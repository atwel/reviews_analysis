customer review from the amazon vine(tm) program what's this set in the 1930's during the depression the book opens with a promise of an interesting story thea atwell a fairly wealthy girl from florida is driving with her father to enter the yonahlossee riding camp for girls her father is exiling her to this camp school for wealthy girls for some tragedy thea bestowed on her family her very close knit family consists of her twin brother sam and her parents who live on acres of land they have isolated themselves there is minimal interaction with the outside world apparently it is the mother's choice i believe the mother to be the most interesting character as she seems to vacillate from understanding her daughter to reviling her thea who is not effusive with the other girls at school but she is their equal in terms of materialism she has taken wealth for granted living on a large estate although her father is a physician he also owns acres of florida land providing a steady income despite the depression the family has a relationship although often questionable with the father's brother george and his wife and son sam and thea are true twins they are part of each other disclafani tells us thea's story with a methodical deference to time and place she never errs we always feels it's the 1930's in terms of the depression but there are secrets and tragedies in every family thea's apparent sin which the reader will easily solve becomes a provocative story of scandalous love and family heartbreak i did not find it that astonishing and thea remained a mystery to the reader the author did not take us inside thea's mind and thea seemed to be more than ready to repeat the same mistake at yonahlossee what i did admire was thea's equestrian expertise her knowledge of horses and her innate ability to bond with a horse she was at the right place at this school where the horses became the center for these southern debutantes i was not transported from page to page but i thoroughly enjoyed the passion and rivalry among the girls at the camp when their families lost their money the girls lost themselves too but something was missing thea's burgeoning sexuality was a central theme and her mother's influence was carved out with precision and yet i didn't understand thea and really didn't like her i recommend the book but was somewhat disappointed","5":" ttheodora \"thea\" atwell lived in a world enclosed in a paradise of 1931 - 30 acres of florida woodlands upon which to ride sasi her beloved pony a house that is \"majestic \" and a twin brother who is her best and largely only friend outside of her parents and brother the only people she sees for weeks a time is the family of her paternal uncle george his wife carrie and their son georgie the senior of the twins by two years the reader meets thea as she is being delivered from her cherished home to the yonahlossee riding camp for girls a boarding school riding camp deep in the north carolina mountains the reasons for this decampment are made to be mysterious from the moment we meet thea the mystery of why she was banished from home is slowly revealed as she spends the next year among the daughters of the elite and the horses that define the camp tthis novel is narrated from the first person point of view of thea when she arrives at yonahlossee she is a typical16 year old female of her culture - shy pretty entitled and expected to be nothing beyond this and someday to be a good wife and mother as she adapts to life at the school she keeps the other students at a distance as she will \"only be there for the summer \" when she learns that her stay has always been intended to be long term she begins to reflect upon the events that ended with her being exiled to a land unknown among people who are strangers she comes to see that the path leading to her being separated from her family began by the choices she made without regard for their consequences those choices in themselves were risky but the response to them caused the cataclysmic chain of events whose shockwaves crash over everyone it seems who populate thea's world and change that world forever tthe story is set during the great depression when the lines between those with \"means\" and the increasing number of those who have nothing was clear but due to the failing banks the population of the former was dwindling daily such uncertainty caused the tension everyone experienced to be elevated \"family\" was important but they did not always survive intact \"expectations\" may have been lofty and \"set in stone \" but their fulfillment relied upon a cultural system that was outdated and prejudicial it was a time very similar to the present in thea's desire need for connection and place she learns the deep painful truth of \"disappointing yourself is the worst thing that can happen to you \" p 271 in the redemption she is offered she tastes the sweetness of mercy found in self sacrifice both the disappointment and the mercy are shown to carry a huge cost as some bridges once crossed cease to exist there is some violence one graphic fight and many sexually charged scenes in this book the author hails from northern florida received her undergraduate degree from emory but her writing lacks the southern \"flavor\" i expected of a writer with such a background it is a bit of the \"new southern gothic\" that seems to be arising showing how the \"old south\" is giving way to a more modern disconnected uncertain identity that gives pleasant memories to the past but has little relationship to those grand ideals it is a book with a quick pace would probably appeal to a more feminine readership and would make an excellent public television mini series it appears this is ms disclafani's first novel this speaks well of a bright future","6":"a nicely written book that reflects the struggles women face as they grow up and form their own identity and view of the world regardless of time and place women all face such challenges","7":"a compelling story of a girl expelled from her family's isolated and privileged lifestyle in central florida to attend a boarding school in the appalachian mountains at the start of the depression told in flashback interwoven with the present the story is oddly uplifting and empowering of girls especially against the backdrop of a time when girls even more than they are now weren't worth as much as boys","8":"the main character thea is extremely unlikable and selfish yet there is something about this book that made it great it isn't my favorite style of book overly descriptive but it works it is just extremely well written","9":"beautifully written loved this book","10":" i wouldn't call this a ya novel since there are some explicit scenes that would have been absolutely scandalous in 1930 it's clear from the start our main character is a thinker beyond her 15 16 years which is quite refreshing the book is full of nostalgia coming of ageness and just enough horsieness to keep a horse person like myself interested i wouldn't define it as historical although the perspective does come from a person coming of age in the great depression but her family has money the reader is strung along just long enough to discover the very bad thing that our main character did to get sent away to boarding school for equestriennes she's quite introspective within herself which was appreciated also not a common characteristic of today's 15 yr old girls of course she goes from wildly outrageous thoughts to more realistic thoughts with her internal drama typical teen i would have liked to see more followup on the years after the adult years as long as there are enough horses for the sequel i'm in","11":"i enjoyed this book 3 1 2 stars there is enough controversy that it was interesting to discuss with others i think this would make a good book club book","12":"i was immediately sucked into this book i like the voice 16 yo girl and i like the time period depression era and was intrigued by the premise sent away from home for a mysterious bad deed and she's sent to a camp in wnc fantastic i'm in but somewhere near the middle of the book it just got icky you saw the bad choices coming and then you saw her make them and you just felt sad about it well written definitely well written but not a pick me up by any means jesse","13":"couldn't even finish this thea was so whiney throughout and i still don't understand some of her motivations","14":" the year is 1930 and thea theodora atwell falls in lust love with her cousin george two years her senior thea's twin sam discovers their affair and fights george leaving him maimed thea is then sent to an obscure but elitist riding camp boarding school in north carolina by her wealthy florida parents in shame there she discovers the competitions between the girls for friendship social status and of course riding oddly or not thea again falls in love lust for the handsome headmaster henry holmes and he for her despite his having a wife and three children the story is revealed beautifully and is very sensual and arousing thea was ahead of her time","15":"finally finished this book on vacation and i'm very glad to be done with it nothing very compelling about it other than it being set in nc","16":"i truly enjoyed this book the author's writing style sucked me right in i can't wait to read more of her work in the future thea's character was refreshing and engaging her musings on the world around her as well as her interactions with its denizens were deeply satisfying i adored her voice i wasn't entirely satisfied with the story's ending i wanted more nonetheless from start to finish this book was amazing i would recommend it in a heartbeat","17":"from the beginning this book really kept me reading there's this whole mystery about what exactly thea atwell had done to be sent to the yonalossee riding camp for girls you get snippets about what exactly happened throughout the book but you don't get the whole story until your nearing the end of the book it left me torn about whether i should see thea as a headstrong girl going after the things she wants or as a girl made victim by her own desires here's a small youtube review i did on the book http youtu be mw3elc8vtmq","18":"i enjoyed this book i would love to see orlando in the 1930's but i could definitely see north carolina the way it was described my one criticism is that thea wasn't a realistic 15 16 year old i kept forgetting her age and she was 18 or older","19":"this book was not at all what i expected not at all it's super sexy and a bit taboo the main character thea is such an interesting character she's not at all in tune with the world having been kept apart from it for a long time she grew up with her twin brother and her cousin this book takes place in the depression thea's family isn't hit by the depression but others around her are an make an interesting backdrop for the plot in this book thea's been sent to a camp really a school for a reason you aren't made aware of until much further along i was annoyed at first that i didn't know why she had been sent to camp but then i was determined to figure it out it's a bit of a character study is thea naive is she a sociopath she realizes that she's a girl who gets what she wants and she's an observer more than a participant interesting great book for discussion on another note i loved the horseback riding in this book it made me want to get back into it it's a weird one not sure who i'd recommend it to but i ended up liking it","20":"beautiful i give it a 4 5 i don't want to give anything away but i really don't understand why thea was blamed and not her brother the times i guess","21":"i was thinking i would give this book one star but i've decided on two for some reason this book was terrible a waste of money ugh and i seriously wouldn't recommend it to anyone it was a painful read to get through but just because i spent money on it and because it was a book club book i felt obligated to finish it do not read","22":"good one insight into 1930 rich usa south family life","23":"read this book gorgeous lush writing and the author keeps her foot on the story's accelerator so it moves quickly it's romance and sex and adolescence and depression era 1930's north carolina and family and friends and love and disappointment and the best of literary fiction blown away","24":"i loved the writing of this novel but had a heard time relating to the main character in fact i'm not sure any of the characters were developed enough i loved so many parts of this novel but as a whole it wasn't one of my favorites","25":"though set in 1930 little about anton disclafini's the yonahlossee riding camp for girls felt like a period piece except for an occasional mention of the great depression i didn't find the main character thea atwell all that likeable so it was difficult to relate or identify with her i did found it interesting how weak all her male characters were portrayed i think the greatest disappointment was the conclusion i wanted it to end with a bang but it merely fizzled out","26":"this is definitely not what i was expecting to read i had heard a lot about this book but i never expected it to resolve the way it did incest attempted murder sex...definitely not a book that i want to read again nevertheless it was well written and i wanted to finish it if only to find out what happened","27":"i was very excited to read this book because it is set in western north carolina where i live i love reading anything that involves familiar landscapes i also loved the way that the real world kind of crept into the bubble that was the camp and the way in which the secret behind thea's banishment revealed itself i was not expecting how sexy this book was but it was all very tasteful and in keeping with the time period and general tone of the book a great read and i highly recommend it","28":"while this is not the usual book i read i did devour this in a weekend it kept me interested and there was some interesting character development and maturing for the main character that you were able to see happening over the course of the novel this is not for the young adult or naive reader there are some pretty explicit sexual scenes involving older men and family members which i was not aware of before reading but it didn't bother me because the book is still very well written","29":"it is in the writing style of then then then very little substance one scene after another","30":"i'm going to quote another reader's review because i identify with what she said she wrote a complicated imperfect totally screwed up character who still manages at times to be loving brave and kind thea is very much a product of her circumstances and looking back i think she does the best she can with what she has most importantly she survives and she learns to accept herself for who she is sure she makes some terrible choices but haven't we all i think that's why i resented her so much at times she evokes many of the things i dislike and fear about myself but this makes thea an honest if flawed character and that's something i can appreciate set in the depression era i was initially drawn to this book because of course horses were involved i love the relationship between girls and their horses and how that stays with them throughout their lives i had mixed emotions about thea and her behavior but i still cared about her and though others were disappointed with the ending i wasn't it seemed meant to be this one will stay with me a while","31":"ok best for a beach read","32":" this was a great book i really was intrigued and could not put it down i liked reading about this time in history during the beginning of the great depression and how the wealthy lived they basically send their daughters to a place to learn to ride horses and study although they rarely studied much because in the long run all that was important was getting married such a sad way to think how woman before us were raised thea the main character was hard to love or hate she did something that tarnished her family and was sent away to camp however not sure this camp helped or hurt her there was very little talking in her family but i am sure that was the nature of this time in history i enjoyed the story of what sent thea to yonahlossee and what brought her back home","33":"this book is beautiful and atmospheric i absolutely loved it in 1931 15 year old thea is sent away from her isolated home in florida to a riding camp in north carolina all we know in the beginning is that thea was send away due in the midst of a family scandal thea grows to love yoahlossee and the independence it gives her away from her family for the first time she is able to re evaluate her relationships and discover who she is as a person thea is also able to explore her sexuality and come to terms with her impending womanhood the book is told through thea's perspective and she is an amazing narrator i can imagine her at 97 telling us her story from a settee in her tastefully decorated living room this book was a joy to read i will definitely be looking for future works from disclafani","34":" thea was such an interesting character and i enjoyed seeing her emerge as a person i liked that she was so flawed and that she recovered from the tumultuous teenage years she experienced i am not sure about the mother character i have a hard time believing she was alone with her kids secluded from the world supposedly fast in her youth and yet completely oblivious and out of touch with her kids i had a hard time seeing the closeness of the twins although it was referred to quite a bit although inappropriate for the relationships the sex scenes were well written i enjoyed the riding scenes and loved the connection thea had with her horses","35":" thea is a 15 year old girl from a middle class family in the 1920's she has a twin brother we meet her as she is arriving at the yonahlossee riding taken there by her father something has happened at home that has made her parents send her away to school the story follows the trials and tribulations of her time at the school gradually throughout the book you are let in to the reasons for her being there when i was first given this book i wasn't sure if it was teen fiction or for adults it was easy to read and enjoyable but when i finished still was unsure of the audience it was intended both would enjoy i am sure","36":"really enjoyed","37":"i really liked this coming of age story about a 15 year old girl growing up in the depression 1930s her mother has chosen raise her and her twin brother mostly isolated in a setting described as idyllic on a florida orange plantation she is sent away to the yonahlossee riding camp for girls after a horrible incident involving her brother and cousin although the reader does not find out exactly what happens until 3 4 of the way through the book during her time at yonahlossee she learns a lot about herself while still making some bad choices all part of growing up","38":"this was a slow slow read half way thru i started thinking every now and then when is something going to happen i wasn't crazy about the main character thea there are several interesting discussion points for book clubs however expectations for women in the 1930's the depression thea's relationships with her family horses","39":"entertaining but a bit predictable i especially enjoyed learning about the time period through the perspective of a young woman","40":"i had never heard of this book i saw it on the sale table at barnes and noble the cover caught my eye for 6 24$ i got my money's worth i loved this story i loved the strength of thea i enjoyed the historical aspects not overly done i was moved by certain aspects of the writing that drew me in and touched my memories as that girl first loves independence separation of self from family or friends the end of life as you know it","41":" thea is sent to a riding camp for girls in the appalachians after a tragedy occurs in her floridian family for which she bears some responsibility the reader gets hints of the event as the book unfolds thea who was very sheltered in a remote part of florida learns to interact with other girls for first time set during the early 1930s with the backdrop of the depression we see a privileged segment of society enduring various troubles perhaps for the first time in the case of some girls their families run out of money for others their families are dysfunctional thea falls into the latter category i thought the author got into the head of a pubescent girl who encounters burgeoning urges with emotional immaturity","42":"one of the strongest debuts i've read in a long time a character driven coming of age story set in the 1930s raised with a twin brother and a male cousin young teen thea atwell is sent to a boarding school in kentucky where for the first time in her life she's learning to live with other girls her age while enticing all the way through the author takes her time letting you know why thea was sent away from her family without being obvious about it","43":"i loved this beautiful book it was my favourite novel of 2013","44":"not at all what i expected i liked it and didn't at the same time thea is an interesting character and well written i guess i just wished some things happened differently","45":" 1930's amidst the great depression a teenage girl is sent to the riding camp after she is exposed in her part of a family scandal it is a coming of age sexual awakening story with some dark twists and turns although i may not agree with most of her decisions i believe that it is a story teaching young girls in any decade to own their decisions and desires and live for themselves not their parents unfortunately thea's poor choices came at a time where it was too easy to shame your family of course maybe the current teenage generation needs to learn what 'owning our decisions' means or perhaps a decision shaming your family would make them think a bit more about their actions stories i hear about middle high schoolers are just disturbing they are into all kinds of stuff this was one of my faves this summer i did feel there was a bit of prolonged babble and delay in order to draw the story out until the author revealed the initial scandal however i still very much enjoyed the development of the characters and the self examination by thea i found myself emotionally involved in the happening of her life routing for her cringing for her and being completely distraught with her being cast out by first the family and then yonahlossee it was remarkable to watch her find the courage within to accept that which she had done while home in florida and in the secluded mountain top riding camp perhaps this was the beginning of the women of our society learning to step up and take control of their own lives this novel was beautifully written i feel even if the story doesn't follow one's idea of 'entertaining' they can appreciate the high quality of work and see the piece as a beautiful accomplishment as dislafani's debut","46":"i started to read it and i really liked it the mood and atmosphere and writing was quite beautiful it started to get inappropriate so i stopped","47":" this wonderful coming of age novel is set in a 1930s american still in the grip of the depression thea atwell leads a quiet life in florida with her doctor father mother and twin brother sam however events at home lead to thea being banished to north carolina to the exclusive yonahlossee riding camp for girls thea is led to believe it is a summer camp but yonahlossee is a school and thea is about to learn some very important lessons there the locations used in this novel are wonderfully described ad although i'm not a 'horsey' person i really enjoyed reading about the camp and the girls there upon finishing the book i felt exhausted it is a very emotional read as we find out just why thea was sent away to yonahlossee in the first place readers groups are going to love this novel as it can be discussed for hours believe me i have","48":"sad and terrifying many parts resonated but just too sad","49":"where to start too many girls and no real character development to keep them straight writing is very vague in key parts so you aren't sure what the author is implying but the knowledge is pretty key to the plot so it's irritating storyteller jumps around in time to the point where it's not just a plot device it seems to be there just to annoy the reader skip this one","50":"i had read some pretty bad reviews of this book so i wasn't expecting much even though i love horses and the idea of a lush portrait of the south in 1930 i loved the story straight away the setting the plot and the narrators 'voice' it took me a little time to get established with the characters but for me it's always that way i loved this book and recommend it to anyone who would enjoy a sexy southern story","51":"i really liked this book the characters were developed and believable i cared about thea and wanted her to make better decisions but understood why she was tragically flawed i would recommend this book","52":"a decent read and a great story set during the beginning of the great depression one of my favorite genres it probably went on about 50 pages too long but i would still recommend it","53":"the book was good the story was slow at first and then picked up speed about 3 4 through the book it would have been a better story to show more comparison between the mother and daughter","54":"another great read that was hard to put down reader's won't be disappointed it is set during the great depression and is a fine character study examination of the have's and have nots of that period this is the 8th great book in a row i've happened upon definitely on a roll if i could just get myself on the treadmill at the same time","55":"in this story set during the great depression thea's narration alternates between the past and present as she slowly reveals why she ended up at yonahlossee she's not very likable and i don't know that her character grows or learns from her experience there's also a bit of a disconnect between the thea throughout the book and the thea at the end reflecting back on her life","56":"a well written book but the love story not going to say who was a bit too weird for me i finished it but can't say it was particularly notable","57":"this book seemed really beautiful in it's writing until just a little after the half way point then somehow the whole thing soured for me the narrator a 16 year old girl living in the 1930's american south is sensitive and a dangerous combination of careless and fearless the repeated sentiment of but i was just a girl what could i do becomes kind of sickening by the end i really can't find fault with the writing itself but just ended up with a bad taste in my mouth by the end of the story","58":"wow what a disappointment i can't tell you how many times i was shaking my head wondering how this book received so many good reviews and is on summer reading lists what a snooze fest this isn't writing it's a bunch of inconsequential filler the only thing this book has going for it which is why i picked it up is the title and book cover character development is weak and the author is a tangent queen often starting a paragraph with one thought that she never resolves i hate that there is a secret that is alluded to within the first half of the book that is obvious and once it's revealed i was yawning literally this one goes on my \"mindless\" shelf i wouldn't bother with this one","59":"this a good example for not judging selecting a book by its cover when i received notification that the digital arc of this novel april selection of the first flights penquin debut author program was available nothing about the book appealed to me not the artwork the title or even the author's name but like horton the elephant i honor my commitments and so i downloaded the arc from netgalley i loved the novel from the first page and it turned out to be one of the best books i've read this year","60":"i enjoyed it boarding school and horses but didn't love it a few text inconsistencies bothered me and i found the voice a bit too modern it's slightly irritating that mr holmes view spoiler got away with statutory rape hide spoiler also","61":"excellent summer reading the main character is sent away for a year to the camp part summer riding camp part year round school in the wake of a family scandal separated from her fraternal twin sam for the first time in their lives she has to begin to negotiate her own identity and negotiate a new community of girls","62":" i was very disappointed in this book it is about a girl named thea who had a privileged life with her parents and twin brother in florida she had a pony that she rode every day and her parents were wealthy however when she becomes a teenager she becomes involved with her cousin georgie they start out by kissing and things progress from there all of this is slowly revealed throughout the book while she is at yonahlossee riding camp for girls where she was went by her parents because of what happens with georgie eventually georgie and thea have sex and she instantly regrets what she did with him the next day she is so upset that she starts crying her brother sees that something has upset her and georgie reveals what they did thea is a very inconsistent character at times she is naive and other times she calculates what is going to happen for example when at the riding school she develops a crush on the married headmaster mr holmes and she starts pursuing him while mrs holmes is away for several months there is not much appealing about this novel i could not get past the disgusting fact that she had sex with her cousin who was almost like a brother to her there is not much to do with the horses either one of the parts with the horses is when thea is riding in a jumping competition and she pushes her horse too hard because she wants to win it shows she cares nothing for the horse she is riding and only cares about what she wants i do not recommend reading this book","63":"ugh worst book of 2013 promoted as best book wha so much plot but yet nothing of substance the depression rich family in florida fraternal twin teens girl falls for cousin lots of steamy prose tragic accident angry family she's shipped to horse boarding school she seduces headmaster is callous of everyone her family is equally absent of emotion lots a flat boring dialogue cousin love really finished it in hopes it would be worth it in the end nope","64":"it is difficult to review this book without spoiling it there are several captivating themes about women coming of age in the 1930s and gender attitudes and expectations around sex morals and our place in the greater social structure the book also addresses the nature of family and its dysfunctions the characters were not always sympathetic but were intriguing enough to make me want to keep listening i had the audio version there is a slow plot reveal the reader knows something went wrong but not quite what went wrong until close to the end of the book and i think the author finally got me to begin to understand the relationship between humans and horses which i must confess i never quite got in all those sappy horse stories out there btw this is not a sappy horse story there is a lot going on in this novel and i found it to be quite interesting and thought provoking","65":"i thought it started strong but then became about teenage romance and melodrama could have been much better","66":" thea atwell is a teenager from a wealthy family and is sent away to a camp because of an incident involving a boy it is the 1930s and the depression is just starting to have an effect on the country the author explains the incident through flashbacks which i know is a common thing authors do but i got impatient with the whole trick in this book maybe mostly because there wasn't too much else happening in the beginning of the book i was feeling the need for some drama but then the second half of the book was really filled with drama alot of it sexual and in this case descriptions of an affair between 16 year old thea and a 31 year old man just left me feeling icky","67":"the story itself was interesting but i didn't appreciate some of the choices the main character ended up making thought there was more to her","68":"set in the 1930's a young girl is sent to boarding school as a result of a tragic event this all unfolds through the book the story is her experience being away from home and coming of age during her time at school the book began with hope with excitement and it ended quite a bit sad","69":"although i can say i didn't like thea her life family and place of action were compelling i picked this up thinking it might be something for my 13 year old granddaughter might enjoy i found it too sexually explicit to buy or recommend it to her older teens would possibly find this a cautionary tale","70":"this is easily one of the best books of the year so far i picked it up at the airport on my way back to detroit not really knowing what to expect the cover was intriguing a young woman smoking and it was set in a boarding school with horses and about family secrets i mean really how could i resist but i had no idea what i was in for i raced through this book in fact i finished it on the plane it was that good this is a rich story about a young woman who is in search of herself understanding her sexuality and her independent streak in the '20s no less she is sent by her family to a 'riding camp' that masquerades as a boarding school for troubled young girls all of the characters were extremely well written even the ones that appear infrequently an unforgettable story about growing up realizing who you really are and who your family really is","71":"i really wanted to like this book the setting was wonderful and it was well written but for most of the story i found myself not liking the main character thea at all she played a major role in the tragedy that forever changed her life and the lives of her family members her choices afterwards made her unlikable to me in the end she was somewhat redeemed at the very least she grew up and finally settled in to who she was although it was well written at times the story was very slow which one reason why i'm only giving it two stars","72":"actually did not finish this book started out ok then went downhill","73":"i was really conflicted about this book i loved the writing style and way the story and characters developed but i felt like there were some odd plot twists and aspects to the story that were off putting i am looking forward to discussing it with my book club to see how others responded to it","74":"i can't decide how i feel about this book the story line during the depression thea age 15 and one of a pair of twins in a wealthy florida family has done something really bad and so has been sent off to a boarding school which includes horseback riding in the north carolina mountains two story lines emerge one focuses on what she did that got her sent there and the other on her experience at the school where she behaves in similar manner the good things about the book the writing is beautiful lush descriptive the thea character is introspective enough to weigh what she has done and is doing even though that doesn't make her change her behavior very much the weaknesses slow pacing not much action and moving back and forth between the past bad behavior and the present bad behavior is sometimes confusing there are few pleasant characters in the story so there is no one to root for all that lush description gets you nowhere in terms of advancing the story it gets a 3 because i really wanted to like the book and because i kept reading in spite of my frustration if you like stories about girls and horses set in a beautiful place in the 1930s you might like this better than i did the reviews here seem to be pretty much love it or hate it i'm surprised i felt so neutral","75":"this review has been hidden because it contains spoilers to view it click here pretty decent book for a book group but why does it seem that every decent book for book group includes incest i'm so tired of reading about incest","76":"not good for book club","77":"the author's ability to build a page turning narrative kept me going until the end her obvious knowledge of horseback riding and the historical context of the depression added to a lush storytelling but in the end i was left a little cold it was difficult to empathize or relate to her characters thea the narrator as well as most all of the other characters felt a bit removed","78":"more of a 3 5 stars easy summer read","79":" thea atwell is escorted by her father a very proper but compassionate small town physician to an exclusive equestrian school in the appalachian mountains thea is being exiled by her family for behavior that is very very slowly revealed the story moves from florida to north carolina as thea's life is exposed set during the depression we see how it affects the wealthy and poor alike the politics of the day as well as the people the girls and the horses at the camp are beautifully described as are intricacies of riding competition and social behaviors of the time i would give this book to upper hs girls because of sexual details who are interested in riding or in the historical era","80":"i gave this book 3 stars it's a depression era coming of age story with two somewhat unusual settings a steamy remote florida homestead before air conditioning and a riding camp boarding school for southern girls from wealthy families i wasn't particularly drawn in to the story of thea's sexual development but there was something of a mystery to her situation and the horseback riding portions of the story were very well done","81":"well i liked this book but i expected much more from the story line and didn't get it it was well written but ultimately left me with that so what feeling","82":"i enjoyed the descriptions of the areas where the book took place as the author compared the flat lands of florida to the mountains of north carolina my issue was that i could not warm up to the heroine and her choices especially as regards her married teacher","83":"this book started out strong but faltered toward the end all the characters were rather dysfunctional it was an interesting and sensual but not necessarily satisfying read","84":"wow this was a racy one always interesting how family members interact","85":"eh i wanted this book to be so much more than it was i kept reading because i'm a horse person and the beginning drew me in but it got insufferable part way through you can tell where the story is going so the allure quickly leaves and the writing style is that of someone who desperately wants to sound intellectual but isn't think about your high school english class essays yeah that that being said it's an easy summer read and was fine for easy reading sitting out the sun","86":"the plot became predictable halfway through and i struggled to maintain compassion for the main character","87":"this was a coming of age book set in the depression the protagonist finds herself at this camp for wealthy girls a clever story that successfully depicts such a particular place and time i liked this book","88":"very beautifully written i loved how the author was able to go from present scenes to past memories with such ease of flow at certain times however i would have liked to jump in the book and shake the main character thea from making certain choices","89":"the writing in this book is great but some of the plot seems a little unrealisitic","90":"i received this book from goodreads i wanted to read it mainly because i lived in the north carolina setting for a few years i enjoyed the book overall it explored a taboo subject in a thoughtful manner thea's regret and guilt over her actions haunted her for the rest of her life","91":"good book club pick finally","92":"wow this book gave me chills loved it one of the best i have read","93":"i couldn't finish this book call me weird but the sex life of a 16 year old doesn't do it for me especially disturbing since the sex partner is literally twice the age of the narrator too bad the writing and plot minus the excessive number of masturbation and sex scenes were excellent definitely would have been a five star book otherwise a waste of talent","94":"beautifully written yet totally surprising story a coming of age story that is so shocking yet also so real it creates almost an uncomfortable guilt to read anton disclafani captures the forbidden longing that is adolescence wanting so much to do adult things while still a child","95":"i loved it the atmosphere is really rich and transported and absorbed me i really liked the tone of being wrapped up in the dramas of her life while being periodically reminded of economic depression unfolding around her it's plot is gripping and is also quite sexy fun summer read that i expect with stick with me","96":"i really enjoyed reading about thea and the challenges of being 15 16 in the 1930's i felt the author gave a true voice to the combination of innocence and sexuality of that age it also showed how the depression affected the population and how different personalities adapt or don't to a variety of life events thea has a twin brother sam and a cousin frankie that she is very close to she lives in florida on a secluded ranch","97":"i was really excited about reading this book after so many rave reviews unfortunately i was so disappointed the story moved at a snail's pace and i just did not care about what was happening to anyone in the story especially thea i was bored by the parts about horses and skimmed through those i should have quit 100 pages through it but i wanted to find out what thea had done to be shipped off to the yonahlossee riding camp for girls","98":"there was a lot to like in this book good complex characters lovely descriptive passages and settings well drawn relationships of a girl coming of age a particular obsession of mine of late and yet... it was overly repetitive to me i felt like i kept getting the same realizations over and over just with a slightly different setting and because of it i would lose interest still worth a read especially if you like horses or coming of age stories","99":"recommended in oprah mag but it was a book that made me uncomfortable for the main teen character the lush setting couldn't fix this book","100":" i thought this book had good potential when i started it depression era coming of age family scandal fraternal twins lots of interesting elements but it was a let down the enigma of the twins relationship that was served up at the start came to no conclusion and i didn't care about either of them the same can be said of the mother and i cared even less about the other characters the sexy stuff twisted and dysfunctional a whole bunch of unlikeable characters that i didn't care about","101":" i really wanted to like this book the premise was intriguing lonely thea is sent to remote equestrian school because of some transgression her back story is revealed with agonizing slowness the author crosses the fine line between building suspense and torturing the reader meanwhile life at camp is described in vivid detail with characters that come alive the author writes convincingly about horses and horsemanship the plot takes an unfortunate turn as thea develops an improbable relationship parental warning there are some steamy scenes","102":"fairly disappointing i liked the narrator and the setting at camp however it spends most of the book hinting at the thing that happened something happened and thea was sent away something happened some thing happened it is a lot if buildup and hinting and takes forever to get to then when we finally learn what happened it's just ok so that's what happened the end","103":"loved this book","104":"so so i liked the idea of the book but it wasn't well executed parts were too predictable and other parts were just boring","105":"i have not read a book in a long time that i loved as much as this one","106":"this book was fantastic exceptional writing a little bit of mystery a little coming of age a lot of forbidden desire i found the boringness of wealthy breeding alongside thea's scandalous behavior for the 1930s riveting","107":"i'm not certain what i expected from this book an all girls horse riding boarding school in the great depression it's quite grim thea has committed an egregious social error and it has had some very negative ramifications in her family spoilers in short she slept with her cousin georgie and then her brother sam accidentally probably although no one least of all him is sure severely injured georgie so thea is shipped with her shame up to boarding school where she begins another illicit affair poor thea it's not a romance novel i didn't find it sexy at all i thought thea had no one to confide in or talk to so her sexual awakening is the exact opposite of her peers","108":" i was nervous starting this book after i read some of the goodreads reviews and much as i expected this was a beautifully written novel not just about the coming of age of a character but of the country being set during the great depression spoiler the great depression wasn't the happiest time in america thea struggled with teenage love and angst in a world very ordered by garden clubs and using the proper fork her choices and the consequences those choices wrought lens themselves to a fantastically written book about growing up if you didn't grow up in the south worrying about which fork to use at a country club supper you might not understand the nuances that make this book superb","109":"this review has been hidden because it contains spoilers to view it click here i really liked this one even though it was not at all what i was expecting for example i was not expecting any incest or student teacher relationships but hey here we are regardless as soon as i finished it i kind of wanted to read it again i think what i liked best was how things didn't get better with her family it was depressing but realistic given all the shit that went down","110":"i was taken in completely","111":"i have to say i wanted this to be better than it was think if prep was in a girls boarding school finishing school in the south during the depression also just girlier","112":" loved it beautifully written wonderfully evoked the world of the north carolina boarding school and the protagonist's beloved florida home distinctly and vividly not a completely sympathetic heroine but i liked her all the more for her flaws some reviewers complain about plot pace being too slow i found it mesmerizing and although it was easy to guess what the tragic family secret was that propelled the plot it was an engrossing read nevertheless if you enjoy coming of age novels featuring a strong willed and complex female protagonist you'll definitely enjoy","113":" this was an ok story i would probably rate it 3 1 2 stars not a full 4 it is definitely a quick read that keeps you captivated however the terrible event that the entire book centers around is alluded to for longer than necessary i believe it would have been better perhaps to have come out with it a little bit earlier so that then we could really understand even more the journey of the characters however it is shocking and fun and sad and depraved and even hopeful at times it's basically a fun read but nothing extraordinary","114":" could have even been two stars rather than three soooo disappointed in this book i was really liking it at first not really knowing where it was going then i realized that the whole thing was focused on the lust of this 15 year old and it just grew tiresome it's not that i minded the sexual description or was offended by it it actually became a little boring in its detail the book was well written but i thought it was going to be and wanted it to be something else six word review horny equestrian teen banished for misdeeds","115":"3 5 enjoyable quick read especially at a time in the semester when i don't want anything complicated it's sort of a beach read in that way but probably too dark for that classification","116":"this book was an interesting read and i enjoyed the beautiful writing at times but i didn't finish it with the thought that i liked reading it overall i found thea's family to be a strange unlikable set of characters and the revelation of thea's shame to be a let down since i had figured it out early on the slow reveal just felt overly dramatic and unnecessarily distasteful in the telling i did enjoy the parts of the book that focused on what thea learned about herself at the camp her love of riding her friendship with sissy her awareness of the wider world in the end it just felt like a cliche overly sexual coming of age story that had a depressing ending","117":"in the midst of the great depression wealthy southern families still sent their daughters to north carolina's yonahlossee riding camp for girls which was not so much a camp as a finishing school designed to create proper southern ladies who would be able to find the right sorts of husbands into this environment comes passionate headstrong thea atwell a 15 year old from florida who has spent her life isolated with her parents and twin brother in their comfortable home surrounded by orange groves she's been thrown out of the house for some horrible act she's committed but the reader doesn't know what that is until well into the book this keeps the momentum building in an otherwise dreamy story told in first person it weaves seamlessly back and forth between the actions unfolding at the camp and thea's previous life at home in florida it's a beautiful coming of age tale as thea learns painful lessons about family sex friendship money and social class all set against the picturesque backdrop of the blue ridge mountains i loved distefani's detailed descriptions of the riding camp it brought me back to my own first anxious days at summer camp getting to know my cabinmates figuring out who to be friends with who to avoid this is a wonderful read note i received an advance proof of this book from penguin its publication date is june 2013","118":"amazing riveting though provoking and entertaining a page turner","119":"a young girl gets sent away to a riding school after a scandal in her family book doesn't reveal the scandal until late into the book keeps you in suspense","120":"an interesting story but certainly not what i expected thea was at times very hard for me to like as a narrator and person and i frequently wanted to yell at her","121":"loved the way thea's story unfolds throughout the story from the beginning you have an idea of what happened but slowly the pieces come together","122":"possibly the worst book i've read this year one of those where you get mad at yourself for getting sucked into reading it in the first place so trashy think judy blume forever from your adolescence i'm not sure what list i got this off of but it will be worth my time to go back and research so i can cross off everything else on the list the intimate scenes are laughable enough said i would give it zero stars if i could","123":"i enjoyed the parts about daily life at yonahlossee but the drama was not very believable and therefore rather boring for me","124":"i won this book as part of a library reading program and knew almost nothing about it other than a vague recollection that it was written about favorably it took me no time at all to be hooked by the narrative technique of weaving in past events to the present and telling a seemingly simple story in a complex way i was curious what others thought about the book esp since there are taboo topics and was surprised to read the reviewers of so many haters yes the main character's actions are less than exemplary but the book has excellent character study and great description throughout a first novel can't wait to see what she does next","125":"amazing first novel a little difficult to follow the time jumps between some chapters but a tightly woven story","126":"predictable story and plot should have stopped reading and gone on to another","127":"i'm still not sure how i feel about this book complicated it was an interesting read and i wasn't sure where it was going even now i'm not sure if i liked the ending but i'm glad i read it","128":" thea the heroine slowly unravels her shocking tale amid a parade of wealthy naive girls at a girls' school in the mountains their petty gossip problems and concerns seem silly even thea's larger betrayal compared to the great depression some reviewers said that thea was annoying and whiny but i found her daring and complicated she makes mistakes that don't get nicely resolved which i find refreshing i say read it it's a sad story but a positive one about how a life can stand to be ruined a couple of times that people have room to screw it all up the lesson is that when we do botch it all we have to move on rather than trying to make everything as it was","129":"i completely immersed myself in this book over labor day weekend it is a wonderfully well written first novel for anton disclafani the story line is suspenseful at times heartbreaking at others but you find yourself pulling for the main character and all of the girls that are attending this boarding school riding camp throughout the story cannot wait to see what future books from this talented author are like","130":"i loved the first two thirds of this book the writing is beautiful and thea the main character is so compelling later in the book though i was disappointed by how thea's strength with the potential to be so much more ended up just one dimensional and sexual the adults in the book are also exceedingly disappointing","131":"this book was poorly written uninspired and criminally overrated it's unfortunate because the two settings the florida orange farm and yonahlossee held such potential and were wasted in disclafani's hands i think this book was about a girl finding herself but the characters were so vaguely drawn that i had a hard time investing in them also as if one sexual awakening scandal wasn't enough this book had two neither of which taught the heroine anything besides how to run away as fast as she could the book ended with a sentiment from thea saying along the lines of i'm a woman who always gets what she wants that is interesting the author should have started there also this book was set in the 1930s yet i did not get the impression that discalfani did much research into this era which is why the characters the plots and settings felt so flat","132":" i really enjoyed this book its based during the depression about a well to do family living in florida the children of the family are twins a girl and a boy when the twins are 15 their first cousin who is a few years older comes to visit and starts a sexual relationship with the female twin eventually the male twin finds out about the affair and beats the crap out of the cousin almost killing him of course the whole thing is blamed on the female twin and she is sent away while the male twin stays home she is sent to a horse riding camp for girls to learn to become a proper lady she is there for a year and lots of things happen at the camp that i won't get into the book really illustrates how women were treated as second class humans during the depression era that men knew best and anything that went wrong was the women's fault i recommend this book as long as you don't mind some kinky sexual situations descriptions","133":"i didn't love this book but i liked it enough about 100 pages too long","134":"i loved it this book was cathartic i feel like i healed while reading it","135":"meh didn't even finish it great subject material but there wasn't any substance in the book","136":"hum it made me keep reading i liked reading about the beautiful place and people i liked the historical setting but i am not sure i ever liked the main character she was just too selfish and about getting what she wanted which she did all of it but not without consequences","137":"thea is sent to yohlonsee riding school for girls for a tragic mistake that isn't revealed until near the end of the book she learns to live without her father mother and adored twin brother thea learns she is stronger than she thought but can she manage this life without all she holds dear","138":"i liked it a lot a lot more than i expected to mysterious and sexy without being overdone","139":"definitely one i had to restrain myself from flipping ahead she does a nice job with the storyline","140":"just finished heartbreaking and beautiful and sexy and raw read it","141":"truly exquisite i need another half star to add to this review maybe it was simply my own personal connection to the north carolina mountains or my love of anything to do with the old monied south but i simply could not put this book down what a brutal gripping poignant coming of age story","142":"haunting such a good coming of age story i'm still thinking about it","143":"this review has been hidden because it contains spoilers to view it click here spoilers i loved the book at first well written initially captivated by the main character but it's not sexy or evocative turns out it's just about a sheltered u0026amp impetuous 16 year old thea atwell that has sex with her first cousin u0026amp later her married with children she is teaching to ride headmaster that's not sexy her choices lead to disaster for her brother u0026amp cousin destroying the dynamics of her own family thankfully her other affair is never revealed or she'd hav spoilers i loved the book at first well written initially captivated by the main character but it's not sexy or evocative turns out it's just about a sheltered u0026amp impetuous 16 year old thea atwell that has sex with her first cousin u0026amp later her married with children she is teaching to ride headmaster that's not sexy her choices lead to disaster for her brother u0026amp cousin destroying the dynamics of her own family thankfully her other affair is never revealed or she'd have left a second family shattered thanks to her selfish sexual desires if not for the end where adult thea summarizes the lessons of her spoiled youth i'd have given even less stars more","144":"i enjoyed this book i might give 3 5 stars just because i thought the end wasn't quite as good as the rest there was a bit of mystery in the backstory that unfolded as the book went along but i also enjoyed the main character's insightful observations about her relationships with others","145":"this is an arc courtesy of the publisher and edelweiss i'm so glad they approved my request because i used to drive past the actual current day yonahlossee with my partner on our way to his house in blowing rock from boone and i'd loudly yodel out the car window yonah losssss eee eee at the tennis players so yeah that's why i'm interested in this book not to mention library journal's inclusion of it in their prepub announcement section edited 3 2 13 to add review despite its campy ha title disclafani's debut is a sultry atmospheric bildungsroman set in the mountains of north carolina thea has been banished to the equestrian school for girls due to an event at home the details of which disclafani withholds in order to ratchet up the narrative tension while at the camp thea comes into her own as she no longer has the isolating social bubble of her family and home in florida disclafani deftly and accurately conveys the awe inspiring beauty of the blowing rock area her depictions of social strata the depression and girls' private lives make this a vivid tale the family dynamics are interesting and devastating all at the same time i think this will be a hit with book clubs and fans of historical fiction","146":"a mysterious book surrounding the main character's departure to an exclusive boarding school the mystery is tragic and takes some time to find out in parts this book can be a bit cumbersome of a read as the supporting characters all have a 2d quality","147":"set in the depression era of the 30's and after a partly self inflicted family crisis thea is sent away to boarding school where horses figure prominently i love fiction where horses gallop through the pages aka black beauty but the horses in this steamy story reveals to thea what it means to be human fickle","148":" i really didn't think this book lived up to the first sentence of the description it seemed there was little about the rituals of girls' school in the 1930s and more about a girl who didn't care to make friends or participate in the rituals because she was too self absorbed and guided by her desires thea was pretty unappealing but i gave this book three stars because the writing was excellent it was as if the author was writing a portrait of a person who really existed and had no choice but to portray her in as generous a light as possible i agree with another reviewer who felt that thea was a sociopath if this wasn't a work of fiction i could imagine thea hiring the best writer publicist she could to explain her side of the story and why she was so much better than everyone else","149":"i won an arc of this delicious book through a goodreads giveaway from the first chapter i was drawn into this wonderful story the author evokes so many sounds smells and feelings through her writing that you feel like you are part of the story i found myself thinking about thea even when i wasn't reading the book it is a thought provoking book that moves slowly giving you time to savor every detail and the scandal is revealed in small bits through flashbacks and reflection i adored this book and highly recommend it","150":"an easy summer read but disturbing","151":"a bizarrely perfect blend of innocence and sexual awakening","152":"set during the depression the story is about a teenage girl thea who is sent away to an exclusive all girls boarding camp school because she has done something to create an irreparable breach in her family this story is a slow read it places you in the deep south you will be pulling for thea the entire novel even if you may not agree with the things she does i would use the word lush to describe how it feels to savor this slow read this is definitely a book you will need to read when you have time to enjoy","153":"i loved this book could hardly put it down","154":"this book is wayyyy more graphic than i anticipated thea is a bit of a fast girl which i did not expect nor does she seem particularly bothered by her own promiscuity it made me very uncomfortable especially one relationship with an older man she did not do any growing up that i could ascertain so this novel is not bildungsroman i enjoyed it only because of the descriptions of north carolina my home state","155":"i listened to this as an audiobook from audible i didn't really know what to expect all i knew was the title sounded interesting and i liked the colors on the cover grey and gold are a surprisingly nice mix i'm very superficial like that i choose books by their covers usually i regret it not this time the yonahlossee riding camp for girls was so delicious the first surprise was it was based between the only two states i've ever lived in florida and north carolina i've lived in central florida my whole life except for half a year spent in central north carolina the main character in the yonahlossee riding camp for girls thea lives in depression era central florida in a small rural town i loved the descriptions of rural florida i just love books set in my home state from descriptions of the crisp winter mornings to the oppressing heat of summer sunsets and orange groves mosquitoes and snakes i love it all anyways this book had everything family secrets forbidden love and passion all girls schools lots of drama when the book begins we know something has happened that thea has done something to get her sent away to a boarding school in north carolina the reader isn't sure quite what thea did until after the middle of the book though the event is alluded to on several occasions the reader can pretty much guess what thea did but not the details or the extent to which thea's crime affected her family i really enjoyed this book and i'm giving it 4 out of 5 stars the book babe","156":"this book was so interesting and down right hard to put down i'm not usually one to read adult novels sticking mostly to the young adult genre but this book was fantastic","157":"i found the main character unlikable i feel like there was supposed to be some deeper moral probably something about family but i could not figure out what it was","158":"thea atwell is 15 confused and has been cast away from her family as punishment for a transgression that has torn her family apart she is sent to a school in the blue ridge mountains to atone for her actions and to get her away from the people she has hurt","159":"reading blurbs about the book made me really want to read it so when i found this book at the school library i was excited i'm not usually into horsey books i quit the girl scouts because all they wanted to do was read horse books but the overall premise was a strong one i like the braided essay style this novel is written in it reminds me a bit of gail godwin's flora in terms of the isolated innocent woman who wants too much","160":" it's interesting how much a reader's opinion of a book is colored by their expectation after seeing a smattering of low ratings when i added this to my 'currently reading' list i set the bar low for this story surprisingly i ended up really enjoying this read and at the start there wasn't much to recommend the author kept obtusely alluding to the scandal that sent our protagonist to camp although it was quickly very obvious what had happened the protagonist herself seemed like an unreliable narrator as there was no concrete sense of time passing all this lent to a weirdly dreamy quality to the novel at some point though as i accepted that this was a slice of life story about a hormonal moody lonely teenager then the story became more lovely to read this was helped by the beautiful flowing prose there were entire paragraphs that i re read aloud this is not to say that i agree with the protagonist's actions or her soundness of judgement but i can accept that this was just part of her nature in addition having grown up in florida myself it was a treat to read about how it was like so many years ago","161":" there are two words to describe this book slow burn i have a very important piece of advice to give readers when it comes to this book clear your schedule not because it's a fast paced heart pounding read but because it's one that needs total attention if you jump back and forth between yonahlossee and real life you'll lose the true beauty of the book which lies heavily in the characters and the subtle changes of self and scene fifteen year old thea atwell has been sent to the yonahlossee riding camp for girls because of a terrible tragedy that struck her family which we learn was her doing thea has led an unusually sheltered life for a girl her age she and her twin brother sam have only ever really known their immediate family living in florida on a citrus farm with their parents they've never had much exposure to other children and society home schooled and content with their nuclear lives the world outside is a mystery the only outside friend they've ever had is their cousin george when thea is sent to yonahlossee she's faced with the heartbreak of being sent away by her family the confusion of living with other girls and the normal hormonal changes that teenagers experience it's a whirlwind of emotions told from the first person narrative there is a maturity to the narration which leads readers to believe a much older thea atwell is looking back upon her years and telling her story the narration jumps back and forth between thea's memories of her childhood leading up to the unraveling of her youth and her experiences at yonahlossee beautifully anton disclafani orchestrates all these situations with a quiet grace and clarity it's not a plot that assaults the senses but one that invites you to sink deeper into understanding the scandal beneath the surface","162":"incest and redemption not","163":"almost didn't finish it the main character narrator wasn't believable or likable to me","164":"this was one of the books of 2013 to read which was widely praised now upfront my typical genre great descriptions of florida during the depression and specifically of the area around orlando long before disney this is a coming of age book from a female's perspective which highlights the importance of morals manners and culture when such things were important maybe a beach read","165":"all through the book i was like what have you done thea it's amazing how this central idea was brought out for the entire part of the book didn't really like thea it's kind of hard to really the story is rather sad and dark and i dislike what happened to thea and sam the book was mostly pretty depressing but felt rather believable","166":"very different a page turner a young girl of the 1930's takes us along on her physical and mental journey of change into a maturing woman it is interesting how she perceives those around her and applies her determination to get what she desires","167":"the narrator sounds at times like a sociopath this kept me interested but in the end neither her voice nor the mystery in which she was involved was enough to make me enjoy the book worth a read for modern insight into social mores of the south during the early depression though","168":" so story line was interesting and characters were interesting i liked those pieces enough for at least three stars but view spoiler um it was pretty graphic in parts and call me a prude but i do not need to read about erect penises and other gross things especially when it's a young girl and her teacher also there were some major rape abuse issues going on with the cousin that were just completely ignored i just felt really uncomfortable and didn't think that the graphic language added anything to the story hide spoiler","169":"a well written novel dealing with mistakes regret and the pain of disappointing your family it was an interesting story but i was not as attached to the characters as i would have expected","170":"this well written historical fiction is set in 1930 as the country enters the great depression fifteen year old thea atwell arrives at the yonahlossee riding camp for girls in late july 1930 banished by her wealthy parents for her scandalous behavior disclafani slowly reveals the traumatic events which have caused thea's parents to deposit her in an isolated area of the north carolina blue ridge mountains far from her florida home at it's core the yonahlossee riding camp for girls is a powerful coming of age story with a unique u0026amp memorable setting","171":"this one started out so good than really started to drag in the end i ended up having to put it aside for a bit and then come back to it in order to make it through","172":"i didn't dislike this book but i don't think it ever hit it's stride i didn't find the characters likeable and it took way too long for anything to happen when it finally did i really didn't care sort of a meh kind of book","173":"very well written this writer really knows how to tell a story the book kept me engaged however the story is fairly grim and unhappy nothing in the way of joy or triumph here and little humor there are no characters in the book that i really liked but they were reasonably complex and believable","174":"so this was highly recommended by a friend i got to page 145 and had to stop because i was sooooo bored the 'secret' is obvious from the start i read on few pages just to be sure yep and it feels stilted and never really gets going there are some great bits but not enough of them disappointing","175":" this is a coming of age book that deals with a young woman who grows up in an isolated and seemingly idyllic region in florida it seems to me that it is not idyllic because the girl and her family live in almost complete isolation with the exception of visits from a few family members and rare trips to town to shop after committing a grievous act the young woman is ostracized from her family and sent to the yonahlossee riding camp as this story came to the end and the girl had become a woman i realized that i found this book to be very sad even though the young woman clearlyhad the strength to make her own choices and lead a life of her choosing","176":"at times i enjoyed this and at other times i was frustrated i think this has a few 'first novel' issues the narration jumps between the present set mainly in the camp and the past where we learn what thea has done that caused her parents to send her away i think it would have benefited for a little tighter editing","177":"it was ok a little weird the writing was good but i thought it was very explicit for the main character being a 16 year old girl not that i am a prude about anything i read but still i don't think that i would read it again","178":"i thought the writing in this book was well done in spots and drawn out in others i enjoyed the historic time period and the specific setting for the plot however the main character and her repeated choices and behaviors became increasingly more unlikeable the more i read so that by the end i didn't really care about what happened to her","179":"this book is not going to be for everyone but i enjoyed it especially after a long run of horrible summer reading i would probably give this more of a 3 5 3 75 star rating if i could","180":"i really struggled to read this and at one point found myself sort of skimming along i found the main character who i think we were meant and should have had compassion for a non likable character it was a dark story which would be fine if it were also somewhat good and it left so many unanswered questions that could have been explored and made the book and the characters more interesting don't waste your time no matter how popular it was","181":"i thought this book was boring i never warmed up to any of the characters i had hoped that the further i read that it would start to become interesting but it never did","182":" thea atwell a young teenage girl from florida is sent by her parents to a girls' riding camp in yonahlossee in north carolina for some transgression that happened with her which is a mystery to the reader the novel takes place during the great depression so the only girls at this camp are girls that come from wealthy families including thea thea does not want to be at this camp but over time she starts to like it the girls and she falls for the head master through the course of the book we are slowly clued in to why thea was sent to this camp i don't want to put any spoilers but i was really disturbed by why she was sent not revealing too much of the secret too soon i thought was good on the writer's part because it made me want to keep reading to figure out what happened i was able to figure it out before it was completely revealed the writing was easy to read and it was a fast read but i only thought that the book was so so i also thought for awhile that this book was written by a man i've never associated anton being a girl's name and i thought that it was very weird that a man was writing about young girls at a riding camp once i figured out that it was actually a woman writing this it made a little more sense to me thea wasn't a hugely likeable character and the story didn't captivate me","183":"lots to recommend it great writing excellent suspense but i found the plot troubling read more http litlunchbox com 2013 07 09 sex","184":"i'm not really sure how i felt about the story though i know i don't care for the main character she seems flat and disengaged except in rare vengeful moments despite the first person narrative","185":"there's a lot of hype surrounding this book and i'm not sure it lives up i was engaged the entire time but i was not a fan of the main character thea i kept reading wanting to like her maybe that was the point","186":"this was a very good book it was like peeling the layers off an onion i liked the ending and would recommend reading it","187":" i like a fast paced plot as much as the next person but i also really enjoy this slow deep immersive experience where you get to know the place and the time and the people and feel like you're living among them i also think this sort of book is much more likely to stick with you after you finish it because you've really experienced it so i did find this book slow moving at times but it was never less than a pleasure to read it was also quite emotionally astute a rare quality that i always appreciate in a novel if you've got a decent attention span this is definitely worth the read","188":"very disappointed in this book certainly did not live up to the reviews quite depressing and not any redemption qualities in the end","189":"it's book reminds me of why i used to read the oprah book club books u0026amp why i quit reading them likable main character but too much drawn out melodrama","190":"i loved this book for so many reasons because i love horses of course but also because i love stories about strong women i couldn't put this one down","191":"this is classic chick lit the only things the women in this book care about are men and horses though it takes place at an all girls boarding school it barely even passes the bechdel test","192":"horses an idyllic mountain setting u0026amp a sexy coming of age story three components that come together rather seamlessly to provide an engaging summer reading experience thea our protagonist is an unusually self assured 16 year old especially for the 1930s u0026amp considering her rather sheltered upbringing the author takes her time revealing the family scandal that resulted in thea's being exiled to the remote riding camp by the time you get the full story you've already guessed most of it thea herself wastes no time making an impression on the girls not to mention the headmaster of yonahlossee","193":"i am not sure if this is vc andrews or literary masterpiece or something in between couldn't put it down but found so many flaws with it that it took away from the enjoyment","194":" i enjoyed this book and it was a fast read a lot of the book mirrored my personal girls boarding school experience at age 16 thea was 15 i too was sent because of a boy although he wasn't my cousin i empathized with her questions about her family's love for her choosing the right girls to be associated with and finding for the first time that some girls come from families with big money the book was set during the time of the great depression and that had an impact on everyone money or not i wonder if someone who did not go away to school college will have the same sense of intimacy with the story that i had","195":" we've all known girls like thea atwell--girls who made mistakes so big they were sent away fast girls precocious girls daring girls thea narrates anton disclafani's debut novel the yonahlossee riding camp for girls an exquisite period piece and a provocative passionate and bold coming of age tale much more than just a precocious teen thea is a magnificently well drawn character a trail blazer wholly modern and a feminist before there was such a thing no one who reads this story will be able to forget thea one of the most memorable characters in fiction today exiled from her family from her florida home and from her beloved horse sasi thea is sent to a school for girls in the blue ridge mountains of north carolina in a voice that is at times worldly and sometimes naive thea reveals \"it was called the yonahlossee riding camp for girls but it was neither a camp nor a place for girls we were supposed to be made ladies here \" her place in the family had once been well defined but now thea is displaced and struggling \"a confused wronged girl\" whose parents punish her for a misdeed by banishing her her twin brother sam who commits a transgression of his own is left unpunished disclafani uses two story arcs one present and one past to tell her story the two narratives are like thea herself--on the cusp of something each story arc leads up to a shuddering climax while thea herself is a character also on the cusp at a crossroads of adulthood womanhood and budding sexuality thea slowly comes to realize it is a man's world whether she is in florida or in north carolina she must obey either her father or the headmaster she must obey their rules and abide by their laws and she is not alone at yonahlossee her new friends must also follow the dictates of their fathers and the depressed economy friends like leona mistress of the showing arena who must leave her horse behind when her father can no longer afford his daughter's tuition they are \"but daughters \" it's no wonder these girls ride horses only in the saddle do they have any semblance of control interestingly thea seems to assume the role that others have assigned her at yonahlossee \"did my parents hope i'd been taught a lesson they thought they'd sent me somewhere safe away from men away from cousins...if my parents had kept me home i might have learned their lesson \" thea though chafes at convention she is a girl who wants too much and who desires desperately a girl who has been introduced to the world of men and finds she likes this world even if she does not always understand it she is fearless an attribute that aids her \"in the horse ring\" but \"badly in life \"at fifteen thea wants to explore who she is and what and where the boundaries are today her rebellion is a rite of passage but it was unusual in 1931 for a girl to behave as risky as thea does in the novel since her parents have expelled her she feels that there is nothing left for her to lose with reckless abandon thea sets her sights on the headmaster mr holmes and what thea wants she usually finds a way to get she knows \"what it was like to want to desire so intensely\" that she is \"willing to throw everything else into its fire \" when disclafani reveals both the shocking act that led to thea's expulsion and the scandalous way in which she leaves yonahlossee you are speechless shaken and consumed with awe disclafani writes \"i wanted everything i wanted my cousin i wanted mr holmes i was a girl i learned who got what she wanted but not without sadness not without cutting a swatch of destruction so wide it consumed my family and almost me i almost fell into it with them i almost lost myself \"tyet it is only because of her intense desire and wildness that thea is able to forge her own path a place in the ring where she rules supreme and where fathers and headmasters are absent neither her parents nor thea expected this surprising turn of events when thea was cast out in the end yonahlossee shows thea her life is hers and no one else's thea must \"lay claim to it \"penetratingly plot driven the yonahlossee riding camp for girls is a literary stunner and will be one of the most talked about novels of the year get a head start and read it now","196":"pretty disappointing after the amount of hype it received for much of the time i felt i was reading a ya novel the main character is hard to like and somewhat hard to sympathize with many secondary characters are two dimensional the book could have bee pruned by about 80 pages still i would investigate other works by this author she's talented just needs a more adult story and better developed characters","197":"i was thrilled when the bookstore i work for got the advanced copy for this in i had a feeling that i would love it and i was right what a beautiful southern literary read disclafani made florida of the 1930s come alive with beauty and ease","198":"maybe it was because this was set during the depression but it didn't grab me and i couldn't stay into it","199":"totally engaging well written interesting characters with some history","200":"more than i expected for a debut novel it carried a serious punch think coming of age novel with for a change a young woman as the main character set in the 1930s i didn't expect and was pleased by the complexity of the main character thea worth your time","201":"i apologize for sticking with short reviews there are plenty of reviews that give a brief or not so brief summary of the book i do not plan to do that i just plan to say how i feel which in short is that this is just another book where young women seeking to find themselves do so through intimate relationships with men blah is there no other way in the world for a woman to find herself and of course it is so scandalous her intimacies it ends the world around her i don't know... just seems so done","202":"definitely a coming of age story set during the depression it was a moving complex book that didn't end with a happy ending it made me think of atonement for some reason though thea is much more likeable a bit gothic and set in the south good enjoyable read","203":"odd story but interesting","204":" i really wanted to like this book i had kept it on my shelf for a while just looking at it hoping that it would take me back to a nostalgic camp setting where a coming of age story however tragic and sad would pull me in uh nope not what happened perhaps it's because i could not find any kind of empathy for the young heroine born from privilege and is awakened sexually by her cousin ugh if that was all there was i might not have given it a 1 star rating it's not because of the subject matter that i'm giving it this rating it's because there seemed to be no purpose beyond detailing her confusion and pain i would not say this was a well worded novel either the character development was overdone for some characters and definitely not enough for others i felt that we needed to understand sam her twin much better to understand his actions","205":"dull and lackluster i'm sorry to say","206":"i really enjoyed the yonahlossee riding camp for girls check out my review here mkb book club","207":"the hype lead me to read this slowly and there were a few good lines and the way they unfolded the plot kept me reading to find out what happened but i wanted more","208":"spoiler alerti had to stop this coming of age youth book a girl sent to the riding camp because of her sexual encounters with a cousin and then her encounter with her teacher nope i was done","209":"this book has some themes the might make a reader uncomfortable if you can push past that me barely i found this book to be an interesting portrayal of the united states during the great depression the main character is not someone you want to like or will enjoy but her sad story in contrast to what the rest of the united states is encountering at the same time puts things in perspective i enjoyed this book it was not a relaxing or peaceful book but a good book","210":"i am done could not finish this book i tried but found it quite boring","211":"it started out as such a great coming of age tale about young girls and forming friendships but then it got weird when you find out why she is there its disturbing and the ending just sort of well lame everyone ends up broken in their own way and moves on alone i really had high hopes for this book especially in the beginning i just wanted more but it bombed instead","212":"page 146 and i give up slow and boring seriously it still hasn't even been revealed why thea is at the camp there's slow build and there's ridiculous i don't care about thea at all i read another review with all the spoilers and i'm glad i didn't waste my time with the other 250 pages","213":"dark coming of age is a correct description","214":"difficult book to review because it is about a main character that i thought i'd hate but ended up captivated by thea is complicated selfish and impulsive but i liked her and felt sorry for her sam her twin brother is a great literary tragic figure and the headmaster of the school is quite a paradox wanted to hate him as well but didn't there is a scene where thea is dancing with a boy at a dance that is so bittersweet and honest that it probably earned a fourth star in this review","215":"another book about growing up in rural florida and being sent away for some adolescent transgression like fates and furies but not so ambitious i thought it captured the inner voice of an adolescent girl very effectively","216":"the third star is for the historical setting it was interesting to read about how the depression hit several rich families however i did not like the main character thea her choices seemed to be justified by her independent outcome but her deviant and immoral behavior should have had stronger consequences she is a very selfish person","217":"great setting and interesting storyline but the writing could have had more flow","218":"recommended in oprah magazine as a novel you could not put down i liked it at first when you really didn't know for sure why itsprotagonist thea was at the camp as the truth was revealed i found myself not really empathizing with her a spoiled rich girl who always went for and got what she wanted without concern for who she stepped on in the process i did enjoy the novel but did not love it","219":"although the story was a well written one i had some issues with 2 of the reviewers on the book jacket saying this was a sexy read what story is considered sexy about a 15 going on 16 year old girl who is seduced and also seduces her 17 year old cousin what is sexy about seducing your headmaster at the riding camp she was sent away because her parents thought she might be carrying her cousin's child when his wife is away for 6 weeks mmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkk","220":"this book was slow it could have been 100 pages shorter and been a better story the family was so dysfunctional thea craved love guidance and even discipline not my favorite book","221":" i rarely say this but i hated this book i kept reading on and reading on in the hopes that it would get better but it just got worse and worse thea is not a likeable character and so i was just not invested in her growth or her relationship with others same goes for the rest of thea's family the holmes and most of the girls at yonahlossee beyond the fact that these characters were so unlikeable the writing left something to be desired quite a bit actually discalfani does a good job articulating what it feels like to be on a horse but the rest of her prose and broken and unbalenced i never write poor reviews but i felt betrayed by how bad this book is as an aside enough with incest already i mean really people stop sleeping with your relatives","222":"thea atwell is sent to the camp which is more a finishing school than a camp for a year after a family scandal she has never spent much time with people besides her immediate family so she is thrown into a complicated social structure as penance for what she did at home as she stays at the camp and makes friends she also starts to reveal images from her past relating to the scandal that got her sent to the camp the characters are very well written they come off the page the story has twists and turns i figured out what some of the scandal was before too long into the book but the final plot twist in the scandal was completely unexpected i honestly had trouble putting it down","223":"this was a great book","224":" the yonahlossee riding camp for girls by anton disclafanithis big rich novel covers only a year but manages to convey an entire lifetime thea the main character is a twin a lover of horses and a girl who wants unfortunately what she wants is not necessarily good for her or her family or those she loves sent away from her home because of her actions she spends a year at a \"camp\" that is actually a cross between a finishing school for wealthy girls and a riding academy the background of thea's infraction is explored in many backflashes as the book progresses disclafani gives us a whole world set in depression era southern appalachia her characters are well drawn and appealing her descriptions provide a moody backdrop to a story filled with angst teen girls and horses while the characters are teens this is not a young adult book but a sizzling sex tale set in a victorian horse show book groups will find a plethora of topics ranging from teen sex to family roles to education of women to the importance of money among many others","225":"i had high hopes for this book because i really liked the idea of the time period and setting but something about it just rubbed me the wrong way the way she so carelessly interjected herself into the headmistresses family while she was away without any regard for how it effected others caused me to grow to dislike her she didn't seem to ever think about anyone else's feelings but her own the flashbacks to her time at home were the best part of the book it seemed as though her time at camp was very dry and the author tried to make up for this fact with her promiscuity i don't have a problem with romance or sexuality but personally i think it would have been a better book if it had gone in a different direction it's hard to like a book when you don't really like the main character","226":" easily the strangest thing i've read in a while i hesitated reading this strange story for so long because the reviews of the critics and those of ordinary folks differed so wildly surely never a good sign but i did it and although i wouldn't call what i'm feeling gladness exactly i am still here thinking about thea and writing about her and thinking about her mother and the wonderful sissy don't get me wrong thea is terrible a truly terrible selfish cruel nasty girl but she is also odd and strange and at times mesmerizing for me she's vividly adolescent and i do read a lot about teenagers who don't act like teenagers and perhaps it was just refreshing to read about a girl who was so teenage even obnoxiously so unlike others i didn't have a hard time with the pacing the author is manipulative with the way she chooses to tell her story she doesn't try to hide every string and pulley but thea as the most teenage of teenagers is manipulative and it seems to make a certain kind of sense that the story she is telling would also be manipulative even obnoxiously so it is a hard book to just move through it's obstinate that way but i weirdly enjoyed the battle","227":"this book was chockfull of potential the depression boarding school horseback riding and i really wanted to like it sadly it falls short i struggled to feel invested in the characters and the big family secret was over played and felt drawn out i'm not sure how this book is a national best seller","228":" i had read about this book in all the summer magazines so when i saw it on the library staff's list of best books for the year i eagerly checked it out and started it i thought it must be me but after reading the reviews i see it is not only me but this book truly was a waste of time i enjoyed the writing it is a lyrical style that slides you into the book but not the story or the characters or the plot or anything else i kept falling asleep without getting anywhere in the book and then chastising myself for not wanting to read it before i realized that it was just plain boring the last fourth of the book finally got my attention and then it ended poorly with a paragraph seemingly out of nowhere and on to the acknowledgements i literally had to re read the last few pages to decide that's it aaarg hate when i waste my time like this","229":" a melancholy period piece about a young girl named thea holding fast to a secret that has begun to destroy her family she is deposited at the yonahlossee riding camp for girls a place nestled in the blue ridge mountains that has plenty of secrets of its own i didn't expect to enjoy this book as much as i did seeing as i despise horses but the girls were likable and the writing was so lyrical and hypnotic that i couldn't help getting sucked into their lives as thea's secret is slowly revealed against the backdrop of the great depression i disliked her more and more all the while devouring the pages i felt it ended rather abruptly but appreciated that the author gave us a taste of what the future would hold for thea and her family","230":" one of my pet peeves is narratives that try to stretch things out by continually harping on some terrible secret that the main character knows but won't share it is a very unsatisfying way to draw out a story and unfortunately there's a lot of this at the beginning of this book if it had been done with a lighter hand i wouldn't have been so annoyed i do love horse books and the nc setting was welcome but someone dropped the ball in regard to fact checking spanish moss doesn't grow anywhere near blowing rock nc","231":"pretty underwhelming i pushed through it hoping the mystery would prove more interesting than what i correctly guessed it to be","232":"a slow simmer but a good one an interesting coming of age story of a young rich 16 year old girl in the 1930's the question that was always the underlying theme of the story was why did her family send her away in the first place it was slowly and juicily revealed as the story progressed at times i felt sympathy for thea the main character and other times i felt she was spoiled and unthoughtful i'm not much of a horse person but the descriptions dealing with the horses flowed easily this was certainly a different kind of story and after it picked up the pace a bit so did i and i wanted to see what was going to happen next an enjoyable read","233":"i expected to not care for this book but i got hooked the horses the friendships of the girls at the camp great read","234":" thea atwell leads what many might called a charmed life or as her mother says a lucky life she and her twin brother sam live with their parents on a secluded farm in florida she spends her days riding horses and investigating the wonders of the natural world with sam educated at home thea and sam rarely spend time with other children the only other child thea and sam see with some regularity is their cousin georgie their seclusion from the outside world seems nearly absolute it is 1930 and even what would become known as the great depression is starting to make itself felt thea and her family barely feel its effects this is partly because her father is a doctor and after all there will always be sick people her father's medical practice however isn't really where the family gets its money that comes from the citrus groves on thea's mother's side but not even wealth can protect one from all the tragedies of life thea is 15 years old when she is sent away from home to the yonahlossee riding camp for girls she hopes it is just for the summer but as fall comes around she realizes her banishment will last much longer her banishment is the result of a family tragedy in which thea played a significant part contrary to her family or even thea herself i cannot hold thea solely responsible she views the camp boarding school as a punishment but it becomes a gift as thea begins to grapple with who she is away from the isolated life of her family the yonahlossee riding camp for girls is a coming of age of tale set in 1930s florida and north carolina in other hands this story may have filled with sentimentality and nostalgia anton disclafani does not waste time with that here thea's transition from childhood to adulthood is messy and painful her actions hurt her and those around her but like often in the teen years she can't quite seem to stop herself she manages to be both insightful and naive calculating and innocent at the same time kind and cruel at the same time i'm still grappling with what to think about thea and the yonahlossee riding camp for girls thea as a character was strong and full of contradictions which i felt was intriguing and accurate in the sense that people particularly teenagers are often full of contradictions i liked that there was a lack of romanticising of the past there was something missing however i wanted more about sam in particular as well as their parents but maybe that's unfair since this is thea's story i also wanted to know what kind of woman thea was going to become she makes one mistake and then makes the same mistake again and it isn't quite clear what she has learned in regards to that situation she does grow in other ways but not exactly in the way that i would have wanted given the nature of the story and the tragedy that drives the novel if i am not mistaken this is disclafani's first novel though it was not perfect it was quite good i look forward to reading what she writes next","235":"i could not put this book down i started it on a plane ride on our way to vacation and even after getting to our beautiful resort i still kept reaching for it every second that i could it was a beautifully written coming of age story that is heartbreaking and empowering at the same time although there is some mystery about why thea is forced to go to the camp the author provides enough clues that i got the general idea and was able to enjoy the novel without rushing to get to the flashbacks so i could figure it out as i often do which of course ruins the whole point of reading a book in the first place when i finished it mere moments before our friends arrived to join us and i wouldn't have had time to read i honestly felt like starting it all over again and despite how much fun i was having thea's story continued to stay with me throughout the week haunting me as if she were a real person it's been a long time since i felt like this about a book i wholly and thoroughly recommend it","236":" i read this book quickly and found it entertaining and in spots the language is so beautiful that it made it completely worthwhile to read but i felt like the tease of what had happened stretched on too long and then there were shocking events that were indeed shocking but i didn't feel the shock from within the integrity of the constructed characters so overall the story was a bit too intellectual for me i would have loved to see the settings more vividly and understand the motivations of the characters more thoroughly","237":" the main reason i rated this book three stars instead of four is that i'm not a big fan of reading about horses this book isn't about horses but the protagonist is a serious rider so horses figure prominently in the story i realize that's probably silly but i've never understood the connection between horses and coming of age stories without the strong recommendation i received i wouldn't have chosen this book but i really liked the story which is set in the 1930s mostly because i liked the protagonist narrator a lot","238":" started off wonderfully i thought and slowly declined over the course of 400 pages into a lolita thing which disappointed me a manipulative too mature cynical for her age 16 girl sent off to an all girl's camp in the early 1930s after a scandal at home the scandal of course involves sex all the girls in this story in fact are written as if they were 30 not teens at all in short i never quite believed any part of this novel not our protagonist not the girls not her family nor even her headmaster none of it rang true for me although the author has an engaging writing style kudos for her mastery of first person narrative your mileage may vary","239":"really loved this one first thoughts i just felt a little devastated when i closed the last page i suppose it was the combination of such elegant writing coming to an end the fact that view spoiler henry holmes and thea never saw each other again hide spoiler the way their lives ended up and the fact that you truly can never go home again the author's prose reminded me a touch of curtis sittenfeld's which is the biggest compliment i can give it was spare and a little odd at times but it's a first book so i forgive it and beautiful i'm looking forward to more from this author favourites 1 view spoiler the relationship between mr holmes and thea initially i thought that mr holmes was molesting his daughters no idea why except the whiff of competitiveness between them like no i am going to hold daddy's hand now and then the whole rachel debacle but anyway i guess i was way off i liked mr holmes so this upset me and i was happy to be wrong of course it's a tad icky that a 30 year old was in love with a 16 year old but i took into account the times and henry himself who was if anything a little emotionally stunted and had obviously married before thinking things through i think he recognized a kindred spirit in thea how damaged she was by her family's choices how she fought so hard against society's expectations of her and of course how pretty and self contained she was i think he was also attracted to how much she wanted sex i doubt mrs holmes was up for it much and when isn't that attractive to a man my favourite thing about the relationship though was the power dynamic shifting between them the way that there was no shame in what they did the oral sex part good job mr holmes how it wasn't one sided and how thea was never made to feel like a slutty slut as in so many other books i loved the way the author handled it i loved how thea came out in the end hide spoiler 2 thea herself this is an unpopular opinion i find women are very critical of characters like this maybe it makes us uncomfortable when a girl is sexually liberated and knows what she wants we have to call her a twit or whiny or a slut etc but i really liked what she stood for and how the author crafted her from her environment i thought that her cousin was at fault for what happened in terms of how quickly it escalated view spoiler he was older than her and set out to seduce her in no uncertain terms that seemed clear from the book he wanted sex and she was pretty much the only game in town yeah it was gross because they were cousins but i'm surprised that no one picked up on the fact that it was bound to happen because of how isolated they were the author details how they never see anyone else it's just the family and the horses shouldn't we all just thank our lucky stars that sam and thea didn't start experimenting it isn't shocking that thea and georgie were curious about sex and thought they were in love not to me hide spoiler 3 the environment more later","240":"i really enjoyed this book and could hardly put it down it's been a long time since i've been drawn into a story so quickly it gave a little glimpse of life in 1920s but the heart is a young woman finding herself and have relationships transform her views","241":" i sometimes thought isn't that always the way a dull girl charmed by a book i'm not sure i liked thea atwell but at least she was honest disclafani does a great job of depicting thea's inner struggles the mystery lover in me kept reading to discover what horrible transgression sent thea away from her family i could identify with thea being propelled by some inner force and not being able to stop herself and feeling bad about feeling free thea's transition to adulthood is a painful one as she navigates the dangerous waters w o her parents who seem incapable of parenting and or dealing with life in general it's sad how thea's perceptions of her family her twin and indeed her life change as she initially endures yonahlossee and then grows to appreciate it and yet isn't that what growing up is all about","242":"would probably give this one 3 5 stars very well written story of a young girl during the depression 1930 thea is from a wealthy family they seem to have it all then a horrible accident shatters everything all this because thea can't or won't control her desires the fall out is huge and far reaching her family will never be the same well written as story explores family relationships twin relationships and how a young girl learnw to navigate all this and the world at large","243":"i'm so tired of novels about selfish teenage girls and their sexual awakenings","244":"this was a beautifully written book and i really enjoyed it i've seen a lot of poor reviews about this book how thea would act one way and then do something completely different in the next scene yes this is true but where some call it an author fault i think it's in fact a very purposeful character trait thea is 16 years old in this book i don't know about the other readers but when i was that age i was still discovering myself and i without a doubt made some mistakes more than once as thea did i commend the author for her thoughtful and accurate portrayal of a 16 year old girl who thinks she knows what she wants but in reality her needs are something much deeper i look forward to seeing anton disclafani release additional novels and hopefully they'll have more horsey backdrops","245":"i actually enjoyed this book club book far more than i expected the author exploration of a girl's sexual awakening and all the craziness that entails felt very believable i liked thea as she grows to understand and accept the unexpected consequences of a single act and the lasting implications the girl's camp school during the great depression in north carolina captured the changing times of upper class families control of their daughters their wealth and place in society","246":"as another reviewer said it's a dark coming of age novel it's fairly predictable but still enjoyable to read i liked the writing style","247":"i really enjoyed this book it wasn't all that difficult to guess ahead of time what was going to happen but it still was an interesting story i didn't particularly care for the thea but i certainly was captured by her intensity and her intriguing behavior it's a quick read","248":" the darkness in this coming of age story felt very real thea struggling with her sexuality at an age and in a time when that was not encouraged felt very true there was a constant threat in the unknowns isolated childhood parents with secrets the mysteries of twins the atmosphere of the depression the beautiful dangers of horses which influenced thea's life that discalafani mirrored well with the slow revealing of the past and present story lines her characters felt fresh to me and their faults felt true to their circumstances it is not a feel good story but it is a great read","249":"lovely writing delicate atmospheric fantastic details on riding and the relationship between horse and rider perhaps i wouldn't have been as disappointed without all the hype but my irritation at the slow reveal of thea's big secret the nature of which the author signals clearly early on in the book kept me from fully enjoying this book i don't mind being manipulated i just would rather not be so constantly aware of it","250":"maybe 2 1 2 fun beach read but really didn't do anything new didn't seem to fully develop anything that was interesting about it the depression timing the family dynamics that drove the main events even the girls' school setting seemed only sketched out the author's writing was skilled and her love of horses translated well","251":"perfect for a beach read well written especially the descriptions of the camp and relationships between the girls which i found evocative and nuanced i just never really felt much of a connection with the protagonist","252":"whatever did thea do down in central florida in the year 1930 that's basically what drives this luminous coming of age novel although it is pretty clear about a quarter of the way through the novel what our 15 year old heroine did it is still a wonderful pleasure to read as the details are slowly revealed by the author because of her horrid deed she is sent to the place of the title where she grows up really fast the book is very simply written and i found myself flying through it it is told in the voice of a 15 16 year old and the author recreates that age's mode of communicating very effectively the book is about a young girl coming of age her love of horses and the dissection of the american family all in the milieu of the beginning of the great depression it is very readable very connectable and very moving however be forewarned for those of you who are turned off by girls in their middle teens having sexual feelings and acting on them this book is probably not for you however the author does deal with the subject very realistically and very sensitively","253":"thea atwell a 15 year old girl is sent away to the yonahlossee riding camp for girls after a devastating family tragedy which is actually pretty obvious early on thea's fraternal twin sam stays at home with their mother and father while thea is sent away farther away than she's ever been from everyone she knows disclafani sets the stage of this well to do family that lives in an idyllic setting on 1 000 acres in florida seemingly untouched by the real world it's the time of the great depression and the banks are failing and everyone seems to be losing everything including the only relatives thea and sam have uncle george aunt carrie and cousin georgie but not thea's family they are untouchable thea spends nearly all of her time with her horse or her brother when georgie visits they spend their time with him and then the terrible thing happens view spoiler thea has sex with georgie in the barn and afterwards sam beats him nearly to death hide spoiler and she is sent away to a boarding school full of other rich southern girls located in the blue ridge mountains thea is forced to learn the intricacies of a social order what is acceptable what isn't how does one act when they are around others thea's only respite from everything is the riding the horses are the only thing that keep her mind off of her role in what got her sent to yonahlossee in the first place but then after another indescretion view spoiler thea has an affair with the married headmaster while his wife is out of town hide spoiler she gets sent back home and has to deal with what she's been sent away from meh that's my overall feeling re this book kind of a let down considering how much i was looking forward to reading it also it got some amazing blurbs from curtis sittenfeld the story is told in a grown up looking back sort of flashback way with the current story happening and flashbacks to the big tragedy it makes it a bit awkward like she's constantly interrupting herself i found it hard to want to know more about thea as it seems it couldn't be decided if she was a naive unknowing girl or the calculated smart 'knowing' girl also there's this mysertious build up to the obvious tragedy that is really unnecessary i just think there are better books out there that deal with the pecking order of groups of girls","254":"this was horrible the storyline is all over the place there's no follow through it seems to bounce between time frames this is a pretty long book for such elementary writing","255":"i found this incredibly depressing there were decent spots but almost all was sad","256":"this review has been hidden because it contains spoilers to view it click here i really wanted to like all of this book here's my problem with it why does the main character need to have an illicit affair with her cousin couldn't thea have fallen in love with another boy perhaps from the wrong side of the tracks in my opinion the incest was not necessary it added nothing to the book it did however make me feel like i needed to take multiple showers ick","257":"so i had big hopes for this book it's everything that i love rich teenage girls riding camps scandal and high society things however the main character was really annoying and i really didn't appreciate the horse beating scene totally unnecessary i really liked the descriptions of the camp though and i think the writing was good but the dialogue was dumbed down if that makes sense the scandal was obvious but didn't come until the last part of the book overall a let down","258":"i found this book to be engrossing and well written but at the end i realized i really didn't enjoy the story very much","259":"i had really high expectations for this and felt let down i had absolutely no sympathy at all for thea because of her whiny nature every move she made and the scandal that sends her to the school was entirely predictable i had to force myself to finish this book and i was relieved when it was over","260":" a suspenseful coming of age romance and mystery i read it quickly i enjoyed its unique setting north carolina school for girls in the transitional depression era the twin factor weirded me out naturally and the main character all the characters had so many flaws that's where i'm torn thea was so conflicting cold and caring sometimes she played innocent victim and then flopped to selfish conniving adolescent i'm really torn on this one saw it on several 2014 summer reading lists i think in the end i liked it more than most books i've read lately because it is making me think the main character is so introspective i was entertained by her original thoughts she was not flat on top of that she had modern progressive feminist thinking during a victorian society quite a few racy scenes here","261":" i don't know how to feel about this book the writing is wonderful and the story was interesting thea is not exactly a likable character though this isn't necessarily a bad thing as what kind of story would it be if the characters were all likable but upon finishing the book i just felt unsettled like the story wasn't quite over yet i will say that it is refreshing to see a novel where the young heroine is not ashamed of herself as a sexual being and isn't afraid to act upon her feelings and find pleasure in them","262":"this review has been hidden because it contains spoilers to view it click here this book has been on a lot of magazine summer lists as a must read i was really skeptical because every review from an actual reader seemed to be either an absolutely love or hate it opinion also i hate to write this but sometimes magazines promote books for other reasons than they actually liked them eventually i finally decided to read it any way and let me emphasize that while i liked it it was pretty evident why a lot of people do not i am going to first explain the reason i liked i this book has been on a lot of magazine summer lists as a must read i was really skeptical because every review from an actual reader seemed to be either an absolutely love or hate it opinion also i hate to write this but sometimes magazines promote books for other reasons than they actually liked them eventually i finally decided to read it any way and let me emphasize that while i liked it it was pretty evident why a lot of people do not i am going to first explain the reason i liked it and then explain the reason why i feel a lot people did not linguistically this is a beautiful book for that reason the prose is a pleasure to read also i am from the south and love horses this book is a tribute to both i liked that it seemed to give an overall picture of a time in this girl's life and for me i liked reading it however this is not a book where a lot happens if you are the kind of person that likes a book driven by an active plot this is not going to be the book for you there is not also a lot of resolutions for the character by the end of the book it is not evident that the main character has learned anything so it leaves many a reader probably wondering what is the point spoiler plot girl sent away to a private boarding school horse riding camp because she slept with her cousin georgie back home she leaves for this school and at first hates then grows to like it she also while at the school has an affair with her married headmaster until his wife returns then she decides to cover for a friend at the school by claiming she was sneaking off to meet a boy when it was the friend and gets sent back home in disgrace when she returns home it becomes clear that her previous actions have changed her family dynamic for the worse in addition her family seems to have lost some of their wealth there really isn't any sort of resolution a little more background after she sleeps with her cousin her twin brother sam and her cousin georgie get in a horrible fight that leaves georgie with permanent brain damage and her brother feeling guilty leave a comment if specifc questions and i will answer them more","263":" lovely prose but no real character development or story i so wanted to find out more about this protagonist but all she did was make cryptic allusions that went nowhere if this had been submitted in one of my mfa classes they would not have been kind surprising since the author holds an mfa one of the more frustrating aspects of this novel is its failure to evoke the depression era if the protagonist didn't keep mentioning it one would never know also it jumps around timewise and becomes confusing as to plot sequence i really wanted to like this book but it just doesn't hold up","264":"i tried to like this book but just couldn't the story just sort of keeps going it does not develope into anything the character is all over the place and i had a hard time keeping track of of she was feeling what time frame things were taking place it was either really well written because it was written the way a teenage girl would think or really poorly written because it was they way a teenage girl would think had to put it down","265":"the writing begins beautifully and the story seems promising but i could see the ending coming a mile away and the second half of the book moved slowly the drama and emotions of teenage years were nicely fleshed out and i enjoyed reading about the girls at the school but thea's character seemed to be lacking something","266":" i looked forward to reading this book and was excited about reading it but i found this book strange for some reason i felt compelled to read it even though i a didn't like the main character at all and b didn't like the story and yet i finished it quickly and read the whole thing so i'm torn the main character is unlikeable and i'm not sure we're supposed to like her she's a supposedly great horse person but she can be cruel to her horses and describes them as dumb animals but at another point she says her horse is smart i don't think you can be a great horse person and be cruel and think horses are dumb animals in some ways i liked leona better also thea doesn't seem to do anything spoiler alert i'm also not sure but i think that it may have been becoming more uncommon but i don't think it was as scandalous to marry a cousin even a first cousin mostly because i think the british royal family are all cousins and that fdr and eleanor were first cousins so that part felt unconvincing to me wouldn't recommend this book but like i said i felt compelled to read and finish it","267":"hmmm a 2 5 strong writing with an intense draw to hear the real story the one that began the whole situation and a wonderful setting really horse camp for rich girls situated on top of a mountain in the smokies at the beginning of the depression amazing unfortunately i disliked thea intensely i almost shelved this as ya due to her inability to remove herself from a 15 16 year old's hormonal and emotional angst but the sexy bits made me hesitate and there were lots of sexy bits i think i've taken an idea from the book that transcends thea's headstrong decisions her mother comments 'but that was my mistake wasn't it to think i could fiddle with your natures' 279 but at the same time i think that twin sam was halfway complete georgie very incomplete as a character and even thea's parents were hazy you get inklings of their personalities but thea's hormones color everything and though thea calls herself fearless i think she was fearful in the way so many teenagers are about the wrong things about opinion versus reality and adult choices and thea did come to a general understanding of the immensity of her decisions which was the strong point of this book in my mind there was one point after some sexy bits where she realized that she would never be able to tell her eventual husband about those experiences and that moment was powerful to me especially as a former 15 year old girl i would have liked to read more about her adult life which disclafani glosses through at the very end one weird caveat i thought disclafani was male at first and was incredibly impressed with his first person narrative as a 15 year old girl but disclafani is female which makes more sense","268":"loved this book was attached to the characters believed in the setting couldn't stop wondering about the past and fell in love with the writing","269":"i too really wanted to love this book but that didn't happen the story although interesting did not have any punch and the ending was very disappointing very blah too bad it could have been a great book but the author did not take the story in the right direction","270":"one of the things i loved about my 30s era riding camp was the sense of nostalgia that permeated the place and i was returned to that feeling by this charming book","271":"i loved this story of thea a young girl who is sent away from her beloved home as a consequence of an unnamed family trauma that has devastated her parents her twin brother and her extended family the book opens with thea's journey to the yonahlossee riding camp for girls where her father escorts her to spend what thea believes will be the rest of the summer but which ends up being the entire next year shamed and bewildered thea moves from shock and contrition to resentment as she settled into yonahlossee makes friends and begins to explore her independence although thea makes some extremely poor decisions at camp as she struggles to reconcile her feelings about being cast out of the home she loved and away from the people she loved i felt a lot of empathy for this young woman whose teenage angst is met with so much blame denial and recrimination the novel highlights that things are not always as they seem by the end of the story we clearly see that thea has become stronger for her mistakes she learned in a very painful way that the insular world in which she had been growing up was more fragile than she'd thought but that she herself was stronger and more courageous than she'd ever dreamed of being","272":"this book was compelling sad and difficult and while the description says it is sexy that sure isn't how it came off to me not a traditional love story or one that resonated with my life but well written","273":"a bizarre plot that seemed a little far fetched throughout would have enjoyed more info about the girls school with the backdrop of the depression","274":" when one is a teenager one tries behaviors that appear to them tobe acts that adults do some of these are wrong and would be thought by adults to be immoral or damaging to one's growing up as a teenager one constantly reviews what one has done and whether they like what they did often they don't go over whether it was wrong or right this is a story of the outward things done and the mind regurgitation of the outward behavior by thea atwell she horseback rides over their gigantic citrus property in florida accompanies her twin brother in his nature experiments does some housework and in secret fingers her boy cousin until it leads to the sex act in consequence she then is sent away to a camp boarding school the yonahlossee riding camp for girls where she get her first girl friends and rides horses in preparation for an eventual horse show she also gears herself up for another sex act but this time with an even more inappropriate choice of male she doesn't seem to regret what she has done she truly enjoys the physicality of it as i read i went over the thoughts i had when horseback riding and those of various life transgressions to me that seemed the purpose of the book to open ones mind to what and why we had experimented and thought as a youngster i was amazed that the writing and the switches between current life and home life were so well done and seamless","275":"thoroughly enjoyed this book","276":"some parts of this book were a little long and drawn out but overall i thought the imagery was great and the story line pretty original","277":"this is a haunting coming of age story that reminded me so much of my camp years but with an unusual twist not the same ole cranked out storyline","278":"i was excited to read this book so much promise but it was a disappointment i found thea's adolescent sexuality oddly aggressive and the details too much her character too self absorbed","279":" rich girls and horses sound attractive add some family drama a boarding school and a lot of smut and you have the yonahlossee riding camp for girls a depression era meatballs yonahlossee is part summer camp mostly boarding school for wealthy southern girls many of whom are realizing that their fortunes are disappearing with the economy thea is escorted to yonahlossee by her father after shaming her reclusive perfect tightly knit florida family not understanding she is being sent there permanently for boarding school thea an avid rider thinks she's going to camp although we are aware that something tragic has happened in her family having to do with her cousin georgie and distancing her from her twin brother sam hm what could that be disclafani alternates chapters between the present at yonahlossee and the events leading up to thea's censure so that both stories climax so to speak at the same time this has seemed to be the way to write best sellers for a while now but i can't say that it leads to much depth in character or plot development while tyrcfg is a fun beach read it's not much more than that while thea develops as a rider she doesn't seem to learn from her mistakes not being southern but liking horses and the descriptions of clothes and jewelery i found tyrfcg amusing but not life changing","280":"definitely a divisive book as you can see from the reviews here the protagonist is not likeable but her thought provoking story is compelling u0026amp worth telling as always feel free to stop reading if it is not to your liking","281":"slow and characters are either un likable or underdeveloped complex themes abound but are only explored nominally","282":"a little formulaic but still a good read about girls being girls when they aren't under their parents' eye","283":" i am going to be one of the few people who hated this book i can tell my problems with it are many first off i found the writing style to be pretentious and awkward the sentence structures read very unevenly to my ear and i never got pulled into the story because the language was so jarring my next complaint would be that the setting and time period were very generic for a novel set during the beginning of the great depression and taking place in blue ridge mountains neither time nor place came alive for me i knew that's when and where they were set because that's what the writing told me but i certainly wouldn't have guessed so under other circumstances in my long list of complaints i had to take extreme exception to thea herself i certainly don't demand that my main characters be sympathetic sometimes the villeins are all the more compelling for their evil but thea struck me as spoiled not strong willed sure her family seemed to have sheltered her and limited her interactions with others besides her twin brother and family but thea seemed more than comfortable with that her big disgrace if you can call it that beware the spoilers ahead was a not so innocent sexual affair with her cousin georgie i say not so innocent because they fooled around quite a bit and thea in her narration expresses doubts about the wisdom of the affair and yet her biggest concern is getting caught when they actually decide to consummate their relationship thea suddenly gets cold feet after and realizes she's been used this humiliation and her childish response leads to georgie being struck down by her brother where upon he basically is never completely right in the head the family doesn't quite know what happened but they suspect thea has had sex and could become pregnant they immediately ship her off to a girl's boarding school which is a sort of upper class school for girls with horses i wasn't quite sure why they would send her away to someplace she might actually enjoy thea loves to ride so why reward her behavior you'd think the school would be a sin bin full of other naughty girls but that doesn't seem to be the case so again why send thea there surely there are other equally out of the way places they could have parked her despite having lived in a social bubble thea immediately susses out the politics of the various girls and manages to attach herself to the popular sissy thus ensuring a fairly easy time of it she decides to devote herself to two goals winning the spring show so her picture will be enshrined on the office wall and seducing the headmaster you'd think after her second thoughts with georgie she'd be off men and sex altogether but she's become quite wanton she even uses the headmaster's children in sham concern and friendship to further her ends to bed the headmaster the author seems to want to paint thea as this strong willed young girl claiming her sexuality in a time and place that frowns on such conduct and knowledge but instead she came across as a greedy little girl hungry to have the forbidden regardless of the costs to others she was shallow and amoral and frankly rather boring it even took energy to dislike her she might have been redeemed for me by her act of self sacrifice at the end ruining her reputation to save another girl's but here again it is a calculated act to allow her to leave the school and reunite if only briefly with her brother and home the ending was disjointed and if thea had gained any self knowledge it seemed to be she was a girl who wanted too much and her big revelation was that she was such a girl and she was willing to pay the price for it the worst sin for me personally was the lack of horses for a book about a riding camp there wasn't much riding or bonds with the horses i'm sure others will perhaps love this and find it an amazing first novel by a rising young talent for me it was pretentious drivel and best shelved in the bin i only finished it because a friend lent me her copy and i felt obligated life is too short to read bad books","284":"what a sweet heartbreaking and embracing book the emotional weight thea carried all through the story while trying to survive just being a teen aged girl felt so real every page brought pain and heartache while also providing second chances and pitfalls reading this book felt like running away going home really can never happen","285":"coming of age novel that takes place among the southern wealthy and while we guess at what made thea be sent away we don't see the extent of it until the last third and it takes till the end for thea to come to terms with it a good novel overall but i thought it stalled a bit toward the end","286":"i loved the beginning of this book but was so disappointed with ending it felt rushed and wrong you spend the bulk of he book waiting to find out what she did that was so horrible and then when it is finally revealed you are confused what no plot spoilers here just wish the last was more complete","287":"it's a coming of age story but it's not really moving the only word that comes to mind to describe this book is 'okay ' it wasn't painful to read but it wasn't particularly moving or interesting the non linear aspect did not serve this book at all i was unimpressed by the reveal of the protagonist's 'shame '","288":"i really did like this story but not enough to rate it a 4 star it was a very good story of youth innocence tragedy and consequence a coming of age drama it kept me interested and wanting to know the conclusion i can see this as a lifetime hallmark movie it's worth the read","289":"this review has been hidden because it contains spoilers to view it click here really enjoyed the book a page turner till the end explained too much in an unsatisfactory ending maybe i just wanted everyone in the family to come back together but that just wasn't possible","290":"loved this book having grown up near elmatha and attended summer camp in the blue ridge mountains i could imagine the settings of this book with ease thea is a fantastic character who comes to terms with her desire to consume the world around her she is driven by her fearlessness which is both a blessing and a curse as she lives her life her fearlessness results in actions that isolate her from her family keeps her at the periphery of having friends drives her from fair favor but it is the same drive to live without fear of fallout that weaves success and fulfillment through the course of her life i loved this book and completely understood thea it is a thin line between courage and stupidity like her i walk it every day","291":"let me preface this by saying this was my neighborhood book club selection i probably would not have finished it otherwise i did not like this book i found it unpleasant few of the characters were likable even thea the main character also there is a secret reason for which thea is sent away from home and family that is alluded to and hinted at in flashback for half the book i found that incredibly annoying get to the point already also after dragging on for 390 pages the book wraps everything up and ends in just few pages in what i felt was an unsatisfactory way","292":"quite enjoyed it lovely writing and solid exploration of female friendship coming of age not really about horses and the goodreads blurb makes it sound more pulpy than it is","293":"i picked up this book solely because of the author she was a professor of mine back at washington university in st louis so i admit the review may be a bit biased i enjoyed her class the yonahlossee riding camp is a classic tale of the old south a literary novel that in many ways reflects the time period it is written about the florida and north carolina landscapes are richly described and fully realized pieces of the narrative and a wide cast of characters exposes many sides of the great depression at least from the perspective of the wealthy i thoroughly enjoyed the immersion in southern society as the story presents a beautiful portrait of an age only my grandparents could have known well they were in cleveland but you get the idea admittedly i'm not a frequent reader of books about teenage girls horse camp boarding schools and the great depression i'm not sure this is the first book i would choose to get away from the usual from my perspective it felt like a few parts were slogs please not another horse scene but i suppose i knew that was coming when i picked it up the larger issues to me were in the plot and characterization it was hard to get into the protagonist's head so as to root for her and to understand her motives additionally the story doesn't seem to really move anyone forward and bring closure to anyone i was disappointed in the way it ended and wanted something better for these families while this wasn't my favorite i'm sure there are plenty of demographics where this book would be a hit for me it ended up as more of a meh","294":"i read this book very quickly which tells me i enjoyed it but something was off for me perhaps it was that i didn't find the main character to be very likable i enjoyed the setting time frame of the story though","295":"interesting read","296":"this book is very well written with well defined characters thea is a young girl shown little direction in life and while it is obvious why she is sent away to camp the message of the book is shown more powerfully towards the end i highly recommend this book","297":"if you like books about the south or coming of age it's an easy good summer read concerning the close relationships of twins families and girls friends","298":"this review has been hidden because it contains spoilers to view it click here i loved this book her coming of age story involved a few really uncomfortable scenes that i enjoyed reading the end was dull and i cannot completely understand why they sent her away to the camp if sam was the one who hurt georgie and it never fully came out that she was intimate with georgie but entertaining anyway","299":"it took a bit to get into this story but once a few chapters in i was entertained the book was a good read with a little bit of disturbing situations","300":"i won this book in a goodreads contest lovely story which includes mystery scandal and love the author created a lovable sympathetic character making terrible life choices this is one of those books that you can't stop reading but you don't want to finish i hope this author continues to write i would love to read more of her books rated 5 stars","301":"slow start but somewhere i don't remember maybe a hundred pages in or so i couldn't get enough i interchanged between audio and the hardback so maybe that was the problem it was a book i chose for one of my book groups so i was committed to reading it through so glad i stuck with it it's a quiet book and beautifully written","302":"this book is beautifully written thea is a very interesting character to get to know and i would have loved to have known more about her this is a story about a 15 year old girl who put herself into a very mature situation and had to grow up a lot faster than needed","303":"this book was captivating and heart wrenching such a fresh and honest look into the inner workings of a teenage girl learning to be her own person in the world","304":"it kept my interest throughout different from your typical family saga","305":"part historical fiction romance part coming of age but not a ya novel horses and riding take up much of the action great characters and portrayal of effects of the depression era on the well to do in the south thoroughly enjoyed","306":"i felt sorry for the protagonist but never liked her that's not enough to buoy my interest in a character's story a minor note but confusing and irritating disclafani described spanish moss hanging from the trees in the mountains of north carolina i've seen it along the coast of nc and perhaps it may have grown further inland in the 1930s but i can't imagine it hanging from the trees in the mountains of nc","307":"i am still trying to decide how i feel about this book i think it was predictable in some apsects but it still packed a punch it almost made it worse that you knew what was going to happen it feels a bit like watching a slasher movie and yelling at the screen to look behind you","308":"this is a very good debut it defies genres a little coming of age a little southern gothic a bit period depression era piece thea and her family glide thru life in florida untouched by reality until uncle george goes broke georgie gets horny and thea starts to grow up this book was beautifully written and sweetly sad","309":"i was a bit disappointed the book started out good but the content went too far over the edge i certainly would not describe this book as a coming of age novel","310":" lovely coming of age tale with a unique setting other than overtones of the depression it didn't quite have the feel of the 1930's thea the main character and narrative voice was both naive and overly mature but it did seem to work i feltthe book got abig draggy in the middle then suddenly the ending was rushed disclfani's foreshadowing was deft and continued to pull the reader along with story a 4 srzt feels about right better than average but not quite stellar i would have to agree that this author shows great promise","311":" i really loved the first half of this book and felt very sorry for thea or at least believed she was an innocent victim of her circumstances but about half way through i began feeling less and less sympathy for her on the one hand i could believe that thea had contradictory personality traits sometimes innocent sometimes femme fatale but things started happening at the camp that i found ridiculously unbelievable i wanted to love this book there was so much potential for it to be really good but instead it left me feeling let down","312":"this book was beautifully written and the words seemed to flow together the reason i gave it a three and not higher was i was very much not in the mood for a book like this this book kind of reminds me of 'the diary of anne frank' it is a typical coming of age story it shows the confusion and lack of understanding of the world as seen through a 15 year old girls eyes if you like to read coming of age stories this book is for you if you like horses that also helps like i said earlier the words seem to flow and it has details that make the story quite beautiful","313":"too much blatant sex incest and not well written","314":"i stayed up way past my bedtime a couple of nights reading it if you're in the mood for something complex and a little dark this is a great choice my review here http smallworldreads blogspot com 2","315":"a really good story a page turner enjoyed it a lot the main character and a few others were well developed but i gave it four stars because there could have been more done on some of the secondary characters enjoyed that it was set in another era i don't usually like that but in this story it was well done","316":"considering all we went through in the last 6 months to buy a new horse not sure a story centered around horses and spoiled teenagers was a good choice overall the story was fine the writing style wasn't my favorite i did think the author truly captured the mind of a teenage girl","317":"i liked the way the author evoked a sense of time place money and privilege i didn't necessarily love the protagonist but well i didn't have to","318":" this is probably a 3 5 for me and it captured that status with the final page the ending of this book took my breath away the final words and images are haunting before i got there however i found myself somewhat annoyed with the main character thea and her actions i guess they are understandable and the final page really makes it all count for me this is a very well written first book and with strong characters and setting the plot was somewhat slow at times but in the end the events really shaped who thea was and why her story was important discafani's book is moody and romantic but never maudlin this coming of age is realistic and maybe somewhat harsh which could explain my dislike of thea i leave this book with an aged black and white photo imprinted in my mind and wonder if that was perhaps what served as a guide in the writing of this book i can see very clearly the nameless girl captured by a camera posing for her remarkable efforts her true story lost in the dusty pages of time","319":" the first half of the book was good suspenseful the author has a hook and i wanted to know why thea was sent away to the camp however once she is at camp the story takes an unfortunate turn i didn't care for the plot at this point and i wonder if the major event that happened to thea at camp was really necessary to the story i finished the book but really didn't care for the last half i would have given the book 2 1 2 if possible but went with 3 since i did finish it and enjoyed the beginning","320":"in 1930 fifteen year old thea atwell has been forced to leave her home in florida and be exiled by her parents to an equestrienne boarding school in the blue ridge mountains as this story ranges between the school and her home and family in florida thea has to deal with the truth about her past and how it will impact her future","321":"take a coming of age story a pony book a boarding school story twist them together with a dash of period style and you have the yonahlossee riding camp for girls the story begins with fifteen year old thea atwell being sent away from her florida home for the first time to an elite establishment set high in the blue ridge mountains of north carolina a finishing school for wealthy debutantes who lived in chalets who were waited on by maids and who spent their days riding and perfecting their equestrian skills heaven for the right girl but thea who had never been away from home before who hadn't wanted to leave her beloved horse stasi knew that she was being punished and she knew that she deserved it as i learned for about her history i realised that she was probably right thea and her twin brother sam grew up in a grand house set in the middle of a thousand acre estate they were educated at home by their father and they spent their days roaming the estate thea riding and sam observing nature which fascinated him they never saw anyone outside the family and that made them very close their only friend was their cousin georgie who visited from time to time with his parents thea was such a fascinating character she was bright confident and passionate but she was selfish thoughtless and heedless to the consequences of her actions i couldn't in all honesty say that i liked her but i was intrigued by her i wanted to know more about her past and her future and i saw that her character was very much the result of her upbringing she struggled at first with the curiosity of the other girls who wondered why she had arrived without warning with the knowledge that while her family was well of by florida standards others had far far more and with a school that put far more emphasis on etiquette and equestrianism than academic study but she adapted she made friends she began to enjoy the lifestyle and she knew her riding skills would put her in contention for awards that made her an enemy thea was at a turning point in her life and the world was changing the 1920s were drawing to a close the depression was looming and maybe the time for establishments like the yonahlossee riding camp for girls was coming to an end the story of the girl and the story of her world worked together and echoed each other beautifully i was pulled into thea's story by lovely lovely writing that carried echoes of the writing of the period even as the story touched on themes that the writers of the period would have passed over she drew me into a world that was fully and quite beautifully realised and though i'm not at all horsey i found it easy to understand thea's passion her other passions were more troublesome and i feared the consequences of many of thea'a actions feared that maybe she was repeating the mistakes of the past at first the story seemed quiet little seemed to be happening but i was caught up and i turned the pages quickly eager to find out what had happened in the past and what would happen in the future i worked out some things but not all of them i was just a little disappointed that certain characters and their motivations weren't as fully realised as they might have been and i was left with one or two unanswered questions but thea was such a wonderful character her voice rang true and i loved following her through a defining period in her life that's what i'll remember about the yonahlossee riding camp for girls","322":"this is a good summer read it is a page turner but a little darker and more serious the author does a commendable job of capturing the confusing feelings of teenage sexuality particularly for a teenage girl the author is growing up in the 1930's in a sheltered home and it is interesting to see how she learns about her own sexuality and how her family reacts to her scandal although the character makes mistakes she shows a great deal of strength and independence","323":" i chose this book after coming upon it at the library it was shelved as a librarian recommendation i read a few paragraphs and trusted that i would enjoy the book and i did i like the way she writes i was disappointed in how sad it was true joy never occurred there was always underlying bitterness maybe it is like that for some people i only know my own life it seems to me that the joy comes and goes there is good and bad and it weaves it's way in and out of our lives in the end this book is too depressing for me still i don't regret reading it","324":"i'll rate it after book club","325":"this was a clever book with a very tight storyline i can't say i'd highly recommend it but i enjoyed it for the most part","326":"quite disappointing none of the characters seemed real mostly very one dimensional not even satisfying as a 'coming of age' story the main character felt selfish and immature the other characters were boring","327":" i read this over two days which i haven't done or been able to do in quite a while it's a very absorbing story the treatment of oh my what could the mysterious tragedy be is a little heavyhanded but it still works to create suspense thea isn't likable exactly but she feels real and familiar i was left a little bit unsatisfied though there are a few writing tics that i found jarring thea's habit of referring to the events taking place from a far future vantage point didn't feel necessary and there was something about the tone that was a touch unbalanced is it lyrical is it straightforward disclafani isn't sure on the whole it is a good book but it feels like it's trying to be a much better book than it is and it's not quite there it's taking itself very seriously and doesn't have the gravitas i'd still recommend it boarding school history horses sex scandal there's a lot here to be interested in","328":"the writing was amazing the story compelling and it was a novel that had me thinking about it long after i had finished my only complaint really is that i never actually liked thea nor did i actually dislike her seems the main character should fall solidly on one side of the camp or the other","329":"although you could usually predict what was going to happen i did like the book somewhat dreamy at times not bad for a new author","330":" at the epicenter of a family scandal thea atwell is fifteen when her family sends her away to yonahlossee more than a camp however yonahlossee is a boarding school for southern belles debutantes and it's quite an eye opener for thea who has only ever lived on her family's citrus farm at first thea misses her twin brother and her old life but she soon adapts to her new home - taking pleasure in her new friends and her passion for riding thea has learned very little from her mistakes however and she continues to do as she pleases - wanting what she wants despite the consequences of her desires and so she enters into an affair with her headmaster which can only end badly for someone this book left me frustrated and depressed it was not at all what i had expected and i had been looking forward to it boarding school horses debutantes seemed like a winning combination to me although it doesn't have an omniscient viewpoint readers will be able to guess that things aren't going to go well for the characters oh if she hadn't done that oh if people hadn't responded to it that way things could have been so different i am not a fan of unhealthy doomed relationships and tragedy - and this had both it takes a young girl just discovering herself and her power and cuts her down punishes her it reminded me of curtis sittenfeld's \"prep \" which i disliked for similar reasons","331":"i didn't love this coming of age story about a girl coming into her sexuality and learning the hard way that decisions even those of a 15 year old have consequences i can't quite put my finger on why i didn't like it","332":"overall very enjoyable more like 3 1 2 stars i did find the build up of the scandalous past was a bit too drawn out given that most of the events weren't really a big surprise the real strength of the story was the sense of place and time that the author created the descriptions of the riding camp and the relationships between the girls are what kept making me want to read more","333":"too much inner dialogue from a not particularly interesting teenager read about two thirds and skimmed the rest","334":"thea has been sent away it's a punishment removed from her family she loves so much and made to live amongst strangers she has never known people outside her family but she knows she deserves her punishment she must leave her beloved sasi behind but at least she will be riding for she has been sent to yonahlosse a summer equestrian respite educating young ladies since 1902 set in 1920s america the novel spans a time of in betweens not only is thea at that awkward age between child and adult but it is also a time where women's roles and rights were changing social rules were shifting and of course the start of the great depression where the once rich have to deal with being the new poor thea has lived a very sheltered life and somehow that manages to continue despite the rest of the world falling into chaos she comes across as a bit distant she's one of those characters who you won't exactly like as a person but it all fits with everything you learn about her and her upbringing i have never quite grown out of horse books and being a pony mad girl growing up i would have killed to have been sent away to riding camp long term anton is careful to explain some things that would seem obvious to those who know horses so a lack of knowledge wouldn't get in the way of enjoying yonahlossee however i do know some people just don't like horses and well they do play a big enough role to get annoying if you're that way inclined it's not really about the horses though it's about a girl who is cushioned throughout life and the resulting consequences i did think at the start that i knew what her secret was and whilst i may have been partly right each dip into the past reveals something new and my prediction changed repeatedly it's fairly slow paced but enough information is drip fed at the right moments to keep the intrigue going i loved the setting both in time and the secluded ranch in north carolina i have seen some people recommending this for fans of the great gatsby but in all honestly i enjoyed yonahlossee a whole lot more","335":"i would actually give this a 3 5 rating i thought it started off slow and made too big a deal of referring to the incident that got the main character sent away for the first chunk such a big deal that it seemed way overblown i did like that the characters seemed richer and the plot became more layered as it progressed second half after the revealing if the incident was much stronger in my opinion","336":"a wonderfully written coming of age story thea a 15 year old from a wealthy florida family at the start of the great depression is sent away from her home and her twin because she did something that rips the family apart she learns that loving to live and being herself regardless of the consequences is both the most difficult and the easiest thing to both be and do","337":"this was a pretty good book the first 3 4 were engaging and interesting because i was waiting for the mystery to be unraveled but once it was the book became rather boring and very melancholy and as a side note i have never read the word penis so many times in a book seriously","338":"it became horribly tedious in the middle i actually finished this awhile back so i'm iffy on character names but the mystery surrounding why the main girl was sent to camp was not a good mystery the ending was also flat it wasn't terrible but it wasn't good either","339":" this was described to me as a depression era dirty dancing which i saw in the genteel camp setting and the conundrum of how to be a right girl it's a quick read and i enjoyed it but it suffers from a lot of inconsistencies the narrative wanders all over the place and thea behaves inexplicably because her character isn't well developed the book captures adolescent despair particularly well though and really brings back the lack of agency that makes being young so awful for that reason the book has a strong emotional appeal but also doesn't make a whole lot of sense the central plot mystery is also obvious from the start and older than the hills but the combination of southern social hierarchy and equestrienne manners makes the book more strange and interesting than it could be","340":"yikes there are some serious haters of this book i would encourage those who hated thea to think a little more about what this book has to say about female sexuality and try to find some empathy for her","341":" i started this book thinking it was a story about riding camp in the south in the 1930s soon enough i found out that it was something else entirely it was about growing up sexual awakening way back when separating from one's parents and all within the background of the depression while with this realization it felt a bit light it soon revealed itself to be a lot deeper sharing the perspective of the main character as she experienced a painful but exciting period in her life i would recommend it as a good solid book conception wise and a very good read","342":"good book good story author seemed to really wanted to keep the reader guessing and at one point it just got annoying the end would've been nice if the author would've given more details of how life turned out","343":" i enjoyed this 3 and 1 2 star book as a mystery and as a coming of age sexual awakening story told by a female protagonist rare in my experience the plot started out as key to the story but diminished as key information was meted out throughout the book told as is it all in the first person as we grew to know the narrator more and more elements of the book were revealed gaining in importance i look forward to reading more books from this new author who knows how to spin a tale i enjoyed the setting both time and place and would like to revisit the south through the author's eyes in another book","344":"while i very much enjoyed the theme of self actualization there was an air of implausibility hanging over the novel's action that i found distracting","345":"i struggled to get through this","346":"both lyrical and tragic the reason for thea's exile is spread throughout the book which i liked rather a big reveal at the end favoritre quote our lives are unimaginable to us","347":" i liked this sort of against my will i'm not a horse loving girl and the pacing of the book the flashbacks and whatnot was a little annoying to me i felt like reading some of the chapters was like wading through the steamy hot florida weather disclafani describes which i respect as a way of making me feel more in tune with the story overall a solid read with some beautiful parts and some disturbing parts a good coming of age story with an overtone of dirty little secrets and familial strife there was a defined ending though and that's more than i can say for half the books i read these days","348":"didn't live up to what i expected from nyt book review thought there would be a bit more intersection of southern culture depression era experience but these were handled lightly and pretty invisible basically a good beach read type novel took me two days to finish","349":"overrated hype proceeding book made me want to read but when i started it i felt it took too long to get to the reason main character was sent ot the camp then that reason wasn't what i was expecting","350":"the beginning of anton disclafani's debut novel sees thea atwell fifteen year old floridian arrive at the yonahlossee riding camp for girls in north carolina towards the end of the 1920s run by a mr and mrs holmes this is \"a place for young women to learn how to become ladies\" it is certainly a dramatic change of environment and lifestyle for thea - not least when she discovers that rather than the summer of riding she had anticipated her parents have actually sent her to yonahlossee for a whole year thea offers to teach the holmes children how to ride not just as a good turn but also because she wants to get close to mr holmes the chronicle of thea's time at yonahlossee runs in parallel with that of the tragic event at home which led to her being sent to the camp disclafani evokes the social maze of life at yonahlosee well particularly effective is her use of riding as a metaphor for thea's passage through the year when she leaves her pony behind in florida she is in a sense leaving behind her childhood friendships at yonahlossee are cemented and social progress marked through horse riding the novel's handling of thea's key relationships seems less sure footed however her attraction to mr holmes - and especially his reciprocation of it - don't seem to me to be established well enough to earn their eventual pay off i have similar reservations about the florida set storyline though to a lesser extent thea's friendships at yonahlossee are nicely done but the emotions that move the novel forward are not quite as powerful as they might be","351":"i was disturbed through a majority of this novel and found it difficult to like thea","352":"this is probably a 3 5 but it was much better than i was expecting after reading reviews on goodreads the main character's likeability aside i loved the descriptions of florida the camp the horses and the other girls it could have had a better plot with a more genuine protagonist but it was an interesting read","353":"loved it didn't want it to end","354":"this review has been hidden because it contains spoilers to view it click here i had a hart time putting this book down once i got into it that doesn't mean it didn't frustrate me but i wanted to know what thea had done to deserve being sent away and dumped by her parents and once it became known that she had an incestuous relationship with her cousin shame on her naive parents really i understand they were distracted by the depression coming on but her mother found her in bed with her 17 year old cousin i would have thought she would have paid attention or ta i had a hart time putting this book down once i got into it that doesn't mean it didn't frustrate me but i wanted to know what thea had done to deserve being sent away and dumped by her parents and once it became known that she had an incestuous relationship with her cousin shame on her naive parents really i understand they were distracted by the depression coming on but her mother found her in bed with her 17 year old cousin i would have thought she would have paid attention or talked to her daughter that being said thea took no responsibility for what happened she whined a lot and lusted after her headmaster that part of the book was creepy to me but i loved the relationships she developed with the girls she met and i wanted to be at the camp with them i have thought about the story a lot so i am glad i read it more","355":"it's growing on me the longer and longer i sit with it","356":"this book was a tough one for me to get through easy to want to read but tough to plug through i loved her style of writing but her writing topic besides the horses was awful i loved the mystery and suspense of waiting for the big occurrence of what happened to unfold but i knew i'd be sick over what happened and i kind of was this girl is a girl who doesn't have any sense of what is right or wrong inside she knows what people expect of her but she doesn't really care enough to stop herself it drove me insane i would love to read something else this author has written perhaps but i don't know if i can recommend this book","357":"not a feel good book hated the character's judgment yet wanted to finish and know the ending","358":" the yonahlossee riding camp for girls tells the story of thea atwell who has been sent from her home in florida at the age of 15 to the riding camp by her family the camp is located in the blue ridge mountains and far from thea's home both in distance and comfort levels the era is 1930's and many families are suffering from the great depression thea's father is a doctor and her mother's family's orange orchards have kept them financially stable thea has a twin brother and spends her days with him as well as her horse the twins are very sheltered and rarely are around other children except for their first cousin georgie the story is told from thea's perspective reflecting back to her time at the camp and the incident that led to her being sent there the camp teaches the girls to be ladies and also teaches them how to ride and show horses for thea that was the easy part as she has a great love and talent for riding horses throughout thea's time at camp we are also introduced to many characters including other girls and staff at the camp thea begins to truly love the structure and relies on her friendships at the camp what is difficult for her is the knowledge that she did a bad thing and being away from her twin brother the bad thing has repercussions not only for thea and her family but another family as well will the riding camp be able to help thea become a lady as well as help her forgive herself our book club won this book through the putnum and riverhead book club community i was really excited to read this book as it has been receiving a lot of press and i had been seeing excellent reviews for it unfortunately i think i am in the minority here but this book didn't resonate with me or my fellow book clubbers even though you can probably guess the bad thing thea did to get sent away you don't find out the whole story until over half way through the novel this bad thing is mentioned over and over again and is part of the reason you are interested in turning the pages but after a bit i was tired of hearing about the bad thing and just wanted to know what it was even though my guess was correct there was another twist to that part of the story that i wasn't expecting since the book was set in 1930's and is one of my favorite eras to read about i was really hoping for more of a historical account of the time instead the story was more about thea's relationship with her family and with the girls at the camp i appreciated the creativity the author used in developing the characters in the story each of the girls at the camp entertained me with their unique personalities i think we can all think of a sissy or a mary abbott or a leona in our lives thea's character told the story and at times you wished you could ask or get the perspective from others we watch thea grow up and make choices that are continually frustrating and made you want to strangle her i found it interesting that even in 1930's america the choices she made couldn't be controlled by her parents and there was no television texting or social media to blame i guess i was mostly disappointed in this book because it wasn't at all what i expected it to be i was surprised by the graphic details and frankly i didn't care much for thea i was continually angry with thea's selfish behaviors and didn't like where the story was going i was left with disappointment after finishing this novel","359":"this got rave reviews so i was excited by my god i don't have to love a main character but i didn't understand her at all i cant even remember her name she was shallow immature and i never understood her motivations also this book was billed as sexy no just no","360":"this is one terribly dull book that is not helped by the attempts to shock and disgust by the author yes i stole this from another reviewer it just said it so perfectly","361":"this book is magical intense and deeply disturbing it begins as a captivating story from another era and spirals into something much more complicated it is a gorgeously written but searingly painful story of power abuse betrayal and loss read it forewarned","362":" i had really looked forward to reading this book which touches on so many subjects that fascinate me the depression horses all girl boarding schools the reviews made me very hopeful another amy and isabelle something donna tarttish or francine prose ish but after 135 pages i decided i wasn't going to slog through it according to my usual compulsive masochist habit and i would be better off reading a book i actually enjoy or that teaches me something once i decided i was going to return this to the library i skipped to the end just as i suspected the supposedly suspenseful plot worked out exactly the way i had predicted it would disclafani's writing is certainly competent but the sentences aren't especially beautiful not enough to sustain my interest anyway and the characters lacked verisimilitude and depth i neither liked nor disliked the heroine although at times i found her intensely irritating it is very rare for me to begin a book and not finish it but i think i gave this one a fair chance","363":"i really enjoyed this book it`s back in the 30`s and about a 15 girl who makes some serious mistakes and is sent away from her secluded home in fl to live in n carolina at the yonahlossee riding camp","364":"it was ok the place descriptions of both florida and north carolina were very evocative","365":"the four stars here are actually 4 5 i can't quite give it the whole five because the main character seemed to get off a little easy for my tastes the setting was gorgeous the characters fascinating and the backwards and forwards in time worked perfectly highly recommend","366":"3 5 stars i really loved the first half of this book but then i felt let down by the big secret that took so long to come out enjoyed the time period and the camp boarding school setting","367":" i realize this story was supposed to take place during the depression in a time when young girls were protected and expected to grow up into empty headed young ladies the story is shocking for its day and age but it dribbled along because the main character's perspective was annoying to me were teenage girls really that stupid in 1929 thea a nickname for theodora was overly melodramatic about everything a teenager's point of view about me me me and it got bogged down with how she felt about all that happened to her and her big but not so big secretc mistake thea appears to know more about riding than she does about her family and even feels closer to her horse s than her parents","368":"another boring book i thought this would be much better than it was but it was so slow it was like the characters were moving in slow motion","369":"i had a hard time liking the main character maybe we aren't supposed to like her but i couldn't even work up much empathy for her and she wasn't the kind of character you love to hate which made it hard for me to really like this book","370":"i am still thinking about this book which i read a few weeks ago this is the story of thea age 15 and the year she spends at a boarding school for girls the setting is in the mountains of north carolina in 1930 thea loves riding horses and soon bonds with a horse and with many of the other girls we know that thea has displeased her parents enough to be sent away and thea is quite sad to leave her home that she loves and her twin brother sam and beloved horse sasi through flashbacks we are privy to the events leading up to thea's coming to the school i did feel the sexual descriptions were a bit much and this would have been a 5 star book if these had been edited but still this book has wonderful prose interesting characters and a great plot","371":"i just finished this i thought it was a good summer read a little scandalous a little mysterious quick and light","372":"this book was easy to read and moved quickly that being said i didn't like this book because the main character thea is completely unlikeable she is arrogant and unsympathetic i also found that the end of this book just dragged on and on so overall i feel 'meh' about this whole book","373":"it started really well and i thought it was a great story half way through it just got dragged out too much i anticipated the big reveal and it was anticlimatic at best the first half of the book was really good though","374":"reading this book is like watching a train knowing it's going to crash but waiting waiting waiting for it to happen i couldn't put it down","375":"thea is cruel to animals indifferent to the pain of others ignorant of consequences and unaware of the world she lives in and those are her good qualities","376":" it doesn't need a spoiler alert it's clear from the beginning that 15 year old thea a privileged florida girl has been sent off to the yonahlossee riding camp for girls aka a boarding school for a sexual indiscretion that her parents considered worthy of banishment what baffles the reader me at least is why she is the only one being blamed the time is 1931 the great depression is beginning to be felt even among the wealthy families able to send their daughters to riding camp and the moral code is as oppressive as the financial climate i see many reviewers thought of thea as a spoiled whiny brat i didn't i thought she was brave and more sinned against than sinner it made a good coming of age story had i known more about horses i probably would have enjoyed the book more","377":"loved this book there was a twist that i did not expect","378":"this is a coming of age story set in the late 1920's the main character thea is banished to a boarding school after a family tragedy thea is hard to like yet you are sympathetic to her the writing is very sharp and you are pulled into this story my criticism is that i had trouble understanding the family dynamics and the reasons for their actions it was so vague the character development could have been better but inspire of that i found this to be a memorable story","379":"while it started off rocky this book came together in a thoughtful and melancholic way coming of age novels are often triumphant this one is of the more realistic variety things happen i particularly enjoyed seeing a side of the great depression not frequently explored in literature the skittish lives of those not quite rich enough to insulate themselves completely from the ravages of the economy","380":"this is a a novel written by someone with a lot to work out i kept reading it as it was a bit of a tease but the content was too disturbing to believe i do not recommend it at all the 2 stars are for the writing which was great","381":"a well written and fairly sensual coming of age story set in the great depression but a world away from it interesting glimpse into the impact of socioeconomic and social isolationism","382":" 3 5 i liked parts of this book and the setting but other parts really disturbed me not so much the main character's choices but when i felt she acted out of character i did like the variations of personalities among the girls at camp i felt most of them were very realistic and the setting during the depression was also important these girls were hidden away in their bubble yet the long reaches of the depression still managed to touch several of them overall a good read but not quite what i had anticipated","383":" i was disappointed by this novel the events which led to thea atwell being sent away from her home to yonahlossee that are gradually revealed over the course of the novel are wholly predictable and do not have the shock value i suspect the author intended the scandalous love story mentioned in the back cover blurb is equally as predictable and constitutes statutory rape by modern standards the characters with the possible exceptions of thea and sam felt flat to me especially the girls at yonahlossee who should have had so much potential i think that had the characters been more rounded i would've felt more strongly about the plot finally i was so so disappointed by some of the depictions of horses in the novel some of the riding techniques described are just plain wrong pinching with your knees or outright cruel and i think unnecessarily so worse perhaps is the repeated implications that horses are merely dumb animals i expected more from an author who according to the biographical note on my copy of the novel competed horses nationally","384":"wish i could divide the book into thirds would give the first two thirds 5 stars and the last one third 2 stars started out great and could not put the book down ended with me wanting to shake some sense into several of the characters and wanting to skip to the last pages to find how it ends last third of the book erased all the promise of the beginning","385":"thoroughly enjoyed it as something different to read for a change lots to talk about for book club","386":"most people really seem to hate the main character of this book i'm not sure i'd go quite that far since the circumstances of her downfall upbringing are so bizarre truthfully i blame her parents for most of the bad decisions she made","387":"life for twins thea and sam was nearly idyllic in their south florida home they were home schooled and thea spent hours on her pony they often interacted with their older cousin georgie however when thea and georgie began to feel a sexual attraction it caused trouble in the family and thea was sent away to a horseback riding academy most of the book takes place at the camp an engaging novel with strong characters and an understanding of horses","388":"this book just didn't do it for me the protagonist was flat and too self loathing for me to like her when i started reading this book i thought it had great potential but i finished it feel unsatisfied","389":" what a travesty that this book has such a low rating yonahlossee is engrossing from page one to the end the characters are engaging in their naivete even if one does not agree with our thea anton is a master at making us root for her and leads us to understand why thea would make the decisions she makes as well as why we should be okay with it what would appear as a ya story set at a boarding school is anything but the story is erotic and mature tender and heartbreaking in short anton's writing is flawless her turn of phrase beautiful yonahlossee kept my interest even after having to put it down for two months i could not stop thinking about it anton is a writer i hope to see around for a very long time","390":"a quite tedious book full of characters that i couldn't even work up the energy to dislike even the time period the book took place in 1930s doesn't come alive the way it should i finished this because i kept thinking something would happen but nothing much ever did only recommended for fans of the sexual awakening of a teenaged girl plots and then only with reservations","391":" solid not special i enjoyed reading it but kept waiting for something the back and forth narrative worked but i wanted to see more growth at yonahlossee thea talks in the beginning about how the school was transformative for her by making friends with people she barely liked by a romance that felt inauthentic at best and creepy at worst still she's an interesting character and it has a nice language to it the horses are background but beautiful background sam and leona both were interesting enough to get more substance some missed opportunities for sure","392":"really enjoyed this book tragic tale","393":" this is the story of a naughty girl shunned by her family and punished by being sent to a very priviledged equestrian camp and boarding school during the great depression the depiction of this full service camp complete with maids for every cabin starched and pressed perfectly primmed white uniforms at a riding camp turn down service and glorious iced tea was enough to make me drool to say nothing of the beautiful horses the backdrop of the north carolina mountains and the very handsome headmaster most of the story takes place at the camp with flashbacks throughout filling you in on why theadora was sent there problem is while the reasons why she was sent away was surely meant to be central to the story i didn't really care for me it was all about the description of this camp and the girls there which provided all of the necessary drama the family story was just accessory a nice read with plenty of coming of age steamy bits","394":"i was entertained but not enthralled thea is whiny and selfish while i disliked her character i needed to know what happened will keep you entertained","395":"the only thing stopping me from giving this book a one star rating which is the literary equivalent of reading the side of a box of cereal is that the writing itself was not awful unfortunately everything else was i don't have to love the characters in a novel to enjoy and appreciate a book although it helps but i have to at least understand them the narrative of this book was like taking a walk through the mind of someone with multiple personality disorder and not in a good way","396":" this novel by author anton disclafani is utterly consuming one almost has to physically extract oneself from the story if reading through the entire text in one sitting isn't an option dangerous and suspenseful and compelling \"the yonahlossee riding camp for girls\" is a heartbreakingly coming of age story that will undoubtedly resonate with every woman who has traversed the unfamiliar landscape of growing from girl into womanhood the year is 1930 and the united states--particularly the south--is deeply entrenched in the great depression it seems that no one even the most affluent of america's elite is immune from the economic depression of the era our protagonist is the fifteen year old thea atwell who has been effectively banished to the yonahlossee riding camp under tragic familial circumstances--inspired by a sequence of events that thea herself played a pivotal role in disclafani reveals thea's whole story gradually tantalizingly fluctuating between thea's two separate worlds the riding camp in north carolina and her home in the remote orange groves of florida the girls of yonahlossee are far enough removed from the real world--high in the blue ridge mountains--that the troubles that plague their families back home often take a backseat to their personal longings boys sex popularity gossip and horses what no one is immune to is the fact that every decision they make at home or away has the capacity to alter their already tenuous young lives forever as thea grapples with her feelings of blame and shame over her role in the tragedy that has resulted in her exile to yonahlossee she only finds herself in increasingly dire straits readers will grow with thea throughout her story--loving her at times and hating her at others and ultimately wondering if the inevitable ending of her story is satisfying and just or simply representative of a life tainted by inescapable tragedy perhaps it's both","397":" yonahlossee riding camp for girls is where thea atwell's privileged parents send her after she her twin brother sam and their cousin georgie are involved in scandal details of the scandal are hinted at red herring ed around and ultimately underwhelm what is meant to be an interesting look at the impact of the great depression on the daughters of the erstwhile rich read to me as if an mtv reality celebutard had somehow been transported to 1930 i realize hedonism is nothing new but the porn here just seemed forced and pointless there were no higher selves here just indulgence of baser instincts and with no lessons learned or retribution i like curtis sittenfeld's writing a lot it's satirical and smart and she gave this book high praise so i read it but the only similarity between the two authors i can discern is their gender obfuscating first names","398":"the first 50 pages were great and totally drew me in i really liked the author's writing style and the flow of the book then slowly i realized how much i disliked the main character as they mystery of what lead her to end up at the riding camp was slowly revealed i liked her less and less then the last 3 4 of the book just made me feel gross i finished it but overall really didn't care for it sad","399":" ms disclafani's depression era coming of age but evidently too ahem adult for ya novel is a delightful read despite its low gr cume lots of dnf and i couldn't stand the main character reviews and a curious dearth of male reviewers helped sway me to give it a try the titular yonahlossee riding camp for girls is a boarding school horse riding retreat situated in the appalachian mountains of north carolina attended mostly by southern girls of privilege to transform them into prim and proper ladies our reviled protagonist narrator 15 year old thea atwell daughter of a well to do rural florida doctor and his wife is sent to the camp for an at first undisclosed reason we find out in flash backs exactly why here's where i depart from the consensus opinion of many fellow goodreaders although the likability of a novel's character s shouldn't be the defining factor of the book's merit i contend that thea despite her haughty sometimes whiny demeanor is indeed likable at least in the context of her situation she and her twin brother sam are virtually marooned on a metaphorical island in florida in a childhood cut off from normal interaction with peers thea's world of naivete drives the narrative makes her voyage of self discovery shimmer and resonate she can't help who she is but she in her limited world view is hell bent to determine how she'll turn out it's the lazy reader reviewer that would dismiss thea's actions or ms disclafani's novel for that matter as unlikable for thea is simply a product of her environment just for the record though i haven't felt so pervy reading and liking a book since reading and liking nicholson baker's homage to porndom house of holes let's just say while the yonahlossee riding camp for girls is not exactly a salacious bodice ripper it's at times cough pretty um spicy be forewarned","400":" at first i thought this was a young adult book because the main character is 15 then 16 throughout the book after reading i put this book in the adult category because of the complex family relationships really this book is not about thea the teenager but her family and the result of her mother's experiences before marriage thea is kept isolated and protected and has no where to experience normal developmental stages except with her family layer upon layer of family dynamics keeps the plot moving the story is told as a woman's memory with two time lines this sounds confusing but this is a skillful author i am excited for her next novel","401":" set in the 1930s the main character is a teenage girl thea who has shamed her family and is sent away to a girl's riding camp this story begins slowly and continues it has the hope of a trip with an interesting premise and characters but it never arrives the characters are on the surface prim proper and clearly have issues however we never get fully engaged and don't care to because while the writing is elegant in spots and others too many sentences beginning with 'but' the characters are uninspired the sex scenes between thea and the headmaster are static probably because of the age difference overall there is a feeling of uneasiness or taboo which never quite lifts and how could it","402":"hmm i kept reading because i wanted to find out what happened but i could never quite decide what the intention of the author was mainly if it was supposed to be seen as a lighter coming of age story or something darker because there were some sort of unsettling parts","403":"i didnt care for the book","404":"i wanted to like this book more than i did but i didn't like the main character at all","405":"i don't understand the hype about this book it was very boring and all of the characters were unlikable i was at first intrigued by the secret but i was very disappointed by the end i slogged through it because i like to finish books no matter what ugh should have skipped it","406":"this one just wasn't for me i wanted to like it her writing is exquisite but i did not find the protagonist appealing and for me that makes a book a tough sell i did finish the book but i can't say that i enjoyed it","407":"this was an ok book it had some disturbing aspects and was a little predictable but i still enjoyed reading it","408":"this seemed like it was going to be a very interesting read at first but the book's secret was fairly obvious from the beginning there wasn't a single character who didn't behave in exactly the way i would have expected them to bland and forgettable the only thing that saves it is that disclafani clearly has a talent with words but without a compelling story and characters it's not quite enough","409":"this was very well written and in such a way that i couldn't put it down because i wanted to know the infraction this young girl had committed it slowly unveils itself throughout really enjoyed this","410":"easy to read not sure i'm a better person after reading it it has some interesting playing with time and memory but it was a little like reading a soap opera","411":"actually pretty good could have been 4 stars almost little too much teenage angst and drama but very interesting look into how restrictive and depressing womens lives were back in the 1930's and how quickly devastating the depression was to even the richest people","412":"while it wasn't exactly fluff and i checked it out because dottie promised it was not it was just ok coming of age rich girls horses what set this book apart was the way the author doled out the juicy bits very sparingly so that the big picture didn't really come together until close to the end","413":"surprise this book is good i picked this audiobook out from the library just so i'd have something to listen to while commuting and as it turns out i found it to be quite good i noticed that several other reviews had mentioned that thea seemed like an immature whiner but the audiobook did not come across that way in the slightest you don't even have to like horses to enjoy this story i'm not sure i could recommend this to a teen maybe 17 or older but not younger due to the nature of the sex which i don't want to get in to as to not ruin it for anyone i love stories that take place during the 30's therefore i may pre dis positioned to like it i think it deserves 4 5 stars","414":"a nicely written coming of age story i found thea really likable loved the theme of wanting desire the end got a little vague could have been wrapped up more tightly but i could mostly forgive that","415":"foreshadowing that became tedious not particularly well drawn or sympathetic characters unfortunately predictable events simply didn't work for me","416":"wouldn't necessarily recommend this book to anyone i liked how initially you were kept in the dark about why young thea was sent away from her family to a boarding school in va once the reason was revealed and the incident was described i lost interest in the book also did not like the storyline about 16 year old thea becoming involved with adult teacher at the school","417":"the reviews were very good and i looked forward to reading this novel the writing was fine but the story wasn't told well the characters weren't realistic and the main character thea atwell was self centered and dishonest in her relationships not recommended","418":"a girl from florida is sent away to a riding camp boarding school in disgrace","419":"what a strange reading experience there were so many flaws inconsistent main character underdeveloped minor characters uneven pacing and i didn't feel emotionally invested yet i read it in one sitting and quite enjoyed it some of the writing is very good there's a nice sense of place and i even liked the horse stuff i had a difficult time understanding the main character thea her punishment for misbehaving is being sent from her florida home to a lovely camp for girls where she gets to ride all day something she loves to do the food is great there are servants and indoor plumbing and this is during the depression nobody bullies her many want to be her friend frankly it sounds like a wonderful experience but thea is mopey and wants to go home which makes no sense because things are awful there one thing that really stood out for me was the frank depiction of sexual desire in all the ya novels i grew up with girls who had sex did it because they were horribly damaged had daddy issues wanted to keep their boyfriends were mentally ill basically for all kinds of reasons except for enjoying it here teenage girls are accurately portrayed as total horn dogs who will jump your bones if you let them i loved that it gets thea in trouble and some reviewers seem to find her actions despicable requiring punishment i found them perfectly reasonable and was glad there was no shaming and pearl clutching plenty of adults have a hard time keeping their pants on no wonder teenagers don't make level headed decisions when in the midst of a sexual awakening so three stars for that alone","420":" i just feel so bad for thea she has to take on all the responsibility for the act that put her into the riding camp she is sent away from florida by her mother who by keeping her family in isolation contributed to the act at the riding camp in north carolina there is no counselor to help thea deal with her guilt and emotions there's only snobby rich girls and horses but finally thea has a chance to interact with others i think the book points out the down size of homeschooling and what happens to those raised without the shared experiences of others the juxtaposition of the telling of the story that lead her to her stay interment is a better word and the story of her stay at the riding camp is masterfully done many people will be put off by the down right uncomfortable nature of the act but you have to remember the time it's the very start of the depression the isolation of the children and the predatory nature of some people all make it very possible and realistic","421":"i liked the first half of this but ultimately it didn't really go anywhere most of the characters felt like barely drawn sketches and the secrets revealed were neither interesting or surprising","422":"enjoyed the character development","423":"very odd little book","424":"great depression and mountains of north carolina my favorite kind of setting i really liked the book but i didn't ultimately like the protagonist which is always awkward","425":" i'd actually give this 3 5 stars if i could for the most part it kept me engaged wanting to get the rest of the story particularly in the first part when it kept talking about the incident that caused the main character's family to send her away i was very interested in finding out what happened the main character thea isn't a very sympathetic character so it is hard to like her much but i liked the storylines of the girls at the camp and how she related to them not the deepest book i've ever read but entertaining","426":"i only finished this book because i wanted to unravel the very minimal mystery that was the central conflict of the book the characters were hard to keep track of and the plot was tiresome","427":"i was disappointed i didn't really like the main character and thought the big family tragedy was just weird","428":"have i ever mentioned i hate books where nothing actually happens","429":"not sure i would call a book sexy when it's really about a young woman being taken advantage of skimmed it hoping she is redeemed she's not","430":"i really enjoyed this story it was quick to read and hard to put down set during the great depression the story gave insight into life as a young woman during that time through the experience of one girl who was sent away by her family would be a good discussion for book club","431":"not worth the time the author of this book was trying really hard to imbue each sentence with meaning and subtext ultimately i didn't care what thea's shameful secret was","432":"slow start but kept me interested last part don't want to spoil but was disturbing","433":"very predictable plot","434":"not an easy read but worth the time","435":"on the plus side it's very well written i might have been raving about how wonderful it is if it had been 100 pages shorter and if the main characters thea and her parents had evidenced more depth and complexity","436":"the yonahlossee riding camp for girls - anton disclafanii absolutely loved this book but don't ask me why in many places it wasn't well written i read some sentences several times and they still didn't make sense maybe it's the remaining child in me rising to the surface i remember after reading enid blyton's st clare's series beseeching my parents to send me away to boarding school but is this just a boarding school story no some may say it's a coming of age novel others a love story but for me it was the tale of an individual shedding the layers of childhood to womanhood in such a vulnerable sore way of questioning decorum attitudes and conventions and simply making choices to do or not do the right thing i'm always a sucker for a debut novel i find the anticipation and the possibility of a future genius completely beguiling and real readers have frequently given me that opportunity books i wouldn't have selected from choice however this one is different the title alone piqued my interest this story delighted me it moves along at a perfect pace not so fast that you cannot grasp the essential elements of the narrative but not so slow as to lose your interest the denouement of what thea has actually done wrong was so gradually unwoven and all the time i was thinking it had to be this or that little morsels of clues offered urging you to read on tantalising as thea herself tantalised the characters seemed real flawed as we all are aware of their shortcomings sometimes but powerless to change their intrinsic being and the evocation of the south could this be scarlett o' hara reincarnated i said earlier that i couldn't say why i loved this book i think i've answered myself in this review wonderful story thank you anton disclafani","437":"loved her writing the descriptions made it easy for me to place the scenes and environment as an original floridian i can pretty much say she nailed florida down what i'm not so sure about are some of thea's decisions nor the fact that none of none of the adult figures were strong in character flawed is realistic but weak willed across the board not buying it still i'm interested in reading the other work i hope she puts out","438":" i liked this book less than i thought i would but more than i might've guessed if i had thumbed through it before reading i saw it in an airport bookshop on vacation and put a hold on it at the library when i returned florida native thea a 16 year old girl with a secret is sent away from home after certain events transpire joining the ranks of boarding school girls at the yonahlossee school for girls what i liked most about the book is the way her story unfolds through flashbacks so i won't spoil what those events are here but suffice it to say it made me feel awkward and uncomfortable the more it was described that squirminess is that a word made the book somehow both uncomfortable and intriguing i don't know how to rank this one the writing was really good i loved the setting depression era south but there was just a lot of squickiness and i'm still making up words i don't know exactly what ones to use here","439":"this review has been hidden because it contains spoilers to view it click here i don't know what to say about this book except it was pointless and rambling okay pointless isn't wuiet right but it never goes anywhere it is a contradiction spoiler alert how on earth did such a sheltered girl know about sex orgasms etc it made little sense disappointed","440":" thea is a fifteen year old girl from florida she is growing up in the 1930s in idyllic surroundings as a member of a wealthy family thea loves being in the company of her twin brother and cousin but following a scandal she is involved in her parents send her off to yonahlossee riding camp for girls a summer camp and boarding school for girls from wealthy families thea does not understand why she is being separated from her family and the home she loves she will find herself immersed in a school full of girls from all over america with its own rules and hidden agendas based on status beauty family wealth and equestrienne powers thea will have to deal with her sorrow from being sent away from her home and family her responsibility for the scandal which got her new situation and will learn the effects of the great american depression thea does not relate the full details of the scandal until almost the end of the book but she drops hints all over the story so that we can sympathise with her and understand what she is going through the book has an great start describing remote florida and what life was like in 1930s rural america the trip to yonahlossee is very realistic and you cannot help but feeling for thea and the new world she will have to join the description of the yonahlossee school totally absorbs you into what it was like to be a girl from a wealthy family in the 1930s and the expectations for girls to be made into ladies so that they could marry by the age of twenty one thea is a likeable character but as she gains confidence in her new school she starts to become confident and a bit annoying towards the end she redeems herself and you cannot help but feel sorry for her and sympathise with her feelings this is a bittersweet story about being a teenage girl finding your place in the world and following your heart this is a moving and passionate tale and totally recommended to fans of coming of age stories and americana i'm sure teenage girls will love it and identify with thea in many occasions","441":"a slow trot throughout never reaching a gallop","442":"if i cared more about the main character i would give a higher rating this book did have a great setting 1930's girls riding camp in north carolina as you saw the impact of the depression on a small group of well to do southern families the plot reminded me of we were the mullvaneys in the way a tragedy irreparably tears the fabric of a previously tight family","443":" set in the orange groves of florida and the mountains of north carolina in 1931 the imagery in this book is superb the author especially engages the reader's senses of touch and smell which combine to make the past seem fully present you may have to have a working vocabulary of horses to fully understand all of it but there are exquisite passages of riding and lush gardens and mountains thea as a protagonist is interesting but inconsistent in the early chapters at yonahlossee she was almost childlike but in flashbacks to her life in florida she seemed self possessed sometimes she showed a keen awareness of the rampant poverty in the communities surrounding the school and sometimes she complained that the food was bland she was compelling but perhaps not quite likable but the real reason i can't give the book more stars is pacing the author spends so many pages building suspense about thea's family tragedy that the first half is slow and the riveting second half feels rushed for many many chapters i questioned whether her great secret was that she slept with her twin brother and continued reading only to make sure that wasn't the case i wish it had been better paced because the climaxes of thea's stories both past and present jumble together in an unsatisfying way","444":"i should have stuck to my 50 page limit on books this one went no where one dimensional bratty girls stuck in an equestrian school down south predictable story line and i kept waiting to care about the protagonist waste of time","445":"kind of depressing the young girl's sexual exploits were unrealistic and unbelievable and the whole story was centered around them","446":"i wanted to like this book more i feel like the main character learned nothing i wanted more appeciation of the time period as well","447":"the most boring and predictable book i have ever read","448":"the number of 1 star reviews for this on goodreads surprises me most complaints seem to be of the whiny or selfish narrator but this quality hardly seems one that could illicit such vitriol from readers i am left wondering if it's just the nature of her behavior that colors opinions and if these readers are wrongly attributing the source of their discomfort thea's level of selfishness is found often in narrators especially teen ones and though her behavior is somewhat shocking the more interesting aspect of this story is the environment that leads to her feelings and actions i think dismissing this character as selfish and the plot as empty does a disservice to the author and the quiet portrait she paints on thea's world as influenced by her times and circumstance while many readers seemed to hate thea i pitied her more than anything she was a young woman isolated by her living arrangements and disregarded because of her gender she doesn't need to be liked and i'm not agreeing with or justifying her behavior but i think she deserves more consideration","449":" i saw this as a must read in some magazine and waited patiently for it to come out all of that waiting should have prepared me for trying to get through this incredibly dull book waiting for something to happen i got the book after all that waiting i did not get the point of it after all that reading halfway through struggling to find some point in all these words i decided to peek at the end to see if it was some type of cliffhanger it was not i'm fairly certain the magazine was paid to support that book and that book promotion not word of mouth will be the only thing saving this book","450":"cheers to you anton this was a great book steamy parts i read it in 2 days and when i wasn't reading it i wished i was","451":"quite sad but amazing that a man wrote this in the voice of a 16 year old girl","452":"not for horny teenage girls but then again neither are most movies and television shows there are some wise well rendered observations about human nature and coming of age hidden in the text","453":"set in the midst of the depression at a camp school for daughters of wealthy families this coming of age story follows thea as she deals with being sent away by her family and learns that disappointment works both ways with parents i enjoyed reading this book and look forward to more from this author","454":" at first i thought that this was another story a la the rules of civility written by a man about a saccharinely sexy plucky heroine from a bygone era that was actually a fantastical and unsympathetic character he lusted over in an era he lusted over those stories always make me wonder why the author felt sure enough of themselves to publish the literary equivalent of a very dudely pinterest project and bewildered at the people who see themselves in this flat macrame d milk jug of a character turns out that the author is a woman so there's a little less oh my god this character is fifteen you should be in jail for writing this but there are still far too many adult scenes to make this novel truly outstanding i think it's the general consensus in the lit fic world that these scenes are hard to write well and are admittedly clumsy and inevitably cliched one such scene is to be expected two are whatever three are prep by curtis sittenfeld which i did love but in this book i skimmed over a full 70 awkward pages of euphemism punctuated by the occasional breathy revelation if i thought that was something that added to a story i would be reading a lot more things with fabio on the cover the heroine is infinitely less insufferable than towles's kate perhaps because she has actual flaws the tragic parts of this book were wonderful that sounds terrible to say but they were evocative and insightful even thought provoking that's why i finished the book towles should make a mental note that more imperfections less quirks that magical formula to bring a character to life and transcend masturbatory for relevatory i think the parts of the book that other people found cold unsympathetic and jarring were actually a believable depiction of what it's like to be fifteen fifteen year olds are narcissists they don't know how they feel they feel reckless and immortal they feel deeply insecure i wish this had come across more in the affair with the headmaster which the character who has such little life experience suddenly is able to conduct with the finesse of someone a decade older in my third decade in my life as a reader i find myself becoming tired of the there is a secret hint hint keep reading here is a hint what is it going to be you have to wait till the third quarter of the book to find out formula however this book had enough emotional intelligence to conquer that cliche too and just deal with the actually quite interesting aftermath without having to string readers along there was certainly enough of a plot without having to add that layer of intrigue on top let's write more apples and fewer onions authors of the world please","455":"mmm i didn't really like the main character i found her cold calculating and distant it was written well but it wasn't memorable","456":"this is a book that i had high expectations for based on the premise however due to what seemed like far too much focus on the sexual urges of young thea never quite lived up to it's potential","457":"a well written and somewhat murky coming of age story set just as the depression has hit although i am not one of those girls for whom horses held much charm this did transport me to a different time and place not all that mysterious what led to the protagonist's departure from her family but a quick different read for me","458":"this was a much hyped book before its release while i did enjoy the book it wasn't exactly what i was expecting","459":" i am a lifelong equestrian rider so i thought i'd love this book while i found the setting of the riding camp appealing it was difficult for me to really get into the book because i found the narrator to be pretty darn unlikeable that being said the plot was interesting and the overall theme of the book always pursuing what you want despite who you hurt in the process was something i found relatable so i ended up giving it a 3 star rating i wouldn't tell someone not to read the book but i wouldn't necessarily recommend it to anyone either","460":"loved just loved this book","461":"just finished reading this book for book club the story line was good and you know something happened that made her feel terrible etc... but it seemed to go on for too long enjoyed it tho","462":"proud of myself for finishing this one because i was not a fan of it at all so thea is extremely unpleasant i did not like her at all whether we were in present day with her or she was giving us flashbacks to everything that led up to her being sent away you know frances 'baby' from dirty dancing imagine that character times 10 extremely selfish self centered and boring she wasn't the only unpleasant character either when it all comes down to it her family also was quite awful because actions that they did caused everything that happened maybe that was the point maybe we weren't supposed to like the characters at all if that's the case mission accomplished but the story just wasn't interesting at all i've seen it on countless lists as recommended titles for ya readers that were intended for adult readers and i'm sorry i'm not going to suggest this book to any ya readers just no i also was excited to see it was set near asheville i adore asheville but nope that's it she mentions the blue gray haze maybe once and the mountains twice that's it then there were constant moments where we're told this or told that but we've seen absolutely no evidence of that whatsoever ugh such a chore to read avoid it if you can","463":"i liked this book enough to recommend to others i liked the riding the horses the camp but i often found myself saying wow this girl is not very nice i liked how the author started in the middle of the story and filled in the beginning and end as it went overall i couldn't put it down definitely wanted to find out what and why you will see what i mean if you read it","464":"this review has been hidden because it contains spoilers to view it click here 15 year old thea atwell is sent to the yonahlossee riding camp because of a tragedy in her family the story goes back and forth between the riding camp which turns out to actually be a boarding school and the events leading up

review has been hidden because it contains spoilers to view it click here loaned to sarah a","467":"i thought that the jumping between the two different time periods was a little hard to follow","468":"i liked getting to know thea atwell but my biggest problem with this novel is the strange way that time is treated we spend a year with thea but it didn't feel like a year her friendship with sissy is referred to as a best friend ship but they barely speak to one another thea says that yonahlossee is hers at the end of the novel her memory that she won't share and i got the same feeling from the book itself i got a sliver and it was enough to keep the pages turning but in the end i found the book wanting","469":"i wanted to like this book more than i actually did the main character thea atwall is hard to sympathize with and so i couldn't get into the book","470":"as a beach read i give this a 5 but as a piece of literature it is definitely fluffy the story hangs on slowly unfolding the events that got the narrator sent to the riding camp a plot twist that seems somewhat obvious from the minute the book starts the story moves fast and is a good summer read but the opposite of chewy","471":"this didn't live up to the hype artful concealing of the incident that sent thea to the school and clear writing but not as compelling as i expected","472":"i would say a bit of a disappointment after all the hype i read last year it meandered and the author's writing style was a bit odd leaving me confused at times i believe the sexual awakening part was done well but then thea became somewhat calculated and selfish with the headmaster and that was a turn off to me i also found it odd that thea's brother's character wasn't fleshed out and infact we never heard much from him until the end of the book at first i thought maybe he had some kind of mental or developmental problem or maybe some kind of difficulty communicating but that thea was so close to him she wasn't aware of it the author seemed to be trying to show the weak position women were put in in that era and how thea came into her own and realized she had to take what she wanted in life if she wanted to be truly happy unfortunately she became a somewhat unlikable character with that metamorphosis","473":"i loved this book sexy but sweet totally engrossing made me remember what 'young' felt like sigh","474":"read this because i heard it had been in a bidding war with two publishing houses it was good but maybe not worthy of a publishing house battle bonus is you like and ride horses though","475":" i didn't love this novel nor did i hate it but it did make me think i see the novel as a portrait of the innocent thea coming into womanhood in a privileged yet rather vacantly parented family thea becomes the scapegoat when her innocence is badly abused an unspeakable tragedy occurs and none of the children have a voice to be heard later in the story we learn some rather salacious facts about thea's mother as a young woman and it led me to contemplate the daughter being sacrificed in order for the mother to maintain her current status unsullied by rumours from her past so thea is sent away aching with need away from family into a stratosphere of daughters of the wealthy and learns how to make friends is talented in the equestrian ring and believes that she is a terrible bad person a girl with nothing more to lose i wish that the conclusion had more to say about thea the adult the one with wisdom gained about families people hardship and resilience the darkness which she endured was fully explored her wry assessment from an adult perspective felt just a bit unfinished perhaps i wanted to see thea given a kind of justice for where she had been so wronged and a chance at happiness as a good person","476":" i saw this book on a website that was talking about the must read books of the year and when i read the brief summary it had for the book i added it to my 'to read' list then i had to wait to get it from the library for several weeks and in that time i was shocked to see the overall rating for this book plummeted i saw reviews talking about thea being annoying and whiny and that there was too much horse riding in it i seriously don't know if those people read the same book ok let's address a few things first the book title indicates it's about a riding camp second thea is a 15 year old girl that has led an isolated life that is suddenly in a dorm with other girls as the great depression is starting what did you expect this book is vividly written you can feel the characters and understand them the pieces of the story of why thea has been sent away are slowly revealed which can be frustrating but it is ultimately good writing this book was not what i expected but honestly i liked it it had some history it had some mystery and intrique and it had young love with mistakes and confusion it's not a light fluffy read but worth picking up","477":"while i enjoyed this book a big part of me felt that i was too old for it and would have enjoyed it more in my teenage years i give it 4 stars because the writing was gorgeous and well done","478":"well written but i just wanted this book to end i'm not sure the audiobook reader helped in my dislike of this book the reader didn't have a lot of emotion to her voice and i didn't connect with thea at all i wanted a big blow up or her to get caught in her scandalous affairs with her cousin and the headmaster but it all seemed a bit flat in the end","479":"2013 seemed to be the year to write a book told from the female main character's voice this was the best of the three i've read so far the book was better than i thought but there was something missing i think it's the thea's almost monotone 'voice' she describes having intense emotions but you don't quite believe her","480":"i found this novel very well written i love intensely flawed main characters and this book certainly provided one in thea disclafani developed characters of great complexity and realism the descriptions of the mountains of north carolina and the aggressive lushness of florida paralleled the characters who populated them well done","481":"a book about an exclusive camp where well off girls to go and learn to become ladies takes place during the depression but these teenage girls are removed from real world problems and understandings thea is sent there because of a perceived family disgrace the book is about thea's growth the repercussions of her punishment and the changes one even can have on a family i really enjoyed this book in the beginning was thinking how i was going to recommend it to everyone toward the last 1 3 of the book i started thinking how this book could be so much more explore the sisterhood relationships more the friendships and thea's thinking seems to be superficial i still enjoyed the book but at the end i was left wondering what really was the point maybe a good book discussion will leave me feeling differently but by the end i can only give this an average rating","482":"i read so many positive reviews about this book that i really wanted to love it but i didn't it was well written great descriptions about life in the 1930s and depression era but the main character was too unlikeable even her final gracious act was self motivated my favorite aspect of the book was how the author weaved the what happened in the past with her life at the riding camp","483":"not worth the good reviews it has gotten a week story and adequate but not beautiful writing adds up to wasted time wish i would have skipped this one","484":"splendid a raw emotional sexual coming of age story","485":"this book started off really strong as a classic coming of age story but then turned into a romance which is not so much my thing still i read to the end enjoying the cantors gallops jumps and romps","486":"i love a book that's impossible to put down and riding camp was definitely one of those ending was a bit drawn out but otherwise a perfect read","487":"this was pretty good very well developed protagonist minor characters were pretty interesting too lost of horsey language that i didn't quite get the meaning of but i could still catch the gist and it wasn't relevant to the story line i mean i think not anyway a reasonably good book","488":"i did not enjoy this book i found the characters to be quite unlikable and uninteresting since i didn't connect with the characters i didn't care what happened to them","489":"not many books let me cry this one did bravo would make for a great book club discussion being a girl is hard","490":"a copy of the yonahlossee riding camp for girls was provided to me by riverhead penguin group usa for review purposes the authors childhood fondness for horseback riding sets the scene of this story about teenage angst boarding school drama and a family scandal that changes a girl forever thea atwell has lived with her family on their florida farm since she was born but after a recent scandal her parents have sent her to the yonahlossee riding camp for girls the back story slowly unfurls as her time at camp passes going in to this novel i had already seen many rave reviews for it and that it was also on several summer reading lists it's quoted as being 'lush sexy and evocative' entertainment weekly says ' the lovely descriptions of riding and adolescence have a spellbinding effect ' kirkus reviews called it an unusually accomplished and nuanced coming of age drama suffice it to say i went into this with extremely high expectations my overall opinion this is one terribly dull book that is not helped by the attempts to shock and disgust by the author 100 pages in and it's brought to our attention that 2 months have passed but you could have fooled me considering nothing of consequence had actually occurred but honestly nothing of consequence ever seems to happen the entire book the majority of those 100 introductory pages felt like a whole bunch of inconsequential filler it's also extremely disjointed and lacks a much needed flow there's a dance then they have riding lessons and now it's bath time it's never a full day though so it's difficult to grasp exactly how much time has even passed 'i knew what it was like to love horses but i also knew what it was like to love humans i knew what it was like to want to desire so intensely you were willing to throw everything else into its fire 'lines like that if read without context would make me think this was a fascinating book about a headstrong and passionate girl but the rest of the lines spoke of a girl that wasn't raised around anyone but family and had terrible trouble adapting with suddenly being shipped off to camp thea is a terribly awkward girl that seems extraordinarily confused with life in general and her purpose in it it was not a joyful story to read about the writing was at times extremely well done but as a whole ended up being excessively descriptive and made the story feel long and drawn out this was an extremely lackluster and disjointed story that only managed to keep me interested enough to find out the 'scandal' that caused her to be sent to camp in the first place the shock factor was there however it lacked any significance and essentially ended up being overly superfluous and just left a bad taste in my mouth","491":"this review has been hidden because it contains spoilers to view it click here they call this sexy but any book describing the sexual experiences and fantasies of a girl between ages of 14 16 is not sexy this book had the potential of being good but wasn't","492":"this didn't grab me like i thought it would while i loved the story of the family's unraveling the scenes set at the camp didn't work that well for me logistically it seemed improbable if not impossible 200 girls a horse for each girl and during the depression probably a failure of imagination on my part","493":"i'd give the first half of the book a 4 5 stars it totally held my interest the writing style is unique and interesting the second half of the book i'd give a 3 stars it was getting repetitive and long all in all i'm glad i read it and i'm glad i got it from the library and didn't purchase it","494":"a powerful read loved the relationships the sisterhood that develops between the girls at yonahlossee can't decide if thea is liberated by her passions or ruled by them","495":"might have been 3 5 because it was slow to engage me but ultimately a triumphant coming of age novel disclafani bravely tackles thea's sexual awakening and conflicted nature she is a girl who wants to much in a time when girls are not supposed to want i like how the author writes without judgement there are a number of unsettling relationships but she lets them play out naturally without casting good guys and bad guys surprisingly good for a first time author","496":"you know what i don't like those chapters that kind of sum everything up for us dumb readers you know when we're not smart enough to draw our own conclusions that's how i read the final chapter or two of this one the entire book was beautifully written but the story didn't grab me until i was about halfway through i just found myself frustrated that there was some big secret that everyone knew but me disclafani is great with words but i was feeling left out i wanted to know the secret damn it and she almost made me wait too long to find out i didn't get the feeling that i was being led to the answer i had the feeling she was toying with me instead and i was like fine you don't want to tell me then i don't care then i stuck my tongue out at her","497":"the yonahlossee riding camp for girls tells the tale of thea atwell an adolescent in 1930 sent to a boarding school because of her scandalous role in a family tragedy having lived a privileged but isolated life with only her twin brother and cousin for companions she is forced to navigate the complex social web of wealthy young girls ranked by money beauty and riding ability she approaches both her horseback riding and burgeoning sexuality with a fearlessness and recklessness that destroys the carefully constructed dynamic of the camp i was excited to read this book and i will admit i found it entertaining and easy enough to read on my commute to and from work that being said it wasn't nearly as good as i had hoped for starters i had a difficult time relating to thea some reviewers have called her sociopathic or narcissistic i find those words a bit harsh but she was definitely cold and inconsistent i believe men took advantage of her to an extent but she was also an aggressor who knew how to harness her sexuality as a means of gaining power in the rapidly changing male dominated world she professed to love her twin brother sam but seemed almost mean to him in many of their interactions sam too was inconsistent and his role in the family tragedy seemed out of character and hard to believe the author spent a little too much time building up the event that brought thea to yonahlossee and honestly i didn't really care much what happened by the time he actually came out with it additionally i found thea's liaisons creepy and disturbing which i suppose is what made it so hard to determine whether she was an instigator or a victim initially i had categorized this as a guilty pleasure novel but i found it too cringe worthy for the 'pleasure' part","498":"a disappointing coming of age novel which bounced back and forth from the year at the riding camp and the time that led up to when the main character went to the camp i realize all that happened had an impact on her life but am not sure how much she learned i was somewhat done with the book before the book was done but glad i finished it i read this for a book group and am interested in the upcoming discussion to see what issues come up","499":"mid teens girl experiencing sexual awakening looks for love in all the wrong places literary writing more annoying than literary annoying protagonist and annoying supporting characters glad i got it from the library and didn't spend money to buy it","500":"great story and good summer read","501":"really an interesting premise and anything about horses is good but the main character suffers from poor judgment and doesn't learn at all throughout the book she consistently makes bad decisions and seemingly knows it while she's making them the horse part of the story is good and the interpersonal relationships with teh girls at the school are well written the rest not so much","502":"could've been better takes a weird turn in the middle that tainted the whole book for me","503":"i want to say i really enjoyed this book but i can't quite get there the setting was wonderful u0026amp i was able to visualize the camp the mountains u0026amp the atwell's home in fl to great satisfaction in my mind i had problems with thea u0026amp her family i don't know if i can buy the notion that she was just a confused adolescent if that what the author was really peddling she seemed spoiled u0026amp self indulgent i'm not sure if i really liked any of the characters all that much her mother must have been so involved with her own life that she didn't deal with her children until u0026amp i'm being generous when i credit her for dealing with them at all disaster struck the woman was not stupid just a really lousy mother apparently a spoiled self indulgent person with her own history suffice it to say i finished the book with a bad taste in my mouth i must say though the author did an excellent job of putting me there in the camp i could almost feel the change in seasons in the camp on my skin u0026amp smell the western carolina mountain air","504":"i won this as a goodreads giveaway it was alright i love a good coming to age story definitely a lazy rainy day read i can't say i'd reread it though","505":"this seems to be my summer for reading debut novels from female authors the draw of this model is that it questions desire from the perspective of s sixteen year old girl who believes she has destroyed her family with her out judgement she is essentially exiled and this is the story of her discovering her self awareness and growing from child into womanhood","506":"slow and insular rich white girls served by poor white girls and what's with the trend of making narrators opaque and unlikeable i think it's overrated i suppose what i most admire though is the tangential development of the mother's character although revelations about same seem perfunctory and unearned and the whole childhood as eden sort of thing make no mistake though this is a readers' book summer time reading for the dilettante it is not","507":"if you are looking at this book because you like horses don't bother although there are horses in the story most of the book deals with characters that are totally unlike able some parts of the book are written beautifully but the lack of plot and the ick factor detract from the writing i may have missed the author's point but i found no message or moral in this story","508":" this is a story about a teenage girl sent away to a riding camp for young ladies at the start of the depression after an indiscretion at home thea has led an isolated and privileged life at her family's home in florida seeing very few people beyond her mother father and twin brother with visits to and from her aunt uncle and cousin to be sent away is devastating for her as well as a culture shock although riding remains the constant in her life the full sequence of events leading up to thea's expulsion from the family circle is revealed slowly across the course of the book although the reader guesses some of it earlier when it was finally fully exposed i felt the unfairness of thea's punishment and realized why her family life was never going to be the same i also understood why she'd done some of the things that she had done at the camp which i'd previously found harder to buy into the darkness of the depression hangs over this book as much as the shadow of thea's offences other girls' families are suffering and the numbers at the camp are falling as well as thea's uncle's troubles i really enjoyed parts of this book but found the ending a little unsatisfactory i wanted to know more about where thea ended up i saw a lot of very positive reviews of this and for me it didn't quite live up to the hype but i will keep an eye out for more from this author as i thought it was a very promising debut","509":"i wanted to love this so many elements were right it was kind of a mash up of lolita and the secret history i was hooked for the first 10% but then my interest flagged this is a book that might've been better if the reader never actually learned what the big transgression was as frustrating as that sounds don't get me wrong i love books with school settings that vividly conjure the eras in which they're set this does a good job of that but left me wanting for more not a waste of time by any means the writer can write i'd be curious to see what other people think of it","510":"i was looking forward to reading this after all the reviews but wasn't what i expected i don't want to stop anyone from reading it because they may love it just maybe the wrong timing for me","511":"this was an easy book to read a girl gets sent away to a riding camp after getting i trouble at home","512":"a coming of age story loved the period just before and into the depression keeps you guessing right up to the end of the book","513":"i found thea to be an interesting and compelling character several days after i finished the book i was still thinking about the story and found myself liking it more and more","514":" i wish i could give half stars because i don't feel like this one was a solid 2 it was definitely more of a 2 5 in any case the story had lots of potential but somehow went awry important or interesting details were left out or withheld until later for suspense and failed to create it while other seemingly irrelevant things were described thoroughly i still devoured the book and might have been persuaded to give it a better rating but the rushed and slap dash nature of the last part of the book after the riding competition really irritated me","515":" i thought about what i would rate this book for a long time had i rated it at the 1 2 to 2 3 points i would have given it a definite 2 there was way too long to go to get enough information to actually participate with this book i've read other reviews that were out and out hostile toward it and i can understand why the issues in the book take more consideration than one might think many people called out thea as being selfish and privileged not sure why her mother wasn't called out more directly my take 1 thea as the narrator made it extremely hard to get a good read on the situation she is an overly isolated young girl that hasn't been taught anything about the world her interpretation of things around her are sometimes accurate but most times not she is viewing her world through her filter which we all do but her filter is very uneducated in terms of people etc we only get a real sense of her when others make comments about her behavior she is told she 'lurks' and watches people i can imagine how weird others would think she is she understands she is different and slowly starts to try to correct it later leaving this isolated existence was an act of self preservation 2 thea and sam are raised away from people human interaction that would teach them social skills and are home schooled did anyone else think this was odd no friends coming to the house of either their mother's or their father's only the aunt uncle and cousin so we are living a very secluded lifestyle which thea as our storyteller doesn't even get is odd it's not thea's fault her parents and as we come to learn her mother did this on purpose her mother has social issues that we finally see when they are living in the hotel 3 thea's relationship with her cousin is disturbing but she has had no interactions with humans beyond this family where is she supposed to learn or experiment with the things she is feeling it doesn't seem as though her mother while cloistering her bothered even to warn her or tell her why they were so cloistered 4 her relationship with mr holmes is actually a an attempt at working through what happened with her cousin psychologically she was looking for an emotional replacement for her father and her family her we find out later didn't even hug her after the strategy she is left alone to process it and is even sent away she is a child with no skills to use to even begin to understand while something i don't support at least she found a type of love and caring with mr holmes that helped her see the complete process 5 sam demonstrates the only true rational response to the situation he beats the shit out of his cousin he saw it for what it was and reacted to protect his sister none of the other characters did a single thing that was this brave and appropriate to the situation i don't believe in violence but at least he recognized the situation for what it was and acted on it instead of covering up and hiding","516":"interesting fun read","517":" the good there was some good writing the premise that she and her brother lived in such isolation that she would be so untainted by social conventions and that she could be a bit progressive in her thinking also that she could be so sheltered to not understand real issues in the world the bad there were odd factual errors that grated on me the back and forth between before it happened and the camp were a bit much i really found it very annoying also the cruelty she dished out periodically was off putting it showed how spoiled and unchecked she was overall it would have been better if the character evolved a bit more","518":"it was quite sensual a good read","519":"i love that this book was set during the great depression this definitely wasn't the grapes of wrath but i had a really hard time identifying with the heroine's actions and internal dialogue overall an entertaining read although i was ready for it to be over by the end","520":"this book wasn't quite what i expected but that is certainly not a bad thing first i was intrigued by the central florida setting where we'd recently lived for a few years as well as the camp in blowing rock north carolina where my father is from plus the title pulled me right into the book the journey of the main character thea is remarkable and all at the same time an ordinary view of a young teenager in the great depression the book is provocative not only in its plot matter as thea is the participant in several scandals but is provocative in how it reveals thea's past i like how the author juxtaposed the setting of the great depression against a very prestigious horse camp and then how those two settings clash scandal drama family relationships and a very well written main character will pull you right into the gates of yonahlossee darker than i expected but i didn't put this down for a few nights until i finished it","521":"i loved this book but must admit that i love and have owned horses and this colors my opinion though thea was sent to the riding camp in disgrace by her family she thrived there and found herself followed by old longings the story was paced perfectly but i just wished i'd been sent away to horse camp i'm not sure the story would keep the reader's attention if they didn't care for the horsey backdrop","522":"started out being drawn into this book but the last 1 3 dragged a bit good debut however i hope she continues to write more coming of age novels","523":" i found this book wholly engaging as i was drawn in by wanting to know the mystery behind thea's banishment from her home and family but even before that was revealed i struggled to make it through this book because i could not find a single character that was likable the author did a very good job of articulating the weaknesses and insecurities of the characters but not much of their redeeming qualities which were hinted at enough to know they must've existed but were not expanded on unless it was to further highlight their emotional shortcomings the time period as a backdrop was one i don't usually find in this genre of fiction so that was of interest and helped to carry the storyline","524":"this book really made me sad i kept waiting for an uplifting moment that never came i do think that the author portrayed thea's adolescent sexual awakening and her complicated relationships with her family members in a sensitive and graceful way i just could not get past the gloominess of thea's personality","525":"a compelling coming of age story i felt a personal connection to it because i used to ride horses as a teenager","526":"this is a 2 5 star book for me i generally like books about camp but i found the narrative style of jumping back and then father back into the past jarring i also found some of the scenes gratuitous where there could have been really beautiful passages instead","527":"i want to write about spoilers but i don't think this book even deserves the time to write them out boring stupid criminal white privilege whining this book could be an example of every decision not to make as a teen","528":"i'd give this one 6 stars if i could the whole time i was wanting to know why was she sent to the camp and the reason was no where near what i imagined my daughter goes each summer to a camp in the nc mountains and this book was so realistic i'd highly recommend this book to everyone","529":"i adored this book i was so excited for it that i literally skipped when it arrived at my library it struck a chord within me and i devoured this book on a friday night sitting on my patio as the sun set","530":"this author is amazing she wraps you up in the 1930's world of a young girls horse camp where hundreds of teenagers are coming of age in the era of the depression there are lots of subtle plot lines and suspense and you can practically feel the teenage angst and hormones coming through the pages a must read","531":" i was hesitant to read a book set in the 1930's but my adoration of horses and riding won out i tore through this on july 3 4 2013 thea is a captivating young girl who is growing up in rural florida she is a fraternal twin and her family has money through a series of flashbacks the author slowly reveals the reasons for thea to be sent to a girls riding camp in north carolina the slow reveal paired with the ongoing interaction between thea and the girls at camp kept me turning pages or pressing the next page button thea is a very flawed character whose decisions make her unlike able many times but she is interesting i'm not sure what her motivation was for acting so impulsively beyond the obvious i read an interview with the author who thinks thea would be considered a feminist and i can see flickers of who she becomes as an adult in the last pages does she continue to act so impulsively the author also stated that the time period was essential to the story because he series of events would be handled differently in a post modern world i would love to have a group of high school students read this book and tell me their opinions finally the horse riding portions of the book were true to life and memory stirring","532":"well written nicely styled and it actually felt like the novel was about the story rather than a mystery or an end point i appreciated that the riding u0026amp equestrian references were all right on as so many books that include horses can often get these details wrong i did have to giggle that there were many references to gainesville fl home of the university of florida and thea commenting that she'd never seen a college before uf was definitely alive and well in the 30's having been established in 1853 and operating at it's current location since 1906 but i can forgive that small fact given that the rest of this novel was enjoyable","533":"astounding","534":"i looked forward to reading this book for a while which may explain my disappointment i just didn't feel that the characters were developed thoroughly and felt the main character went too quickly from confused immature and unintentionally pleasure driven to experienced clear minded and hedonistic","535":"read this in 2 nights at the beach nice coming of age story great summer beach read","536":"just fabulous and this camp actually existed but it is much more than camp and much more than riding this one will go far","537":"a dark coming of age story set in the mid depression rural south thea's heartbreaking family backstory is more compelling than her predictable boarding school experience","538":"3 stars purely for the descriptions of the carolina mountains and the horseback riding otherwise the main character is pretty deplorable","539":"excellent coming of age novel about a young woman and her journey to self discovery at a riding school for wealthy southern girls","540":" thea atwell 15 has been sent from her family home in florida to attend a girls boarding school for the southern elite one at which she will learn to become an accomplished horsewoman over the course of her stay she learns to navigate this world filled with young women much different from the isolated life she led at home with her parents and twin brother while she recovers from a mysterious tragedy in which she has played a central role i had high hopes for yonahlossee after all of the rave reviews it received it was described as spellbinding lush provocative and smart it even made oprah's summer reading list initially i found the book a page turner i was drawn into the vivid world disclafani described first the hushed sheltered world that thea grew up in and then the majestic wild of the mountains in which the camp is nestled the social structure of the camp with it's regional cliques and finishing school schedule yes french was a part of the curicculum created a picture of life for wealthy young women on the verge of the great depression my problem with this novel however is simply how unlikable thea is when the reader is first introduced to thea she is a quiet girl reluctant to leave her father's side she is timid and shy but has a deep love for horses and we are treated to hints about a family scandal that ruined her family's life back home in floriday as thea becomes more acclimated to her life at the camp she has to make choices about her relationships with the other girls as well as with the adults in her life she does not simply make bad choices of the kind you would attribute to a girl her age but dangerous and disturbing choices that made me question the author's purpose for this character thea was also an extremely selfish character which is to be expected at her age but without a transformation into a young woman more cognizant of her situation in life the novel's ending was weak rushed and ultimately disappointing in addition the other characters were not well developed and felt like shallow stereotypes her brother was described as an animal lover with no other apparent characteristics sissy thea's friend at the camp was a sweet girl that everyone liked but was sheltered and foolish the adults are even worse her parents are portrayed as having created a progressive childhood but it is never explained why they kept their children so sheltered and separate or if they had desires and hopes of their own in the end this was a book i truly wanted to like but just couldn't find much about it to enjoy i received a free copy of this book from the publisher in exchange for an honest review","541":"a nice little coming of age story set at a girl's private school during the depression years thea atwell is sent to yonahlosse after a tragic ending to a flirtation affair with her teen aged cousin at yonahlosse she finds herself and begins to live her life on her own terms","542":"i read this book on a whim inserting it between a book i had not finished and one i really wanted to read wild this is a good book it kept my interest and was especially good at slowly revealing what the main character thea had done that was so horrible her family sent her away","543":" it's the depression but thea is from a weathy family and their money is secure so she is sent to a boarding school after her family finds out about her involvement with a boy i enjoyed the parts that were set at the school the writing was good thea was a fully realized character i'm only giving this three stars though because i felt like the pacing was off some scenes were too short feeling un finished and some were too long dragging there were flashbacks to her homelife and the scandalous involvement with a boy which were not really flashbacks more like it was a dual plot line which kept switching from boarding school to pre boarding school life and this constant back and forth annoyed me there was too much about thea's pre boarding school family life which interrupted the coming of age plot that was unfolding at yonahlossee i only needed a few flashbacks to get the gist of what happened in her family i didn't need to know what every christmas ornament looked like overall a good satisfying read","544":"i could not finish this book as it crossed that line into semi pornographic i got sick of reading about 15 year olds having sex the main character had few redeeming qualitiies and made one stupid choice after another and then she beat the crap out of her horse with a whip and i decided that should could not possibly have any redemtive qualities and i stopped reading although the writing was okay the plot was incredably weak save your money don't buy it","545":"teenage angst raging hormones and a series of bad decisions lead to a terrible tragedy yet this book is so much more the complexities within families is always fodder for a book but often not so well written i feel as though i have been to yonahlossee i feel as though i know the folks in this book i feel great sorrow for thea and her family for the circumstances that brought them to such a hard spot a serious book a compelling book and a book that felt like a satisfying meal","546":"intriguing story that keeps you reading i enjoyed the flow of this book and found it's flawed protagonist both interesting and engaging something worth discussing","547":"read this super quickly and was surprised at how much i enjoyed this i liked that the tone was a little on the darker side","548":"set in the blue ridge mountains in 1930 my favorite setting this book tells the story of a fifteen year old who gets into sexual trouble within the context of her isolated family as is so often the case she is blamed for what is a systemic family problem and shipped off to boarding school the way the book tells the story within an era that lacked an understanding of family systems is extraordinary it illustrates powerfully what often happens to girls in families a remarkable boo","549":"this book was set in north carolina and had great appeal in the beginning i did not enjoy the turn it took with sexual relationships i realized that was the premise of the story and finished the book but could not recommend it","550":"a kind of lolita story about the changing of times and lives but the circle of times that spin so similar over the years interesting","551":"i wanted to finish this book but couldn't very wordy and boring i was 100 plus pages in and still not much had happened in the way of a plot i was looking forward to reading this since it was on so many summer book lists and received good reviews save your time and money on this one","552":"i may up this to 4 stars an engrossing tale of a young woman who claims her own way in life after her family has been irrevocably disrupted a wonderful deck chair in the sun tall glass of iced tea read","553":"though an argument could be made that this book is evocative and well written there is little that will have you sympathizing with the main character a spoiled girl who wants to be the center of men's attention she is far from likeable you'll want to give her the benefit of doubt but will come up short","554":" grossly overrated coming of age story set in the 1930s with a ridiculously sexually liberated 15 year old heroine tedious wait for the great distressing reveal as to why she was banished from her loving home to the all girls riding camp gratuitous sexual content which could potentially have been believable if this story was set in the 1960s but which is absurd in the context of depression america and has clearly been made explicit to sell the book some critics have hailed this as a romance uh noooooo preposterously happy ending for the heroine who really should have been in therapy for decades bleahh","555":"this review has been hidden because it contains spoilers to view it click here i want to talk about the writing in this novel first at times it was excellent but this author has a thing for smells many times throughout the book thea the main character mentions the smells of another person's breath and it is always okay never really gross also how people smell in general like one of her roommate's pillow when thea puts her own head on it i didn't care for that it just kind of grossed me out but on to the plot thea is a bad girl a wrong girl not a right girl i want to talk about the writing in this novel first at times it was excellent but this author has a thing for smells many times throughout the book thea the main character mentions the smells of another person's breath and it is always okay never really gross also how people smell in general like one of her roommate's pillow when thea puts her own head on it i didn't care for that it just kind of grossed me out but on to the plot thea is a bad girl a wrong girl not a right girl why she did something naughty and bad but she didn't do it alone she did it with well never mind that for now especially if you're going to read the book and then her brother her twin does something very bad as well forget about the cuckoo parents the kindly quiet seemingly unconcerned father and the beautiful yet oddly cold and controlling mother who hides her children away in their little corner of paradise in florida except for dad's brother wife and son these kids don't know too many people in any personal way no friends their own age just mom and the maid and dad gives them lessons yonahlossee is a boarding school for southern debutante type girls the main thing the girls focus on there is not lessons or what college they are going to attend this is 1931 and they need to learn manners how to ride a horse how to dress how to flirt how to behave how to find a rich man to marry them to save the family the author does a good job of keeping you in the dark about thea's transgressions the ones that have causes her perfect happy family to send her away but you figure out most of that pretty quickly there's more to the story then you initially guess of course but while thea is away from the safety of her family home she does more wrong stuff very wrong stuff i felt it difficult to understand and sympathize with thea and certainly her family really a very selfish and strange bunch of people the writing so often made the same loop again and again thea really needs a good therapist i found it hard to take this book seriously towards the end perhaps this book was just wrong for me but it was hard for me to imagine yonahlossee riding camp at all more","556":"really a 3 1 2 but i am rounding up because i got caught up in the mood and atmosphere of the story a little overwrought but evocative of the time and place","557":" the yonahlossee riding camp for girls by anton disclafani is one book i would not recommend actually that's not entirely true i would tell my friends to read it just so we could all talk about how horrible it was i don't typically dislike books i just put them aside as one i would not read again but this book was so hard to finish i struggled through reading most of it the narrator 15 year old thea atwell is a very irritating character with odd sexual habits and a horrible riding style i have spent my whole life surrounded by horses and even have one of my own so i know a thing or two about horses the author clearly has not spent enough time around horses and made some pretty ridiculous comments for people who don't know horses this probably wouldn't affect them the same way but just know most things said are not factually accurate now about the actual story it is set during the midst of the great depression but thea is a very privileged girl she has sex with her cousin and is sent to a riding camp finishing school with other rich girls to 'straighten her out' in a way this is a magnificent camp where the girls get to ride and spend most of their day with the horses throughout the story you switch from flashbacks to the present and slowly unravel the bad thing thea did to send her to this camp you read about her life at home and now her new life at camp until she decides to make a move on the camp headmaster mr holmes thea taught his daughters how to ride and felt a real bond with them but the moment his wife went away to collect donations she let her passion fly and goes for it of course more events transpire in the story but ultimately thea doesn't want to be the cause of another broken family and goes back home we then find out that thea's family sold her horse and that's where i stopped reading because you don't sell a person's horse behind their back","558":"lots of missed opportunities a disappointment overall","559":" though straightforward in story and style this is a strange and baffling book in terms of sexual politics qualitative standing a generous reader could indeed say that 'yonahlossee' is anton's attempt at taking back the horse riding genre from the pre teens and soft core porn writers that by telling them in this more literary way she is subverting the tales of burgeoning sisterhood and illicit sexuality creating an authentic and liberal minded work from pieces of problematic pulp a harsher reader however would simply say that she is adding another book to the pile albeit one with slightly fancier language and a few nifty narrative tricks for every enlightened moment there is one that will make you cringe most lacking that little wink or nudge a modern writer will give to let you know it's ok this is intentionally horrible while there is maybe a sex positive message to be found in the book alongside one deconstructing gender lines it is dirtied a little by the fact that all the relationships shown are lurid and taboo there are too many tantilising hints of a great revisionist work in here to dismiss the book entirely but the result is nevertheless too much a mess to really reccomend if neither holds up to too much scrutiny nor provides enough phenominological pleasure to succeed as either literature or trash and sits unsatisfyingly between the two","560":"while i enjoyed the book and wanted to finish to see what happened i was very frustrated with the mistakes this girl made and how her parents treated her","561":"tauntly written coming of age story a bit disapointing in terms of equine knowledge in my opinion and maybe a bit too steamy without any real romance the ending wrapped up rather fast i'm not always a fan of the narrator summing up how things turned out later married kids etc when it can end in the present tense","562":"this was the worst book i've read this year i can't believe i read the whole thing i liked the setting and kept thinking it would get better but it got worse","563":"this book was average if it weren't for my love of horses i would have given it two stars the characters weren't all that exciting the plot was decent enough but too overdrawn and the overall story felt uninspired","564":"how does a family cope with the loss of a child caused by another child most family never recover and this one did not the story is set before modern psychiatry which child do you choose this is the story of the child not chosen blamed and blaming herself for the loss but she also lossed her family and her beloved twin her coping and mourning leads to an aberrant behavior although 16 she is not an adult but has an adult body prior reviews blame her for seducing mr holmes but in many states having sex with a minor constitutes statutory rape the adult should have known better than to take advantage of a lost teen blaming her is the same as blaming rape victims or molested children not my favorite book but an interesting concept","565":"a really painful but good growing up stor","566":"thought it read like a good ya which i am not fond of it wasn't until nearing the end of the story that i sank my teeth into this one when the \"bad\" girl who was never really bad just young realizes that her past lie is a link of circumstances and understands more importantly only you are in control of your destiny most adults can go a lifetime and never make this realization","567":"would give it 2 5 stars if possible it was fine but the pay off wasn't worth it","568":"between a 3u0026amp 4 i didn't really feel like i was in the 1930s it felt too contemporary","569":" so the writing was good i did enjoy it the disapproving mother in me did not like all the sex that the 16 year old protagonist was having with such inappropriate partners so this girl grows up somewhere remote and only interacts with her family she has no girl friends etc then she gets shipped off to boarding school then shenanigans ensue it was interesting to see how the 1930s financial crises affected very wealthy families this book did leave me wondering did she ever have an appropriate relationship what did she do i'd read a sequel","570":"i really enjoyed this book thea is not a like able character but she seems like someone i've known i'm not sure why people feel do strongly negative towards this book yea some of the subject matter is hard to read hard to imagine in real life but doesn't life take difficult turns isn't life uncomfortable at times i definitely would recommend this book didn't 100% love it but really liked it","571":"despite being a bit too long this was a compelling story about the sad dissolution of a seemingly idyllic family and its home displaying wealth and privilege circa 1930 the main character thea is bold needy and headstrong which leads to a family tragedy and her banishment to the riding camp boarding school while her weaker twin brother stays with the parents and leads a cloistered life unlike his sister a sad family story but one that holds your interest and your compassion","572":"i decided to read this book because of the hype surrounding it although it's not the usual reading material i select i found myself racing to the end to uncover the secret of thea's banishment from her home the author knows how to draw you into a family's secrets my rating is actually a 3 5","573":"didn't finish it boring after i read other people's reviews i'm glad i didn't waste my time with any more of it than i did","574":"made it to page 186 this is a terrible book that started off with some good writing and what looked to be a promising story however the author mistakenly believes that slowly and painfully unspooling the story of what happened before the book begins substitutes for tension within the book itself but i could have forgiven that had i cared about the characters or their world i couldn't read one more page and that's just the beginning she had so many details wrong especially about horses and the n c mountains so many manufactured situations designed to create action for instance when a frightened horse ran away there was a fear that the horse would disappear into the mountains huh has she never heard that if you give a horse its head it will take you back home and other instances where horses and their people were wrongly portrayed worst of all was that this book had a contrived inauthentic heart this is the first time i have ever said this about a book but i really would like my money back a very tiresome overrated grinding piece of work","575":"i liked this book it didn't seem to get great reviews maybe it was my mood but i liked it it got a little long at the end i wanted to say okay get on with it but it was an interesting story racy and scandalous","576":"good suspense mystery as well as interesting story of finishing schools for girls in the 30's","577":" you're probably tempted to read this because a it was a must read book a couple of years ago or b because the cute county name is evocative of faulkner's yoknapatawpha thus lending it that delicious southern magnolia scent that you know you're a sucker for well guess what it's a book about rich white girls who love horses and get sent away to horse camp by parents who want to cover up the big secret that young lassie's not a virgin anymore but if i'm wrong and you weren't actually looking for something more profound than that then be my guest hon","578":"not my favorite skimmed over all the horse stuff felt a little slow","579":"this book pulls you into it and doesn't let go the characters are well drawn and you can feel thea's need and recklessness come off the page the first person narrative is powerful but i found myself wanting to hear from sam the other half of the twin ship a very satisfying read","580":"definitely an enjoyable read for some of the pressures of the time period on young women but a little unsure about some of the self deprecating messages from that in present times","581":"just an awful book cannot understand how in the world this landed on at least two major summer reading lists","582":"i got this as an uncorrected proof for limiteh distribution from penguin since they believe i am a woman interested in such stories i was dumbfounded to discover parents who put their children in an isolated situation and then are upset when they act like teens with budding hormones so our narrator is sent away to a girls' school fortunately this 15 year old girl liked horses and riding unbelievably stupid parents and caretakers","583":"couldn't be bothered to finish it","584":" not suspenseful in the traditional sense there is no single closing point to the storyline the manner in which the first person narrator switches between camp days and her familial past implicitly speaks to the reader but the quality of the storytelling keeps you hooked even though a reader can anticipate what comes next while as a whole the novel did not have any single major plot twist or surprise it kept me involved and wanting to read more the value of this book is its storytelling beautifully written with a subtle complexity that didn't feel overbearing highly recommend","585":"a young girl is exiled from her florida home to a riding camp in carolina because of an undisclosed indiscretion as the story unfolds we learn what happened and why we also meet the other girls who are at the camp for various reasons there is something off putting to me about the sexuality in the book you have to wonder about the adults in this girls life","586":"exiled to an equestrian boarding school in the south at the height of the great depression for her role in a family tragedy strong willed teen thea atwell grapples with painful memories while acclimating to the school's strict environment thea atwell comes to grips with her sheltered upbringing and the outside world when she is 'sent away' after an indiscretion with a cousin the riding sequences are terrific written by someone who knows her way around horses","587":"wow what a wonderful debut novel i loved it at the start of the great depression thea atwell is 15 years old she is sent by her family to the yonahlossee riding camp for girls at first the reader does not know why her family sent her away and that story is what makes this such an interesting book don't miss it","588":" i'm not quite sure what to think of this book the main character remains so elusive thea is sometimes kind and sometimes cruel sometimes self absorded and sometimes selfless and there is no predicting when she will be which even after spending a whole book inside of her head it's written in first person i don't actually feel like i know her i'm not saying that's entirely a bad thing as teenagers can be very all over the place thea barely knows herself still it kept me at some distance from her that said the story is interesting and entertaining and i was always eager to know what would happen next i liked the book i just wish it had drawn me in more","589":"this isn't great literature but i liked it i love characters that aren't flat i need a little inconsistency or really what's the point thea is young confused acts then thinks and i like it it could have ben a bit more brief but a good read","590":"i was disappointed in this book it was a bit confusing at times for a 15 year old to have such an adult image of life","591":"i was disappointed in this book esp because i had read good reviews first of all it needed a much better editor there were odd mistakes throughout also a lot was left unexplained and you saw the secret a mile away disappointing read","592":" a character wearing a mink stole in atlanta in july eating roasted beets in 1930 in the south they would not have been roasted they would have been boiled in july they would have been served pickled mention of an heirloom garden while people certainly had gardens they did not think of them as heirloom spanish moss in the north carolina mountains spanish moss is a lowlands plant etc etc the misuse of details threw off the novel for me small but annoying mis steps from beginning to end the so called suspense had little to do with plot craft but more to do with hints and innuendos that lead nowhere","593":" i listened to this on audio while driving from oklahoma to southeastern wisconsin i'm from florida and i miss home so i feel like i could understand thea's desire to stay home in florida and eventually return home then home becomes something different when one leaves even if it's against one's will i read reviews scathing reviews by readers who seemed to attack thea calling her selfish spoiled entitled etc how is this are we not the products of our parents our environment shaped by our own personal motives and drive at times i disliked thea especially during the period when mrs holmes was away yet a part of me was cheering for her the whole time maybe because thea thought for herself and knew the power of her actions long before any of the other people in her life would figure this out for themselves i never considered her selfish she was wise beyond her years wiser than her twin wiser than her parents even edited to add spoiler going back to reviews again a few readers have pegged thea as a sexual predator interesting see she's 15 and 16 years old in this story her sexual partners are both older one nearly twice her age each one of those men knew better too but oh women or teenage girls in this case always seem to be the troublemakers","594":"engaging fiction beautifully written and a great weekend read unabashed in its exploration of teen sexuality and the effects of a sheltered childhood meeting a hormone drenched adolescence great riding sequences and lovely sense of time and place slow start with a lot of somewhat overwrought foreshadowing but hang in there it gets better","595":"i have thirty pages or so left in this book i guess i should finish it but i went on vacation and totally forgot i didn't finish it so i really think i've had enough it's pretty good and entirely predictable although perhaps those last 30 pages show some surprising growth i will read them and report back i guess though i sorta like finishing where i did","596":"a coming of age tale set in the 1930's in the south althea has been banished from her family due to a scandal and is now trying to adjust to her new life at the yonahlossee riding camp for girls","597":"the narrator thea was difficult to like that is not a bad thing this is very much a coming of age novel and she does not do it with much grace or guidance parts of this novel are very difficult to read but i believe are factual accounts and feelings of what some adolescent girls go through i'll need to sit with this book to see if my opinion of it changes it wasn't bad","598":"i liked the writing and the beginning of the story i was not fond of the affair it just didn't seem plausible","599":"yawn rather boring thea is sent away from home at the height of the great depression to a horseback riding camp for an unknown reason it's not too hard to figure out why thea was sent away hence not much of a suspenseful secret most of the characters fell flat for me and i found thea dull and one dimensional didn't really enjoy it","600":"interesting story great characters","601":" it was well written and the descriptions were incredibly real but i can't say that i enjoyed this book much the main character was someone i wouldn't want to know i guess you could call it a coming of age story but really it didn't show growth it just showed getting older i guess the main lesson she seemed to learn is that it is ok to be selfish to make yourself happy the one thing that made me sad was that she really wasn't a bad girl at the beginning the parents should have supervised those kids more what happened initially was almost inevitable and the aftermath was accidental however her choices while at the camp and the way she treated both her pony and her horse made her not a good person in my book i find it strange and pretty amazing that a man wrote this book the readers that i know would not enjoy this book and therefore i would not recommend it","602":"coming of age and sexism in the 1930s i was riveted well done","603":"one of the best books i've read in the past year characters well developed plot tight teen girls horses love and lust in the depression","604":"a great read how our actions can effect everyone around us","605":"i was tempted to give this book 5 stars but there was something holding me back the story was both interesting and a bit irritating but i have to admit this author knew how to end the book well this was the best ending i've encountered in a long time it was not the most thought provoking book as far as taking me on a journey of myself but the coming of age and growing and maturing of the main character was well done","606":"i rarely finish a book in one day but devoured this one family secrets parental expectations messed up relationships a coming of age story horses innocence from a too sheltered life rejection forgiveness series of events in the southern us during the great depression makes for a compelling and satisfying page turner","607":"so well written and thought provoking i could not put it down i just wanted to keep reading to find out how it would end and knowing that i would be sad to be done i can't wait to see what the author comes up with next","608":"i knew i hated romance novels but i still gave this one a shot after finishing this book i realized it's still not my thing","609":"this book was ok i liked the story line for the most part i felt though it was lacking something throughout not enough meaning behind the main characters actions as a fan of asheville nc i enjoyed reading a book that took place in the beautiful setting of the mountains of nc overall it held my attention and i enjoyed it just not a favorite read","610":"i really liked this book it's a great coming of age story that is set at a school for girls with a riding camp the characters are well rounded and the story is entertaining lots of fun to read","611":"i am not one to gravitate towards adult novels but there are certain ones that pull me in and the yonahlossee riding camp for girls was one of them i received my review copy at the penguin canada spring summer preview event and it was one of the only piles of arcs that were not touched i picked up the book read the back and decided that i would give it a try and i am so glad that i did because i would have missed a breathtakingly beautiful novel although the protagonist in this novel is only fifteen this is far from a novel a fifteen year old girl should be reading set in the heart of the great depression this story is heartbreaking and painful to read at times it made me wonder if i could have survived during that time in history and it made me wonder how our protagonist thea did survive she was sent to the camp because of a unmentionable incident that happened earlier on in the year and it threatened not only theas reputation in society but her families as well this incident is hinted at throughout the novel and i loved that the author reveal it to us through a series of small flashback that added so much tension to the story the best part of the novel was how true it was to its time period obviously i did not live through the great depression but i have family who did and i thought the author did an amazing job at representing a very difficult time in history i also loved that most of the conflict came through the flashbacks but also the letter correspondence between thea and her family mainly her mother this was the part that broke my heart the most because thea just wanted approval from her parents that everything was going to be okay and it was that lack of approval that lead her on a path that would shape the rest of her life during the progress of the novel we watch thea grow up and make certain choices that are frowned upon by many but they also made her into a different person she grew up very fast at yonahlosee and it was hard to read at times because she was only fifteen yet after that year at the camp she seemed much too old i really enjoyed this book mostly for betrayal of a time period that was so foreign to my way of living and for making me invest in a character that in the end was not very likable it was a great read","612":" i enjoyed this coming of age story set in the time of the great depression thea the main character is sent from her home in florida to attend a girl's school in north carolina something horrible happened that caused her exile and we learn her story through a series of flashbacks at times sympathetic at others frustrating you can't help but feel sorry for thea and for the lives of the others she so callously disrupts it's a sad story that does not have a happy ending and that's heartbreaking however it's definitely worth the read if you've ever been a teenager that did foolish things and didn't consider the consequences of your actions","613":"wish 1 2 was an option there was much i liked about this book but i also found much of it disturbing","614":"being generous with a two i think oh the melodrama didn't like the story didn't like the writing seemed contradictory in spots probably would not have finished it had i been in the real world but it was the only book i had during a 13 hour day at the hospital i am dumbfounded by the praise about this book sexy unusually accomplished maybe i gave it an extra star because my mom came out of surgery without several organs but without cancer too i was feeling good","615":" the first two thirds of this book were enjoyable and then in the last third it took a turn for the creepy and uncomfortable i love a book with a private school setting and had high hopes for this story thea is a teenage girl sent away to a camp for girls after an unknown family scandal the reason for her exile is only hinted at as the reader i was intrigued about the mystery of her history i wasn't too surprised when it was all laid bare but by then the narrator had become so whiny and arrogant and unlikeable i no longer cared about her conflicts she sets herself up as this wise sage that really understand life and its nuances and yet makes terrible decisions i could no longer root for her happiness and the fact that no one around her though knowing what she was up to called her out on her behavior and asked her what in the world she thought she was doing baffles me i dislike stories wherein a not very nice person gets away with things scot free where are the consequences","616":"i wanted to like it i really did it was not lush and evocative it bordered on trashy the suspense of what had landed her at horse camp was drawn out unnecessarily ugh","617":"it was just a good story well told i loved the slow way the truth unfolded i think the author did a great job of creating suspense but not so much that one rushes through the book just to get answers i savored it and enjoyed the journey through her year at camp","618":"the author has such a talent for writing i can't rate the book lower than three stars but i found the story a less than pleasant one thea is so incredibility confused at her coming of age and her lack of socialization as a child causes havoc on her teen years the author does a lovely job of drawing you in and making you wonder what she did to get sent to boarding school but she otherwise spins a tale that spirals into a very morbid story i can't tell if the author was trying to give a warning to parents who don't socialize their children or if she didn't blame the parents for what happened but overall i left this book disappointed","619":"the first fifty pages of this tale of a fifteen year old girl exiled to a north carolina boarding school and horse camp got off to a slow start for me but it's one that i ended up enjoying immensely while it's very much about an affair of the heart gone wrong and the immense consequences at stake for a young girl it also says a lot about the detrimental effects of sheltered isolation and how parents can engineer their children's downfall in an effort to keep them safe though young thea is a strong and insightful heroine who recognizes the opportunity for her own salvation though it comes at a price so steep that few would be willing to face and pay it disclafani does a fine job portraying the heartbreak and confusion in awakening and transitioning from girl to woman recommended","620":"a coming of age book that leaves a mature reader sad remembering her own disappointments with her parents taking place during the depression is exactly how it leaves the reader generations of disappointments between mothers daughters and other family members","621":"this is an enjoyable easy to read book one that a woman might enjoy as a beach read it would not in my opinion have much appeal for a male as it a story of a 15 year old girl from a wealthy florida family who disgracing the family in an encounter with her cousin is sent to a riding camp school for girls in the mountains of north carolina she learns to integrate herself into the social strata of the other girls at the school the story has appeal from many aspects love money sex horses family etc","622":"i liked it didn't love it kept wanting the main character to make different choices was an interesting look at how the depression affected the very wealthy","623":"a couple of people recommended this book to me and i just didn't like it it just felt blah","624":"it was good not my favorite","625":"this book has mixed reviews on amazon but i found that i really enjoyed it thea is a fascinating but disturbing character","626":"i thought this was an excellent book really enjoyed it","627":" after a family tragedy fifteen year old thea atwell is sent away to a riding camp and school located deep within the blue ridge mountains the book alternates between thea's present day life at camp and flashbacks of the events leading up to her arrival leaving her family's isolated citrus plantation in florida thea initially struggles to understand how to survive without her family in the company of strangers but as her time at yonahlossee passes she becomes an exaggerated version of the girl she was in florida self assured of her riding abilities confident in her few close relationships and at times stupidly selfish and reckless when actions she takes at camp begin to mimic the same destructive path that sent her to yonahlossee it's interesting to see the struggle between wanting to be both a right girl and not caring if she is though easily passed off as a beach read the internal struggle of thea resonates a little bit deeper kristen z marathon county public libraryfind this book in our library catalog","628":"it lost me about three quarters of the way through","629":"well i can honestly say i was entranced by thea i really enjoyed her story even if there was a lot of inappropriate booty w the wrong men it def didn't glorify it as a good thing i was rooting for her to be happy and the story left me satisfied great book","630":"i really liked this story for it's strange mix of innocent honest sensuality with life at boarding school or camp","631":"just finished this hauntingly beautiful and sad book it seemed such an easy read at 388 pages after the thousand page marathons i've been reading in the outlander series","632":"i loved this book such a well written coming of age story thea is such an interesting character she makes bad choices tragic choices and must work through them and learn from them i found the twin relationship to be fascinating","633":" the yonahlossee riding camp for girls told the story of 15 year old thea a fraternal twin a floridan from an upper class family a rebel who gets exiled from her home after doing something unacceptable during the early depression years separated from her brother she sadly is set to north carolina where she begins another life at an equestrian boarding school for girls although i really enjoyed the story itself i found the characters to be shallow almost unlikeable especially thea who's actions and character diminished the story as it went on suffice it to say the book held my interest but i was disappointed at the end","634":"the suspense at the beginning to find out what the main character did to end up in her present situation was well played","635":"good writing and the southern setting storyline at the camp school was interesting but the rest of the heart of the story lacked for me well deified characters set in the depression era","636":"sexual awakening and bad decisions in the 1930s but still a compelling book with a main character you both liked and wanted to ground audio book version nicely done","637":"i suppose this is only romantic if a person enjoys the notions of incest and adultery however it is a coming of age and broken family story that is told well though i don't feel the need to read it again","638":"was looking forward to reading this but was a little disappointed was just mediocre","639":" the writing is well done and i enjoyed reading the description of the different settings i liked all the side characters in the school and wanted more of them it was refreshing to read a coming of age novel that is a little dark it's not fast paced but it did hold my interest the main character thea was unlikeable the shocking reveal of what actually occurred that was hinted at all throughout the book wasn't all that shocking there were lots of stuff thrown in here that seemed completely thrown in there for no reason this was a decent read but i was a little disappointed because it was so highly praised i'd recommend this if you're looking for an ok coming of age novel but don't expect too much","640":"lame a horney lonely girl discovers sex in al the wrong places and lives happily ever after really","641":"despite this being a very dark story i couldn't put it down and kept wanting to learn more about thea","642":"i like this writer is in st louis","643":"i enjoyed the book a well written coming of age story told thru the main character thea i couldn't relate to her struggles and lifestyle but the book had a couple of messages that hit home for me with regard to family dynamics","644":"i chose this book because i am familiar with the yonahlossee resort in the blue ridge mountains and the name caught my attention i wanted to like thea but don't know if the portrayal of a girl so lustful and reckless at all costs is meant to be the story of a free spirit or a badly raised little rich girl with no morals although the book was beautifully written there was a different pace at the end as the author tried to wrap everything up which is distracting and which ultimately changed the tale for me after the languid pace of the rest of the book i liked it i didn't love it","645":" spoiler alert this was another of those books that i was glad i finished because i almost didn't early on i decided i disliked the main character a self absorbed teen who has been sent off to the yonahlossee riding camp for girls after a scandal largely of her own making there she proceeds to make another similar but less devastating mistake and is sent away in disgrace she returns to her family but their idyllic life has been forever changed by her actions and nothing is or will ever be that good again after finishing the book i decided that i couldn't really blame her entirely for her ruin her ignorant in denial parents their isolated home her possessive brother her selfish manipulative cousin her young age the era 1930s all contributed something bad happened there was fallout and everyone's life changed for the worse such is life i suppose bad things happen sometimes we are at fault mostly i think many factors beyond any individual's control come together assigning blame is a futile exercise that keeps us mired in the event and keeps us from healing and moving on","646":"coming of age story with a very self absorbed and somewhat selfish main character i found it hard to sympathize with the situations the main character was going through because i disliked her so much","647":"can't really recommend it the prose is lovely in places and the setting 1093s exclusive camp school well done but a lot of repetition and poor resolution","648":" while i do not typically enjoy reading coming of age books i was drawn to the yonahlossee riding camp for girls by anton disclafani for two reason the hype and the historic setting i do so like reading a well written historic novel and this one happens to take place during the great depression the writing is exquisitely beautiful descriptive and i found this book to be far more difficult to set down than i would have imagined i would recommend the yonahlossee riding camp for girls to those who enjoy well written books and to discussion groups this will make a brilliant choice","649":"eh it was sort of interesting there was some appeal in reading about a woman growing up in the depression at what was essentially a high end women's boarding school but the drama that led to her being sent away seemed overblown also the book spends a long time leading up to it and it's fairly clear the direction it's taking early on i think it would have been better if it had been more forthcoming with those details i also didn't really understand the character or her motivations while at the camp i didn't find her behavior all that believable and her detachment in telling the story was off putting the cool distance at which she tells her story is clearly purposeful but made it harder to care very much about what was happening whether one was sympathetic to her or not there were also times when i literally had to read a sentence three times to understand the point it wasn't densely written or complicated just a lot of words that didn't always seem to go anywhere interesting i got the sense that the author wanted there to be subtext and feeling there more than was being said but it just didn't come through and finally the end it just sort of fizzled and stopped like i said eh","650":"i was skimming by the end one of those rare books that might be better as a movie","651":"one of the best books i've read in a long time","652":"i found myself caring less and less about the main character as the book dragged on some interesting bits and beautiful prose but overall not worth reading","653":"ugh threw this one when i was done awful protagonist boring characters little plot and sex just for the sake of having it in the book pointless and boring need a good book recommendation","654":"the 30 s were not a great time to be a woman","655":"a pretty good story but i dislike the i've got a secret plot mechanism hiding information until the end","656":"good book early in the book i had a sense of dread but then storyline becomes predictable in a sense i had the feeling i'd read this before","657":"loved this book beautifully written story about a teen girl who makes questionable choices the choices affect her family and change all of their lives forever definitely not a ya book very adult matter","658":"while very well written i had a hard time getting through this one honestly i felt really uncomfortable with the plot itself it was fairly predictably so i knew what to expect but like a train wreck i couldn't look away","659":"i have mixed feelings about this book the story is dark and at times disturbing i'm not sure i cared for any of the characters except for sissy for some reason though i couldn't put it down which is why i am giving it a high rating","660":"most compelling protagonist i've met in a long long time this book moved me to tears","661":"i really wanted to love this book but in the end i was so disappointed in the lead character but i do want to ride again","662":"i liked this book for the geography of it for the descriptions of western north carolina a place i love and florida i place i have zero desire to visit the story was convincing and a fast read but i didn't like the main character and i didn't like the dissolution of her family i suppose that's something hard to like in general","663":"i thought this book would be more about the relationships of the girls at the camp but that was really only a small part of it i squirmed through the events of most of the book well written but completely uncomfortable to read","664":"this review has been hidden because it contains spoilers to view it click here this was looking like a 4 5 star book until the last 150 pages the story was captivating a young girl sent to camp for a supposed disgrace to her family because of problems with a boy the bond between thea and horses should have been the focus on how animals can help in healing but no first we find out that the boy is her cousin who essentially coerced her into sex then left her in a horse stall to deal with the disgrace then at camp she has sex with the married father of three ca this was looking like a 4 5 star book until the last 150 pages the story was captivating a young girl sent to camp for a supposed disgrace to her family because of problems with a boy the bond between thea and horses should have been the focus on how animals can help in healing but no first we find out that the boy is her cousin who essentially coerced her into sex then left her in a horse stall to deal with the disgrace then at camp she has sex with the married father of three camp counselor who's twice her age disclafani tries to write this as some sexual encounter between two consenting adults when in actuality is just plain rape of a minor even if it is the minor instigating the affair the story and writing went downhill from there i honestly grazed the last 100 pages because i was so disgusted with the turn the story had taken and the complete lack of any characters to feel sorry for more","665":"the writing was decent the story predictable","666":"i thought this was a very engaging read a bit different than what i expected so it really held my attention i never could decide whether i liked the main character or not","667":" when we first meet thea atwell she is on her way to the yonahlossee riding camp for girls not for a summer break and not because she wants to go but because she's done something that has caused a rift in her family we slowly discover what this bad thing is as thea shares her story about her year at yonahlossee and the year leading up to her being sent away it's a wonderful story about being a girl consequences and family and while there are lessons learned along the way it's far from preachy i loved the setting yonahlossee was described so well and thea's childhood home is located in a part of florida that reminded me of home i'll give most books a chance that take part in the non touristy parts of florida or before disney world took over this is my third florida read this year and the name of the camp love it i grew up in suwannee county where there is a river called the withlacoochee names like yonahlossee aren't uncommon just brings back more memories of home wonderful debut can't wait to read more by ms disclafani","668":"i really enjoyed this book","669":"beautifully written intriguing story","670":"i enjoyed the first half of the book there was a secret deftly woven into the writing then it was revealed and ew the book turns to sophomoric descriptions of adolescent sexual encounters yuck it was described as sexy by whom a 16 year old would not recommend","671":"i really liked this book at the beginning and then it got very weird and into a subject that i was not comfortable with","672":"i won't soon forget the atmospheric setting of this novel both the camp and thea's florida home are vivid and beautiful disclafani creates all of this through thea's voice one that i found unique and authentic she is intriguing enough to draw me into the story and make me care about what happens to her so many fine details of the time period and yet the story feels very timeless lovely book","673":"really terrible there is no reason for any character in this book to do anything i can't believe i read the entire thing there are a lot of great ideas themes started but none of them deliver and the main character is a shallow sex crazed idiot even her horse doesn't like her","674":"this is one of the best books i have read in a while thea's voice is strong and authentic secondary characters are well drawn and could easily spawn a half dozen more stories highly recommended","675":"this story about a 15 yr old girl who was sent away to boarding school because she disgraced the family wasn't very believable to me it was set in the depression era and referred to that some but didn't really act on it much also the story is told in first person 15 16 yr old whose voice was way too mature for an isolated girl growing up in fl i just didn't care that much about the characters","676":" it takes place in the early 1930's and the great depression and is about a young girl thea atwell whose family sends her to a school camp for girls in north carolina the story moves from her time at the camp to events that happened while growing up and at home i started out really enjoying this book and the writing was grabbing i was not able to finish the book though what did it for me was the incestuous relationship that was starting now i could handle it being implied that something incestuous had happened but i did not need to have descriptive details i overlooked the first instance but then the instances continued and this just really turned me off and i could not finish","677":" i read this because it is about the sexual awakening of a teenage girl something i am teaching myself to write about disclafani writes about that and so much more very well thea atwell was raised along with her twin brother in virtual isolation it is the 1930s the depression has hit and the atwell family lives far from any major town on a plot of land in florida the family has money the father is a doctor the children are home schooled and the mother loves her house and gardens the only people they see are the family of the father's brother who has one son thea loves horses and rides her own horse everyday when she is discovered messing around with her cousin she is banished from home by her parents they send her to the yonahlossee riding camp for girls in georgia where she is abandoned by them at the age of 15 no visits even when she gets dangerously ill only letters now and then this novel is sad dreamy and atmospheric i loved the writing and the excellent capturing of that time of life when a girl doesn't know enough about life to understand what is happening to her thea wants whatever she wants strongly and fearlessly so of course she suffers mightily she learns the perils of wanting but she turns her misfortunes to her own advantage as she processes the terrible hurt her family has laid upon her most of all i admired the author's admission of how strong the sexual desire of a teen girl can be she takes up the subject where judy blume left it in the 1970s all mothers of teenage girls would do well to read this novel whether we went through our teens easily or tortured we don't always remember it well and mothers will always worry for their daughters there have to be ways to deal with these things that are helpful healthy and give a young girl the support and understanding she needs the yonahlossee riding camp for girls is a good example of how not to handle it but also an example of a girl with a strong sexual appetite who figures it out for herself i think simone de beauvoir would have loved this novel","678":"the reviews were mixed on this book when i was looking at it and i picked it up on sale at doubleday it was an interesting mix but a little predictable","679":"it was a nice summer read","680":"this was a great if slightly disturbing book the sense of place and time what would it be like to live during the depression but as someone of relative privilege add to the plot and the characters are rich of course as a former equestrian the riding subplot didn't hurt either definitely recommend this book although you may not love the protagonist for large parts of the book","681":"what i admired most was disclafani's restraint in unspooling the story this is very much a model of structure the characters are mostly interesting but for me the two halves of the story never quite jelled i actually found the parts set at the riding camp much less compelling than the sections dealing with thea's life in florida and how and why her parents send her to the camp and parts of the plot were a bit too expected especially the big reveal overall good but not great","682":"full review to come","683":"i really had hoped this coming of age book would warrant a 4 star rating but in the end i just couldn't do it i do applaud the author for her debut novel and liked the way she moved throughout the book from present to past and then to future tense always leaving a bit of mystery for the reader i look forward to her next book","684":"i had high hopes but by the end i was bored i liked the anachronistic telling of the tale not knowing the main character's shame fully until 3 4 of the way through was intriguing yet the character development was not well rounded and i felt myself disgusted with the main character not feeling for her while it was not a short novel it ended abruptly i felt no closure","685":"i'm not sure what i thought this book was about when i bought it but i'm certain it wasn't this a spoiler free review of this book would be that it's a book about the echoes of our decisions and moreover that life can't stop for anyone nor it should disclafani makes a superb immersion to the south of the 30s as someone not familiarized with either the civil war or the usa of the depression it did help me understand many things not only of the story but also some deemed general culture on horses the depictions of the runs the smell the speed everything is so vivid you really feel it","686":"felt as though i was reading a ya novel with inappropriate sex disappointing","687":"i really enjoyed this book and was sucked into it very quickly the author doesn't give away all of the content at first and you have to keep reading to figure out what happened to thea and how she ends up at yonahlossee if you don't mind reading some descriptive scenes of sex then i recommend they aren't raunchy and are wound into the storyline and really complete the flawed character of thea","688":"wanted to like this book more i was with it for the 1st 2 3 of the book after the 2nd indescrestion i found my self not liking anyone in the story anymore but finished it to see if there was any type of redemption the ending also seemed rushed u0026amp could have been a tighter written book","689":"i finished it finally not sure why i continued reading it i could not relate to the main character or anyone in the book actually and the author kept us waiting way too long to know the details of thea's exile a real disappointment","690":"beautifully structured and written but i found myself not caring about the internal life of the main characters or knowledgeable enough to appreciate the riding passages and and skipping through pages to get to the answers","691":"vile book which came so highly recommended i was disgusted and disappointed by this book the protagonist had no redeeming qualities except one unselfish thing she finally did in the end and was so selfish in her actions and only brief moments of having a conscience i found the way she treated horses she supposedly loved to be abusive again only caring what she could get out of it for her own enjoyment i wasted my time reading this book and even writing the review","692":"i liked this book a lot the riding camp aspect was a no brainer for me seemed like chick lit with horses good summer read i found some of it hard to swallow especially given the time but i still enjoyed it quite a lot good horse details too can tell she is a rider","693":"i listened to this on cd it was an interesting story and well narrated i would recommend it","694":"i honestly loved this book the 30s are one of my favorite time periods the trials and tribulations of this 15 year old girl kept me intrigued well told story","695":"this is a coming of age story set in the 1930's in the south fifiteen year old thea atwell is sent away to boarding school because of her involvement in a mysterious family tragedy which is slowly revealed as the story moves back and forth through time i really enjoyed the characters and how the story gradually unraveled","696":"it's a moody book not a page turner i liked it but it's not a book i would say you 'have to read'","697":"i'm surprised by how low the rating is on this book i won't moan on about the plot as there are enough reviews that do but i will just say that the way disclafani unfolds the plot slowly beautifully but still keeping it a page turner is a rare gift one of my favorites in the last couple years","698":"this review has been hidden because it contains spoilers to view it click here many will claim this book was well written but it's hard to see that when you're just so angry sure the author drew in the reader by only threading in small hints as to why the main character thea was sent away from home and to this riding camp do not continue if you don't like spoilers normally i'm pretty good at keeping out spoilers but this book just made me so angry that i feel like i must warn unsuspecting readers and spoilers are the only way to do that thea is a selfish unlearn many will claim this book was well written but it's hard to see that when you're just so angry sure the author drew in the reader by only threading in small hints as to why the main character thea was sent away from home and to this riding camp do not continue if you don't like spoilers normally i'm pretty good at keeping out spoilers but this book just made me so angry that i feel like i must warn unsuspecting readers and spoilers are the only way to do that thea is a selfish unlearning horrible character she has an affair with her cousin who has been like a brother to her i don't care if it's from a different time period i still find that revolting then she finds out he wants one thing from her sex not marriage so you would think she would learn her lesson after her disgraced family sends her way nope she spends most of the book yearning for home why after her affair with her cousin her horrified family and the incident in which her twin brother sam maims and almost kills said cousin after finding out is beyond me even though almost all the girls are nice and friendly toward her then she has an affair with the handsome and married headmaster while his wife is conveniently gone for a month or so she called it a crush earlier and is determined to control it but a few weeks later and she's throwing himself at him keep in mind this girl is sixteen sixteen years old and yet these people are running around acting like morals and consequences just don't exist moral of the story from the author in his deluded mind if you want something no matter how bad it is you should just go after it because everything will turn out just fine for you if not for the people in your life but don't worry about them they deserve the consequences of your actions and you shouldn't have to worry about a thing because you're passionate which brings me to another point thea is a very inconsistent character she's described as being controlled always watching other people and listening to their problems but not sharing any of her own but later headmaster mr holmes calls her passionate and tells her she wants so many things so much and that's not a problem if anything it's a problem for the people who try to stand in her way what what kind of message is that that's also not even remotely true there's something to be said for headstrong people but every action has consequences and sometimes it's the freaking police who get in the way of so called passionate people what do you think they do with people who murder others because of an act of passion duh come on so yeah everything turns out great for wonderful ideal and selfless thea she wins the horserace receives no consequences for her affair with the headmaster oh so selflessly takes the fall for a friend's indiscretions and tells her family she comes home for her brother so she goes home her cousin georgie has had mental issues from brain damage when oh i don't know her twin brother tried to kill him and later dies her family sends georgie's parents money because they feel guilty and therefore have to sell the house and horse oh and guess what thea cares about she only cares about the horse even after noticing how sad her mother is being torn from the place she fell in love with nope only cares about her horse so she sees what a crap life her family has now because of her and she says she wants to leave oh but not before she talks with her brother and this lovely little exchange happens \"do you remember how mother used to say that our lives were blessed that we had our own private patch of paradise \"i nodded and met his eyes in my reflection on the window \"well she doesn't say that anymore \" he gave a short laugh \"i thought god was watching us \" he was quiet for a moment and it was all i could do not to interrupt i had never heard this before i didn't quite believe it \"i know it's silly but i thought that god knew we were special \" he smiled \"i didn't mean to hurt him thea it would be better if he were dead \"\"hush \" i said \"who can say that \"\"i can say that \" he said almost shouted \"i can \" he shook his head \"i can \" he said more quietly \"because i have been here and i have seen all of it all of it thea \"\"all of it \" i repeated surprised by the sound of my own voice \"you should leave sam it's not your mess \"\"whose is it then \"\"no one's just a series of events a series of events \" i repeated \"no thea it's ours \"\"it's not mine \" i rose and walked over to the window peered over his shoulder the sun was rising and street sweepers were making a neat job of clearing the sidewalks \"there's all these people in the world and we are only two of them mother and father thought they were punishing me by sending me away it was a reward to stay here but they were wrong it was not a punishment \"\"you learned so much at camp \" i could smell his breath the particular tang it had whenever he hadn't slept long enough \"i learned enough \" i said i took his hand and squeezed it \"you should leave too our lives are elsewhere \"he laughed \"where \"i shrugged \"who knows but god grants happiness only to those who seek it \" yeah that's what thea got from this whole thing that her happiness is the only thing that matters and she does not accept any responsibility for what happened i'm not saying she should take full blame but for god's sake her whole affair with her freaking cousin started this little series of events i'm so mad right now i am actually typing furiously as my sister says intelligent authors write intelligent books this was not an intelligent book this sounded like one big excuse for graphic incest sex scenes as well as graphic sex scenes of an older married man taking advantage of a younger girl just because she's offering doesn't mean you should be taking wonder why the age of consent is 18 just guess it was also an excuse to avoid any responsibility and to say that anything bad that happens should just be accepted because the person is selfish sorry passionate all in all i would advise any self respecting person to stay as far away from this book as possible it's not that well written the characters are horrible horrible people and there is generally nothing redeeming about this book more","699":"from the first few pages of yonahlossee riding camp for girls the author tempted me with a secret theodora or thea was sent away from her family home and orange orchard in florida to live at the riding camp because she did something terrible i think the author really tried to tackle a difficult topic of a girl being sent away because of her sexual escapades with a boy prior to marriage but that situation seemed so ridiculous given the modern approach to dating that exists in 2013 that it was hard to give that scandal the level of drama the author expected thea made friends easily with the other wealthy girls who shared her cabin and her passion for horses at the riding camp but despite a few smart encounters and good writing the book could best be described with a single word eh the young protagonist had the spirit to make this an excellent book but those elements were not enough to carry the slow and choppy storyline the riding and the girls in the school lacked the magic to make me want to continue reading or riding read more of my reviews on my blog http fastpageturner wordpress com","700":"i'm not sure i think it really deserves 3 stars but still closer to 3 than 2 my review is here","701":"yonahlosse was a little slow to get into but i found myself engrossed in the scenery and intrigue of how girls were treated in southern society this feels very much like a hit for book clubs","702":"review to follow as per usual","703":"honestly i got about 100 pages from the end and i had to give up on it it began to seem way too much like some dirty old man's masturbatory fantasy","704":" this is one of those books that i quite enjoyed but did not love i'd been looking forward to it and it delivered the writing is skillful and evocative the characters are interesting and there's a simmering tension throughout that kept me turning pages the book begins with 15 year old thea atwell's arrival at the eponymous camp which doubles as a year round boarding school we learn immediately that thea's parents have sent her to yonahlossee due to some sort of bad behavior at home and short chapters building up to that event are interwoven with her life at the camp looking back this isn't an action packed sort of book thea makes friends has sexual encounters rides horses but it's one that kept my attention throughout with a combination of skillful pacing secrets doled out bit by bit and a persistent sense of complications simmering beneath the surface the depression is just beginning when thea arrives at yonahlossee in 1930 and provides an apt metaphor for the grown up problems the privileged girls must learn to face told in the first person this is very much thea's story and she's a complex character although not always a nice one it's easy to sympathize with her and get caught up in her story most of the other characters are also vivid and while we don't get to know all of them very well i believed in them and came away with the sense that there is more to them than we can see through thea's eyes the biggest exception is the headmaster who seemed less than fully fleshed out but i admire disclafani's ability to write convincingly about the society of girls at the school and without resorting to common stereotypes like the bullying rival the girls we get to know all feel like individuals and their relationships and group dynamics ring true the writing is also good atmospheric and sometimes evocative providing a great sense of place both in the scenes set at yonahlossee in the appalachian mountains and the ones set in thea's home in florida there's also a strong sense of the cultural context although the story is set less than a century ago and not so far from where i live it's in many ways a foreign place thea's voice is believable although for a story meant to be told by an older character looking back on her life we don't hear much about what she thinks of the events in hindsight in particular there's a surprising lack of awareness of the bad choices made by virtually all the adults in her life but perhaps just because readers are meant to come to our own conclusions a few words on the sex which has generated mixed reactions thea's sexual awakening is an important part of the book and there's an innocence vs transgression dynamic that runs through these scenes she's caught up in the eroticism of it while it's left to readers to realize how inappropriate the people she's picked really are ultimately the sex scenes are about the physical if you're looking for romance you'll be disappointed so they're rather explicit although not unusually so by the standards of adult fiction in sex as in other areas of her life thea is an active character who goes after what she wants which keeps her story interesting although she makes some bad decisions overall an enjoyable and well written book that would make worthwhile summer reading or whatever season you want really far be it from me to tell you when to read the book i don't think i'll be adding it to my favorites list but i will be interested to see what this author does next","705":"i'm not quite sure why this book captured collective interest that's always a mystery i thought it was pretty well written and mostly interesting and especially captured how girls in their teens are half girl half woman and how contradictory that can be but the mood the tone all very flat and consistent made the book feel duller and longer than it is","706":"started out strong and interesting i was done when it got a wee bit smutty i was stranded by a ankle sprain so i finished it but not a big fan i picked it up because i have stayed at yohnahlossee in the nc mountains and it is beautiful","707":"i had such high hopes for this book because it was set at a riding camp it was well written but the main character wasn't very like able and the story has very little to do with horses i wish there had been at least more of that since it was set at a camp where the girls ride horses all day but instead the story centered around sex and incest a let down for me","708":"thea has been raised in florida in isolation with her twin and her cousin her parents and aunt and uncle as her main source of companionship her doctor father even homeschools her and her brother and riding her pony is her main activity suddenly she is ejected from her family and taken by her father to the yonahlossee riding camp for girls in north carolina for some sin which according to her mother has ruined her family the situation is slowly revealed through the course of the book so i won't reveal it now although the book is set in the 1930's a lot of the interactions seem to me to ring true for today as well","709":"really enjoyed this book not a fast paced read but very descriptive and engaging","710":"interesting book but all in all i did not like thea particularly when she adopted and later espoused the view that the ugly actions she precipitated were only a series of events stretching back through the years and that she was a hapless girl caught up in them","711":"quite reading it just didn't have my interest","712":"i read this book in 1 day i couldn't put it down can't wait to discuss it at book club","713":"hard to read story about girls coming of age in the depression and how we learn as we grow","714":"very sexy i think i will recommend it to 10th grade and higher","715":"kinda conflicted on this one the language is beautiful the characters complex the overall storyline interesting and i loved the riding camp but some of the sub plots had major ick factor most 15yos are pretty self involved but at least take some personal responsibility not everything in life is just a series of events","716":"not quite what i expected very sad story set in 1930's the depiction of life in the girl's camp was interesting especially since i live very close to where the real camp was located really a tragic story","717":"interesting story of a girl who takes the blame for something her twin brother did the victim of the accident was a cousin who is now brain damaged this older cousin has awakened sexual feelings in theodora and so she feels guilty regardless of her culpability gets sent away for a year to a special school where she gets to continue riding her passion makes friends and enemies finally gets to go home although home is no longer the same place as the great depression has taken it's toll the story rather slides slowly to an end the author trying to tie up each thread of the story","718":"not what i expected","719":"this book was a little more graphic than i was expecting the main character was not particularly likable and though i love stories set in another place and time i really didn't get much of a feeling of the great depression in this book i was all prepared to really enjoy this one but i have to say it didn't live up to my expectations","720":"oh how i wish i had not read this book was it divinely written eloquent articulate and anecdotal yes quite but it nicked pieces into my heart that i do not welcome a story of a girl a girl who wanted to much who could not help whom she loved who moved with abandon and instinctive passion and all the punishment and loss that attended those choices a story about how poorly girls can treat one another about how society and all it's rules dominate without discretion a story about pain there is victory in one coming out the other side in learning to 'own their own life' yes but likewise there is raw truth in how these types of victories can leave one a lonely sack of empty bones a shell broken i did not need be reminded i am left pensive","721":"this was another of those books where the enjoyment comes from the journey rather than the conclusion it was rather sad over all and whilst it did dangle an unknown at you from the start it didn't keep you waiting until the bitter end for the reveal","722":"lovely prose but a slow storyline a bit deeper development would have made me either love or hate the characters easy to read once i got past the first few chapters it was hard to put down","723":"wasifted to me by random house house reads","724":" this is a lesson on why not to home school your children my it is the tory of thea a pent up teenager and her twin brother and boy cousin and no outside socialization is a a story set up for disaster the one problem with this story is the main chatcaracter's mother who thinks somehow she can keep her daughter's sexual desires restrained at the end of the book she tells her daughter she was involved with a boy and that it was exciting it would have been interesting to read more of the mother's philosophy on her thoughts of giving her daughter a different life it is explained to the main chictreat that her mother was very fast as a young woman if her mother had feelings of sexual inquiry then why restrain the daughter by home schooling or did she give into her husband i like the fact that the daughter never fully recovered from the mistakes that the parents made perhaps too from the accident involving her twin brother and cousin i had to remind myself in occurred in 1920 as it could have been a sorry set in this year liked the writing and the plot made it a quick read","725":"this was more a fun story than anything i would prob give it 3 5 stars didn't like the ending kind of depressing but a perfect easy summer read","726":"i didn't like this one as much as i thought i would i figured a coming of age set during the depression era was a sure shot but not so much i would only recommend this one to my friends who horseback ride","727":"i'm conflicted about this book i read it knowing nothing i kept reading wanting to know what the main character thea had done i'll warn you it's not pretty yet i felt like the descriptions were well written and thea's immaturity was honestly portrayed it might make a great book club discussion","728":"this book was slow at first but got better towards the end as long as you are looking for something passionate the author did switch back and forth between what was happening at camp and thea's memories i could infer the reason why she was sent away from home pretty quickly into it but everything leading up until the end when it was finally revealed was well worth it it is surprisingly filled with ample amounts of passion it has emotional moments but for the most part you will find thea to be a very straightforward person almost bland not too much fluff she does have a very risky pattern of behaviors for a young woman in the 30s but it was a nice thing to download and listen to in the car when i'm stuck on 95 in traffic for a few hours so hey what the heck","729":"meh it seemed the like least of all evils in the newark airport","730":"really enjoyed this story well written interesting characters read it in a day","731":" there were some moments of pure beautiful writing where i was so pleased by disclafani and wishing that i had written that most of the time though my eyes were rolling to the ceiling she couldn't have tried harder my favorite figurative language fail comparing someone's erection tenting their pants to a tumor crying laughing emoji i really enjoyed the way disclafani wove the plot it was enticing intriguing and kept me going until all was revealed at this point though i had to give up i meant to stick it out till the end really i did but as a horse person thea's purely mean behavior at the jumper show sent me over the edge i couldn't deal with her anymore and had to leave off also disclafani really needs a better editor thea is supposed to fifteen and she sam and georgie act like they are twelve and thirteen much more young and clueless i realize she is supposed to be entitled and sheltered but she seems to have no conscience and no idea that her actions have consequences oh and please edit out the tumor bit","732":"a wonderful book i thought it might be a ya book coming of age but it got a little explicit the book takes place during the depression but it's not about the politics of the time but the ramifications on the families","733":"i think the yonahlossee riding camp for girls shows a writer in the making it comes out as somewhat immature and unfinished but with several good attempts and ideas the main character thea is a teenager run by her hormones rather than her heart so to call this a romantic page turner as it's claimed on the cover is definitely not true actually i found the sex scenes to be anything but romantic or even erotic they came out as a bit clumsy and describing techniques rather than desire the end is somewhat unresolved which isn't nescessarily wrong but in this case it just left me somewhat untouched to hear about thea's distant future in a few pages at the end","734":"as far as abp criteria my vote would be a no thea's narcissism overwhelms any kind of empowerment she gains in my book narcissists don't really care about overcoming barriers they just do whatever they want without regards for others which is basically thea's mo her two troublesome sexual conquests may be of her own choosing and progressed as she let them but they seem more of an attempt to fill some void that of her twin the fact that she turns to men for sex is relatively seperated and flat out mean to other females in the story doesn't fit abp for me","735":"good not great","736":"i really could not connect with this book which is a little weird conidering i went to a girls boarding school in the southeast with a pretty heavy emphasis on its equestrian program but really i didn't connect with the characters there was too much telling and not enough showing also i found the writer's style to be very disjointed i was disappointed because i had heard good things about this one and was looking forward to reading it","737":"$1 million advance and that's the fact i used to google the name of this book because god knows there was no way i could remember let alone spell the title or the author's name curious as to why she made the title so complicated when her name is already complicated i came at it with an extra critical eye as a result the first third read like a ya novel all horses and the angst of a 15 year old girl then it kicked into gear and i enjoyed the res i heard on npr that the author received a $1 million advance and that's the fact i used to google the name of this book because god knows there was no way i could remember let alone spell the title or the author's name curious as to why she made the title so complicated when her name is already complicated i came at it with an extra critical eye as a result the first third read like a ya novel all horses and the angst of a 15 year old girl then it kicked into gear and i enjoyed the rest view spoiler i was relieved that thea and mr holmes were never found out in a public way that's what kept me reading late into the night waiting for them to be discovered and wanting to know what sam had done hide spoiler lots to think about with this book","738":"i wanted to like this book which is apparently a national bestseller and was featured in staff recommendations sections of two independent bookstores i visited last week unfortunately i thought it was melodramatic with often clumsy dialogue and repetitive narrative perhaps many readers liked it for its numerous sex scenes most of which seemed unrealistic to me and all of which feature the word moan more times than i could count there's a good story in here somewhere about the nature of being a twin and the desire to protect your sibling i wish disclafani's editor had pushed a little harder i'm willing to bet her next novel will be better","739":"it was ok","740":"this is a book that i can see making its rounds in popular culture for awhile maybe even a book club or two it is a solid general fiction historical fiction book from a view point that we don't hear from often horse lovers will enjoy it more than others but it is an overall enjoyable read","741":"a purely frivolous fluffy read but a fun and sexy one nonetheless flew through it","742":"disturbing but captivating read","743":"thea is sent away for doing something you find out about later she leaves a life of isolation and insulation to be thrown into a life of sudden exposure at the yonahlossee riding school though still benefiting from luxury that at the time was far above the normal its a coming of age story that you find out later may have begun earlier than thought money youth horses and sex turn out to be the right mix for a very good book","744":"easy to read suspenseful coming of age ey type book","745":"i never read the sweet valley high series as a teenager but now thanks to this book i can feel like i've finally acquired the experience","746":"this book was so transparent and that made it difficult for me to continue reading to the end i was disappointed that what could have been a lovely historical novel was overtaken by a selfish main character which would have been tolerable had she any depth","747":"i was disappointed in thea the main character mistakes made at a young age should be forgiven but the same mistake soon soon after was self centered and destructive in terms of writing i liked the author and the story she wrote just not the characters","748":"great summer read 4 5","749":"i wasn't sure what to really expect about this story at the start it grew on me as i read and i found it to be really well rounded and addictive at times if i hadn't had a busy weekend i would have finished this flat out on saturday afternoon family secrets and a young girl coming of age yonahlossee had an air of sultry suspense about it that i enjoyed","750":"it is it a good sign when half way through a book i'm looking for what i'll read next this one just didn't grab me the author spent too much time dangling this family mystery and telling us how bad thea is without divulging any new information in between we're fed a very humdrum unfolding of events at yonahlosse when the mystery is finally revealed meh furthermore i found thea whiney entitled and careless not one i would recommend","751":"well it is not at all what i thought it was going to be loved the descriptions of the school and surrounding mountains not to mention the horses the landscape of middle florida was made very appealing as well i did not expect the incest or student teacher sexual encounters i think it could have been so much more without it i admit it got my attention early on because i wanted to know why she was sent away and it dragged it out i felt sorry for her really but not because of what happened to her in florida but because in the end she thought it was all okay","752":"i liked this book a lot more than it seems many other goodreads members did beautiful writing and unexpected storyline i would give it a 3 5","753":"overall a good book especially for those of us equestrian enthusiasts i was a bit disappointed with the ending it didn't have much substance but then again it is a book about growing up easy read","754":"great story dark story couldn't stop reading it must add that what i didn't like was the focus on the soft porn that became the center of the story got a little icky after while","755":"the pacing of this novel is very demanding on the reader it drags and then tugs you hard creating incredible tension it is unstable and manipulative but you will find it hard to put down thea the main character is strong willed vulnerable self destructive immature and naive you will both want to help her and to shake her to wake up and think about others while reading this book it is important to remember the time period and the setting 1930's in the south the ending of this story is unbelievable as suddenly we have a dysfunctional mother a detached twin and a young woman with an incredibly disturbing past raising a family what happened to accountability i plan to recommend this book to our ms librarian as it is a great ya read","756":"the story is 3 5 stars but i took a half star off due to all the improperly used commas i found it distracting and annoying","757":"i'd give this 2 5 stars really it dragged on a bit without much happening to justify it","758":"very slow and drawn out in the 1st half of book author kept milking the drama that occurred eventually gets to the point and then got a little better but not much disturbing and depressing thea is selfish and a horrible character","759":"dark coming of age novel the beginning is slow and everything centers around horseback riding but the book picks up after the first 3 cd's once the momentum changed i liked it some of the bouncing back and forth in time was a bit confusing but it eventually clicks i liked it it gets a 7 on my 10 scale","760":"for quite a long time during this book i hated it i hated the characters and the story quite a lot the story of a willful girl who is raised with no real contact with the outside world and spends all her time with her parents and her twin brother a teenager who acts out without ever thinking of consequences before the act only afterwards somewhere close to the end i came to appreciate the story the characters are not likeable and you hope you are never like the parents or the children in this book but maybe it is a book you learn from i did always appreciate the writing from half way through i began to see this book as a movie a very beautiful movie with tragic overtones also while reading the book i returned to the thought that within a fairly short time had read two books by writers who live in st louis my home and have written books about twins weird at the end of yonahlassee i saw a thank you to curtis sittenfeld by this author my advice if you start this book bear with it","761":" i don't usually diss a book in public but i really really did not like this book it was very very slow yes i finished it yes it was at times enticing but in the end i just felt dirty reading it and was terribly glad for it to be over first off i did not like the main character at all i didn't like any of the characters for that matter so it was pretty hard to care what happened to them the main theme of this book was a young girl done wrong by a young man and then she thinks it's her fault which leads to an even darker turn of events and then what the author tried to make this a magnificent novel with many themes a young girl's sexual awakening the mystery surrounding what actually caused her to be sent away the deep feeling twins have for each other how families were devastated during the great depression men's power over women horses and summer camps families and wealth and florida and north carolina i don't think she pulled any of it off for me the dialogue fell flat and did not ring true the situations all felt forced as well as the tension that went with it i didn't like thea the main character one bit i originally put this on my horses list but have since taken it off because it is only peripherally about horses and horses are not the main theme and i couldn't stand the way thea treated her horses ugh okay something nice yes the yonahlossee riding camp seemed cool and i could totally picture it in my mind this all sounds rather harsh but i think it's because i had such high hopes for this book in the end i was really disappointed and i cannot recommend it at all sorry","762":"not really a fan of this book while the premise was interesting the characters were not i found it too difficult to connect with them and rushed through the book because i mean who really wants to spend time with people they don't like","763":" wow really up in the air with how i feel about this one as a literary work it was brilliant ms disclafani created a deliciously enticing story one in fact that held my interest and kept me reading until the end i was not crazy about the main character thea i found she was self centered selfish and almost to the extreme of being narcissistic in her behavior the book was somewhat depressing and tragic for me as i tend to lean toward more positive and uplifting stories i am glad i read the book though and may even look to read more from this author in the future","764":"this is a book is set in the south at an all girls school though at a very different time and thus different mindset from the place with which i am more familiar one theme the book explores is the extent to which something drastic and how you and your family interpret that does or does not define you","765":"i liked the way it started out but halfway through the plot took a turn that made me loathe the main character and it all became so trite annoying and predictable i finished it anyway hoping it would get better but was only relieved that it was over bummer","766":" one of the first things my mother did when she brought me home from the hospital after i was born was to go to the barn and see the horses there's even a picture of me held against her chest while she's on horseback that was an image from the book that resonated with me because i have that picture that's a life i can understand not the part about being a twin or what happened before thea was sent away to yonahlossee but the horses and that connection that you can have with them it's something my mother gave to me just as thea had inherited it from her mother i can see where this might be a difficult book for some but to me thea came across exactly as she was supposed to detached she'd been so isolated with only her twin brother and a male cousin in her age group and only her parents or aunt and uncle for any sort of socializing it's not for nothing that her father says he hopes she learns how to be around other girls while she's away she has no idea how to interact with anyone other than her family and that extremely limited social circle she's not whiny or entitled she's overly sheltered and a mirror to the backwoods appalachia people mentioned in the book it isn't her looking down on them she says she can understand it she is also the same as they are apart from the money that her family still retains at the time this is set mostly in yonahlossee but the narrator is looking back over what happened so there is a bit of back and forth as things are slowly revealed it's definitely a slow burn on that front but you get a glimpse of the start of the depression from the microcosm of not only thea's small family but the slightly larger slice of the world at yonahlossee there we're introduced to everything from the maids and scholarship girls to the top of the upper crust of southern society thea has a plethora of issues but if you pay attention to where she comes from and how she was raised and isolated it's easy to see where most of them come from she also makes bad decisions but in the end she grows though we only see the beginning of that growth just the edges as she skims over everything that came after to the point where she's recounting it all for the reader it's more than coming of age or boarding school or horses or a limited historical study but it's also not the flaily perfection of a 5 star still i'd give it a strong 4 or 4 5 stars","767":"i was disappointed in this book i read such great reviews about it and was expected a great book not so much","768":"the author did such a wonderful job with character development and setting at times i felt i was thea wondering how to fit in at camp wondering why my parents sent me there trying to sort out my past feelings for my cousin george and my current feelings for the director of the camp what a great coming of age novel in a unique setting it was refreshing to read that girls way back then were naughty too","769":"good discussion book book club book page turner mary you'd like this","770":"i enjoyed this tremendously and two weeks later am still thinking on the characters the settings and the plot very beautifully written totally evoked two gorgeous settings florida and the town in north carolina where my grandparents retired stunning scenery both tropical and mountainous the emotional complexity of one girls actions and her lack of understanding of consequences ripped apart two families and endanger a third highly recommend","771":" it took me a little time to warm up to the characters but i ended up super engrossed in the story and wanting to know how everything wraps up while not always a likable character thea is interesting and dynamic and ultimately won me over it's pretty wild imagining how life must have been for girls in the early 1900s in the states sheltered from the depression and just about everything else including boys life at yonahlossee is a world of its own and disclafani does a great job immersing the reader in that environment originally i'd assumed i'd like the book because of the horses but i actually wasn't such a huge fan of how thea interacts with her horse it's certainly no black beauty story thea pretty much wants to be the fastest and best on horseback and has the courage and recklessness it takes to do so and to get everything else she wants too sometimes the consequences are greater than expected which we see as thea's background story is slowly unveiled throughout the first half of the book personally i figured out what must have happened in thea's past pretty quickly and didn't think the mystery had to be drawn out for so long but at the same time the flashbacks are cleverly done thea's initial homesickness is complicated by her memories of the recent past and how her family has essentially thrown her out of the home a coming of age story beyond all else the yonahlossee riding camp for girls does a marvelous job looking at both the pleasures and social pressures thea and the other girls must face when heading towards adulthood this book is refreshing in its unhesitating exploration of female sexuality and the tightropes girls walk to remain in good graces with their families while simultaneously discovering who they are underneath all the layers of convention and repression","772":"my mom lives in western north carolina and recommended this book to me otherwise i don't think it would have come up on my radar it was a good summer read and the writing was better than average the story itself was pretty predictable and it's hard to comprehend the scandal for thea in this day and age overall a good summer read","773":"an impressive debut novel full of mystery southern family skeletons boarding school girls and an ill behaved headmaster was completely captivated by thea's weird upbringing with her odd twin brother leading to her abandonment at a posh but isolated riding camp school and at the mercy of an ill behaved headmaster the most atmospheric novel i've read in a while","774":"i can tell this is a book that's going to be haunting me for a very long time it's extremely atmospheric the writing is engrossing which is fitting seeing as part of the book is really a mystery an investigation into the past into what brought thea to the camp it's also a tale of the great depression and how different people from all paths of society were affected i was really excited to read this book as i absolutely love school stories and horses and this has both though i wouldn't say that's the main theme rather it's a great support to the main theme which is thea's coming of age if a potentially very unlikeable narrator doesn't put you off you should give this a go but it's not a novel for everybody it's sad and heavy and odd it explores family dynamics in a surprising way the characters are so well depicted and the pace so right it was really hard not to read this in one sitting very riveting five stars for the strong impression it left on me though in a way it's very much the opposite of a comfort read","775":"this book could have been much more than it was i tried very hard to really like it but was unable to do so it was about 100 pages too long i found myself skipping entire paragraphs in the last 75 100 pages the premise was interesting u0026amp intriguing but i found that any writing about events and feelings merely skimmed the surface we are let in too late and not enough as to why the decision was made to send thea away her mother's story could have been very interesting and added an entire other dimension to the book in fact it may have helped us to understand the relationship she had with her mother if we knew more about her but alas that too seemed a footnote and what of her relationship with her father thea did not come to be who she was in a vacuum but we are not entitled to know anything of substance about how she became to behave the way she did and how she came to have the thoughts she had disappointed","776":" you should remember that the sins of youth seem very far away when you are no longer young i devoured this book it is an engaging coming of age story about a teenaged girl's struggle to not let a mistake define the rest of her life with a little bit of illicit romance mixed in the story is well paced and has a strong setting because the story is partially set at an equestrian school there is a lot of description of all things horses which i skimmed over but i loved the sense of place and thea's struggle to put her life back together","777":"http www snowwhiteofmoon fr 2015 02","778":"my first impressions were very good i love the style of the cover which is always a big plus i'd heard critics comparing yrcfg to the great gatsby which is my all time favourite novel so i was instantly intruiged and had very high expectations the story starts off very slowly building the suspense and entwining plot details into the present day story it does take a while for the main focus of the story to get started so the first 100 pages or so are mainly character development and setting not that this is a bad thing disclafani's descriptions are faultless and the characters are very three dimensional when the plot finally starts moving it does at a startling pace i was hooked and didn't put the book down until i'd finished my only gripe is that i found it difficult to connect with the main protagonist though i feel that the distance was somewhat intentional on the same level as gatsby i don't think so but it's a great read it keeps the reader hooked and moves along with ferocity towards the ending which i for one was not expecting a great read and a fabulous first novel tl dr4 5 great story great setting and beautifully written","779":"this book was fascinating not an absolute must read but a great vacation book","780":"maybe not great literature but it was a great read for a lazy weekend","781":" a very self contained young woman tells of a year in her depression era life during this year she shatters the safety of her home and family attends a girls' school rides horses and comes into her own like most young adolescents she is extremely observant and thoughtful and she is also extremely articulate it is an interesting place and time that said the most important thing i learned from this book is the fact that pickle forks have 3 tines i was finished with this book 'way before the writer was","782":"i'm not sure how this book can be called sexy light on the action and suspense in the beginning the reader can predict what happened in thea's family","783":"sad book about the function dysfunction of family life in the 20's listened to it on audible and the reader was a bit monotone not a happy ending so i wouldn't recommend it","784":"an okay summer read that took a little too much time to unwind","785":"this was one of the best books i've ever read","786":"this review has been hidden because it contains spoilers to view it click here a book about a thoroughly unlikable heroine who is selfish impulsive illogical judgmental and spoiled i hate it already add in incest sorry if i'm being a prude here but sex with your 1st cousin is incest to me and a sexual relationship between the 15 year old main character and her 30 something year old schoolmaster statutory rape in most places these days and i'm wondering what i'm supposed to get out of this book is it supposed to be titillating to me am i being set up for one a book about a thoroughly unlikable heroine who is selfish impulsive illogical judgmental and spoiled i hate it already add in incest sorry if i'm being a prude here but sex with your 1st cousin is incest to me and a sexual relationship between the 15 year old main character and her 30 something year old schoolmaster statutory rape in most places these days and i'm wondering what i'm supposed to get out of this book is it supposed to be titillating to me am i being set up for one of those hidden camera stings like to catch a predator it's certainly not romantic like it has been advertised on top of these obvious disasters the relationships in this book are the worst developed relationships i've read it a book that other people said was good in well maybe forever it makes no sense that thea loves mr holmes other than because he's handsome maybe or he's an authority figure only guy around forbidden fruit she's a teenager and doesn't make good decisions yet true enough but yawn also the supposed bond between thea and sam is just something we have to assume is strong it's never developed they have no meaningful regular interactions just emotional fallout from all the mess that happens can i do the mental work of assuming twins have a bond that is deeper than anything i can imagine yes but that is not why i read books i read books so a skilled storyteller can show me an interesting enlightening engaging story this author does no work other than throw ideas of characters at you and trickle a predictable boring story out across 389 pages which is 100 pages too many i should have listen to my friend who told me this book was stupid but i read it anyway who's stupid now more","787":"i do not remember how i came across this book but i thought that it had been recommended it to me it turned out to be one of the worst books i have ever read i only soldiered through to the end because i thought that it must surely have some redeeming value the plot was very rudimentary and not particularly interesting the story was set in the late 20's and early 30's and held very little relevance to day's society yet imparted very little interesting information about that time period the poorly veiled scandal of the book seemed just an excuse to write what might have been considered erotica in the 20's and 30's but was in fact just boring don't bother","788":" people seem to really dislike this book based on the most recent reviews but i actually found it quite readable yes the narrator is self absorbed but she's also a teenage girl so i didn't go into this expecting her to be a paragon of selflessness and good decision making yes the story does plod along a bit but i have a penchant for novels that are more concerned about their characters' thoughts even those awful insecure whiny thoughts we all have from time to time than they are about page turning action i would agree we never delve deeply into anyone but thea and even then there isn't the sweeping character development or growth that we may have come to expect in coming of age tales but i wasn't particularly let down by that lack even my disappointment at not getting to the heart of sam was tempered by my understanding that no one is completely knowable to you not even your twin so leaving us feeling empty or lost in our relationship with him mirrored how thea would have felt in my opinion admittedly parts of the narrative are pretty f'd up and to some extent implausible i felt on occasion as if i were watching a train wreck or a depression era episode of maury povich but i kept reading so it seems that doesn't bother me as much as i'd like to think it should i'm not sure i would recommend this book to others but if someone indicated an interest in reading it i wouldn't tell them they shouldn't not exactly high praise but it could have been worse","789":"just an ok book the authors' rambling style of writing was just too distracting","790":"this book was an intriguing look at a teenage girl set during the great depression who is sent away from her family because of an indiscretion the writing kept me reading quickly but the subject matter felt uncomfortable there also wasn't a lot of detail about the time period","791":"i suppose this story had to be set in some time period so the depression was as good as any but the reader does not ever get a sense that this is the 1930s it could have been and would be more believable 30 years later the story of 15 going on 25 year old thea and how she destroys lives while finding her own sexuality is engrossing and probably all too realistic the author does a good job of keeping us reading to learn the reason thea was sent away","792":"this book was nothing but a glorified romance novel with lots of underage sex and yet i couldn't tear myself away disclafani writes well but the plot was lacking a good quick summer read","793":"great cover","794":"good not great lots of fuss about this title this summer and i was prompted to read it because of the favorable reviews it was a summer book with interest generated by the settings physical and historical thea is a complex character the maturation that takes place during her stay at the riding camp is believable the tragedy of her actions and their consequences was revealed in alternating episodes with the camp experience","795":"i read it thinking it might be interesting but only bothered finishing it because i was home sick and had nothing else boring predicable and ridiculous don't bother","796":"not sure what to think about this one it's definitely a test in patience which is fine if it's worth it but not sure this was some parts are beautifully written but mostly it's repetitive and doesn't make too much sense because she didn't explain all the way like her friendship with sissy there were not many scenes to show that they were actually friends she just magically was best friends with her and that confused me just one example and after almost 400 pages i still don't think i know thea at all or understand anything about her or sam why was sam so upset at her anyway i guess i just didn't really see what the big deal was probably because it was so built up i think if this had been more focused on the friendships instead of graphic sex this really could have been a great book there's a lot of promise","797":"interesting take on the coming of age story for a teenage girl at the beginning of the depression the book offered a unique take on sexuality privilege and how the two intermingle in a sheltered existence i liked it but could have done without the entire last chapter","798":"3 5 stars fascinating but unlikeable main character who i could never seem to get haunting though would make for an interesting bookclub discussion","799":"i loved this coming of age tale that explores family dynamics the life changing consequences of one's actions the limitations on girls and women during the depression and the difficulty of being a person who cannot accept the restrictions and limitations imposed by social mores thea is not bad or evil she simply wants more for herself than what society dictates she should want and in her recklessness and ignorance she hurts others irrevocably when she tries to get what she wants but she comes to accept and eventually embrace those consequences i loved the gritty realism of this book and highly recommend it","800":"loved it it is written looking back at theas's childhood with such great insight thoroughly enjoyed","801":"as punishment for her participation in a scandal thea is sent away from the security and shelter of her wealthy family's home in florida to a different world - to the yonahlossee riding camp for girls this is a summer camp boarding school set in the blue ridge mountains of north carolina it is meant as a place for the daughters of elite southern families thea has gone from the shelter of her family's orange groves to mingling in the mountains with many other girls at first she is desperate to go home but eventually she begins to adjust to yonahlossee she even develops a certain fondness for the school or at least for a couple of people at the school and it is interesting to see how the great depression changes the lives of her formerly wealthy classmates yet she also seems to act incredibly inappropriate at times she is so selfish and brazen with her developing sexuality in fact i found the sex scenes in the book to be really jarring this is not a romantic book at all i'm not sure why it was promoted as such i was disappointed with this book loved the cover though i am glad an older thea discusses her life at the end because she is not a character i would be interested in revisiting in a sequel","802":"fun quick summer read great literature it is not but it is a good page turner","803":"actually a 3 5 it was a really good book that made me want to keep reading but definitely could see why others may have found it slow i really liked the first 3 4 but the last 1 4 brought it down a star for me","804":" color me disappointed i found thea atwell to be a rather unsympathetic protagonist i liked her less and less as the story moved along she's highly self centered and her character arc only strengthened that trait in her even her supposedly self less act near the end seemed selfish rather than benevolent my impression is that the author wanted to show that thea was a strong modern woman in a time and place that was not ready for such a person but in the characterization somehow strength became mistakenly defined as egocentrism","805":"i really got into the book because of the writing she is a good writer plus there is a mystery but at the end my dislike of books where i hate the main characters kind of ruined it you start out by learning that thea is being sent to a riding camp sent away from her parents because she did something wrong you don't really fully learn until the end that keeps you reading oh but thea","806":"for me this just doesn't live up to the hype and could have easily been cut by 100 pages for a better read i almost gave up 3 4 times but kept reading and expecting more i was bored out of my mind several times with the slow pace and unimportant to the story passages oh well they can't all be masterpieces","807":"embarrassed i read this so bad","808":"i was really liking it but i think that it fell apart at the end the sexuality just seemed a little bit over the top","809":"terribly disappointing an interesting time and intriguing place but the author sacrificed both to a less than mediocre soap opera plot if i hadn't been bored to death by the first half of the book i'd have the energy to write more","810":" this book cannot rise above the lack of empathy one feels for the heroine selfsh amoral and downright destructive thea i know the reviews have said stuff such as transcendent coming of age first novel blah blah blah disagree thea does not grow as a character and in fact seems to regress the writing does a good job of creating a sense of place but the plot pretty much disintegrates into farfetched blather near the end since pretty much all the characters except dad and sam are unlikeable we don't really care thea is even mean to her horses on occasion and it's odd that an author who is allegedly an expert horsewoman would say a 21 year old horse is so decrepit it should be put down at its' great age a 21 year old stallion just won a national championship for arabs others are successfully shown as well and my 21 year old mare is peppy as ever with no health problems huh","811":"this book totally surprised me it was very sexual almost humid in how it was written weird word but that is what it made me think of i highly recommend it but think some folks may not like it at all might be offended by it or think it too simple i really liked it","812":"really a sad book of a family torn apart by one moment where emotions can't be controlled","813":"i was captured by this book in surprising ways i was drawn to the subject matter rich teenage girls in the 30's punished or protected by being sent to a secluded horse riding boarding camp near the appalachians but what unexpectedly drew me in was the flawed main character you wanted to pull for in spite of her bad choices you keep hoping for a happy ending or a lesson learned but that's not real life then is it naive and over protected teenagers do not usually make great decisions left to their own devices and that is part of growing up so much more difficult for girls during this era i loved the writing style moving seamlessly from present tense to past tense to unfold the story and create tension leaving you wanting answers really great read i hope this author writes another","814":"was left feeling deflated by the ending","815":"michiko kakutani's raves made me read this book and i am glad i did if only for the story of an adolescent almost as obssessed with horses as i am for years i rode a minimum of 2 hours every day this is a depression era coming of age story and that is where the conventionality ends the main character thea is selfish spoiled unpredictable and headstrong yet very real and very understandable her careless actions destroy lives including her own yet hold the seeds of an unknown freedom and possible unfettered future a fascinating read","816":"i liked the idea of this book a lot but it felt a little overwritten i actually liked thea as a character and felt like she got kind of a raw deal with her whole situation","817":" on the one hand i think this book deserves a higher rating it was very well written with a fascinating look into a place and time i had never imagined back in the depression when girls' education had no requirements or accountability because they were just girls no tests or grades just some subjects they needed to know to be able to speak intelligently to their future husbands' co workers and bosses and it is set here in the appalachian mountains near asheville the lead character is interesting it is a good book i finished it i didn't want to put it down but in the long run it left me feeling rather depressed and down and i wouldn't look for another one by this author despite her brilliance as a writer you might love it it deserves to be loved but i didn't","818":"more like a 3 5 read for book club it was great in the beginning got a little weird ended a little abruptly without much emotion","819":"this was the second book i've read lately where the first part of the book was a 4 5 star book and the second half was a 1 5 star book the beginning thea is sent away from her beloved central florida home after a family scandal she is enrolled at the camp of the title and for the first time in her life is exposed to other teenagers her own age this book is atmospheric and both depression era settings of the florida house and the camp in the hills of north carolina are evocative lush rich and alive thea's coming of age story is initially unique with the storyline of going from complete isolation to living 24 7 with a bunch of other girls while thea figures out her path i started to care for her but as the book went on and the secret is revealed and her later behavior at the camp seem out of character and unimaginable she goes from a likeable and relatable character to someone i can't put my finger on i was completely fed up with her at the end there are also horse bits not too much for someone who isn't too interested in horses which was nice","820":" this haunting novel made me happy to have grown up in the 1970's and 80's as a young woman though that time wasn't particularly idyllic either disclafani tells the story of thea atwell who has been sent away from her home in rural florida due to a misdeed that at first is unnamed and only hinted at it's 1930 and thea is sent to a riding camp school for girls in the hills of north carolina and though she thinks it is just for the summer her exile ends up being more permanent thea is heartbroken and misses her family twin brother and horse though she soon seeks solace by riding regularly in her new home as the novel unfolds we learn more of what led thea to be sent away and thea struggles to not repeat her \"mistakes \" the setting feels claustraphobic and thea is almost frustratingly real--a bundle of raw feelings desires and guilt set against the tumultous beginning of the great depression this story stayed with me for days after i finished it--again making me happy to have come of age in a more empowered time for women and happy that other things defined my teen years besides being made an object of beauty","821":"beautiful and lyrical writing but the voice of thea is not the voice of a teenage girl it's the voice of a middle aged dude pretending to know how a teenage girl thinks the author is a woman though i don't get it thea was not a character to whom i could relate so i really couldn't get into the story","822":"what was all the hype about i got halfway through this and just didn't care anymore","823":"three and a half starsi enjoyed this book but what i really felt was missing was more on sam i never really understood his character","824":"this started out really well but just spiraled down into a boring book","825":"interesting story of life for a wealthy southern teenager during the depression well written starts to fizzle toward the end as the big build up and revelation just doesn't hit the mark","826":"i'm not sure what it is that i didn't like about this book florida and we're talking about a part of florida that i'm pretty familiar with didn't feel right and thea was such a mixed up blend of naivete which one would expect and a worldly manipulation of others she wasn't a very likable girl was that on purpose there's certainly teen appeal here but in this year's crowded field of ya a competition i don't think rises above mediocre","827":"lurid and thick with suspense if you like downton abbey you will probably enjoy this american cousin","828":"stunning beautifully written and both achingly sad and intensely hopeful","829":" really loved the first half of this book but it got harder to read in the second half when main character thea atwell's life decisions become more and more cringe worthy and the reason she was sent to the yonahlossee camp becomes clear i think it was hard for me to read because thea is so different from me in every way personality emotionally morally i was also reminded of mistakes i made in my own youth that i would take back if i could still it was a beautifully written novel and it is clear that disclafani knows her horses in the end thea is a product of her environment and her upbringing the family farm and the limited human contact was enough for the rest of her family but thea just wanted more out of life than everyone around her","830":"sick of non linear predictable stories ugh","831":"1930 and thea atwell is sent away to a boarding school for girls she spends a year living in the mountains among girls which are both foreign to her because she's from florida and has a twin brother but no sisters she's sent away for being bad and not meeting the expectations of her family who tried to shelter her and her twin from the outside world thea's choices at home and later at school irrevocably damage her family but she finds the desire for a life on her own terms","832":"beautiful and captivating reads like a sultry summer night in fl unveiling its secrets slowly thea is a real complex coming of age character i didn't want the book to end","833":"this review has been hidden because it contains spoilers to view it click here oh what to say i wanted so much to like this book i did like parts of it and for the most part i enjoyed the writing in spite of the fact that she's sneaky and spoiled i liked the main character the desire to know her secret kept me reading through a portion of the book that i thought was pretty awful followed by more awful portions but i had to know what becomes of thea had i not enjoyed the start of the story the promise of the tale i would have put the book down unfinished spoil oh what to say i wanted so much to like this book i did like parts of it and for the most part i enjoyed the writing in spite of the fact that she's sneaky and spoiled i liked the main character the desire to know her secret kept me reading through a portion of the book that i thought was pretty awful followed by more awful portions but i had to know what becomes of thea had i not enjoyed the start of the story the promise of the tale i would have put the book down unfinished spoiler alert maybe i read the wrong reviews but the book was more explicit than i expected more","834":"i wanted to love this book but turns out it's yucky","835":"i would give this book a 3 5 rating if i could it is not a warm and fuzzy story and will make you uncomfortable at times but i read the last 10 pages out loud my favorite of the story","836":" the yonahlossee riding camp for girls is a coming of age story set in the 1930s depression era but unlike most coming of age stories set in this time period the main character is rich fifteen year old thea atwell and her twin brother sam have grown up in a sheltered and privileged environment among the orange groves in florida her father is a doctor her mother the beautiful doctor's wife who likes to spend her time gardening thea rides horses and brother sam loves to explore the woods and commune with nature for thea her brother georgie and cousin sam are pretty much her only exposure to other kids her age early on it is clear something has happened involving thea without notice her parents send her away to an equestrienne camp for southern debutantes in the blue ridge mountains of north carolina when thea realizes that the camp is also a boarding school she is puzzled and angry about her parent's decision while she does make friends with some of the girls and becomes very friendly with the headmaster and his family life is quite different for her there while her family is still very wealthy other rich kids have seen their families lose everything and must leave the camp time away from family allows thea the opportunity to reflect on events leading up to her being sent away from her family the story weaves back and forth from thea's life at home in florida and the months before she was sent away to the one year she spent at the riding camp boarding school at the heart of the story is the question that readers will want answers to why was thea sent away readers will get the answer to that question but for me it happened just a little to early into the story i would have preferred if it had evolved more like a good mystery but it is still a good story definitely a character driven novel for me there was a feeling of tension throughout it was also a book that really had so many elements that i like reading about a story of social class a family drama young love and coming of age all which takes place in a time when so many people have lost everything yet for the family at the center of this story all they had to worry about was minimizing the potential of public humiliation told in the first person from thea's pov i thought thea made for an interesting character i liked how headstrong she was for a young girl considering how sheltered she was i enjoyed how she grew and evolved throughout the story i thought this book was a good read and would make a good book club selection as well anton disclafani is a debut author that i hope to read more of in the future try it","837":"coming of age story set during the great depression about a fairly wealthy daughter sent away from her twin brother and parents after she does something scandalous","838":" competent if occasionally precious writing a thin plot and an unsympathetic protagonist in a very long book approaching 400 pages in the 1930s fifteeen year old thea atwell is sent off from a privileged and rarefied existence in florida to an exclusive girls' camp school in the carolinas as punishment after a series of events twin brother sam's fate is to be preferred by his parents and kept behind though he too has been pivotal in his sister's removal from the family home thea's banishment is related to her burgeoning sexuality and a serious accident which causes an irreparable rift in her family however at camp thea's sexuality or shall we say her nature of being the girl who wants too much continues to spur her on not surprisingly given the title there is a great deal to do with horses and riding in this novel more than a small chore to read if you're not a horse lover i think the book could've been cut to half its length even then i wouldn't recommend it there's something missing an emotional heart i'd say it occurs to me that a far more interesting character than thea is her mother who we learn by the end has a past of her own i would've been interested in finding out more about that past consider passing on this book or borrow it from the library if you must","839":"compusively readable because of a life changing event in the protagonist's adolescence that is slowly teased out in the storyline i was somewhat disappointed with the ending but overall an engaging read","840":"characterizations were well done and having been sent to camp against my will by parents who thought it would be good for me i could relate","841":"did the audio version of this story ever have me hooked somehow though at the end i was left feeling like i didn't really know what had happened and that it had been owed to me i saw someone else's review that they thought the main character was cruel but i didn't get that in fact she seemed more real more dynamic than most of the main characters i've read lately excellent writing","842":"could not get into this book kept waiting for something anything to draw me into the story and it never happened just gave up","843":"a dark and sometimes disturbing novel telling the story of a girl unknowingly stifled by her confined life as she starts to push boundaries to discover herself as an individual","844":"this book was so interesting and i loved the dynamics of the families and of the girls at the school what i didn't like was how sexually explicit it was a bit too much for me and that brought the ranking down","845":"fanfreakingtastic was so sad it ended really great writing makes you feel like you are living this story","846":"a sympathetic coming of age story what can happen as a result of unrealistic isolation as a form of protection the unrealistic way this girl lived in both parts of her life different setting same intention same result fascinating","847":" this book was enjoyable and a quick read but i did find it a little disappointing for my taste it's a typical coming of age novel so when the plot isn't anything terribly new i really look to the characters to push the story along thea didn't really do that for me she's is a very unlikable character and even if you overlook her mistakes in the past i thought that some of her actions at the camp were pretty terrible despite this however i kept turning the pages to see what would happen next definitely a guilty pleasure sort of book","848":"i really enjoyed this coming of age tale set in southern high society in the 1930s family scandals sexuality friendships and horses made the plot move quickly","849":"i liked this book as a school librarian i most often read young adult literature which is so vastly different from adult fiction it takes time for me to adjust to the slower pace of adult books that said i loved feeling immersed in life in the 30's in the southern us i grew to care about the characters and began to feel at home at yonahlossee riding camp for girls","850":" in 1930 15 year old thea's parents send her away from everything she has ever known her idyllic rural florida home her twin brother sam her beloved pony after an incident that tears her family apart what occurred is revealed slowly as the novel moves back and forth between thea's new surroundings at yonahlossee a girl's boarding school in the mountains of north carolina and her reflections on the life changing events that resulted in her exile the gradual revelation of what occurred in florida provides some suspense but at times this novel seemed a bit slow going thea is the most vividly drawn character in this story told from her point of view others characters are more sketchily drawn an evocative melancholy coming of age novel that explores complex family relationships consequences of actions emerging adolescent sexuality has potential to provoke an interesting group discussion reminded me somewhat of the round house as both books focus on teenage characters dealing with serious ethical questions though erdich's book is superior to this debut novel","851":"found this book from it's review in the ny times started by intending to read for a few minutes at bedtime before i knew it page 100 then a few pages at a time why am i reading this it's pretty bad picked it up again last night that was about 10pm at 3am finally blinked i was finished don't have the least clue why i was so intrigued and couldn't put down any book that transcends my vision problem must have literary merit a coming of age novel about a southern twin isolated in childhood from any social interaction except her parents her fraternal twin brother and a handsome cousin schooled at home a recipe for disaster when normal instincts come to the fore u0026amp nature takes it's course she's banished to a 'riding camp' for wealthy young girls from the south further explorations mistakes disasters etc ensue all the while maturing her her insight ability to overcome emotional instincts u0026amp be rational come to the fore u0026amp enable her to be the strongest member of her family and thus able to find her own way in the world a memorable read and intriguing to me because i still don't have the faintest idea why this book was so fascinating a read for me while reading i kept thinking this really isn't very good but couldn't put down","852":"i had heard great things about this book so was excited to read it amazed at the bad reviews on goodreads though i can see where they are coming from though the book was fairly predictable i figured out the tragedy early on i found it well written and sexy thea was likable and i sympathized with her great coming of age novel set in a well known era but told from a new point of view i'd suggest picking this book up","853":"turning of age book set in the depression fast and moderately good read","854":"after i finished this book i looked at the reviews from other goodreads members and was surprised at the disparity this is definitely a love it or hate it book the narrator thea is a young girl coming of age and confronting her sexuality during the 1930's in florida she is an avid equestrian and after a family tragedy she is sent to a private riding camp school for girls of means in north carolina the girls with few exceptions are from families that are mostly immune from the depression thea's father is a doctor whom she misses as well as her twin brother sam her relationship with her mother is somewhat strained this story meanders through thea's past and present and made me anxious to get to the end to discover what had happened that caused her parents to send her away i thought it was a good book and cannot understand the one star reviews","855":"i do not put books down very often i feel like i'm giving up and i'm not good at that i love the way she writes but the character was so hellbent on doing things that were so wrong that i couldn't keep reading it it was so creepy and i had to read something else before going to bed very odd i have a copy i would be happy to pass along if anyone wants to give it a try","856":" i just finished this novel i was drawn to it by a recommendation from jennifer weiner i'm not really sure how i feel about this story thea is a young girl who has been sent to a boarding school because of something that had happened to her at home the time is 1930 the beginning of the depression she had lived in the heat and isolation in florida and went north to this camp boarding school thea is an avid horseback rider as are some of the other girls in the school the author reveals details of the circumstances which led to thea's tenure at the school in bits and pieces as the story is woven back and forth in time as the plot progresses the reader is given enough information to guess what has precipitated thea being sent away from her parents and twin brother but the exact events aren't revealed until quite late in the book this is a coming of age story set in a dark period of history the backdrop of the economic situation is important as these privileged girls are forced to deal with its impact on their social status the writing and descriptions are vivid and realistic and the character development is intense at times it is difficult to like or sympathize with thea as she challenges the implicit expectations and standards by going after what she wants no matter what as a debut novel it is very well written i found it to be a slow and intense read","857":"perhaps i am the world's biggest prude but there was a definite ick factor to most of the relationships in this book sexual and otherwise came away thinking the author had ruined an otherwise good book with too much detail and a sort of trite and hurried ending","858":" this book was okay for light reading its a romance novel i did notice some errors in the historical accuracy for example the main character tries on ear rings that are for pierced ears but during the 30's pierced ears were only used by bad girls and our main character is from an upstanding family she would not have had pierced ears piercings only became popular again during the 1970's they had lost popularity in the 1920's but that is just me knit picking i also was lost on what she was supposed to have learned from her experiences for me this one was pretty much a thumbs down","859":" i love books that are dark and don't have nice tied up happy endings but there are several things that kept me from loving this book i get the fact that due to her isolated childhood and rigid parents she would not grow up understanding appropriate sexual boundaries but at times the sex was overstated two pages to the end we have yet another sex scene also could there have been one adult in the whole book who acted like an adult i also felt the sam character was underdeveloped for his actions to be so central to the story the reader needed more insight into his head finally the ending seems like she just did not know what to do with the family once they are back together so she just jumps ahead to the future and describes what happens to them better to just have ended it with thea going away and her future uncertain this is one of those could have been sooo much better books i do think disclfani does have great potential as a writer and perhaps will improve with future books i know a lot of reviews had problems with the horse scenes but since i know nothing about horses i enjoyed those scenes quite a bit","860":"the book was interesting and then seemed like the author was done or tired of writing and just finished it a disappointing rushed ending","861":"enjoyed but didn't love however i keep thinking back to the mother and her role in the events that took place so i guess when you keep going back to a story in your mind it's one you liked right beautifully written","862":"for a heroine who had rarely interacted with anyone but her family before she arrives at yonahlossee thea fits seamlessly into the all girl equestrienne school avoiding most rivalries easily and improbably the book worked best for me depicting the camp and least well when it dwelled on thea's adolescent sexual longings and fumblings if she was old enough to know what she was doing as the author implies her actions are unforgivable and foreshadow a lifetime of inappropriate behavior","863":"just could not get into this book","864":"spoilers this book mostly mad me feel sad for sam the brother who is living in the shadow of his sister thea he falls victim to her manipulations and is abandoned by her when she chooses her cousin over him it speaks to his character that he still defends her but it's ultimately a sad story i think the mother was at least partially to blame for not exposing these children to the ways of the world and outside life reminds me of flowers in the attic and thea is not a sympathetic or likable character she is selfish and pretends not to grasp situations but yet makes decisions based on her limited understanding a true sign of immaturity the incestuousness in this book was rampant and quite frankly disgusting i skipped reading several pages because i am not someone who enjoys reading that sort if thing i wished i hadn't read it at all it left me quite sad and melancholy","865":"i cannot remember the last character i hated this much","866":"read it in 2 days","867":"a right girl i wonder who that is and where you would find her this was a gorgeous book with so many excellent turns of phrase i truly enjoyed the writing it took me a while to decide whether i loved it or felt kind of meh about it but a few days after i finished reading it i realized how much i enjoyed it definitely a great pick for a book club and i enjoyed most of all that the ending was true to life not wrapped up in a neat little bow","868":" spoilers below i wouldn't read this one again there were parts that i enjoyed the author is particularly gifted at describing horseback riding but i feel that there was an unnecessary emphasis on the main character's sexual awakening that was frankly gratuitous i'm sure that sounds old fashioned but the idea of a 15 16 year old girl and the adult man she has an affair with please this isn't lolita and we don't need that theme glorified as literature i was dissapointed as it is clear that the author is a strong storyteller i just wonder if she'll be able to follow this one up with something i'd likely read probably not","869":"i enjoyed this book wasn't sure of it at first but turned into a novel i didn't want to put down i like reading about high society and this look into high society in the 1930s was interesting i had a feeling i knew where the plot was headed and the back story as well but i enjoyed it nonetheless i also learned a little more about horses and dressage","870":"coming of age story set in 1930's north carolina by the end i was flying through the pages but it took me about 100 pages to get into it so it was a bit of a slow buildup","871":"actually more like 3 5 stars i went into it without any expectations unlike it seems a lot of other readers it was a good coming of age story i didn't mind the main character narrator she seemed to act and think like a typical teen to me","872":"predictable and tiring i can't really say why i continued reading after the first few chapters and the last few were torture i suppose i was hopeful the author would wrap up all the tedium with a brilliant ending silly me","873":"a coming of age book that is a little too shocking","874":"i've read a few reviews that say this book sucks because they didn't like thea for me a novel is only as compelling as its main character and weather thea was a good person or not is much less interesting than baring her imperfections in the course of telling her story i recommended gone girl to my mom and when she was finished with it she told me i hated that book everyone was horrible and i said but you liked the story right it's no fun if everyone's always on their best behavior","875":"what is this book even about i mean i get it she's trying to evoke a certain time and tell the tale of a family with the underlying secret about why thea gets sent away but mostly i just thought this was awful the best part are the last few chapters but it just takes so long to get there pages and pages of wordy painful description i honestly skimmed the second half of the book just to find out the details of thea's past","876":"excellent debut set in the 1930's at a posh boarding school for upper class girls the country is on the brink of the great depression and fifteen year old thea atwell has been sent away by her parents for bad behavior as a reader i am left with the feeling of wonder did i like thea atwell at times i wanted more from the character emotion and feelings well written i am eagerly anticipating more novels by this author","877":"i really enjoyed this story of a girl coming of age and would have given it an extra star if the end had been stronger recommend","878":"i enjoyed the story but i felt the story was too long if you have such a long book 388 pages i would have liked to see sub plots more developed","879":"loved this haunting evocative coming of age that involved a family mystery terrible dysfunction sexual awakening and horseback riding all set in a very exotic to me setting of the 1920s south thanks to novelist friend holly robinson who recommended it to me","880":"this story takes place during the great depression an overly sexual 15 year old is sent to camp to remove her from her scandal having sex with her cousin she continues following her desires at camp by falling in love with the headmaster","881":"i thought this book was creepy and wrong i finished it but wished i had never started it sexy yuck","882":"sexy suspenseful and beautifully written debut novel in my late twenties i was surprised how empowered i was by thea atwell's unique yet classic coming of age story as she says at yonahlossee i learned the lesson that i had started to teach myself at home my life was mine and i had to lay claim to it a great reminder for us all at any age","883":"a quasi mystery about the events that led to a young woman being brought to this riding camp this was an odd read for me i read it to the end but don't really know why it intrigued me enough to continue but the story didn't really satisfy i did not care for the main character thea she did nothing that made me want to care for her and i felt thea mother's identification with her toward the end was odd and contrived","884":"i read this on my flights to and from chicago it was a perfect escape to a different world while crammed on a plane it's not excellent literature by any stretch of the imagination and the main character won't win any awards for being noble but she sounds like a rather typical 16 year old girl","885":"this had such promise but in the end just fell flat it would have been better if she'd elaborated on thea post yonahlossee depression","886":"you will probably need a strong constitution to read this because things get weird between the main protagonist and her cousin and she turns out to be kind of a hoe","887":"really wanted to love this but it fell short for me i do however look forward to future books from this promising author","888":"characterizations were well done and having been sent off to camp against my will at 11 yo i could relate","889":"i was disappointed by how the story ended very anticlimactic however i did like the main character and enjoyed the majority of the book where she was at camp","890":"this authors name sounded so like a mans that i was disturbed enough to google to find out how why a man would write some of the gratuitous u0026amp poorly written sex scenes it was a woman which makes sense but overall the writing plot and tone if this book make it a must miss i enjoyed first few chapters then it all started to go south pun intended","891":"i'm being generous with three stars over descriptive and about 150 pages too long intriguing story but the reader gets bored waiting for it to play out","892":"so i'm giving this 3 stars only because i think this would make a great book club choice it is very well written but i didn't really care for the main character i could barely identify with her i loved the setting 1930 north carolina mountains what an unusual setting for a coming of age novel there are so many layers to this novel coming of age options for women in the early 20th century the depression family and the realization that your family isn't always the best one for you twins oh somebody i know hurry up and read this so we can chat about it","893":"i was completely hooked after the first chapter as i read this in my hammock i somehow was brought back to my preteen summers reading in the summer breeze this is not a child's or adolescent's book but something about it made me feel like i was 12 and savoring a fantastic book","894":"some parts were uncomfortable to read but overall i really enjoyed this book kind of a blend of prep and the art of fielding though not as good as either of those","895":"it was okay but a little disappointing the big secret was not very surprising","896":" i wish i had read this book in my 20s the story was very engrossing other reviews have criticised it for dragging out the exact transgression which had brought thea to the camp i disagree i felt the nature of what she had done was obvious from the beginning given how she felt towards herself the details were revealed as thea found other context in her life to compare them to we read the details as thea began to understand her own self powerful message though you choose to wallow in guilt forgive the child you were the old children you were raised by and live the life you choose for yourself","897":" this is a tale of a young girl on the edge of becoming a woman but what it really is all about is power there must be an aha moment when young women realize the power they have over men this power leads them to do reckless things with lasting consequences but while it lasts it is glorious at first i thought thea atwell was a victim coming from a well off family even by the great depression standards innocent and naive of the ways of the world her childhood spent in seclusion with only her twin brother and horse to keep her company i thought thea was a babe in the woods when cousin georgie came they became a dangerous triangle and as we know trios never work out someone is always alone with hurt feelings thea's time spent at the yonahlossee riding camp for girls where her mother grew up is where the family sends thea after the thing happens and it is there that she begins to control her own destiny and hone in on that power over men i love anton diclafani's writing style she paints a vivid picture of thea's natural habitat and that of the camp in the mountains the relationships that thea has with all the women there from mrs holmes the other campers and the younger holmes girls are very real and all help tell the transformation that thea goes through the book travels back and forth from her present day upheaval to north carolina back to the events in florida that forced her to exit i am looking forward to ms disclafani's next book i was able to read the advance copy of this book out in june thanks to the first flights debut author program","898":"i kept wavering between two and three stars for this book it was written well enough to deserve higher than most of my two star rated books and i was willing to give points for having a consistently unsympathetic female protagonist but the message that to be happy take what you want no matter who is hurt is a little discomforting","899":" i have to be honest and say that i didn't like this at all imagine reading a pony club book with added sex it combines a coming of age story with a school story albeit set in a riding school it's florida in the 1920s although you wouldn't know it it feels more like the 1970s thea has been banished from home for some misdemeanour with a boy the reader doesn't learn the full story until later in the novel she is sent to the yonahlossee riding school for girls deep in the blue ridge mountains a boarding school for girls with added horses as we progress through the novel the reader begins to learn why thea has been sent away from home but since she loves riding it doesn't seem a punishment for her to be sent there thea is a difficult character to like she's monumentally self obsessed and sex obsessed which makes her difficult to warm to there is an odd detached quality to the narration which might be called dream like except thea is too cold a narrator for that thea bonds with some of the girls at the camp and some of these girls are quite interesting but we never really get to know them so they pass in and out again without much incident the reader discovers most about thea's family the secrets and the lies hidden beneath the genteel southern exterior except her family are also fairly unlikeable perhaps her twin sam being the only tolerable one amongst them the yonahlossee riding school for girls had the feel of a virginia andrew's novel with the detached writing the strange family and inappropriate sexual relationships to be honest i found it a bit tacky","900":" this is a wonderful book its atmosphere reminded me especially in the beginning of work by gail godwin the yonahlossee riding camp for girls is the story of thea atwell a florida teen who has managed to make horrible decisions that led to family tragedy she is sent away to the north carolina camp and as she will learn school as much for her family as for herself i attended summer camp just up the road from the real yonahlossee during the '60s and i was blown away by this young author's pitch perfect creation of that atmosphere and relationships therein thea's sin and the consequences thereof are not fully explained for much of the book but disclafani manages to keep the story moving at a good clip until all is revealed my one complaint and it's a pretty big one is that i didn't like thea very much it can be easy forgive foolish adolescent behavior in a teen we love but thea just eluded me i won an advance reader's edition from the publisher through librarything com","901":"i loved this your life is no ones but yours","902":" critical reviews of this book point out that the main character doesn't learn from her mistakes thea has been sent away from her home in florida to an equestrian girls' boarding school in the north carolina mountains it's the 1930s mid depression and she is 15 years old it's pretty obvious that she has done something forbidden and disgraceful and it's also pretty obvious that means sex i enjoyed the descriptions and plot featuring the school and the other students thea's character is strongly equated with freedom the freedom she feels while riding especially and also recklessness","903":"it is rare when you find a book that discusses frnakly and takes seriously the sexuality of young girls on the verge of womanhood the way that disclafani slowly unfolds thea's backstory is effective it builds and builds mirroring thea's own sexual awakening that a young girl can have desires act on them and not be destroyed by them is dealt with frankly and without over romaticizing those desires i couldn't decide how i felt about thea's relationship with the headmaster not to mention her own cousin spoileru0026gt a part of me feels like i should be creeped out and a part of me simply accepts it i am not really an animal person so i can't comment on the girl horse dyanmic but it felt very authentic to me thea taking control of her life through her mastery of horses really worthwhile read but i have to admit the title makes it almost impossible for me to casually recommend it because i am always stumbling over the title","904":" yonahlossee is the story of thea a troubled teenaged girl who is sent away from her isolated home in central florida to a horse riding camp in the mountains of north carolina in the 1930s i'm not sure why i liked this book so much because there is a definite ick factor which begins to reveal itself pretty early on but disclafani's writing is so hypnotizing that i didn't really seem to care i hated living in florida as a child and only remember it being a wilted and flat setting a place just worn down by the unbearable heat but disclafani reminded me of its beauty too her sense of place is impeccable and you really get swept right up into the setting more so than the story at least for me anyway i guess thea is meant to be a girl living in the wrong place and time but i'm not so sure i think her actions would be as shocking now as they were in 1930","905":"i really enjoyed reading this book the author has a gift of showing us the depth of the main character","906":"this was a fast read a lush sexy evocative debut novel of family secrets and girls' school rituals set in the 1930s south slightly disturbing in behavior but the truth is this could and probably did happen more than families realized or would admit it will open your eyes","907":"well written captivating at times also took a bit too long to reach climax the tension which was definitely there dragged on for too long and in so doing lost its credibility overall strong somewhat dark coming of age story with equally strong supporting characters beautiful job of capturing ambience","908":"after reading such a range of reviews my curiosity was piqued while the writing was stiff stilted and often too sexually precocious for a 16 year old the story was fresh and structured to keep me interested if it was better written it would have been an easy 4 stars","909":" i work at a bookstore and after seeing a copy on the shelf noticed we had an advanced reader's copy in the staffroom free book might as well right it started with a great premise 15 year old girl in 1930 gets sent to summer camp of horseback riding after family tragedy but soon it spiraled downhill to my dismay as thea was proven spoiled and unwilling to learn from her mistakes perhaps it might have gone better if there was a moral at all there was again a promise that maybe thea would learn from her mistake prior to the book's beginning and apply it to her time at yonahlossee needless to say she did not not only did she make a very similar mistake she took it to new levels of oh my god thea what the hell were you thinking which left me wanting to shake her instead of comfort her as she expected her friends to do the only mildly likable character was her twin brother sam while sam was underdeveloped and two dimensional he had a sort of ambition and spark that thea seemed to love and hate at the same time i was very disappointed with the author's ending for sam it was underwhelming and disappointing to say the least i had dearly wanted success for sam and for thea to learn that not only did she have to live with her mistakes for the rest of her life but she permanently screwed up her relationship with sam whom she claimed to dearly love another aspect i would have liked to see was perhaps thea discovering a love for horses rather than arriving at camp with a love of riding perhaps if she had grown to love something something good at yonahlossee she would have had a more well rounded character all in all thea was quite the mary sue and while the concept seemed to have promise it was not well executed definitely a beachy fluff book for the summer not anything special that you can't find elsewhere","910":"after such good detail throughout the ending was a little flat and quick but i really enjoyed the book and thought it did a good job of capturing a time and place","911":"i would have given this book one star but the writing was excellent you felt like you were there but the story was figured out so quickly that you kept waiting for the book to be over and then because it was so obvious you thought ok something is going to happen never did i was so excited when the library called to say this book was in i guess i didn't read the right reviews ahead of time","912":"this review has been hidden because it contains spoilers to view it click here rich snooty sixteen year old has sex and has sex that's it to this book really oh there are horses and some grand tragedy that's basically had our heroine get sent off to a riding camp for rich and bored girls during the great depression but honestly that's humbug and i really wanted to like this thing and i would have too had there been something other than the whiny and horny not a good combination voice of our heroine thea but there isn't anything it's not even the least bit rich snooty sixteen year old has sex and has sex that's it to this book really oh there are horses and some grand tragedy that's basically had our heroine get sent off to a riding camp for rich and bored girls during the great depression but honestly that's humbug and i really wanted to like this thing and i would have too had there been something other than the whiny and horny not a good combination voice of our heroine thea but there isn't anything it's not even the least bit introspective the tragedy is hinted at from page 1 of the book i'd figured it out by the time all the players were introduced around page 20 and then it was just distracting the way the book continued to be coy about the thing for 350 pages more it's just not interesting not the way it's played out thea says she became a woman in the camp that would imply there being some conflict and her learning something about herself zilch she just continues to be horny carries on an affair with a headmaster who has three daughters and then leaves in disgrace of her choosing this time she doesn't deal with the unpleasantness that came before either the pervert headmaster even tells her that it wasn't her fault and that it was her parents to blame sure they're idiots but they didn't bring up a gem sorry to say the creep was only taking advantage of you darling most exceptional one i can't be the only person whose skin crawled when the headmaster says thea you're exceptional because she was wet when he touched her there's honestly nothing else distinguishing about her i would have felt sorry for her had the novel in any way seemed aware that she was used but it didn't seem so at least to me at least in the case of the pervy headmaster instead there's much crap laid at the foot of the parents who are of course batshit crazy and would not teach their daughter the impropriety of incest and would not deal with the inevitable consequences when they came about their actions are actually too silly to contemplate they live in the boondocks of florida have exactly zero visitors apart from their family the cousin thea boinked and his parents who would not step into their house after the tragedy thea's father is a physician who would be able to find out if thea was pregnant and perhaps figure out how to eliminate it properly and with no one being any wiser she could even have the baby and give it up without anyone knowing given how few people visit them the rational course of action would be to confine their horny child and wait it out until they can marry her off what do they do instead send her off to this riding camp full of gossipy girls who know after a minute in thea's presence that she was sent away because of a boy why did they send her off not because they knew thea had sex with this cousin but because they figured that maybe she did and maybe she was pregnant because of that from a physician father and a supposedly rational mother when the premise is so silly i'm really not sure i should even take this book seriously there's a twin in the equation who is the one who actually needs to be sent away preferably to an asylum he gets a free pass because they cover up his actions as an accident and the parents decide that it can be swept under the carpet sam the twin is actually interesting he comes across as a slightly weird boy someone who is supposedly not grown up but still observes the world around him much closer than anyone else supposes i got this from the few lines of dialogues the author actually writes for him he is definitely jealous of the closeness of thea and the cousin and he's the one most affected by the tragedy i would have loved to inhabit his mind to see why he did what he did if this book had to call for incest i would have liked the one between sam and thea there wouldn't even be a need for all the prurient scenes the unnaturally close bonding between them would have sufficed but there's not a bit about sam apart from thea's self obsessed narrative of events and there's even less about sam after the tragic event that separates them the pat explanation is that sam refuses to talk about it and thea is least interested in anything that doesn't affect her personally and directly a pity the horses i know nothing of riding but thea's treatment of horses felt like a punishment to the poor animals and the way she bragged about being an excellent horsewoman felt flat after description after description of how she wasn't particularly kind to the horse in question she wants to win so she runs her horse to the ground she's out of sorts read horny so who should feel the pinch of the whip and the cutting spurs but the poor horse it felt cruel and in this book needless the book also overused her name had i used the number of times someone called her by name for a drinking game i'd have died of alcohol poisoning much before the book ended the rest of the writing was repetitive and boring i did have some sympathy for the girl at the beginning of the book but the book dragged on interminably and some chapters down the line i just wanted it to finish it doesn't help too that take out the horses the sex and the self pity there's nothing in it it's set during the depression but how does thea get affected by it she has to sell her pony that she was outgrowing anyway a number of girls from the camp have to stop attending but they could just as easily have gone away for any other infraction it's a catch phrase nothing more most times i think that hype brings a book down for me i would maybe have enjoyed this book more than i did if i wasn't constantly asking myself why why was this book so hyped what was so overwhelmingly sensual about a creepy book that doesn't even scratch the surface of its protagonists i did not find whatever it was a disappointing book more","913":"3 1 2 stars this was a good read but i didn't love it it had a lot of themes i enjoy a young girl who loves horses coming of age as the nation experiences the great depression it is well written there is a good sense of place the characters are interesting and there are hints of things to come that make you want to read more","914":"glad to have finally read this well worth the time","915":"this book seems to be very polarizing i was totally engrossed with the story partly the idea of a riding camp cum school would have been my dream situation as a young girl and partly for the coming of age nature of the novel imagine a combination of the help the saddle club and prep i enjoy the idea of being a wealthy enlightened southern lady and also riding horses all day so i could not imagine a more interesting premise but every dream life has its problems the story starts with thea atwell arriving in north carolina to the yonahlossee yes this name is tedious camp she thinks of going to the camp as a punishment for her actions and destroying her family growing up extraordinarily wealthy in florida the only people she has every known is her family her mother father twin brother aunt uncle and cousin her world is so secluded and protected that leaving everything that she has ever known would be a punishment the author alludes to the cause of her punishment throughout the first half of the book which was smart otherwise readers would have been turned off by thea from the start thea believes that she has been sent away due to a lack of love from her family however the camp itself is like a dream yonahlossee is secluded in a different way from what thea has known her whole life ensconced in the mountains of north carolina it is set apart both by location and by the people all of the girls at the camp come from wealthy southern families whose worlds and lives are about to change dramatically with the great depression one girl after another leaves due to financial difficulties that they were never supposed to understand the girls were to attend the school to become pretty trophies for their husbands if they got an education along the way perfect but none of the girls took any classes in math or science how could those be useful for a lady the camp provides the backdrop for the discovery of why thea was sent to camp her voice ages as her understanding of girls boys and life changes the novel starts as a scared young girl and progresses to that of an independent woman while i could not put the book down for the first part of the book thea's awakening got a little creepy and then a little annoying by the end thea redeemed herself as she grew into her independence and sense of duty i especially recommend this for horse lovers","916":"i can't tell if i loves it or hated it i enjoyed the writing hated the protagonist","917":"i love a good boarding school book so i was excited for this one especially after hearing michiko kakutani liked it but it was not exactly what i was expecting and i thought the ending was too vague and kind of a let down so 3 stars","918":"interesting story thea is 15 and due to a family tragedy is sent to a riding camp in nc her twin brother remains home with their parents in florida they have lived a very isolated life home schooled etc thea's time at camp is a life changing experience for her as she grows up sometimes in not so appropriate ways","919":"i don't think this had a real grip with reality","920":"fifteen year old thea has grown up on a florida estate in the 1920s riding horses and hanging out with her twin brother and her cousin mostly isolated then comes 1930 as the world is crashing down around them they remain fairly isolated from it thanks to their mother's citrus farms but their cousin isn't so lucky as his father invested unwisely and then something terrible happens but you don't know what it is for a long time thea is sent off to the yonahlossee riding camp in the north carolina mountains turns out it is also a school and her parents don't intend to collect her in the fall although they don't bother to tell her that thea is being punished for an awful thing that happened back home which we readers don't find out the details of for quite some time in the meantime thea builds a new identity having girl friends for the first time roommates rivals and even an inappropriate crush she is obviously working out some of the trauma for herself through distance and physical activity but that can't last of course and the incident must eventually be dealt with some members of my book club found the incident quite graphic but i did not i was okay with it i did though think people overreacted a fair amount i really enjoyed the book so much more when she was at yonahlossee her mother i found cold and controlling her brother was odd and diffuse the book had some brilliant turns of phrase and really captured the timeframe well although at a horse camp like that it could have been any year in the previous 50 years as not much had changed in that time it was fascinating to see the relatively slow impact of the great depression on the students and the school as the year 1930 spun out with us knowing what they don't that this will not be a fast rebound and in fact will get worse before it gets better there were some flaws in the plotting and some unrealistic parts i found the cousin in particular to fluctuate times when he seemed so juvenile that i wondered if he were mentally handicapped to other times when he seemed overly mature thea was prickly to say the least but i liked her i liked her strength her ability to move forward no matter what and her determination not to be a victim","921":"i enjoyed reading this book definitely not a feel good book but it did provide a look at what was expected of a young woman of the depression era","922":"a slow moving but brutally frank coming of age story that really impressed me with the way that the protagonist followed a pretty unconventional path to coming into her own dare i call this a feminist novel yep i think i will","923":"this review has been hidden because it contains spoilers to view it click here this is a compelling read well designed and executed good characters foreshadowing and ultimately thought provoking so having said that a spoiler starting about 150 pages into the book there is incest infidelity and statutory rape by someone in a position of trust i don't know if i would have started the book if i knew that was all coming so now you have a choice","924":"certainly not a feel good book i thought it was very dark and sad i enjoyed the writing but the story line was depressing did not find the characters very likeable","925":"while the story was well written and very descriptive i just felt as if something were missing i also felt that some of the actions choices were over the top a good but not great book","926":" i'm really not sure about calling this a lush sexy evocative debut novel of family secrets and girls' school rituals set in the 1930s south most of the action in the book revolves around young girls gossip and horses it was a good book but those are not the adjectives i'd use thea is sent to yonahlossee for doing something mysterious for which her family can't forgive her the tenses she uses to refer to all her family members switch so that it's never quite clear whether everyone is alive the events that led to her exile are slowly revealed throughout the novel building them up so far i'm not sure that anything can meet the expectations i'd have preferred the truth told earlier with more of a focus on the current events or their lives before the event thea was a complex and interesting protagonist trying to work through the usual coming of age issues as well as melding her childhood freedom with the society expectations of southern life in the 30s many of her actions don't make sense logically but when are teenagers logical the rest of the characters were far more simplistic however i'm choosing to read that as thea's self centered view of the world i don't say this in a bad way she's dealing with so much that it's hard to focus on others the descriptions in sex scenes were workmanlike rather than sexy which worked for me thea's motivations weren't really about the sex and her partners had issues view spoiler i found the sleeping with the headmaster plot to be such a typical attempt at shock value the teenage girl 'seducing' the authority figure it's the type of thing we see all the time in fiction and less so in real life it belongs on the same cutting floor as fake rape accusations not appearing in this book hide spoiler a minor note the novel ends with a look at where thea's family members go in the future i had two issues with this 1 i was far more interested in what happened to the girls from the camp 2 these future events seem to be completely unaffected by this little event that happens next in history you know world war ii","927":" more elements of this book didn't work than otherwise but it will make for a salacious little beach read for the more highbrow 50 shades crowd and while trite and wooden in characterization and over inclusive with description it isn't quite a painful read in some ways it reminded me of a better executed sweet valley high novel a sexualized dive into the mind of the most envied girl in early 20th century riding school still make no mistake this fictional romp only barely earns the adjective literary","928":"wasn't exactly what i was expecting but can't tell you why but i did enjoy reading it","929":" i recommend this book to no one it dragged on at the end entire chapters too long it also sets the record for number of times the phrase natural world has been used in a novel where are the editors and i was compelled to keep reading the book to figure out what thea's big secret was but that's kind of cheating good books keep you turning the pages without aggressively hinting at a big secret view spoiler also spoiler alert don't read if lengthy descriptions of incest are troubling to you i can handle quite a bit but it just got icky living thea's sexual awakening with her very very close brother like cousin though the author is very skilled at writing intimate scenes also i don't buy what happened between sam and georgie i thought the big reveal would be that sam walked in on georgie and thea having sex assumed thea was being raped and then shot georgie maiming him in some way the way it happened sam had too much time to be enraged meaning i don't believe that just the words 'what we did would trigger such a prolonged violent reaction from sam he might have lunged after georgie yes but he wouldn't have continued at such a savage level given how he was described as peaceful loving sweet etc hide spoiler","930":" i was honestly pretty let down by this it was one of the it books from 2013 so i was expecting to love it but it really fell short of my expectations this book is narrated at a remove from the perspective of an adult character looking back over her life and the decisions she made when she was a teenager but it is told in the immediate first person tense with these occasional and jarring interjections from thea now that kind of ruin the flow and it is a sort of flabby read with scenes that neither progress the narrative nor show any real insight into character or period or purpose there is just something bloodless about this book it's not that there's no story here there is it's about thea a young girl who has lived for fifteen years in entitled luxury on an isolated estate in florida secure in the love of her doting parents beloved twin brother and her older cousin georgie riding her pony and wanting for nothing who becomes involved in a scandal and is sent away to riding camp as punishment as the wider country begins to feel the strain of the great depression it is about the long term aftereffects of the civil war on the southern leisure class and the expectations of young well bred ladies and how easily a reputation can be tarnished it is about the dawning realization that wealth and status are relative and not indefensible it is about that fragile state of sexual awakening of knowing and not knowing getting carried away into insalubrious situations that snowball and digging the pit of shame ever deeper not caring about the consequences which sounds like it should be excellent yeah but the problem is with the character thea seems to oscillate between naive and calculating kind and cold self assured and insecure on every other page it doesn't read like thea coming into her own and changing so much as an author who doesn't know what kind of response she wants the reader to have to her character is thea a wronged ingenue or a femme fatale she is both and it just doesn't wash it's as though there are two characters competing for the same story space the story weaves between thea's life at camp and her time at home before being sent away which will eventually relate the events that led to her getting sent away which is telegraphed pretty early so not really a shocker the only thing unifying the two storylines is the presence of horses horses horses horses there is a lot of detail about horses and riding the ways in which the rider develops a relationship with its mount through a combination of understanding the limitations of a horse's mental capacity and the rider's cruelty and the power that is felt once the rider overcomes the horse's reluctance and is established as the dominant of the two which you would think would have been very easy to then apply as a narrative motif to the relationships thea makes with other people but nope not really and the ending just a mess for me with no reason for the decisions she makes once she leaves yonahlossee and the biggest letdown of an epilogue ever not printed as such so i guess the biggest letdown of a closure ever really flat and bleak without purpose there are parts i really liked so it's not a two star or anything but after the first third or so once i started seeing its weaknesses i disengaged a little and perked up for the nice bits but then kind of submerged into reading for plot there were better books in 2013","931":"2 5 stars i was really excited to read this book and was so sure i'd like it i'm a horse girl after all but no first of all the horses and riding are hardly involved at all i know not a big deal to a lot of people but i was expecting to kind of instantly relate on the horse front there wasn't nearly enough character development and i found it hard to grasp who the characters really were they just weren't fleshed out well the only thing that kind of redeemed the book was the sort of mystery behind why thea was sent to the camp the author did a pretty good job at hinting around at it enough that i was invested in finishing the book spoiler also adultery is a particular pet peeve of mine in most cases it makes me hate the character s involved i know she was young but still not your first go round girlfriend and i couldn't understand why thea wasn't more regretful of what she had done she seemed so blase about it all especially the episode with her cousin shouldn't she have been devastated to lose her relationship with her twin brother","932":"i loved the writing style even when it was hard to empathize with the narrator it was so beautifully written","933":"there were times when i disliked thea intensely times when i felt very sorry for her and greatly disliked her parents and by the end i liked her a lot good writing even if it was slow at times and even if i hated what was happening so many layers and dynamic characters a book that made me think about life the choices we make and how events have an impact on us","934":"this was almost 5 stars for me one of the best books i've read this summer a real page turner and written very well","935":" loved certain things about this book but often found it exasperating thea atwell is a 15 year old girl from a wealthy florida family sent away to a boarding school for mysterious wrongdoings i didn't like the emphasis on this mystery constantly referred to but only explained near the end the setting is fascinating as thea is sent to the camp school in north carolina at the start of the great depression all of the yonahlossee girls come from wealthy families but as fortunes change some are weeded out the girls are taught to be ladies they practice riding and sheltered thea learns how to interact with other girls thea is a twin a fearless equestrienne a fierce competitor and just a girl i didn't always find her narration consistent or her character believable though i wanted to like both her and the story the relationship with mr holmes finally lost me i hung on because of the interesting perspective on women's history and the horses","936":"there is a shocking secret in the plot which was very easy to figure out the secret was exactly what you would guess after reading 30 pages however the author did a great job of capturing a very particular time and place the characters were interesting varied and sympathetic i stayed up late to finish which always gets an extra star from me","937":"i liked this book but not as much as i wanted too it started out with promise but i got bogged down in the middle i loved the main character and what she learned about herself but i just didn't connect with the story the way i wanted to","938":" the moving beautifully written story of thea a girl who's sent to a riding camp finishing school in appalachia as punishment for disappointing her family thea is such a well rounded appealing character frank about her good looks and what they mean driven by sex and willing to do dumb stuff to get the men she wants utterly believable in every way there's so much here to delight your 15 year old self horses cabins oranges dances secrets and a camp so well described you can picture every nook and cranny of it and you can enjoy all of this without feeling guilty or bored as you do when reading ya novels because the writing is literary and excellent and the themes are sophisticated plus there are tons of great sex scenes a few caveats i think some readers will find this book slow others will get annoyed by how long we have to wait to discover the big secret and still others will be turned off by the explicit sex but i didn't mind any of these things and i hope you won't either","939":" this book started off slow for me it actually took me a couple of tries to get into it but once the story started picking up i couldn't put it down thea atwell is a 15 year old girl who grew up isolated on a remote piece of land in florida with her family during the 1930's she's only ever really known her twin brother sam her parents aunt uncle and cousin georgie she's sent away to a riding camp in the nc mountains amidst a scandal which isn't paraded for the reader right away but coaxed out between past and present narration from thea you can guess at the scandal early on but once the whole series of events are laid out it was actually more intriguing than i thought it would be which is one of this books most redeeming qualities that and the fact that i imagined mr holmes as edward norton yum however i really felt like the story was a little disjointed the switching back and forth between the past and present without any warning was sometimes confusing thea was also a perplexing character i never felt like i knew her sometimes her actions made no sense in comparison with the person i thought she was she's said to love horses so immensely that she cannot go a day without them which is why she's sent to a riding camp however she often refers to them as dumb animals and whips them she's also presented as fearless but immediately aligns herself with one of the popular girls at camp and snubs the daughter of a minister who is at camp on scholarship she was kind of mean girl in some instances all in all this was a good book and i liked it thea's inconsistencies made her less of a heroine for me and more of the villain in her own story which was cool but complicated","940":"i'm not sure how i feel about this book i guess disturbed i thought thea a selfish careless girl who ruined her entire family by her actions but i've read reviews that say it is a beautiful book which i cannot see maybe i'm missing something if you've read it would you clue me in","941":"i'm not sure whether i liked this book or not i mean it wasn't bad but it just wasn't all that wonderful either there was just a feeling of something missing from it that made it kind of disappointing maybe it was the writing itself it was choppy and had a lot of filler","942":"i enjoyed this book but it didn't live up to the hype it received i don't think it was one of the top books of 2013","943":" this book started out with great promise i was intrigued during the first half with what the mystery surrounding the story would hold the author is certainly talented in a descriptive sense but the narrative seemed to skip beats often and i felt left out not understanding some of the details surrounding certain events i also don't feel she developed the story or really took it anywhere significant i'm also bothered by the lack of change that took place in the main character i had a difficult time connecting to her there are also too many graphic sexual scenes for me to recommend this book to anyone i hope this author tries again i think there is much potential for a good author here","944":"this was pretty good well written and i like the main character who had a believable voice the author is very descriptive and you can really feel the atmosphere she is creating both in fl and nc the plot stumbles a little toward the end and it wraps up a little abruptly but definitely a good summer read reminded me a little of old school anne rivers siddons before she got so silly and over dramatic","945":"unlikeable characters so thinly written that their motivation is unknown little plot ridiculous non sequiturs how did this woman get a book contract let alone tons of media coverage for this book","946":"this review has been hidden because it contains spoilers to view it click here boarding schools used to be regarded differently in the north and in the south in the north one \"went away to school\" and it was a privilege in the south one was \"sent away to school\" and it was seen as a punishment i became aware of this distinction at sixteen when a friend of my mother's told her that one of her acquaintances had enquired what i had done to cause my parents to exile me from texas to school in connecticut my mother who was from connecticut originally and i had a good la boarding schools used to be regarded differently in the north and in the south in the north one \"went away to school\" and it was a privilege in the south one was \"sent away to school\" and it was seen as a punishment i became aware of this distinction at sixteen when a friend of my mother's told her that one of her acquaintances had enquired what i had done to cause my parents to exile me from texas to school in connecticut my mother who was from connecticut originally and i had a good laugh over the provinciality of those texans but that lady's attitude has a bearing on anton disclafani's the yonahlossee riding camp for girls whose narrator thea atwell has been sent from her home in florida to a camp and school in north carolina i have put a spoiler alert on this review but it's hardly necessary because most of the critical turns come with lots of portents and the reader will quickly figure that thea must have committed a sexual indiscretion the book is set in 1930 but i felt that even for the period thea's parents responded with excessive severity as no pregnancy and no public scandal eventuated but her sentence is the basis for the best school story that i've read since megan abbot's dare me like beth cassidy in dare me who was an equestrienne as well as a cheerleader thea is possessed of a very strong pair of legs is extremely competitive and determined to being first and utterly fearless thea is not an elegant rider but she is technically perfect and has spent hours on a horse almost every day of her life and horses are the only things that matter at yonahlossee there is a school attached to the camp and thea discovers to her surprise that she will be confined there year round and the girls have academic classes but they completely blow them off and the only thing that matters is the spring horse show the previous champion was leona a rich girl from texas who goes to school with her own horse who will be thea's arch rival thea seems to lack confidence in her own looks but she is obviously strikingly attractive at fifteen she had her first sex with her seventeen year old cousin georgie which led to her being sent away and at yonahlossee she will have an affair with mr holmes the headmaster just after she turns sixteen like dare me the yonahlossee riding camp is ostensibly a realistic school story but it has very strong mythic elements in its ancestry in dare me they came from greek tragedy and beth had a clear resemblance to a homeric hero here we have an example of a quest epic the hero receives some kind of curse usually as a result of offending a god as in the case of odysseus and poseidon and is exiled from home and sent a difficult journey and must accomplish a dangerous task like jason's quest for the golden fleece the quest was also a popular form of medieval romance with the most famous being the arthurian quest for the holy grail yonahlossee ostensibly is located near asheville in what i think of as the gail godwin country but in mythic terms it is found in the land of faery east of the sun and west of the moon perhaps not too far from the castle of sir bertilak of haut desert in sir gawain and the green knight we notice that the principal school building is called the castle the school is populated by maidens clad in white all of the girls are attired in white riding outfits and the castle is ruled by mr holmes ostensibly the headmaster but his archetype in the grail myth could not be more obvious if holmes were named mr fisher king instead like the fisher king mr holmes has a wound but it is not a physical wound but an emotional wound he lives without love for a crack rider like thea to figure as a knight errant fits our paradigm here her quest is twofold to win a tournament and to cure the king's wound the tournament is the school's spring show in which two champions from the ends of the earth compete of course texas the home of leona another pretty mythic name and thea's former home florida are not quite the ends of the earth but they are about as far apart as you can get and still be in the traditional american south curing mr holmes's wound requires thea give what the medievals called \"solace \" sexual satisfaction this part of the story was tricky to relate and i thought disclafani handled it beautifully the newspapers have been full of stories of sleazy and almost comical relationships between teenage students and adult teachers and in real life the school and its board of governors might well have come down on mr holmes like the furies what made the relationship both right and inevitable for me was thea's absolute determination to have holmes he is a very handsome man she says \"i had wanted something very badly and then i had gotten it and the getting kept getting better \" and as thea is lying with him \"mr holmes above me framed by the bluest sky i thought i'd ever seen and i felt so lucky that he was here with me that i was getting again what i knew i shouldn't have \" on the mythic level no real man could resist thea the name meaning goddess than he could resist morgan le faye or niveve thea approaches holmes just as she would a jump and failure is not a possibility thea remarks after her triumph in the show \"i was fearless it was a trait that served me well in the ring and badly in life \" that would perfectly fit beth cassidy in dare me as well but while beth is a tragic figure thea emerges from yohahlossee pretty much whole we are given a kind of flash forward on thea's later life at the end of the book a glimpse i found a bit unsatisfactory and unfocused but i was left wondering about mr holmes the wall outside his office is covered with photos of previous winners of the spring show and i wonder what he thought and felt whenever he looked at thea's i can scarcely try to imagine the enormousness of his emotions but i am sure they include huge waves of sadness but absolutely no regrets more","947":"this review has been hidden because it contains spoilers to view it click here i do not understand why everyone hated this book so much yes the majority of the book was dedicated to the author grossly recounting thea's sexual adventures but i'm pretty sure the majority of the readers could've stomached that unlike me an 18 year old virgin sorry there's a lot to be taken away from this book besides the incest it is about a young girl's journey into adulthood as she grapples with her desires and the consequences of her actions thea did some terrible things and i i do not understand why everyone hated this book so much yes the majority of the book was dedicated to the author grossly recounting thea's sexual adventures but i'm pretty sure the majority of the readers could've stomached that unlike me an 18 year old virgin sorry tthere's a lot to be taken away from this book besides the incest it is about a young girl's journey into adulthood as she grapples with her desires and the consequences of her actions thea did some terrible things and in her day these actions were seen as the destroying factor to her family she was a young girl in the 1930s the things she did were not welcomed and she was punished for it her ascent from georgie to mr holmes shows that she was capable of understanding how her desires hurt others she learned how she wanted too much and nearly destroyed two families in the process her desires for georgie were completely different from her desires for mr holmes and i think that's the most important thing she learned at yonahlossee ton another note the writing proved to be extraordinary following the first few chapters of choppy sentences and short descriptions i think it was a well thought out plot with many motifs and symbols hidden throughout more","948":"this book took months to read because i started it during my first month of phd work that quickly consumed my life in the worst way now on winter break with a paper unfinished i devoured this book in three sittings plane ride home before bed and the following evening it was the perfect read for what i needed an escape","949":"i received the book for free through goodreads first reads an easy read descriptive tale of a girl who created a scandal and was sent to a girl's camp during the depression","950":"i liked it i liked the way the story unfolded and i liked the flawed character the horse language was technically correct which i always appreciate","951":"this was an interesting story with good characters and a plot that kept my attention a young girl in 1930 becomes infatuated with her cousin because of her inappropriate behavior she is sent away to a riding camp so the situation can resolve itself the reader doesn't really know for quite a while why thea has been sent away making the story a little mysterious we learn a lot about the proper upbringing of wealthy young ladies in this era and the mischief that girls can get into even at a well supervised camp good story something a little different for me","952":"i was looking forward to this novel and for good reason it was a really powerful and well written coming of age story that i thoroughly enjoyed thea is a young girl with a twin brother who lives with her parents on their sizable estate in florida her father is a doctor and they are a fairly privileged family that is able to weather the difficult economic times of the depression era of the early 1930's when thea is fifteen her family sends her away to the yonahlossee riding camp for girls in the north dakota mountains what thea thinks will be a summer camp turns into a boarding school and she finds herself realizing the extent of her family's anger and spite although her family tells her that they're doing this for her to get her better acquainted with other young girls her age and to get a young lady's education she knows that she is being sent away because they're ashamed of her and what she's done throughout the novel we get bits and pieces about what exactly it was that happened we know that she was sent away because of a boy but we don't know the full details until nearer to the end it was a nice lead up and i like that the author didn't just start out with the full story it kept you guessing a little bit and helped keep up a little bit of suspense yonahlossee itself is a bit of a mecca amid the economic turmoils of the country as a boarding school and summer camp for the privileged daughters of the south the school doesn't experience the depression as the rest of the country good meals are still served and maids are employed even though the surrounding appalachians are floundering and the country itself is on unsteady ground and despite this level of isolation from the country this is still more connected to other people than thea has ever been having grown up with only her parents and brother for company and the occasional visit from her autnt uncle and cousin for thea being sent to yonahlossee is essentially like being sent to the moon it is so different from her native florisa she has never been away from home before and the change is immense from the weather and the surroundings to the hundreds of girls at the camp to the classes she takes everything is different and it's a huge adjustment the only constant is that she is able to continue riding horses which had been her true passion at home it is an interesting element because in this one area she is completely confident and herself even though she is going through so many changes she is able to feel at least a little bit of her old self while with the horses i think it is this relationship and this confidence that leads her to be able to open up in the other relationships she has in the course of the novel that will eventually allow her to find herself from her connection to sissy one of her cabin mates to decca the headmaster's seven year old daughter to mr holmes the headmaster himself thea grows as a young woman and slowly begins to discover more about who she is and why she's perhaps not as shameful as her parents make her feel she changes dramatically throughout the book and finally begins to see her fearlessness as a good quality rather than a disgraceful one and puts herself on the path to deciding her own life rather than letting it be decided for her we see her grappling with choices of selfhood vs being a good daughter obedience and defiance are big themes in this novel and thea constantly struggles between the two trying to find a common ground between her desires and what is acceptable for a young girl in the 1930's even a privileged girl her choices were drastically limited simply because she was a girl the theme of gender roles and acceptable behaviors is also huge and is interesting to see play out throughout at times this novel did get a bit repetitive but on the whole it was a rich and complex look at what one girl's story may have been like from questions of friendship familial roles desire and sex to depictions of social expectations and hypocracies thea brings to the forefront many interesting topics it was a thoroughly enjoyable read and it gave so much to think about i would highly recommend this","953":"i wanted to like this book much more than i did i saw it on a slate list of favorites from the year and felt like a coming of age novel about a young woman growing up during the depression would be an interesting read and the protagonist thea atwell is a stand out character full of deeply held desires impulses and emotions but it is as if all of the available dimension has been given over to her the secondary characters are all completely flat leona is the best of the lot but only because being cooly imperious gives a good reason for her distance even the long build up to the family secret of bad behavior that got thea sent away is really an anti climactic reveal i expected georgie to have been kicked in the head by her horse or at least to have been damaged in a way that was more directly thea's fault it's not the worst book ever but i would not put it on any best lists","954":"i wanted to like this novel but found the protagonist's character to be shallow and underdeveloped after the big build up throughout the story about the event that made thea's family send her away to the riding school when it was finally revealed it was mundane and predictable and thea's actions at the school were also predictable and for some strange reason the time setting did not seem right i kept thinking it was the 1880s or 1890s rather than 1930 not sure why this matters but it felt odd","955":"thea atwell has been sent away from her home in florida to the nc mountains to the yonahlossee riding camp for girls because of something that happened at home as the story progresses it alternates between her life at the camp and recollections of life at home it's hard for me to judge this book the writing was excellent very atmospheric but ultimately it disappointed thea wasn't the most likeable character she and her twin brother sam were supposed to be very close but i really didn't get that feeling from the book at home in florida it seemed they went their separate ways sam wasn't a very well drawn character and i really disliked the author's ending for him","956":" it had potential to be a good story about a confused teenage girl entering early womanhood who was sent off to a girls sleep away camp where she met girls from all sorts of backgrounds and stories of their own in 1930 but the main character turned out to just be a slut sleeping with the married head master of her school in the woods after sleeping with her first cousin in a barn really someone should have told this girl to give up the great outdoors and to keep her knickers on and then the author tells us about how she and her brother turned out in life with all of three paragraphs don't waste your time","957":"suspenseful fiction set in nc mountains and fl during the start of the us depression horse lovers should like it","958":" i had a very hard time connecting to any of the characters in this book which made it difficult to stay interested despite the author's attempts to shock and seduce me other reviewers have talked about the wonderfully descriptive writing which i must have missed i just found the whole thing to be kind of dull and disjointed i even resorted to skimming the last few pages which summed up what happens to each character a type of ending i generally dislike because i just could not wait for it to be over","959":"this was an interesting story and i enjoyed how the back story evolved it was very slow moving but i think that is what i liked about it i had no problem putting it down and while it didn't call to me to pick it back up it did whisper softly that i needed to keep reading i would have liked the ending to be a bit more developed but i think this book will stick with me while","960":"i was disappointed in this book it was on a recommended list for a women's reading group and i usually really like their selections but i could never really get into this book there didn't seem to be a plot no beginning middle and end i knew early in the story what had happened so that wasn't a surprise and the ending wasn't satisfying thea didn't change through the book she didn't grow up even though this was meant to be a book about a young girl growing up","961":"listened to good book for that","962":"a well written book but not one that i enjoyed the main character was not a likable person and there was a lot left out of the story that should have been there the slow unveiling of the terrible catalyst event was annoying still i enjoyed the creation of the little world created at the school and the peek back at the changing mores of the times","963":"i thought this book was ok it was interesting and i finished it feeing somber i found it a little disturbing and need some time to mull it over in my brain","964":"you don't think when you are young that you will simply fall into your life but that is exactly what happens 254 indeed you also don't think that you'll simply fall into a book about a young girl breaking some pretty important rules taboos in depression era florida and heading off to a horse camp of all things but that is exactly what happens i was a little distressed by some of thea's choices and i'm not at all sure she and i would be friends in real life i'm also usually rather averse to horse girl stories but somehow this book and this character drew me in anyway disclafani offers readers illicit love twins separated by circumstance parent child relationships that just aren't what they seem complicated families girls coming of age away from home boarding school dynamics all placed in the context of a crumbling economy that feels more familiar than i wish it did i didn't want to start my next book when i finished this one and when i did i still had thea's voice in my head i didn't quite love this book but it definitely stuck with me","965":"entertaining story good writing probably would have rated it higher except a couple of the characters just really got on my nerves i think that was part of the point they were supposed to get on our nerves but it is hard to love a book when you want to slap some of the primary characters elizabeth henry holmes sometimes even thea even though i liked her upside the head","966":" i really wanted to like this book unfortunately i just couldn't the mystery of why the narrator was sent away was transparent from the beginning and the flashbacks the author used to reveal it were tiresome the other girls at the camp school weren't developed enough to justify the claims of the narrator that ultimately she loved yonahlossee and aside from continually telling the reader that the depression was happening the book never evoked its historical era overall quite a disappointment","967":"this book could have been so much better after a barely tolerable plotline though the ending was such a copout blah","968":"what a terrific book this coming of age story is told from a perspective of years by thea atwell a twin from a wealthy family about her life when she was 15 the author keeps us guessing about thea's terrible secret when we finally learn the secret the pieces of the puzzle fall into place and we learn even more about family relationships the world of an adolescent girl and the sensibilities of the depression era south the themes in this book span beyond the particular locale and time and push us to think about how we make our choices and what the consequences of those choices might be do we decide for ourselves what our lives might be or do we let the world happen to us","969":"i'm giving this poorly disguised as a literary effort bodice ripper two stars because she spelled 'yonahlossee' correctly","970":"you know when you like a book but it's also just not that good","971":"thea is very much an unlikeable character though a teenager in an innocent time she is decidedly anything but she destroys a number of lives and even the one gesture she makes toward her so called best friend is not without selfish reasons the setting was interesting but the novel doesn't quite live up to expectations","972":"not my favorite but interesting i probably wouldn't recommend it to someone but i did want to finish it and liked the ending","973":"i really wanted this to be a good book but i hated it there was entirely too much build up to the incident and i kind of despised thea before the book was half over there wasn't enough character development and there were pages and pages that i skimmed because nothing was happening do not recommend","974":"i'd been on the library's hold list for this all summer so was hoping for a better read than this it was much less engaging than i anticipated even though i'm sure the hectic start to the school year didn't help me get through this i loved reading about the particular region as i've spent some time in asheville and black mountain but i found thea such a difficult compatriot no matter how the author tried i just couldn't find myself to be sympathetic to her also i was annoyed i couldn't add this to the sign on my desk where i usually promote what i'm reading since the main character is smoking a cigarette and sexy is mentioned in the blurb although i guess i was less annoyed by that than by how boring the book turned out to be","975":"as i neared the conclusion of the book i was struck by how the victum was blamed for the assault and the affair are we more enlightened today author wants us to consider that all choices are deliberate pg 385 the exchange my parents had made me for sam but i had made the first trade my brother for my cousin was she mature enough informed enough to have made that decision well writtenhistorical link to yonahlosee riding camp very interesting","976":" i received an advance reader's copy of this book set in the 1930s this story is about thea atwell a 15 year old girl who is sent by her parents to a riding camp for wealthy girls to get away from a family tragedy at the girls' camp thea learns to live with the social hierarchy that comes with wealth and beauty and teenaged girls she has left her parents and her twin brother sam because of something terrible she has done and we eventually learn the circumstances of her past it was difficult for me to empathize with and root for thea though the social environment of teenagers in the 1930s is not that different from today's disclafani's writing is beautiful and she should be congratulated on her debut novel i hope there will be more to come from her","977":" i liked this a lot and almost gave it five stars instead of four fifteen year old thea has done something that has caused her to be sent away from her close knit family's isolated florida home to a school and camp for girls in the north carolina mountains we don't find what she did out until pretty late in the book although the author skillfully reveals information a little bit at a time while also talking about thea's life at the camp her first real foray into the outside world her first chance to make friends outside her family and the very interesting friendship she develops with the headmistress's husband it was a page turner i read it pretty fast wanting to find out what thea had done and what she would do next she's a great character thea an unusually good mix of kindness and cruelty bravery and selfishness disclafani writes very very well about the power of a young girl's desire this book had great sex scenes","978":"thea the girl who wanted too much doesn't every 15 year old girl want too much i guess most of them don't act on all of their desires that's what sets thea apart she is not afraid to go after the forbidden i'm not sure i liked the message or the story but it did keep me reading","979":" meh i wanted to like this book as i suggested it as the first book for our virtual long distance book club consisting of our close group of college friends what better book for a group of women who went to an all women's college in the blue ridge mountains than a book about an coming of age at an all girls horse camp in the blue ridge mountains perfect notsomuch my main issues 1 stories of friendships that i felt the book description promised certainly never materialized 2 all of a sudden there were very detailed sex scenes that took up a good chunk of the second half of the book and seemed to come out of nowhere and most importantly 3 i never got to like the narrator nor did i think that she sounded or thought at all like a teenage girl and i felt that all these experiences didn't actually make her grow and change skip this one for a better read","980":"disappointing the reviews led me to expect a more interesting book i love horsy books and this one was less about riding than it was about a feminist girl ahead of her time motivation for parents sending her away to boarding school did not make sense even for the time characters were not well developed better luck next novel","981":"well i really liked it i enjoyed the author's writing style very fluid detailed without being flowery or overly descriptive it was a quiet book in terms of pace and plotting and i don't think it detracted from it but rather set the tone of course i liked the horsey bits but i also enjoyed the historical detail and character relationships this was definitely my kind of book","982":"this was one of those books that i felt compelled to finish although well written i was unable to really connect with the main character the reader is presented a very sad coming of age story","983":"stopped reading half way through i just don't care about this character then i read some of the reviews on goodreads and i am so glad i didn't waste any more time on this book do not bother","984":"a very interesting read was drawn in from the first few paragraphs and couldn't put it down all week great writing style fabulous characterization the author has a great voice throughout this piece","985":"not what i was expecting or wanting from this book i was expecting triumph through adversity and unity through struggles that unite the girls instead this is more of a family tragedy and complete loss of innocence not my favorite book this year","986":"neighborhood book club september selection suggested by leslie this is a strange story of the 1930's where a doctor's daughter is sent away from home in disgrace to a camp for girls she is a twin thea and sam with a cousin georgie whom she falls in love with kind of events happen thea learns that she has been so sheltered by her family she escapes but sam does not this is a strange story","987":"the main gist of the story ~ needy conniving girls existed in the 1930's just like they do today that's about it next","988":"i just didn't like it something about an incestuous relationship that puts a damper on any book that i read","989":" i didn't like this book a few pages in i just couldn't seem to get connected to the main character i read a little bit more but i was just bored by it since i couldn't get into the main character the other characters i didn't care for either i pretty much just lightly skimmed the rest of the novel to see what the main character had done to get sent to a girls' camp in the first place the reason for her being sent to the camp well i thought it would have been more of a bigger deal that happened what happened was a bad thing but i guess i was thinking it would go darker i was disappointed in this story as it didn't live up to my expectations","990":"i had high expectations for this but i simply did not feel anything for the main character thea actually i didn't feel much of anything for anyone i feel the writing style was good but something seemed to be missing","991":"first time in a while i've enjoyed a book this much","992":"i wanted to love this book and there were parts i did love my problems with it were the fact that is touted as 'sexy' on the cover when none of the scenarios are actually sexy the narrator's obsession with reporting how everyone's breath smelled and the fact that i just didn't like the protagonist but felt like i was meant to sympathize with her","993":" this coming of age novel was one i would definitely recommend even though the author hinted at the deed behind the expulsion he kept the reader at a distance through the weaving of the story between camp and florida the author's descriptions of florida alone were so perfect as well as descriptions of what it was like on top of this mountain in north carolina personal experience at a girl's riding camp in north carolina made parts of the story memorable and bittersweet for me i enjoyed all aspects of the book although i hated the lesson that had to be eventually learned so many wonderful lines i hated for the story to be over","994":"beautifully written perfect vacation reading i bet it's going to be one of the top summer reads of 2013 one not to miss","995":" geez people are being hard on this undeservedly so i think thea did something very bad to get her sent away to this horse camp it's during the depression the author has decided not to tell you what the very bad thing is that thea did but rather to tell the story of what's happening now at the camp in tandem with what happened in the past makes for some frustration at the beginning when you want to know what the heck it was she did but once i realized what the author was doing and once i saw that there was a reason for it i wasn't quite so put off there is sex in this book but i think it's handled well descriptive and accurate yet not over the top or sappy or stupid or yucky or any of those things there is also a lot about horses riding them learning to ride them racing them taking care of them since i know nothing about horses but have always admired them i was glad to learn all this stuff i recognized by the amount of detail and the comfort with the subject that the author must be a horsewoman herself yup it was a treat to be introduced to horses in such a specific comfortable way not that i've never read a horse book before this just gave me a different angle one that i appreciated my own use of a semicolon reminds me one thing that bugged me was all the run on sentences tons of them it's really not that hard to insert a semicolon or a conjunction every once in a while but i think the author did a stellar job balancing the story of yesterday and the story of today introducing us to the various girls at the camp showing how the depression was affecting them and their families explaining the dynamics of her own family giving us lots of information about horses u0026amp lots of horse riding activity that i did not find boring and two love stories or three or four actually besides i finished the book in a day enjoyable read","996":"hard for me to believe that in the 1930's the same problems with sex between cousins and underage sex with a minor or adultery was tolerated and not thought to be wrong or sinful the author's writing skills were to say the least rather confusing most times hard to follow if present or past was being discussed for a 15 yr old girl her morals were non existant","997":"i've been trying to read this book for a month and although it seems to have an ok start i have not been able to get past the 2nd chapter it's just not drawing me in","998":"slow starting but ultimately satisfying story of a family torn apart by forbidden love reminded me of atonement in many ways which i didn't love on first read but came back to later and appreciated more thea is not a sympathetic protagonist but then all of the characters here are deeply flawed take it to the beach or on the train probably one of the better big books this summer","999":"nice summer read","1000":"not one i would","1001":"i thought that this was a perfect little book i partly did not want the story to end on the other hand i didnt think i could take much more definitely want to read any and everything by this author","1002":"i think this is a very well written book i just had a hard time with it i think i wanted the protagonist and some of the other characters to have had some epiphany or changed in a way that the author just doesn't take them part of the problem may be that the narrator is a young girl and it's possible you're just not supposed to trust her perspective but more than anything i just thought this was a story about how adults failed this girl and her brother and cousin over and over she seems to accept an equal part in the guilt and punishment and i was just really uncomfortable with where i was leaving the character at the end of the book","1003":"i wanted to like this a lot more than i did my biggest problem was thea herself who alternated between calculating and almost naive","1004":"i picked this up while browsing in a bookstore in vt and thought hurray a horse novel for grown ups beautiful writing that drew me in right away ms discalfani gets the equestrian details right double hurray the scandal at the book's center would be scandalous today as would the themes about disparate treatment of opposite sex siblings but the author deftly transports the reader to 1930 this was one of those books that made me eager for bedtime so i could keep reading highly

review has been hidden because it contains spoilers to view it click here i started reading this and gave up after about 85 pages and skimmed the rest the pacing was too slow and the first person narrator was annoying and kept hinting at a big dark terrible secret that got her sent away to the titular camp the southern gothic vibe of her family didn't quite hit the mark and just seemed like

and gave up after about 85 pages and skimmed the rest the pacing was too slow and the first person narrator was annoying and kept hinting at a big dark terrible secret that got her sent away to the titular camp the southern gothic vibe of her family didn't quite hit the mark and just seemed like the author was trying too hard to create a family torn apart by jealousy lies and sex the time period of the 1930s was not fully explored and integrated into the novel the book could really have taken place in any time period and failed to engage me as a work of historical fiction the character of sam the twin brother of the narrator and his mystical bond with nature and with his sister was silly and not credible there is also quite a bit of illicit sex in the vein of v c andrews in the book the narrator's secret is that she had sex with her male cousin and she later has an affair with the male headmaster of the school which may turn some readers off this book has gotten a big push in the press as one of the best books to read this summer and received several starred reviews so i seem to be in the minority in my opinion more","1008":" i love the progression of thea she is so young and innocent in the beginning of the book things happen to her and she is not in control of herself nor of her environment and by the end of the book is she a hero maybe not but she is control she is the owner of her destiny and she is strong with an inner knowledge of herself a beautifully plotted book revealing a wicked secret so slowly i love also the other girls at yonahlosse their unique personalities and how we see them thea's lens funny how i didn't like the title before i read it yonawha but then i became to love the place as thea did and of course it could only be this name this place","1009":"i was trying so hard to feel for thea but the more i was moving toward the end the more i was irritated by her being spoiled and selfish","1010":"i'm deferring to the most liked reviews on goodreads stacia emma others it was good enough but didn't live up to the breathless reviews two and half stars not that there's a way to give a half star that i've found","1011":"you're from the southernmost state what else would you be if not a southerner i'm a floridian and we're a different breed as someone who grew up in the south but is not a southerner there is no truer statement than that above there's something about the state of florida that truly makes us unusual and in my completely biased opinion somewhat exceptional the same can be true of anton disclafani's debut novel though it takes place in the 1930s thea atwell's story is timeless though women have made a lot of progress in this world there are still some double standards in today's society boys will be boys but girls should be ladies i loved the way that disclafani took us inside thea's mind so that we could grow up with her and she dealt with her new life at yonahlossee this book is sure to be a hit when it comes out this summer","1012":"i just skimmed too many pages for this book to be an enjoyable read it is just a story and not very interesting","1013":"\"southern decorum family secrets ... disclafani is wildly talented and this is a sexy suspenseful gorgeously written book\" after reading this quote on the back of the book the yonahlossee riding camp for girls i was very much looking forward to reading this debut novel the book begins with the main character thea being taken by her father to the riding camp fro girls in the blue ridge mountains from her home in florida her first time away from home being sent away after an incident that had brought shame on her family leaving her to cope with her feelings of guilt the novel is set in the 1920's the story unravels slowly as we learn piece by piece the reason that thea was sent away to the school as time goes by and she begins to wonder if she ever wants to return home to her isolated existence she begins to mature and embarks on a risque affair with the head teacher the plot was not very original and i felt that i always knew what was coming next i was not sure wether the indented audience for the book was teenage girls or adults to begin with it read more like a teenage novel but as the book progressed and the sex scenes began i was not really sure who the target audience was all in all it was a pleasant enough read although i prefer a bit more suspense and to be kept guessing in the books that i read it was very easy to follow no confusing plot lines or in depth descriptive prose i would recommend it for a quick holiday read","1014":"i enjoyed the book but not the ending though i did stay up late to finish the book so i may just have been too tired toward the end to appreciate it","1015":"kept me interested but slightly disappointed ending","1016":"this book was good but i didn't like it as much as i thought i would the narrative started off in an interesting manner but the weaving of past and present events every several pages was distracting interestingly for me the character with the least development was the main character i would recommend this book for discussion groups since there are thoughtful aspects to the story that facilitate conversation","1017":"not bad enjoyed the descriptions of a private girls riding camp in the south in the 1930s tags horses family relationships twins coming of age florida","1018":"this book almost seemed like a ya book but also a gothic romance at the same time it took place in 1930 at the start of the financial collapse in the us and was an interesting view of how the larger things that happen impact everyone","1019":"good at times slow at others this book could have been read should have been half the pages and it still could have conveyed accompished the same stoty plot","1020":"two of the main characters were not believable to me disappointed in this one i had high hopes but it fell flat","1021":"was an interesting story get it from the library not worth buying like i did","1022":"i wasn't sure i liked the protagonist in this one however as i kept reading it seemed she was a product of her environment a well to do family in the south secluded and secretive ms disclafani brought a past time to the present and i believed her world","1023":"disturbing yet interesting considering the time","1024":"young girl rides horses during the depression masturbates shags head master of her riding school last 20 or so pages are shameful theme i am young adult hear me roar","1025":" finally a coming of age novel that addresses the sexual changes in a woman's body and her physical and emotional needs this is a novel where the truth stings it is about embracing independence rather than simply submitting to a world that is artificially created by your parents and in which their expectations determine both their happiness and security and that of their children apparently nobody was prepared for this existence to run its course and change or for the effects on each member of the family eventually thea comes to understand that what she does affects others but that she has a right to independence without disappointing herself i loved all that this book reveals about young women and i loved the setting both florida and north carolina during a difficult time in the nation and in thea's life","1026":"a fine coming of age story this should be of special interest to young adult horse lovers i liked it","1027":"the longer it went on the more i disliked thea and pitied sam","1028":"the yonahlossee riding camp for girls is the coming of age story of thea atwell and it is unlike any other such story i've ever read and i've read quite a few thea lives in florida during the great depression and she is sent away for an as yet unknown indiscretion to the yonahlossee riding camp for girls thea loves horses so it would be hard to see this as a punishment but that's how she feels it she is banished abandoned almost disowned by her parents and sent away from the person she loves the most her twin brother she has never left home before never had to mix with girls her own age for her being sent away from those whom she loves is a punishment thea is a very different very original heroine she is fifteen almost sixteen and has lived in a sheltered world through no fault of her own just the matter of her circumstances she doesn't understand how the real world works is only beginning to learn about herself and other people thea's experiences at yonahlossee due to the series of events that led to her being there shape her and change her the girl who is reunited with her parents is a different one that left them but the change did not happen overnight and this is part of what makes thea a very real character her development as a character as a person is touching and you can see her learning lessons from her time at yonahlossee thea is a go getter she knows what she wants and from where i stand i think this is remarkable due to the time this novel is based in she is not your average '30s girl i thought i knew where this book was going that it was predictable but disclafani had me on the edge of my seat figuratively my eyes darted across the page i was so eager to know what happened next the story was well crafted and i enjoyed the descriptions of the south of the mountains being a horse person i was also satisfied that the author knew what she was talking about finally a book about horses that wasn't aimed at little kids but even when you love horses like thea does there is always more in your life especially once you get older i thought this was balanced well this book while about a sixteen year old girl is not as tame as most ya so i'd caution against giving this book to younger girls there are plenty of other horse books they can read however for the older reader even someone who's not 'horsey' i think this book is fantastic 'i was fearless it was a trait that served me well in the ring and badly in life '","1029":"really enjoyed this","1030":"needs an editor too much repetition too much graphic sex","1031":"well i wouldn't say this book is awful more of a letdown i thought the setting and time era would have sucked me in the story started off strong u0026amp i was really curious about the scandal i enjoyed the first fourth of the book but then it went downhill i am not sure if this is a young adult book or adult book i had a difficult time relating to the main character i found some things odd in the book like when she says that she hadn't met a man she wasn't related to seriously it's the great depression not bc once the scandal is known the book drug even more just kinda blah u0026amp i didnt care for the issue kinda yucky","1032":"i read this in a day the story was absorbing and the writing was good save for a few noticeable repetitions of descriptions that i feel should have been caught by the editor but perhaps these wouldn't be noticeable if i had read it over the course of a week it was a fun summer read curtis sittenfeld did the cover blurb and i would say that the quality is similar to her fiction","1033":" thea has been sent away from her beautiful and isolated florida home to a boarding school in the mountains of north carolina during the summer of 1930 at the yonahlossee riding camp for girls thea will learn how to interact with other girls her age ride horses which is her passion and become more educated and refined her parents have sent her there due to something unspeakable that has happened at home instead of dealing with it as a family they send her away from everything she has known and from her twin brother sam at first thea feels like a fish out of water as she doesn't have much experience interacting with other people other than her family but popular girl sissy takes her under her wing it also helps that she is an excellent horsewoman and gives even the best rider at the camp a run for her money her parents sent her to yonahlossee with the hopes that she would become a proper young woman but the events that occur there would shock her family anton disclafani's debut the yonahlossee riding camp for girls is an addicting tale about forbidden romances friendship family secrets and thea's coming of age thea isn't someone i could really relate to but i was still interested in her story she is kind of troubled but i feel like that is becaue her parents have sheltered her from the world as she only really ever hangs out with her brother or her cousin georgie thea is really unconventional especially for living in the 1930s she is very sexual impulsive and a bit devious which obviously makes for a captivating protagonist thea embarks on two forbidden romances and although a few romantic moments made me cringe i still needed to know more about thea and why she acts the way she does in the yonahlossee riding camp for girls the whole mystery of why thea was sent to the yonahlossee riding camp for girls is what kept me going what could she have done that was so horrible that she needed to be sent away i was dying to know and disclafani does a fabululos job of letting the secret unfold slowly she lets her readers put it together piece by piece the story jumps from thea's past in florida to present day at the camp which is a device that was done very well and added to the mystery surrounding thea's secret in the yonahlossee riding camp for girls the setting of the yonahlossee riding camp for girls was fantastic i love books set in the south so i was enjoyed the carolina setting tremendously plus the setting of a riding camp was fascinating readers can really tell that disclafani has a lot of experience with horses as she really brought that aspect of the book to life although the forbidden romances were a little too forbidden for my taste i still thought it was done well thanks to disclafani's outstanding writing style the setting the mystery the writing and the romance make the yonahlossee riding camp for girls an excellent read to take with you on summer vacation","1034":"i wanted to like this book better than i did and that's all i'm going to say abou tthat","1035":"this was one odd odd book i liked it because it didn't bore me but what was the point it seemed like the ramblings of a girl were written down and published that is not to say that the writing wasn't good but simply that i couldn't find the point to the entire story i'm not sure any of the characters were particularly likable or admirable however i can not say i was bored either which is a good thing i am simply puzzled by it all","1036":" but then i knew nothing about the place except that it was where my parents were sending me so they wouldn't have to see me thea has brought disgrace on her florida old money great depression family and is sent away for the summer to a riding camp when it becomes clear that her stay is not just for the summer but that her parents want her permanently out of their sight she tries to make herself more welcome in her new world trading favours and gossip for social elevation thea is an intriguing character in some senses she is wise beyond her years acting more adult than many of the adults around her but still very much a teenage girl with that brutal mix of sharpness her odd relationship with her twin maybe it only seems odd to me because i'm not a twin the liaison with a far distant cousin who at the same time is like a brother to her predictable and yet tragic her parents considering that she spends very little time with them in the book are also sharply captured on the cusp of modernising while buried in their orange grove dollars disclafani what a great surname captures the fading south well the drip drip drip of family money down the depression drain while girls are packed off to finishing school the importance attributed to decorum and the age of family money is thrown into relief against the lacking morals displayed by several characters and the spicy ambition of the girls to succeed in a sense i found it disappointing that the plot continues to return to thea's sexual adventurousness as if there was no other aspect of her that could cause conflict when there were plenty of other aspects but i often find that frustrating in a novel the inevitable decay of the old money system was much more interesting as was the evolution of thea's relationship with her parents a much darker more american boarding school tale than those of enid blyton on which i grew up just as addictively readable","1037":"great book showing how most of the time life is just a series of one event leading to another without a lot of thought involved in our actions","1038":"a coming of age tale set in 1930 of thea a spoilt impulsive and not altogether likeable character who is sent away from home in disgrace to yonahlossee the story is told from her perspective changing between a slow unravelling of her past and her current life at the camp which sounded like a pretty great place to be exiled too the secret which resulted in her sending away i thought could have been fleshed out better and was referenced and unravelled too obviously to really be a mystery ultimately thea disappointed me as a character but maybe that was just the point teenagers are likely to make mistakes and even repeat them i just don't think she really learnt anything from hers early on i really liked the details of her relationship with her twin brother sam so i found the ending a little disappointing i think his character could have been developed a lot more and some deeper delving into that relationship at the end of the novel would have been good i will be interested to see what else comes from this author","1039":" this is a beautifully written book that takes a very simple plot and assembles it like an intricate jigsaw frustrating at times but ultimately rewarding the story opens with the main character thea being taken by her father to the camp in the blue ridge mountains from her home in florida her first time away from home being sent away after an incident that had brought shame on her family leaving her to cope with her feelings of guilt the book develops quite gently slowly bringing the pieces together to enable the reader to piece together the story while at the same time isolating the characters and insulating them from the outside world while at the same time mirroring it there are hints of the social and economic issues of the time mostly through the troubles affecting some of the minor characters together with indications of the social conventions of the time which in the end allow thea to achieve her independence by subverting them to her own ends and in a way which serves to protect other people and allowing herself to achieve closure to her own problems being a male in my fifties this is not the sort of book i would normally read but having been sent a review copy i decided to give it a try i would have to say is that most of the descriptions i have seen of it sell it short as it is not really a romance in the normal sense of the word in that the person the main character is looking to love is herself it's not really a coming of age story either more a coming of independence which is finally achieved in a very satisfying ending that leaves the reader wanting to see more of how thea lives her life from that point on if you are expecting a great romance or a modern retelling of gatsby then you will be disappointed but if you are looking for a well written book that draws you into the story and gives a good idea of the lives of the daughters of southern gentry when the depression hit as well as one that deals with the obsessions of young girls for horses and ponies without drowning you in minutiae about tack and horse care then i have no hesitation in recommending it as a very good read","1040":" i would have skipped this book if i had known that 1 thea sleeps with her cousin whom she previously treated like her brother and was sent away to boarding school as punishment and 2 thea then sleeps with the handsome headmaster of the school while the headmistress was out of town fundraising for six weeks of course however ick factor aside i did finish it mostly her characters are realistic and sympathetic although many characters but most especially thea want to shoulder the responsibility for tragic mistakes the headmaster tells thea that they are just a series of events these words become her philosophy of life the writing is somewhat confusing as the author switches back and forth in time her best descriptions are equestrian i felt like i was thea riding astride her horse 25 copies lp audio eaudio","1041":" not nearly as impressed with the yonahlossee riding camp for girls as so many others seem to be in fact i wonder if i missed something along the way or if i accidentally skipped over the parts that make this novel loveable because i was actually surprised by how mediocre i found the writing while the story itself is interesting and appealing enough i found thea atwell to be a fairly wretched protagonist perhaps that is an unfair or ungenerous evaluation but there really wasn't a single instance in the entire novel where i really felt like i was on the main character's side perhaps i approach my personal life and therefore my literary life with a different philosophy than that which was used in this novel and therefore felt strongly at odds with the character's choices in any case there were a few rare moments in which i thought i was grasping the essence of the novel where i was finally understanding what the book was about but i still feel as though the main themes and central questions were a little muddled and sporadic i don't really know what exactly the yonahlossee riding camp for girls is really and truly about at the very least it was an entertaining read","1042":" this depiction of family dynamics set in florida during the depression of the twenties offers many insightful moments the characterization of 15 year old thea atwell shows a clear coming of age story thea and her twin brother live with her parents in a beautiful home amid orange groves surrounded by beauty that i can only imagine florida offered before the real estate shark invasion in the later part of the twentieth century she is cast out of this paradise and sent away to the yonahlossee riding camp for girls in the mountains of north carolina maybe i am too churched but i see a biblical comparison to the garden of eden since the reason for her removal involves a sexual transgression there are quite a few reviews that criticize the slowness of the novel listening to the audio with an excellent reader i believe the author intended this lack of action to reflect the slowness of the south during that time period i was content to follow thea as she made friends developed her skill at horsemanship while i waited to discover the dirty little secret the writing is beautiful and although the characters are flawed they are so human there is a lot to ponder about mother daughter relationships the blessings of female friendships and how hard economic times devastate families","1043":"this is a superbly written coming of age story of a headstrong teenage girl who receives an ironic gift when her emotionally cowardly family exiles her from their self imposed isolation to protect her from a scandal set in the depression era south at a school for the social elite the manners and mores of the time are revealed through its characters i look forward to future work from this author","1044":"without the smutty part i think i would have liked this more but it took away from the story for me","1045":" i received this book through a goodreads first reads giveaway and i am so glad i did i adored this book it was one of those novels where i couldn't decide if i wanted to read it quickly to find out what happens next or slowly to savour it the story of thea atwell and the challenges she faces as a young southern girl coming of age in the middle of the great depression pulls you in and the mystery of why she was sent away to yonahlossee keeps you reading there is a great combination of moments that are heartbreaking that are uncomfortable and that make you smile i found myself feeling so involved and upset for thea in how she attempts to replace the family she's lost with a whole new one and have it not quite work out in the end i highly recommend this book","1046":"this was a really good book about what happened to a female child in the 1930's when there was a scandal she was sent away at first it's a punishment but after awhile thea realizes that she's never been allowed to interact with other people she learns quite a lot about people at camp and when she finally gets home does she really want to be there anymore","1047":" first sentence i was fifteen years old when my parents sent me away to the yonahlossee riding camp for girls after a family disaster where she played a disgraceful part theodora atwell has been sent to the yonahlossee riding camp for girls in the blue ridge mountains of north carolina away from her home and family for the first time in her life thea must learn how to make her own way in the world away from her twin brother and among girls who believe they are better than anyone the heartbreak and hardships that thea face reflect the problems of the beginning of the great depression this book started very strong for me it definitely had the feeling of a good coming of age story summer camp boarding school story which i do enjoy the budding friendships between thea and the other girls were enjoyable to read about the hints of thea's disgrace were tantalizing and believable the writing and descriptions were quite well done and beautiful i was very excited to continue reading the book and learning more about thea's growth unfortunately thea stopped growing at all and began backsliding around the halfway point of the book she started making the same mistakes again and again view spoiler she was definitely one of those characters who felt the only way to get over one guy was to get under another one hide spoiler i did not like the whole thing with the headmaster mainly because that took over the book in the second half i could not stand thea at all she wanted to blame everyone else for her problems view spoiler she tries to paint her cousin as a rapist when she never objected to anything and had initiated most of their fooling around she knew what he wanted when he came to the barn same thing with the headmaster i cannot remember his name she knew his wife was coming back but somehow blames him for not continuing their affair she was a very annoying character hide spoiler you can tell the author is a first timer much of the book is filler and at times whole scenes are copied and pasted in various places in the book thea and the headmaster have the same conversation multiple times for no reason it was a struggle for me to finish this book i am sure many will enjoy this book and that it will earn many awards mainly for the shock value i am just disappointed because it started so strongly and then lost its way around the halfway point it will probably be touted as a crossover for the ya audience mainly because of the age of the heroine but i feel that most ya readers will not give it the time to actually get through it alphabet challenge y","1048":"this book has everything family dynamics a girl coming of age in 1930s america mystery horses a good read that will make you think about mistakes and consequences","1049":"3 5 starsthis book has a dreamy ethereal detached quality as if told from the perspective of someone nearing the end of life telling the story of her youth set in the early 1930s at the brink of the great depression disclafani's novel for which there was apparently quite the bidding war among publishers follows 15 year old thea who is sent away to a riding school and summer camp for young ladies the camp set in the deep south is more concerned with etiquette social manners and of course equestrianism--all noble pursuits of the proper southern belle in pre ww2 america--than books and homework headed by a young couple henry and beth holmes with three young daughters including 7 year old decca whom thea befriends of their own the camp is home to girls from rich families some of whom are running away from a shameful past this is certainly the case for thea who we know got into some kind of trouble and who's unsettled and initially unhappy in her new home the story does have a lot of unnecessary asides life at the camp is described in some detail but nothing really happens for the first third of the book and the plot pacing doesn't pick up until nearly the end much of the first 100 pages is pure unnecessary filler we learn everything about the girls yet we learn nothing about them we know they're rich pretty well mannered we know what kinds of things they own we know their horseback riding aptitude we also figure out that thea is not entirely a reliable narrator she doesn't see herself the way others see her do any of us and she's insurmountably self centered petty unfocused and self destructive she is a teenager after all she is jealous of the holmes family and feels that the handsome henry holmes can do better than his dowdy prim wife who watches thea like a hawk this is thea's story certainly and it's also a story about horses and friendship and family ties there's a mystery involved why was thea sent away what happened between her and her twin brother sam and older cousin georgie but the focus is a young girl's coming of age her sexual awakening the strict morals that bind her the isolation that stifles her thea follows along not quite learning from her mistakes she is often angry and quick to make abstract judgments about a situation or person or perhaps that's disclafani not thea i found this book painfully boring initially but in the end i'm glad i persevered the novel has been getting a lot of buzz but it's a slow languid read more a novel of societal expectations than a mystery we anticipate the reveal the event that leads to thea's disgrace i figured out the great tragedy perhaps not the exact trajectory of it but close enough early on and i think any astute reader would so the mystery is really beside the point one final point there are some mature sexual topics tackled in this novel so even though the narrator protagonist is 15 16 this is not a ya novel by any stretch of the imagination had i read this at age 16 vs 20 years later i would have been disturbed and uncomfortable with the events that unfolded both in thea's past and her present","1050":"the characters were so unlikeable i really struggled to finish","1051":"don't read this book just don't it's baffling and inconsistent the narrative will seem promising but then disappoints with gratuitous awfulness trust me no","1052":" i did enjoy this book but i didn't love it maybe it was because i had to put it down so many times due to life's interruptions it's 1930 and a young girl has been involved in a family tragedy her parents who have never been warm and fuzzy decide to send her away to a camp once she has been there for the summer she is told that she will stay for the rest of her school education she does make some friends and can enjoy her passion of riding horses she doesn't understand some of her emotions and gets herself involved with things that could have harmed her however she misses her twin brother and wants to make amends with her family the book is described as a coming of age story back in the 1930's it appears that families did not share their business with their children and often misunderstandings turned into major problems the reader can be the judge of whether or not she made the right choices i did think the ending was a bit abrupt and didn't explain enough of what happened years later","1053":" i can't decide between one and two stars for this book i enjoyed some of the story but i felt that her characters weren't likeable i also hated that several times her characters repeated what they just said most likely to indicate that their thoughts were far off however it happened so much that it started to grate on my nerves thea wasn't a likeable character or a well written 15 or 16 year old i realize this book took place in a different time but no 15 year old especially one as closed off to the world as she was would be as knowledgeable about some of the things that thea clearly had a good 'grasp' on if you get my drift there was no mystery to the book and no closure really the scandal happened she didn't learn from it she lived a charmed life in the end not exactly my favorite kind of ending","1054":"2 5 stars the exposition was very very slow and i didn't care for the protagonist the author portrays her as thinking acting experiencing life more like an animal than a human but i'm pretty sure she's just a sociopath or maybe it's because she's from florida at any rate it was difficult to sympathize with her and only one or two of the supporting characters were relatable and yet i could not put this book down i was so absorbed in it","1055":" i enjoyed this book much more than i thought i would i love historical fiction and the backdrop of the wealthy south during the depression era was a different setting than i had encountered before thea the main character is compelling as she comes of age discovers her sexuality begins to understand her mistakes and makes a life for herself thea's love of horses and the constant they provide in her life is the most beautiful part of the story we should all be so blessed as to find something that we are good at love and that remains such a joy for our lifetimes","1056":"i very much enjoy the way she puts words together the flow of the narrative kept me riveted even when the story was hard to handle because of emotion odd family dynamics that seem idyllic but turn out to have been damaging sad but in a feel good way in the end","1057":"i'm a sucker for boarding school type stories i also loved the visuals painted of florida i know very little about horses too so that was fun ultimately i found this a little long but it's a good read for a decent literary choice good for discussion in book clubs too","1058":"least likable main character i've come across in a while and certain plot lines in the book made me feel like i need a shower writing three stars plot two would not recommend","1059":"first novel in a long while that has held my attention long enough to get a substantial amount of reading in one session this novel set during the great depression is a coming of age story about fraternal 15 year old twins whose lives are changed when their cousin's actions and thea's desires cause major family repercussions","1060":"this book was not what i expected at all i chose it because i saw it recommended in multiple magazines as a good summer read it was different than any book i have ever read and that made it good","1061":" this is the story of thea an adventurous girl who is both headstrong and willful and a little wild at heart at the start of the book she and her father are traveling to north carolina from florida where she will begin a camp stay at the yonahlossee riding camp for girls it is the start of the depression but the girls at yonahlossee are privileged and mostly protected from the harsh realities of the depression thea is an excellent rider and her father tells her this is place she will thrive only at the end of chapter one do you realize that she is also there due to a secret she is hiding throughout the course of the story thea learns what it is like to be around girls her own age and away from her family and her twin brother while you slowly learn more about the family secret that brought her to camp an excellent coming of age story set in the appalachian mountains during the depression this book keeps you engaged from start to finish","1062":"this review has been hidden because it contains spoilers to view it click here i had to take a car trip and bought this book on cd at costco to keep me awake for the drive i was so mad that i spent money on it the setting and story had so much potential but the author didn't even go there she stayed on the fact that this young teenage girl slept with her cousin and couldn't and wouldn't control the calls of her young adolescent body and then consciously preyed on her teacher with no thoughts of tomorrow etc i cannot stand books where characters are their hormones and i had to take a car trip and bought this book on cd at costco to keep me awake for the drive i was so mad that i spent money on it the setting and story had so much potential but the author didn't even go there she stayed on the fact that this young teenage girl slept with her cousin and couldn't and wouldn't control the calls of her young adolescent body and then consciously preyed on her teacher with no thoughts of tomorrow etc i cannot stand books where characters are their hormones and nothing else might as well just forget any type of higher level human thinking augh more","1063":"in this book we have a 15 year old student having an affair with the 30 year old headmaster who is married and has three children birth control isn't even mentioned both characters carry on as though this relationship is perfectly normal and acceptable i did not like any of the characters the story line or any of the themes the book supposedly conveys","1064":"i really wasn't sure about this book until the last 50 pages but ended up liking it more than i thought i would after the first few pages hidden depths and whatnot","1065":" i finished reading this a couple of weeks ago but it has taken me a while to decide what i thought about it i really wanted to like this book it seemed like all the elements were there to create a great read mystery interesting characters first person narrator it just didn't work for me though and i think it was due to the voice of the narrator main character thea she may be one of the most unlikable heroines i've ever read with no character development or redeeming qualities disclafani's stilted writing did nothing to improve the work","1066":" what makes a bestseller if this book was deservedly one then i know why i'm not an agent or a publisher i thought this book was dreadful i won't even be passing it on to a friend it's that bad i found it maudlin overwrought and so slow moving that i felt as if i were slogging through a florida swamp there is not one character with whom i could empathize sexy maybe it was but in such a creepy repulsive way that it was difficult to read there's a whole lot of equestrian stuff going on to which i cannot relate but even the horses were dull and sad why did i keep reading because it was a best seller with some very positive reviews so i kept expecting it to get better but it never did i just saw a promo for another book by this author rest assured i will not be wasting any time reading it total disappointment","1067":"girls boarding school 1930s mysterious family drama coming of age story this was basically my dream summer read","1068":"what a disappointment","1069":"an amazing coming of age story set in 1930 against the background of the depression people still had hope but reality was closing in thea atwell was to learn her value and she's none to happy any limits are placed on her great book","1070":"perhaps i set my hopes too high what i expected was a coming of age story that transcends time and social circumstances but what i got was a tragic story of a girl being misjudged misused and disregarded","1071":"i had a hard time putting this down but it was very maudlin a complex narrator who is discovered to be having an affair with her cousin and is sent away so her family can try to recover from the tragedy she leaves behind","1072":"a privileged girl who's family feels no effects from the onset of the great depression is sent to a horse riding camp for ladies in north carolina due to a mysterious indiscretion that is only slowly revealed as you read i did not feel much empathy with the main character as it did not seem she truly grew or learned much besides the fact she should be here own person no matter what her family thinks i also thought the 'mysterious circumstances' that led to her banishment were truly horrible i just kept thinking #richwhitegirlproblems the entire time i read this novel","1073":"good storyline but the incest and inappropriate activity she acted upon was a bit dark for me her mom obviously never discussed relationships nor intimacy","1074":"i liked this book interesting perspective on how the wealthy families in the south managed through the great depression great characters","1075":"2 5 i liked it ok but got done and wondered what the point was i grew to dislike the protagonist and didn't understand her motivations","1076":"picked this up again after abandoning it a while back it is very slow storytelling that's for sure i almost felt pulled asleep a few times it's also very sexy full of list and angst definitely something you have to be in the mood for i thought the story and characters were decent but the pacing was off and the ending was boring i skimmed","1077":" for the first time i actually revised my star rating up to five stars this book is so well written and the story is so juicy it's compelling and delightful and horrifying but what makes it a five star book is the message which is so different from so many novels adult and ya that i read and the message is this your shit is your shit you have to own it you are not obligated to take your family's shit your life is your own you do not have to carry their water exile is often a gift and most importantly happiness is granted only to those who seek it","1078":"ho hum the reader waits for some cover to be ripped off a family's disgraceful secret but finds the whole thing kind of disappointing","1079":"i had a hard time choosing between 3 and 4 stars for this one i went with 3 because it is a bit racy for my taste but i still really enjoyed what is a true coming of age story and thought it was well written i also love that it was written so that the storyline unfolded in present tense and past tense gently all the way through","1080":" by far one of the strangest books i've ever read i was intrigued by the reviews seemed people either gave it 5 stars or 1 and commented that they couldn't put it down or absolutely hated it i probably fall in the middle but find this to be a book with a major identity crisis it is described as a coming of age and period book but it couldn't be further from what i view as a coming of age book it was dark and weird it also was not a period piece nothing in it really made you feel like you were in the period in which it takes place or understand the lives of people during that time the sex scenes were way too graphic for the type of book it seemed like it was trying to be like i said major identity crisis","1081":" i felt strangely powerful i was a girl of fifteen locked away in the mountains surrounded by strangers but i would be all right i would emerge from this place pg 54apparently this is a book that either inspires severe criticism or much accolades i was fascinated by thea and her life in the 1930's i was caught up in the atmosphere of foreboding mystery and expectancy the basic idea is that sheltered pampered thea has done something so terrible that she is sent away from her sprawling luxurious home surrounded by acres and acres of land her mother has made this her family's own private universe despite the wrenching poverty of the depression thea and sam her twin remain relatively oblivious as they remain inside this opulent lifestyle all thea believes she needs is her beloved horse sasi and her beloved twin sam after all this is all she's known since it seems this is a book that incites strong feelings it's hard to say who will like it i can only speak for myself","1082":"the last 1 3 of the book was the best good story but writing was just okay and i never really felt compelled to read it i think it took me almost a month to complete might be a good beach read i did like learning about the horses though it seemed like a huge over reaction to which i could not relate","1083":"i'll be selling this one to a used bookstore good fast 'beach' reading however characters are very flat story and the setting are compelling but not fully fleshed out enough to be wholly believable and my least favorite in a novel repetitive vocabulary and the main character's name is repeated 200 times per page no no","1084":"this book was engrossing for sure i stayed up late to finish it but then i wasn't sure if i had really liked it it needed a good editor for one thing author repeated some phrases too often and that got in my way i was not comfortable with the time frames jumping back and forth either not too many characters come off well in this book","1085":" a bit of a shrug not great but good enough nothing all that surprising trying too hard to be much more epic of a story than it is felt like there was a fair amount of unexplored potential with the other girls at the camp they didn't feel half drawn exactly but they felt sort of incidental which i guess on the one hand worked because thea is a selfish character who wouldn't recognize too much of everyone else's lives without it being in relation to her own as we all do i don't know didn't love it but goodish","1086":"this review has been hidden because it contains spoilers to view it click here not a very interesting book maybe she could have shortened it by 50 pages and just told the big secret a little earlier so she was promiscuous girl before she left and didn't disappoint while she was at camp she was just like her mother and well that is all we really learn the end","1087":" 2 5 stars and maybe spoilers to follow if you care about that sort of thing the yonahlossee riding camp for girls is essentially the whiny reminiscing of a self indulgent privileged overly sexed adolescent who despite paying lip service to how horrible the depression is turning out for everyone around her lives in a curiously consequence free world even as she is supposedly being punished for some horrible shocking sin the shocker she had sex and that is in the end not even what she is being punished for as it is really her brother's actions as a result of that that lead to her being foisted off to horse camp boarding school there she gets to wander around pondering how beautiful the mountains are have illicit sexytimes with a married man and bitch about how other girls are all terrible eventually she returns home for a half assed reconciliation then goes off to live her carefree life unmoored by family ties and how wonderful for her i'm not opposed to on screen sex in books but i'm really tired of sex being the be all end all hinge around which characters identities turn and the uncomfortably graphic descriptions were much much more than i was prepared for coming into this novel i'm also theoretically unopposed to unlikable characters but there has to be something in the narrative to make up for their unlikability and also i kept feeling that i was supposed to root for thea i was supposed to embrace and love her but no no way in hell she was such a bad person without any redeeming qualities whatsoever so all in all another dud on the literary front the books i most anticipated for summer have all turned out to range from 'meh' to downright terrible i'm sad to have to add yonhalossee to that score","1088":"i'm not sure what to make of this book i found myself connecting with the narrator less and less as the book went on and i learned more and more about her situation the circumstances of her expulsion from her family are kept mysterious for the first half of the book which makes for excellent suspense it wasn't so much what thea did to end up at yonahlossee that distanced me from her as her growing selfishness and sense of self importance her crime does involve a boy and it is disturbing and shocking but i wanted more reason for feel for her and to understand why she makes the self destructive choices she makes at home and at school i wonder what the same story would be like from the mother's point of view the attempt to prevent her daughter from becoming \"fast\" like she once was backfires driving thea into yet another unhealthy and disturbing relationship are we to understand thea and perhaps her mother before her has no control over these feelings and desires however the book gives great descriptions of the usually odd but sometimes nasty and sometimes generous behavior of teenaged girls i occasionally forgot when the book takes place the 1930s because some things at girls' schools never change the passages about horses and horseback riding are beautiful and the most captivating of the book","1089":"i wanted to like this book but i really had trouble attaching to the main character and was not caught up in the story i didn't feel like many of the characters were drawn out enough for me particularly the main character's twin brother","1090":"pretty disappointing overall for the hype that i read the most fascinating parts to me had to do with horses i learned quite a bit about dealing with them however with a protagonist that i felt got what she deserved at all turns mainly because she is not a decent person the book fell flat once the secret that got her sent away was discovered and she fell right back into the same mode i really wasn't all that interested anymore","1091":"it's 1931 and a family tragedy has occurred and 16 year old thea is banished from her florida home and sent to an all girl's school in the blue ridge mountains she's angry and hurt fortunately she gradually begins to understand her situation better and to find the positive side of her expulsion from her family thanks to the friends and adults that help her cope best of all she has her love of horses and riding this is a coming of age story and there's a surprise on almost every page nothing is as expected disclafani always keeps you guessing about the mystery of what exactly has occurred back home but she does it in a way that the mystery isn't the main motivator that keeps you turning the pages thea's inner life provides the main impetus but the mystery is a fascinating bonus thea is an unusual girl in an unusual situation that turns out to be universal in many ways there's definitely nothing ordinary in disclafani's writing she's a new talent to watch this review is based on an advanced readers copy supplied by the publisher disclaimer given per ftc requirement","1092":" so close to a five star book but not quite one minor quibble the main character's name is thea which i just could not keep saying in my mind i don't know why it was probably the th sound thing and it sounded like a lisp so i started thinking tay uh a bigger quibble sometimes the language and tone of the narrator's tay uh's voice did not square all the way around for example her father is a physician so it might have been his influence and candor about the human body that led tay uh to describe her experiences as she does but you never really hear that in the book and instead her father's career seems to be more important because he helps folks who can't pay rather than as a window to his daughter's vocabulary or lack thereof you might have guessed by now this isn't a sweet book to read with your own daughter after all a riding camp for girls sounds fun but the story is the telling of what happened after and the before is only revealed slowly bits and pieces of a familiar and forbidden love the book kept me turning the pages yet enjoying the story as it is laid out and i think you will too","1093":"wistful and poetic at times sexy hot at others leaves you with strange feeling of having read something you shouldn't have","1094":"disappointing could have been so much better 1930s are interesting but way too many details about uninteresting stuff in my opinion","1095":"a great book if you enjoy 1 coming of age novels2 horses3 camp4 historical fiction great depression","1096":"this review has been hidden because it contains spoilers to view it click here a lush sexy novel is the publishers description on the book jacket this book read like a young adult novel but the subject matter made me very uncomfortable the sex was statutory rape i can not recommend this book","1097":"this book was an easy and fast read and very suspenseful i thought the story and characters were well presented i just had a difficult time with the author switching from present to past tense that aspect also made it more difficult to distinguish when we were with her as she was fifteen and when we were looking back on her life as an adult","1098":"i found this book have a dreamy quality and found the writing to be quite beautiful it is mainly the story of how to go on despite a family tragedy that happens during the already tough depression years","1099":" read this book because it was chosen for my book club thea is a 15 year old spoiled twin who is home schooled during the depression in florida after doing something bad she is sent by her family away to a riding camp for nearly a year by her family while there she matures in anticipation of going back eventually to her twin brother and parents who had sent her away i liked the writing style but found the overall book fairly boring hence giving it an it's okay rating down i will read future works by this debut author","1100":"the lush atmosphere created by the author is the best part of this all to predictable 'very southern' novel","1101":"much better than expected the title sounded so boring that i was reluctant to read it however i was not disappointed and really liked the book","1102":"it was hard to rate this novel i loved a few turns of phrase wanted to relate to the girl horse love but it felt overlong and like it was laying it on too thick the structure was melodramatic and the ending felt rushed some loose ends tied but still hanging my instinct is to say three stars but it doesn't feel fair and it wouldn't be two it is","1103":"i loved it i hated it i loved it again beautifully written but the plot construction was a bit lacking the main character was well drawn but supporting characters were not the big secret was obvious from the beginning but should have been revealed in the first 100 pages failing to do so was exceptionally frustrating and yet it kept me reading b c i needed to see the secret spoken out loud","1104":"i thought this was a well written and interesting story of thea atwell i didn't think she was a likable character but i like the story the bad girl vs boys will be boys theme was good and still exists today the depression era time period is just subtle enough to show us how even the wealthy girls at riding camp were affected by the stock market crash thea is a powerful young woman who sets her mind on a goal and goes for it","1105":"nice cover nice idea woodenly executed plot","1106":"recommending to everyone i know","1107":"started out okay but lost all moral compass and fell apart disappointing","1108":" i was a girl i learned who got what she wanted but not without sadness not without cutting a wide swath of destruction so wide it consumed my family and almost me i almost fell into it with them i almost lost myself this passage comes very close to the end of the book but says so much about thea atwell the book's main character the author crafted the novel in such a way that we are in suspense a good long while figuring out just what it is thea has done that made her family send her away to the yonahlossee riding camp and boarding school for girls in the mountains of north carolina thea is fifteen then sixteen during the time we spend with her the country is in the throes of the great depression her family is still comfortable on their isolated citrus ranch in florida her father a doctor her mother an elegant homemaker thea loves horses and is a fearless rider she has a twin brother sam who is her opposite in many ways more fragile a kid who rescues injured animals and heals them thea and her brother have been homeschooled and therefore are lacking in the company of other children except for their cousin georgie who sometimes comes to visit i don't want to include any spoilers here in my commentary but let it be said that thea very much comes alive as a sexual being during her mid teen years though she is intelligent her rational mind does not extend to sexuality she can not fight the urge to follow her sexual impulses she initially feels like an outsider at her boarding school but finds one good friend in sissy a roommate who sneaks out regularly to canoodle with her boyfriend in the woods there is a whole coterie of school girls whose tight circle headstrong thea finds hard to parse they are by turns snippy and nice thea is very competitive about her equestrian skills horses have always been a part of her life and riding often seems to save her sanity you will be on the edge of your seat worrying about thea and her wrong turns will she ever find peace love acceptance this book is a dark storm a dark horse lush eloquent and forbidding i can hardly believe it is a first novel masterful brooding and sometimes a little creepy i almost feel guilty saying i enjoyed it since there is so much pain and angst involved i suspect many readers will find it too dysfunctional in some ways i can sympathize with that mindset but i was so impressed with the author's style i fell headlong into her novel and look forward to reading more of whatever she writes next","1109":"i expected this book to be better than it was after it got good reviews the most interesting part of the book to me was the settings","1110":"could not get into this book and found it dry soulless and prattle","1111":" what a good book an unexpected find at the library based on the title and obvious horsey appeal i found it to be a welcoming place to visit whenever i could while i had to sideline it for a little while for another book on book club deadline i found myself reading from this book as a treat now and then before finishing the other book and returning to yonahlossee it's the kind of book that when i see i'm near the end i slow down as to savor and make the most of each word paragraph page idea and where it may lead and connect i appreciated the in person account of what it was like for the main character to grow up in 1930 in the south i appreciated the deft handling of a number of tabou subjects some of which are no longer quite as tabou for example the idea of a young woman choosing her own course in life making her own experience i found myself thinking of the book middlesex by jeffrey eugenides in fact what a great double feature they'd make enjoy","1112":" lush gorgeous writing and a fairly compelling story although the ending fell a bit flat for me i had trouble reminding myself that the narrator was supposed to be a fifteen year old girl the sentiment and the tone seem as if they come from a much older and slightly world weary woman there are moments when the main character thea appears almost too alienated to be sympathetic a slight stroke of vulnerability would have rescued her from the somewhat bitter and emotionally wooden demeanor the author creates for her thea's love for horses is the only sentiment that shines through as passionate and true she seems to hold the rest of the world with the possible exception of her twin brother at a cool arm's length still the book is worth a read for the beautiful writing and the thoughtful sad look at the life of an emotionally adrift teenager and her equally lost family during the great depression","1113":"this was a 3 5 4 star","1114":"i enjoyed reading of a privileged young girl coming of age in the south at the beginning of the depression her family dynamics and her friendships i wish the book either lasted longer into her adulthood or i wish there could be a sequel of what happens next","1115":" i liked this book but didn't love it i did think it was a fun summer read in that i didn't have to think to hard and liked the main character thea well enough i thought it had a spicy and fun title but it didn't live up to the title thea is sent off to a boarding school for very wealthy girls and the thing that kept me going for pages and pages was why she was sent there you can see that there is a scandal somehow in her past but the details are sketchy until about half way through is there money involved in the scandal an unwanted pregnancy it was driving me crazy i almost skipped to the end in the end i think it was a pleasantly diverting book i wouldn't suggest anyone wait for it on a holds list but it is worth picking it up in a few months i think it would be a fine book for a book club because it is the story of a girl who is sorting out her place in the world becoming aware of her sexuality and the power of that distancing herself from her family making friends all kinds of meaty stuff a book club would have fun with","1116":" this book made me think of the catcher in the rye with feminist leanings there were things i really liked about it the writing is good and it does invoke feelings though it wasn't really for the characters it was more an anxiety from thea's choices and an anger toward her and her cousin she proves to be a dynamic character as far as her own personal knowledge is concerned but she continuously chooses to repeat grave mistakes and disregards any possible consequences even though she acknowledges them and expresses intense relief when they prove unfulfilled spoiler alert aside from all of that disclafani infuses the novel with graphic descriptions of thea's sexual encounters i agree the sex is the catalyst of the novel but none of the explicitness is necessary and just comes across as vulgar shock seeking there is one moment between thea and her cousin that is of particular importance when she describes the feelings directly following their first real intercourse other than that the rest of it could have been left out for a more to the point and less graphic story","1117":"note can't figure out where to put my comments reason for duplication coming of age story for a young girl sent to a finishing school as punishment for what she had done the story was compelling but as the book continued i liked the main character less and less although there was suspense around the book there wasn't really a plot interesting and discussable book","1118":"this was a coming of age novel mystery what's the scandal that sent young thea away long on plot and i imagine it would be a good beach read there's sex but sometimes felt it tried too hard to be sexy","1119":"i'm not sure what all the rage is about this book it's told in the first person from a pampered rich girl who is sent away to a riding camp for something bad that she has done the constant i've done something bad becomes a bit boring and i suppose the little hints about the bad thing are supposed to draw you in i literally slogged through this book and only finished it because someone i know said it was fabulous","1120":" i am so happy i allow myself to wander the bookshelves at barnes and noble as well as sites like goodreads otherwise i would have missed this book the title caught my eye and i was drawn right into the story within the first 15 seconds of reading i have rather eclectic tastes but haven't been reading much of this genre for a while it was quite nice to read a real story one i could relate to even though it took place in the early 30's a well crafted coming of age story that kept me reading straight through to the end","1121":"i absolutely loved this book the authors writing style was so rich and generous wonderful story beautifully written","1122":"if you ride horses this book is one of the few that accurately captures the internal relationship between rider and horse also if you have ever worked at or attended a camp you have to read this but most of all this book is for the few of us who have ever worked at or attended an all girls riding camp it is exactly everything and you will forever treasure the words of this novel which you will probably wish were your own","1123":"i almost threw this book across the room in the middle of it because i hate it when characters do the stupid obvious thing and it feels like they are just doing it in order to advance the story but then it gets better sort of you could probably live a good life without reading it","1124":"i found this a well told story but disturbing i almost need to read it again","1125":" this was such a poignant coming of age story that it was almost haunting i picked it because i love historical fiction but haven't read anything in the great depression era the loss of innocence story was so timeless though it wasn't even really historical fiction i think every girl maybe every child goes through that stage where their world starts to open up beyond their own little family community and i love connecting with that experience even about a teenage girl becoming a young woman in the 30s we think our experiences are so unique to our generation so different from our that of our parents' and grandparents' i loved the way this story reminded me that really every generation fights the same growing up battle the stage that play is acted on may change with the times but the experience of growing up of losing our childhood innocence is so similar across the ages the haunting part was thea's summary of her young life at the end of the book reminded me a little of me i was a girl who wanted too much and back then all that want was a dangerous thing 'woe be to you thea ' mr holmes had said 'woe be to you for wanting too much ' for wanting so much i wanted everything i was a girl i learned who got what she wanted but not without sadness not without cutting a swath of destruction so wide it consumed my family and almost me i almost fell into it i almost lost myself but i was too selfish i wanted as mr holmes put it too much and none of it was a decision a list written out a plan articulated we have no say in who we love and woe be to all of us for that","1126":"i enjoyed this book although it had a lot of sad times i felt that the horse scenes rang true as an equestrian and horse lover it was an interesting picture of the times also","1127":"from the start to me the 15 year old self centered protagonist thea of this story got on my nerves it's 1930 the depression people have lost all their money people are going hungry there's no work etc yet thea having caused a terrible catastrophe in her family is sent away to a posh riding school for girls in shame we do not find out why until towards the end and it's mostly anti climactic she feels sorry for herself misses her twin brother more than a 15 year old should miss her brother dislikes the girls at the camp because it seems they are all richer than she is she wants to be popular but she is greedy and creates a similar situation with the handsome head of the school to that which sent her there in shame in the first place does she have no regret no control it seems not why would an intelligent married man with children involve himself with a spoiled rather provincial child like this surely he would have more sense or am i expecting too much aside from sex thea's thoughts are concentrated on gossip and snotty remarks about the other girls and beating one of them in the riding competition at year end thea seems to have learned nothing at the camp neither scholastically or morally well maybe sexually this struck me as a coming of age novel about a bratty 15 year old girl for 15 year old girls disclafani is a talented writer i hope the next novel she writes will be for adults","1128":"really disappointed in this book so overwrought hard to relate to a rich 15 year old girl falling for her 32 year old headmaster way too much info on horses and ponies","1129":"i had such high hopes for this book but it was so pained and so self absorbed for such a good chunk of it i didn't find it as easy or enjoyable to read as the first quarter third of it to that end it reminded me a lot of prep by curtis sittenfeld which i liked so much at the start but which had me disappointed by the end","1130":"i expected a depression era coming of age story about a girl at horse camp this turned out to be more of a bodice ripper than i bargained for lousy with overwrought teenage dramz aside from a few annoying editorial inconsistencies characters who were already standing standing up that sort of thing the writing was not awful but i feel like i've just been bait and switched","1131":"do not waste your time with this book it meanders around a semi coherent plot in which nothing happens","1132":"wanted to like this more than i did not a new story in the entire novel all the adults were predictably flawed and the teens troubled but understandably so i can't for the life of me understand why this would be a must read this summer it's a check the box period","1133":" i loved this book it's the author's first so i think the writing could have been a little tighter but the story and our first person main character are terrific thea our protagonist is a fifteen year old when the story starts her father is delivering her to a summer camp in north carolina as punishment for something terrible that she's done as the story unfolds against a backdrop of the great depression we learn the reason for her banishment from the family farm as well as watching her come of age at camp she has to contend with possible consequences of several other teenage decisions that she makes while coming to terms with what she's left behind thea's a very likable character with the flaws of being a teenager good book","1134":"3 5 stars nice period piece 1930 in the south wealthy families hit by the depression and the turmoils of one particular girl's life i was kept busy thinking as i read don't do it and as the event got closer really don't do it so i guess it kept my interest on some level","1135":"liked not loved i was disturbed by the protagonist's behaviors they could have used more back story or explanation behind motives they just didn't all make sense liked the horse camp setting and if i were a horsey person i think i would have appreciated the horse elements the author did a good job with those imo overall entertaining but somewhat lacking","1136":"this copy was given to me as part of the penguin debut author's program i really liked the book especially the setting and plot and i think she perfectly captured the confusion of adolescence i predict this will be a big hit with book clubs and summer reading","1137":"started off liking this a lot but by the middle of the book i was tired of it finished it anyway but won't suggest it to friends to read","1138":"the story is a combination of lolita and dirty dancing the sex is graphic ... okay fine but the characters are straight from any \"becoming of age\" story not ya but not for aa actual adults either though the writing's skillful the plot and characters don't inspire any real emotions every aspect is isolated by design rich families during the depression school in the mountains smothering families lastly i would've rated it 3 stars except for the \" end summary \" as if we're too stupid to form our own judgments the narrator recaps her deep meaning at the end yeah thanks","1139":"i loved the setting of this book in a depression era equestrian camp for rich southern girls who'd have thought the writing was great and the characters were interesting","1140":"a debut novel coming of age tale set in the south at an exclusive all girl's horse camp school","1141":"this book reminded me of the yaya books by rebecca wells i don't know why maybe the nostalgia and coming of age stories of young women nevertheless i did not like this book as much as the yaya books i found the writng to be forced repetitious and just too formulaic i really had a hard time finishing the book so i shall not waste any more time reviewing it","1142":"fifteen year old thea atwell is sent away from home to a boarding school after tragedy strikes her family during the great depression as thea is adjusting to living with many girls she is also learning more about who she is and exactly what she wants this is truly a book of heart breaking family dysfunction i am still feeling such a deep mourning for thea in all that she lost and missed out on thea did make mistakes but my heart and mind goes to my own family and how we respond to mistakes and tragedy we eventually break through the grief to a stronger bond thea has to come out on the other side on her own with no true support from her family although she does have to walk a lonely road she matures and develops into exactly who she should be i enjoyed the hopping from past to present as that gave a fuller picture of the story anton disclafani did an excellent job of giving thea a true to life voice of a child becoming a woman in the face of calamity i'm so glad that she also kept the ending consistent with the reality of what would happen with such a family as this i rated this 4 5 stars and recommend it","1143":"i felt very conflicted about this book i think i'm just going to divide it into pros and cons because overall i would say this book wasn't great but it had it's moments pros 1 sometimes disclafani's imagery was quite good and i was pleasantly surprised i would say that technically her writing style was ok just ok i suppose 2 i liked that she attempted to tackle a number of different themes including coming of age youth in the depression horses sexual awakening blah blah blah 3 as trashy as the book was she uses a lot of sex to hold it all together i feel i was pretty much committed to finding out what happens next despite being somewhat predictable i was definitely turning pages to get to the end the author did a good job of weaving the story of the past to the present together and i could appreciate that cons 1 when you frame a book as a horse book watch out because crazy horse people like me want to read about a book centered on horses and this was not it additionally it's pretty obvious the author hasn't spent too much time around horses besides research or if she has it doesn't show 2 the main character is despicable i suppose the point of every book isn't to like the character by any means her actions are just gross like i know she's having a sexual awakening or whatever but it seems like she just thinks everybody is in love with her and she wants to screw everybody ugh like the world wants to read about more of those people yikes 3 as i mentioned before there were tons of themes going on which would have been great if she had explored one or two of them but it was like she half assed looked at the fifteen different themes and didn't do a great job of mastering any of them unfortunately 4 there seemed to be a lot of historical inaccuracies and writing about a progressive wealthy and secluded camp for girls in the 1930's sounded implausible even after reading the back of the book soooo it was as rough as it sounds 5 disclafani just shows a little bit of an immaturity when it comes to writing i think if she developed more as a writer and focused on writing about what she knows that could definitely help her in the long run not the book for me sorry ya'll i read it after reading that one of my favorite bloggers enjoyed it and i was pretty disappointed","1144":"this is one of those books that gives me pause when i think about what to write i enjoyed it but only in that way that you can enjoy a book where the protagonist irritates you so you don't actually care what happens to her at the same time as a pretty realistic portrayal of a spoiled rich sheltered 15 year old i'm not sure she was meant to be likable so i guess the book was a success","1145":"this book started out good however it ended in a very rushed and confusing way it was almost like the author had to wrap it up in a limited amount of time or text it ruined it for me unfortunately","1146":" my parents had sent me away because they saw i was a girl who wanted too much wanted badly inappropriately disclafani 388 theodora thea atwell is the twin daughter of a wealthy family in the depression era south as her own life crashes around her so does the united states' society on which her family's status depends the novel chronicles thea's life through her own narration of flashbacks of her childhood adolescence and the time she is at the yonahlossee riding camp for girls the novel explores the various relationships thea has with those around her her relationship to her family pre ysg is an ideal one she knows her parents love her and she loves them she has a deep relationship with her twin samuel that i can't describe as an only child but the author describes beautifully and that's why i rated this book so highly the language is love i highlighted a lot through my reading her relationship with her cousin georgie is complex and develops into a disturbing one as thea develops into womanhood the three young people have a three musketeers relationship for the majority of the book as they are like siblings when george visits the atwell abode the book is presented as parallel narrative with thea shifting point of view from her year at yonahlosee girls' school to her life with her family the shifts happen at random points which was confusing at times while she's at ysg thea changes into a young woman and from what i noted the change did her good as her father puts it in a letter she is sent to the school to learn to get along with other girls her age which she will interact with in her adult years as a member of high society once she marries of course the changes she goes through causes her to rethink her familial relationships including her sibling relationship with sam who she notes frequently is the child who was left behind thea also describes her relationship with horses which is like a love affair she is herself while on a horse thea's relationship with naari her horse while at yonahlossee is as close one almost human like through him she also reflects on her development as a rider as she rides sasi at home thea's relationships with her roommates in augusta cabin shows social relationships taken out of the realm of her parents' home and the adult world the girls are the first relationships she has with her peers and the results are surprising the school is a microcosm for the adult world which the girls will shift into once they graduate find husbands and become mothers the novel's depression era setting effects the girls even while protected at camp the students report what happens at home through letters and these show the marked changes tat society is forced to endure as a result of the financial crisis the school is even forced to change with the times soon the depression becomes a character which changes some girls' lives forever","1147":" america is on the brink of the great depression and sixteen year old thea who has until now led a charmed existence in florida has done something very bad her deed it's revealed as the book progresses though can be figured out fairly quickly is so bad that her family banishes her from her beloved home and send hers to north carolina to spend a year at the yonahlossee riding camp for girls while at the camp thea rides horses makes friends owns her sexuality and realizes truths about herself and her family i enjoyed this book while i was reading it i was caught up in the story the prose was clear and direct and made for a fast read and the sexy parts were pretty sexy lord knows i love a book with sexy parts that said since finishing the book and discussing it with my book club i have some concerns is thea a reliable narrator not really is her twin brother a simpleton quite possibly does thea knowingly get herself into trouble despite understanding the consequences sort of i feel like this book wanted to explore sexuality repression and freedom and it does but the things the characters do in order to achieve this exploration don't always feel natural overall a great book while i was reading it a pretty good book once i was done and an excellent choice for book club there was so much to pick apart that we ended up talking about it for almost two hours which is pretty impressive considering the number of women in our club and the amount of wine we consume","1148":"mixed feelings liked the writing and setting some the characters were not believable","1149":"unexpected is my best word for this book i thought it was an interesting book","1150":"i didn't really know what to expect i'd heard of this somewhere a magazine and really hadn't paid attention to the synopsis in any case it much more this one time at equestrian camp than is expected for some reason i liked the idea of this more than i really enjoyed the book the main character thea is a spoiled brat and difficult and prickly to read in the first person but i disliked it less than many of the reviews i saw here so i guess that's something","1151":"good topics horses and coming of age mediocre writing and plot spiced up with some sexy stuff but maybe that part was only spicy because the rest was so bland","1152":"an entertaining read but parts were unnecessarily twisted and disturbing in my opinion happy ending which i always like so that salvaged it a bit for me","1153":" i saw alot of reviews for this book it is not one i would normally go for but it was right there on the new books shelf at the library so i checked it out this is a book that makes me wonder as always about the division between adult and ya literature i would absolutely categorize this as a ya book the heroine is 15 17 yrs old and the message is a good one for young women it is a good story interesting and well written the overall moral was worthwhile that you have to pay attention and make your own life and not rely on the opinions or plans of others it was interesting though because this is one of those characters whose choices all make sense when you are in her head but i have to wonder if telling the story from one of the other character's perspectives would have made her way less likeable as in any story the jumping back and forward in time can get a little annoying but overall it worked well in this book this is also a book that reinforces the idea that it is good to be a woman in this era rather than in the past altogether it is likely to make you think about relationships and how people interact as well as the places that shape out lives","1154":"a vivid coming of age story that was well written but i didn't find myself loving it the author hinted at the main event of the book for about 150 pages before actually telling the reader what happened that's a lot of scene setting to survive and i prefer heavy hitters from the beginning i also didn't love that she wrapped up the main character's entire life in about 3 pages at the end which felt more like an afterword or postscript a worthwhile book but not one i'd recommend to my friends","1155":" i took this book with me on a trip to the gorgeous tennessee mountains looking at the cover doesn't it look like it would be a perfect pick for such an environment first of all i love the idea of summer camp i feel that not enough books about summer camp exist for adults from the cover and the description i was expecting an exciting and lively adventure at camp with vibrant characters and a lush green setting i was so ready to dive right into this world where young girls are walking arm in arm and growing up together for a summer having new experiences and becoming friends for life you don't get any of that with this book by any stretch of the imagination instead you get a lackluster setting that has no excuse to be lackluster the setting should be gorgeous there is no excuse it should be described out the ass but it's not it's boring and washed out like everything else in this book supporting characters you can't bring yourself to care about one way or the other a plot that just meanders and doesn't even try to get exciting beyond icky sexual encounters and the basest most selfish most unfeeling and out for herself main character i've read about in a long time thea freaking atwell i am talking about you run and hide girlfriend because more than once i envisioned smacking you on the head with the very book you're in so it doesn't take a genius to figure out right off the bat that there's tenseness in the atwell family probably having to do with thea primarily i'm not going to tell you what happens but i am going to say that thea ruins her entire family 4 lyfe her parents and her twin brother sam are never the same after what goes down thus the whole sending her to camp deal because goodreads lumps this book in the \"coming of age\" category i was hoping some kind of coming of age would happen maybe thea would grow as a person and return to her parents a shining model citizen yeah no she's the same nasty horny brat that she was in the beginning she doesn't come to terms with what she did wrong she doesn't say she's sorry she doesn't reflect on her part in what happened or what she could have done differently she doesn't even seem to think she did anything wrong being sent to camp should have been the first clue that she did something bad actually she should have known that what she did was wrong as she was doing it yet here we are that's why i can't stand her character from start to finish she is completely out for herself pouty and unwilling to even act human yet for some reason she makes all these friends at camp are you kidding sissy run away thea is a terrible person i wish one of her horses had sat on her head and put us all out of our misery thea is the biggest problem i have with this book but there are other pieces of poop smeared all over this book that need mentioning the only characters that even semi intrigued me were leona and sissy really that's only because i imagined leona as daenerys targaryen everyone else was bland bland bland none of the characters acted like someone would in real life none i also found that the author would spring new characters on me without introducing them i had to backpedal a couple times to see if they were introduced earlier but nope we're just supposed to know who they are i guess honestly the more i think about this book the more i hate it i gave it 2 stars at first because i did like the writing style for the most part that's too generous 1 star bitch nobody should read this book it was terrible icky sex god awful characters and a bland setting really the only good thing i can say about this book is that it had an ominous tone to start before we discover the reason thea is at camp i'm scraping the bottom of the barrel here to find a tiny sliver of goodness so glad this was from the library","1156":"this book knocked my socks off it is rich and honest and mysterious and true and so beautifully written","1157":"very well written the structure and vocabulary flowed very well and kept me interested as for the story it was surprising and i found it quite heavy it left me feeling somewhat sorrowful and heavyhearted which is what i didn't expect from this novel but i appreciated it nonetheless although because of this i wouldn't rush to read it again but that it an opinion according to my own taste all in all i enjoyed the book and was excited to get home and continue reading it painted beautiful imagery that carries readers on an extremely meaningful journey","1158":"i wanted to like this more that i did last week i couldn't put is down but was disappointed by the end i don't thing thea learned anything and didn't really have any consequences for her behavior at yonahlossee her only consequence was the loss of sam but i think she might have handled her life differently","1159":" i have taken a ridiculously long time to read this book because i felt no empathy with either the characters or the story it just dragged nothing made me want to turn over the pages normally i will abandon a book if i haven't engaged with it by page 50 but having been given a copy to review i was determined not to be beaten i would have given it two stars but the last fifty or so pages began to redeem it a little and make some sense of the proceeding narrative it is written in the first person the maim character being theadora known as thea attwell she is growing up in 1930s america after the financial crash she lives in florida with her wealthy family of mother father and twin brother sam they have their money in citrus growing which seems to save them from the economic disaster not so their only relatives her father's brother uncle george his wife aunt carrie and their only child georgie a year older than thea her family are very close to them and they seem to be the only people they have to visit thea and her brother are educated at home by their father and live in isolation from other people being brought up by their beautiful mother with a sense of their own superiority thea is also obsessed with horse riding and this is a major theme through the book as thea reaches adolescence this background becomes a receipt for disaster and she ends up being sent away to a school for young ladies that specialises in horse riding where she spends a year we follow her life there with flash backs to her life at home which gradually builds up to the explanation of why she was sent away i'm afraid that i found the main character utterly self obsessed and rather unlikable although at the end it does become clear that her upbringing mainly her mother's doing and her inherited genes again from her mother were responsible for her character many of the people in the novel are shadowy figures that needed filling out for instance the girls at the school with thea were just a string of names and although briefly described failed to have any form or identity for me i just couldn't remember who was who some of the failure to enjoy this novel may be my fault i never did enjoy boarding school books or horse riding i dislike criticising a first novel and yes it is well and sensitively written particularly the sex scenes of which there are many but the author failed to make me care about her characters for me this was a book about not a lot did i gain anything from reading it not really","1160":"this moody depression era story about a 15 year old girl banished to a fancy private school with horses was compelling but i did not find it entirely enjoyable thea atwell is sent to the school for reasons we're not told of until late in the book the time period thea's bizarre choices at the school and the family shame behind the story cast a depressing tone the entire story the book was well written but it left me feeling blah","1161":"loved the camp meets boarding school setting but the rest left me lukewarm","1162":"very lolita","1163":"not my favorite read","1164":"this book was such a surprise it unraveled slowly and i appreciated that not allowing either the plot of thea's past or present triumph over the other but instead presenting them side by side in such a readable way","1165":"i wanted to like this more than i did however i find the over sexualization of thea to be unnecessary and a disservice to the story and i am not a conservative person by nature instead of a coming of age novel about the friendships that form between girls in a tough situation it become an uncomfortable exploration of thea's proclivities and her search for redemption in completely the wrong place this book was saved by better than average writing but it was ultimately a disappointment","1166":"an okay not great book the writing was good the characters unlikable for the most part","1167":"did not like any character in this book it was a book about teenage sexual angstwhich i am not the least bit interested in it was well written but that is the onlygood thing i can say about it","1168":"this book was a pleasant surprise a little racy and scandalous set in the 1930s it is a story about a girl and her indiscretions and how back in the day an entire family was touched by her actions i loved how it kept you guessing about what really happened going form present to past although i'm a sucker for those types of stories didn't love the details about the horses but that was part of thea's identity","1169":"would not recommend this one author is clearly talented at writing but i am not sure why she then said \"i'd love for my first book to be about a main character who is a teenage girl who has sexual relations with her cousin is sent away from home then has sexual relations with the school director and anyone else she can find \" wouldn't have been at the top of my list of things to write about but oh well","1170":" i received this book through goodreads first read giveaway i was enticed from the first page this is a story that took me back to the unreasonable expectations of how good girls have been expected to behave while bad boys just are the way they are i loved the courage and strength of thea the power in the commitment to those she truly cared for the friendships that are never clearly defined are a true representation of how complicated relationships with humans are yet how very clearly our relationships with animals can be i will look forward to more books by anton","1171":"as a horse girl this book has certain immediate appeal it was also very interesting from a historical perspective to feel for how things were for women back then what was expected what was off limits and how young girls interacted with each other in such a setting","1172":"the story was very engaging and i kept reading to find out exactly what had happened to get the narrator thea sent away from home i am tend to like books set at boarding schools the book reminded me very much of prep by curtis sittenfeld in that book as well i enjoyed the writing and the setting very much but had a difficult time understanding the main character and her decisions","1173":" this book was lauded with praise as a great summer read when it came out and i'd been anxious to read it ever since most of the time when a book is touted as great for the beach it is fun thrilling or leaves you feeling good none of those things describe the yonahlossee riding camp for girls for me the story takes place during the great depression though the book's protagonist thea is fortunate that her family is financially sound they have sent her away for something shameful she did slowly the reader is given details of what happened with her family in addition to the sad backdrop and set of circumstances thea faces there are a number of uncomfortable sex scenes that i wish i could go back and un read calling it a beach read feels like false advertising now though it was well written it wasn't what i expected which is why i gave this novel only two stars","1174":"i enjoyed this book more for the setting and time period vs the protagonist thea she both endeared herself to me and irritated me overall this was a solid read and i enjoyed it but didn't love it","1175":"this book had a lot of potential but it rarely lived up to it it was trying to do too much in parts and underdeveloped in parts that could have been great","1176":"i absolutely loved this book a 15 yr old twin is sent from her much loved home in florida to a boarding school in the blue ridge mountains during the depression her parents sent her away because of a terrible occurrence at their home at the school she must now adapt to her new life the writing was real and honest the characters were mostly selfish people but you understand them it sort of reminded me of the movie ordinary people highly recommend","1177":"slow moving like southern molasses it didn't grab a hold of me like other books have well written easy summer read somewhat predictable i didn't have that i want to know what happens next feeling meh i won't be passing it on instead will sell to the used book store","1178":"should have read the reviews first just okay","1179":"disturbing and interesting i like being naive and thinking that these types of relationships all of them do not happen yet realistic enough to know they do can it be that the mother daughter relationship disturbed me most not sure i can recommend it but not sorry i read it","1180":"well crafted coming of age story hides a surprise that is slowly revealed well written sometimes slow romantic and honest","1181":"although there is virtually nothing new in the plot the characterization of the petulant self absorbed teenage thea is very well done while her selfishness is revealed in the rationalization of her actions the reader also participates in her understanding of the role she played in destroying the lives of those she loved in the end it is obvious that she has taken full responsibility for her actions but has not let her actions ruin her life thea is not a character that the reader likes or admires her characterization appears to be the portrait of a true narcissist","1182":"a lot is lacking in terms of story development too many questions at the end and a very unsatisfactory closing to the family dynamic","1183":" http www dallasnews com entertainme by jenny shank special contributor dallas morning newspublished 07 june 2013 07 38 pm\"becoming a lady is not simply a thing which happens like magic \" the headmistress of the yonahlossee riding camp for girls tells thea the narrator of anton disclafani's assured debut novel \"no quite the opposite becoming a lady is a lesson you must learn \"thea the daughter of a wealthy central florida family in 1930 knows all the rules about acting like a lady talking with a boy in a room with an unmade bed \"was vulgar \" at communal shower time a lady must pretend not to look at the others and at a dance a lady must wait for a boy to approach but knowing the rules doesn't mean thea is inclined to follow them as the book opens thea explains \"i was fifteen years old when my parents sent me away to the yonahlossee riding camp for girls \" her father drives her to the camp in blowing rock n c deep in the blue ridge mountains thea has done something so unforgivable that she interprets this as a punishment -- her parents don't even tell her that she will remain past the summer for the entire year this isn't an ordinary camp thea packs her mother's mink stole while other girls bring family jewels and a maid makes everyone's beds the novel alternates action at the camp with letters from home and flashbacks to thea's childhood a picturesque but isolated upbringing during which thea's father a doctor home schooled her but mostly allowed her to ride her pony as long as she could withstand the heat the only other children for company were thea's twin brother sam and her cousin georgie thea's mother is an exacting woman who presides over their dream home near her inherited orange grove and doesn't think her children require interaction with the outside world thea explains \"the country was in the midst of the great depression but my family had not suffered \"we gradually learn that something forbidden occurred between thea and georgie and that the fallout from this event was extreme when thea finally admits to her friends why she was sent to yonahlossee she says simply \"because of a boy \" disclafani teases out the mystery throughout the entire novel and for the most part manages to keep the reader's interest during 400 pages of careful coyness though there are a few moments where she drops yet another hint and you might want to yell out with it already still disclafani's mastery of pace and mystery and her skilled evocation of the atmosphere in sultry florida and the crisp carolina mountains make this an uncommon first novel thea soon repeats past mistakes and doesn't always evoke sympathy but she's her best on the back of a horse disclafani was a competitive horse rider and conveys thea's riding and the human and animal psychology that accompanies it with convincing detail thea's rivalry with leona a 6 foot tall riding champion and oil heiress from fort worth and her friendship with sissy from alabama contribute to the hothouse boarding school debutante atmosphere that should prove irresistible even to westerners who wouldn't know the first thing about the right fork the depression seems far away from the camp at first but soon its effects are evident as girls with ruined families must leave in another era calculating thea could have been an athlete with a killer competitive instinct or a ceo leaning in far enough to fall on her face born into this time and place thea is expected to do nothing but keep her legs closed and then marry \"we understood that desire was a dangerous thing that needed to be carefully handled like a mother's antique perfume bottle passed down to the eldest daughter when she turned sixteen \" thea explains as usual she disobeys these rules setting up many steamy episodes that disclafani details with precision the yonahlossee riding camp for girls is an escapist summer read transporting the reader to a world where the rules for propriety were strict and the consequences for violating them grave which makes for all the more suspense when disclafani's characters misbehave jenny shank's first novel the ringer won the high plains book award","1184":"at first i thought i was going to like this book but it didn't take long to realize i was wrong couldn't stand any of the characters the story line became ridiculous and to me the author couldn't seem to make up her mind about how the characters felt or thought or wanted it could have been about 150 pages shorter but even so i still would have thought it was weak and waste of precious reading time","1185":"very interesting perspective of a privileged teenage girl at an elite school during the depression it keeps you guessing for a bit and swings between past and present very well written","1186":"i'm always rather picky about books with horse related story lines i found that this one did not disappoint as it was a well told tale of a teen's coming of age and the circumstances that led her to the riding camp for girls i enjoyed the storytelling and look forward to reading more from this author that said the implication that sheltered girls become over sexed teens annoyed me it seemed clumsy in an otherwise well executed book","1187":"i wanted to like this very much and truthfully there are some grains of really great writing buried in here but man could this have used some serious editing i think it could have been about a hundred pages shorter slashed some of the unnecessary and sometimes eventually contradictory descriptions it just over explained everything and it could have used some focus too definitely a lot of interesting things going on plot wise but a bit of a slog otherwise","1188":"thea is sent away from her sheltered life in florida because of an indiscretion with her cousin thea believes herself to be damaged and struggles with feelings of abandonment and alienation as well as her sexual coming of age the boarding school riding camp that thea enters opens her eyes to a whole new world of beauty money horses and competitiveness thea tries to find her place in this world as well as understanding the family that has banished her from their lives very interesting novel with complex characters","1189":"i'm not even sure what star rating to give this book so many conflicted feelings we'll definitely have a lot to talk about book club pick for february","1190":"a thoroughly engaging debut novel unfurled slowly and with passion i've read complaints about the sex about the slowness ignore the critics this is about as good as a coming of age tale gets smooth dialogue realistic descriptions and consistently emotionally true and horses the author makes this all look effortless kudos i listened to the audio version and the performance was top notch","1191":"the more i think about it i would give it a 3 5 loved when she was at camp but haunted by parts","1192":" i feel like this could have been the grown up version of the book i always wanted to read as a little girl horses female protagonist the great depression sleep away camp in the mountains the story fell flat for me there was such potential for mystery and wonder but it never happened the narrative felt distant and out of body i found myself more interested in the secondary characters than the main one i feel like the sexual content took over the story because it was so honest and unnerving the ample horseback riding scenes kept me going so often the traits of the horses metaphorically reflected on the characters i could almost smell the horse stables feel the horse noses hear their nervous snorts that made the book for me i'm really sad the rest of the story flopped i keep imaging scenes that never happened that could have added immense intrigue","1193":"such a beautiful book with many quotable moments an intriguing and dramatic coming of age story that reminds us that we can persevere from the mistakes of our past if we only face them you should remember that the sins of youth seem very far away when you're no longer young i am excited to see more of this author in the future","1194":"a good compelling read i will probably like it better after discussion at book club","1195":" i am surprised at myself for enjoying this book so much its nice to step out of one's genre once and awhile even at extreme risk and try something new yonahlossee was the perfect stepping stone a genuine look at family life during the depression and an insider view of families in turmoil during that time i really haven't read much about a young girl's coming of age even though i have 4 daughters my experiences have always been hands on but ms disclafani did an excellent job of opening my eyes through the traumas of thea atwell her tragedies and dealing in the aftermaths were both haunting as well as inspirational a real treat","1196":"i didn't grow to like any of the characters throughout the story well written but disappointing overall","1197":"i just didn't get the main character the story is very disjointed and at times hard to follow there really wasn't an interesting character in the whole book","1198":"i kept looking for some deeper meaning in this book filled with scandal incest and infidelity but i could find none are we supposed to admire the protagonist for her free spirit she kind of seems like a sociopath i just didn't get it at least it was a fast read count me among the unimpressed on this one","1199":"i loved loved loved this book well written actual characterization evocative settings in both time and place horses a plot and good sex scenes how nice to read a novel that actually lives up to the glowing blurbs on the cover an excellent literary novel","1200":"i loved this book finished it in 4 days couldn't stop reading it thought it was going to be silly chick lit but it turned out to be a moving very engaging dare i say poignant story little sexier than i thought it was going to be definitely pick this one up","1201":"ugh no stars didn't even finish this crap","1202":"i give up i am halfway through the book but there has been nothing yet that has made me like it except for the very first pages when thea is going to the riding camp the rest of it has not caught my interest at all it's like it's going nowhere now i am leaving it","1203":"it's not that the writing was terrible i just didn't care about the characters and the plot dragged on and on i don't have time for books like this","1204":"i was initially turned off by the horses but the writing was so beautiful that it made up for all that horse talk and the way that the mystery unfolded was expertly done thea's behavior with the head of school almost made me give this book four stars but the fact that the author was able to make me feel that uncomfortable just proved her mastery so five it is","1205":"i'm surprised by the one star reviews this is a beautifully written novel perfect no but how many are thea is an engaging character who finds herself in complicated situations due to her passion and i'm talking passion so if you're a prude about sex this might not be the novel for you i found it very true to how many teenage girls think getting caught up in the moment is it a page turner no not really but it is compelling and certainly worth the read","1206":" i had wanted to read this book since i saw its cover on amazon several years ago and finally i got my hands on a library copy my expectations were high and they were dashed it sounds harsh but i wasted enough time reading the book so won't waste more time in the review my general feeling is as follows this book wanted a bodice ripping cover and someone in marketing decided to morph it into something that would appeal to the literary community the plot was completely lost among garish sex scenes and while i wanted to care about the characters and their deep secrets they were completely overshadowed by the author's alternate agenda so no thanks this is not a book i enjoyed or would recommend","1207":"a firm 2 stars did give it 3 stars originally but seeing as i couldn't wait for it to end that felt a bit too generous it had a lot of promise but by the time i was a third of the way through it and still none the wiser about this fabled terrible deed that had caused the protagonist to be banished to horse camp which even more frustratingly every character kept going on about so there was no way you could just put it to one side i got a bit restless i found the characters very flat too i think it works okay as the kind of non serious book you take on holiday but not so well as anything more a shame since the author probably put so much more into it","1208":" i enjoyed this coming of age story the story was placed in an interesting historical context the great depression disclafani showed the readers the impact that financial devastation had on a small cohort of privileged young women unfortunately though the narrative around most of the young women at the periphery of the heroine's was shallow i'm no prude but the scenes where the heroine engaged in intimacy with her cousin and the headmaster were a bit too detailed and drawn out in comparison with the rest of the text while the feelings and emotions written about were genuine they felt false against the overall mood of the story","1209":"what a disappointing book i finally just gave up on it the protagonist is one of the most unlikeable i've ever encountered and the story slogged along","1210":"i found the voice of thea atwell well rounded and interesting i note reviews complaining that she's whiny and selfish it seemed to me like a believable depiction of a teenage girl struggling to conform with the norms her era and society expected of her i also found the plot well paced and enjoyed the slow unveiling of events that led to thea being sent to yonahlossee overall a very good coming of age tale and a fascinating debut","1211":"not one of the best reads the star of the book thea spends too much time whining and it was difficult to get into i never connected with thea or really felt like i knew what she was about if you absolutely love horses and or the south the author does a tremendous job with the description and prose if you are looking for a story with an ending this isn't it","1212":"this was a good book with such a hint of the old south before and during the depression more to it than that peeling back the layers of the characters was intriguing","1213":"i thought it was really interesting at first but the second half of the book is pretty boring also i would have liked to know what happened to all of the camp girls like leona or sissy but there was no update this book was so so","1214":"not a bad story a little slow to start thea is sent away to yonahlossee after a family tragedy she makes the best of a bad situation only to emhroil herself in another situation a little bit draggy at the end too","1215":"obviously the horses were the draw but they were not enough to keep me enthused about the book the narrator's consistently bad decisions grated on me and largely canceled out the interest i felt in the richly depicted setting","1216":"at times equally lovely and heartbreaking this book reveals the struggles one girl faces after her family turns their back on her","1217":"gorgeous prose predictable plot unlikeable characters","1218":"this review has been hidden because it contains spoilers to view it click here this book is more a summary of events than a story the main character is rather unlikable it's a weird premise and there is absolutely no actual character growth or development in the book the author spends the first half of the book dropping hints through flashback of the scandal which sent the narrator to the riding camp and heavily implies the narrator was somehow misunderstood or treated unfairly even after finding out which is heavily hinted before the big reveal that the narrator had this book is more a summary of events than a story the main character is rather unlikable it's a weird premise and there is absolutely no actual character growth or development in the book the author spends the first half of the book dropping hints through flashback of the scandal which sent the narrator to the riding camp and heavily implies the narrator was somehow misunderstood or treated unfairly even after finding out which is heavily hinted before the big reveal that the narrator had sex with her first cousin i kept waiting for more of the story for the narrator to reveal something that justified the ickiness of this premise to somehow make her more likeable it doesn't happen and then she just keeps getting more and more unlikeable with no insight or growth or accepting of responsibility basically reads like a narrative of narcissistic teenager who doesn't ever learn from their mistakes and places ownership of them on everyone else i was interested to read this based on the setting which reminded me of where i went to school but ultimately feel like i wasted my time on this another thing that really bothered me were the passages involving sexuality there was a way they definitely could have contributed to the story and character development but i don't really think the author did a good job of it they almost felt like literary hbo ization of the story and seemed added just for smut and shock value the only reason i'm giving it 2 stars instead of one is because i'm a sucker for anything in involving women's education and appalachia but really i think it's more of a one star more","1219":" when i saw three semicolons in the first three paragraphs i thought mfa and it turned out i was right mfa grads have been known to write some beautiful prose but they aren't really known so much for putting together whole readable novels while there were some gorgeous passages of description the whole thing didn't hang together well the author kept the characters very distant from the reader probably in the hope that withholding crucial information would increase the desire to keep turning pages a mistaken hope judging from all the people i know who gave up on this book but really while the whole thing didn't hang together there are some very evocative sections particularly the ones dealing with horsemanship the author captured the essence of the experience as well as i've ever seen it and those were also the scenes most apt to let the character open to the reader","1220":" it is 1930 the midst of the great depression after her mysterious role in a family tragedy passionate strong willed thea atwell age fifteen has been cast out of her florida home exiled to an equestrienne boarding school for southern debutantes high in the blue ridge mountains with its complex social strata ordered by money beauty and girls' friendships the yonahlossee riding camp for girls is a far remove from the free roaming dreamlike childhood thea shared with her twin brother on their family's citrus farm--a world now partially shattered as thea grapples with her responsibility for the events of the past year that led her here she finds herself enmeshed in a new order one that will change her sense of what is possible for herself her family her country this book has been called lush sexy and evocative and i would agree with all three i wasn't expecting to like it that much but the writing was really wonderful and absorbing i also loved the cover although it is a bit odd that there are no horses on it considering that the book is named after a riding camp it's a great work of historical fiction obviously the book is set while the great depression is raging on but the riding camp is kind of an idyllic place untouched by all of that it's still very old school even though the camp has changed since its inception in 1876 or was it 1902 what was frustrating to me was that i really wanted to find out why thea was at the camp what she had done that was so terrible to merit being exiled from her home her father drops her off at the camp and he certainly seems somewhat reluctant to leave her there what she had done nagged at me the whole way through i started catching hints of it as the book progressed i won't give anything away but the reason is pretty predictable and actually pretty stereotypical i loved how the relationship between thea and her brother sam was characterized the reader can see as they read how much thea loves her brother and looks up to him while at the camp she's constantly thinking about what he would be doing and she remembers little experiences with him and also with her cousin who's rather important to her estrangement it was really sweet how fond she was of her brother the scene of the camp dance was i think brilliantly done the reader really gets to know thea better and the writing is also marvelous it's kind of a depressing scene but i think it was well portrayed thea doesn't want to be gathered and she half does and half doesn't want to follow the rules she's also impressed once again by mr holmes's kindness and understanding he was a great character i had a horse phase and i still love horses so i was glad that this book had horses in it but the horses really aren't the central part of the story at all they're not that important although thea's relationship with her horses is interesting and horses are certainly very important to her life she rode when she was still at home and of course she rides at the camp the characters were very well portrayed i really enjoyed the character of mr holmes the camp director he was very kind and understanding thea was also interesting although i didn't exactly like her she was kind of cruel towards horses and towards people but characters don't have to be likable overall the yonahlossee riding camp for girls was a really good work of historical fiction it was very thoughtful and the writing was beautiful really beautiful and atmospheric i started reading the book and i just kept reading it wasn't suspenseful but it was absorbing and definitely evocative thanks to riverhead hardcover for sending me an arc the book comes out tomorrow www novareviews blogspot com","1221":"i received this book through a giveaway in exchange for a fair review i was actually sent two copies for some reason so i passed one along thanks i wasn't really expecting to like this book considering i know nothing about horse riding however this has less to do with horses and more of a coming of age novel i actually liked that it was a bit dark but thea was so frustrating sometimes overall i enjoyed this book","1222":"circa 1920s thea is sent off to boarding school as her transgression from home is revealed could not say this was a great read","1223":"this was a really thought provoking book written about a wealthy family in the depression very interesting story about the inner workings a this particular family the main character thea was a complicated and haunted girl really good read","1224":"loved this book from start to finish a great read","1225":"twins and other family dynamics tragedy and horses a pretty good story that ran a bit too long","1226":"meh didn't pull me in enough abanadoned","1227":"really great read i loved how it kept giving you small pieces of the mystery to keep you hooked i loved thea despite her bad choices and i liked the ending it felt realistic rather than a forced fairy tale","1228":" this was not a particularly pleasant book to read although parts of it were lovely and the author's descriptive passages about the natural world mostly florida and the blue ridge mtns in nc were vividly drawn i happen to have lived in both locales and her writing captured so much of real atmosphere of each i did enjoy that the story is centered around the education of thea learning how to become her own person even if she doesn't realize she needs to do it and definitely doesn't want to do it she is a twin with a brother and they are the only two children of parents who live in central florida during the late 20's and early 30's their home is almost its own character and is the setting for the action that thea takes which leads to her being sent away to the riding camp thea's story swings back and forth between thea's memories leading up to her banishment and the life she is learning to live at school i kept seeing keira knightly as thea it moved at times a bit slowly i didn't find thea to be particularly pleasant at times precocious and self centered perhaps if she hadn't grown up in such isolated location home schooled and seldom exposed to other children their own age she and her brother were a unit learning to be separate was hard although harder for her brother to learn to be by himself especially after the event in which he to played a part not sure i will recommend it the author shows promise but this story seemed overly long to me parts could have been condensed 390 pages is long","1229":"horrible why do so many oprah books have incest i won't finish this it is terrible","1230":"i enjoyed this book","1231":"i suppose it's my love of riding that first made me pick this book up i have read many negative reviews but i loved the writer's story and ability to bring the characters and setting to life it certainly is a tragic tale and i did end up feeling disappointed in thea's attitude about her actions and their consequences to her family in the end though i was truly sad to see it end","1232":"can i give this 2 5 stars the writing is great and descriptive and he first half of the book builds an intriguing a good story but the second half seems to spiral into a different and not so great story 4 stars for the beginning and one for the end","1233":" bad judgment happens but there is more than a bit of queasiness to the main character's bad judgment and she's not even terribly sympathetic except for the contextual sexism that pervades the southern mores going beyond the general ickiness the plot following a scandal a self centered rich girl gets sent to a horse riding boarding school in 1931 and while everyone else's lives are falling apart due to the depression she is only somewhat aware of how miserable most people are but the great depression a very real tragic time in american history in which people literally starved to death and when thousands lost everything including their futures and children's futures is barely a backdrop here it does cause some of the events that lead to other events but it could have been anything for all the attention the lead character pays to it ultimately her life turns out fine in the end so we are left feeling whatever","1234":"3 5 stars this book is slow much more character driven than plot driven it's also fairly dark and depressing while reading it i could feel the gloom of it like a dark cloud hanging over me the book is filled with characters who aren't very likable who are dysfunctional and do awful things my stomach feels sick thinking of what they did the book was well written though but i thought it would be better than it was","1235":"this summers secret life of bees yaya sisterhood spiced up","1236":"meh it was clear what had happened and what was going to happen so it didn't have to be so long and drawn out thea is not a very sympathetic character and so 400 pages told from her perspective gets old fast","1237":" this book started out very promising i really liked the writing style the story she was telling it was very compelling then spoiler alert it just turned out to be a story about sex boo i still maintain that the writing is very very good but i ended up not being very sympathetic toward the main character and i was very disappointed in the final feeling if you are into reading about base desires and forbidden lust i can't call it love because i wasn't convinced it was then you would very much enjoy this book i wish the author would just have stuck with the struggles of the family relationships twin brother mother father instead of focusing on the lust of it all","1238":"steamy","1239":"i gave up the premise was interesting the time setting also interested me the writing was not excellent still being disclafani's first book i wasn't expecting a masterpiece i admire her attempt","1240":"after finishing this novel i stared at the front cover slightly shaking i am only a few years older than thea but yet our lives crossed in so many ways the honest dialogue felt like reading everything i was too scared to say out loud granted thea and i are still very different the sexual endeavors that she experienced i will never understand however as someone who attends a school much like yonahlossee with the same deep secrets and family dynamic i am thankful that i came across this book i felt thea's pain concern and loneliness it is rare to read a novel that is so frank about a young woman's thoughts and feelings i will remember this novel at this very point in my life","1241":" i had difficulty deciding how many stars to give this book because although the first half even 3 4 was great and really drew me in i fell out of love with it the set up description and ongoing flashbacks are all very well written and well paced it's so disappointing then that the revelation of the secret isn't that meaningful or impactful this is mainly due to the lack of fleshed out secondary characters this negatively affects any impacts that a lot of the other girls foils or friends could have had i'm thinking particularly about mary abbott leona and the holmes girls particularly rachel as her actions echo thea's brother's almost subconscious reactive act ultimately although these girls aren't multi dimensional and this hurts the story the lack of description and engagement of sam is what makes it unsuccessful in the end their relationship is supposed to anchor the story and be the driving force behind the epiphanies and results but because it hasn't been effectively built or communicated it leaves you feeling empty and frustrated the build up and the beginning has so much promise that you wish it followed through i felt disappointed let down and unsatisfied at the end","1242":" not sure why so many hated this book i enjoyed it but wouldn't read it again the author did a great job of making me remember what it felt like to be young and full of ignorant thoughts and dreams so those of you who commented on how unrealistic her actions were had no crazy lapses in judgement in your youth i felt as if i was sitting in her room and she was telling me the story i wasn't crazy about how she physically described the characters each time they spoke but still a solid book for a new author","1243":"another coming of age story that though it held my interest all the way through was somewhat predictable fast beach read","1244":"loved loved loved this book","1245":"i really enjoyed this book it is set during the great depression in 1930 a young girl is sent away from her home to stay at the yonahlossee riding camp for girls because of a tragedy that she has caused in her family it is very well written i found it to be a page turner i would recommend it highly","1246":"great booj","1247":"a lolita type gets sent to camp as punishment and is generally a bad friend and person very depressing and not in a good way","1248":"i'm glad i wasn't swayed by all the negative reviews i found this to be both a sensitive and provocative narrative of a young girl discovering her womanhood in the privileged society of the depression era south i thoroughly enjoyed this touching portrait and would have given it 4 5 stars if possible it was a joy to read","1249":"okay really three and 1 2 stars for a captivating story that was well written but seemed to lag toward the end the issues between thea and her mother and her relationship with her brother were intriguing i would have liked more story about the girls in camp good summer book","1250":" yes you do want to read this it is beautifully written about a time the 30s when nobody said what they truly meant but they

uncomfortable the main character thea is surrounded by weak adults yet she is constantly blamed for not knowing better the mystery that surrounds the first half of the book kept me very involved the

every horse she rode she wouldn't let them get away with anything where was the adult to do that with her growing up is so very difficult and this book gave me a glimpse of what it would be like to go

native florida to yonahlosse riding camp in north carolina following her role in a family tragedy she is originally resistant to life at yonahlosse but soon settles in and begins to adjust to life at camp it's an entertaining summer read but definitely left me unsatisfied by the ending the plot the plot spans about a year in thea's life it alternates between thea's life at yonahlosse and the story of what put her there in the first place which is a style i really like and i think it worked well for this kind of story it was frustrating to not know the true reason thea got sent to camp until about 2 3rds through the book but it kept me reading fast her life at yonahlosse is often lackluster and the story lacks a sense of flow time jolts around characters are introduced and never mentioned again two months pass and nothing really changes i found myself waiting for the chapters about her past which were much more interesting to me the characters thea is not a particularly likable character to me one of the reasons she is sent to yonahlosse is because she's never been around girls her own age before as a result she has a hard time connecting and empathizing with them she is headstrong and independent but also careless of other peoples' feelings she adores horses but is oddly okay with losing her childhood pony i was outgrowing him anyway disclafani tells us over and over again that thea is so good at putting unpleasant memories out of her mind and this how the effect of making it seem as if thea never really bares the full weight of the emotional consequences of her actions she does take a step towards the end of the book to save her friend which is beautifully done and quite noble but it also lined up with the course of action she was already planning on taking everything she did came off as quite self serving regardless of the feelings of others the only characters i felt were really well developed and likable were thea's twin brother sam and her best friend at yonahlosse sissy but while these two characters are important in the first chapters of the novel their stories end up being footnotes as thea gets more involved in a doomed romance with an older man the writing disclafani is a talented lyrical writer her style reminds me a bit of curtis sittenfield from whom there is a blurb on the book's cover and a thank you in the acknowledgements disclafani is an experienced horseback rider herself and her knowledge and love of horses came across nicely in yonahlosse disclafani describes the scenery of the north carolina mountains beautifully as well as the fields and orange grove of florida sometimes the descriptions take over the actual action of the story however which left the book feeling exhausting and too long the ending my biggest problems overall with the book was the ending this will be spoiler free the ways in which thea acts towards the end of the book emphasized how static her character had been over the course of the book she behaves in the same way treats people the same way and generally uses the same ideas to rationalize her behavior as she did at the start of the novel the end pages detail the rest of her life as well as that of her family and its frankly depressing and disheartening it's a sour note on which to end the book overall overall it's not a great book but i found it entertaining a couple of other reviews mentioned that it was unfinishable to them but i actually thought the last third of the book went really fast if only because i was eager to have thea pay some kind of consequences for her actions if you love horses or are familiar with the story's southern settings i think you will enjoy this book significantly more many parts of the book are well thought out and nicely woven but the overall plot and character development left me looking for much more","1255":"a coming of age period piece unlike anything i've ever read hard to put down","1256":"i wanted to like this book i really did more than i ended up liking it that is i loved the title and hey a good title is half the battle that's what made me request it from netgalley i loved the setting that riding camp in the blue ridge mountains of north carolina where the wealthy sent their daughters to escape the heat of the south and the time period during the depression where the girls depend on their fathers not losing the family fortune so they can ride and compete and try to meet wealthy boys at mixers the heroine of the book thea has been sent here banished for some unmentioned unspeakable act she has been torn away from the family property and her twin brother all of this has you wondering where this is all going what has thea done and why can't i go to riding camp and not giving anything away the actual premise is a let down there is some wonderful writing and interesting characters but i wish the author hadn't steered the story in the direction she chose thus the 3 stars","1257":"good story thought it was going to be predictable but didn't end up that way","1258":"this review has been hidden because it contains spoilers to view it click here i'd really like to only give this book 2 1 2 stars but went with 3 because the writing the craft of the writing is solid and disclafani had some great bits of prose but i wasn't a fan of the story i thought the era was ill defined i know when she 'said' it took place but i didn't ever 'fee' that that was when it took place as opposed to say a tree grows in brooklyn i also thought the characters weren't authentic and maybe here's where i'm wrong but after raising 2 girls and being ar i'd really like to only give this book 2 1 2 stars but went with 3 because the writing the craft of the writing is solid and disclafani had some great bits of prose but i wasn't a fan of the story i thought the era was ill defined i know when she 'said' it took place but i didn't ever 'fee' that that was when it took place as opposed to say a tree grows in brooklyn i also thought the characters weren't authentic and maybe here's where i'm wrong but after raising 2 girls and being around allll their friends none of them have the composure to handle the situations and trysts that thea underwent the exception was the post coital feelings of betrayal abandonment and of being used without care that came after her initial experience that said i was flooded with memories and the ghost of the aromas of the barn from my childhood showing and riding hunt seat and dressage if i had to be sent anywhere i sure would love for it to be there even now more","1259":"read this one in essentially one sitting love the narrative voice compelling and thoughtful and precocious but also wounded young and authentic i am intrigued to ponder whether she is victimized or empowered or both an adolescent must be the ultimate unreliable narrator blunt but confused but from what future age is she telling us her story the pacing is superb slow revelation of past events and a sense of hurtling toward some unpleasant occurrence but the reader never feels played i also thought the parents' attitude is usually realistic and complex compared to most bad girl banished stories she is sent away but still loved not rejected","1260":"it's very good literary unexpected sad and a very intimate sort of look into a 15 16 yr old girl's head probably a great book for discussion groups since there are many questions of right and wrong and very complex characters but like many literary books affect me kind of depressing next i'm reading something more upbeat","1261":"it was okay i certainly had issues with the main character thea she first comes off as extremely naive but later i can't decide if she is a victim just dense or if she is very calculating and selfish she repeats mistakes and makes very poor choices by the end of the book i still don't think she learned much and i still don't like her this is a story about a teenage girl figuring out who she is awkwardly trying to connect to people and her inappropriate sex life really","1262":"read it an indulgent snap and yet i never felt i was raving through it that's a good recipe","1263":"interesting concept only it was just a little slow going the big secret wasn't too hard to figure out as to why thea was sent away i realize that it was a different era but it just seemed that so many of the characters just didn't have a grasp on reality their heads were in the clouds i debated about giving this 3 stars wanting to give it that benefit because thea was an interesting character but i just couldn't justify it","1264":"2 1 2 stars i really enjoyed this book until thea pissed me off i know she was young and sheltered but where was the moral fiber and holmes he should have gone to jail how many times had it happened before it wasn't a difficult book to read but i guess the moral of the story is if you do bad things and get away with them you win","1265":" this was half a great book the mystery of what led to thea's banishment was interesting and kept me listening so i could get the whole story although the most basic facts were telegraphed fairly early on her life at yonahlossee riding camp was not interesting thea ended up being an unlikable character though who never opened herself up to anyone view spoiler her seduction of the 30 something year old married father was kind of gross with the huge potential to ruin lives female sexuality is not inherently wrong or sin but the way thea used hers ruined or could have ruined lives her decision to sacrifice her place at yonahlossee for her friend came from out of the blue because she had not exhibited any true signs of friendship with the girl hide spoiler i wish the story had dealt more with thea's family and just skipped or glossed over her time at yonahlossee riding camp thea's family was dysfunctional up in ways that i would have been interested in exploring more","1266":"i was expecting much more from this book it just dragged on and on and on","1267":"i love coming of age stories this one had a great combination of a historical setting 1930s american depression era in a horse camp and some mystery why was thea sent away from her family what could be so bad this book will stay with you after it's done the sad melancholy ending didn't help review based on an advanced reader copy","1268":"tripe there was a bidding war for this flat one dimensional characters the author justifies amoral behavior as a young woman finding her power instead of a story that was deep when you peeled back the layers the author struggled and overwrote parts to try and convince you there was some deep meaning here sad because the idea of a bunch of debutantes hidden away at a posh riding camp during the great depression held such possibility for me","1269":" this book had been on a lot of lists so i added it to my list i was disappointed during the depression the main character thea is sent away after having sex with her cousin she really takes no responsibility for her actions or the fact that her twin brother nearly kills the cousin when he finds out she gains the trust of many of the girls at the camp and eventually wins the top horsemanship prize meanwhile she befriends the daughters of the headmaster while the headmaster's wife is away she begins an affair with him this shallow girl takes no responsibility for her actions and frustrated me throughout the book","1270":"this book was a good historical read i found it difficult to picture thea the narrator as anything but a small child once i was able to place her as a young adult the book was easier to envision","1271":" this book is not something i would have normally picked up myself this was a review copy the name alone would have put me off putting me in the mind of the dangerous book for boys but with boarding schools and horses 'yonahlossee' is a bit of a mouthful to remember too the book sat on my shelf for a while and i kept thinking that i should read the 'jonah lomu' book next anyway once i actually picked the book up i grew to enjoy the story a teenage girl who has scanlised her family in some way is sent off to a remote riding camp and i empathised with the main protagonist thea - a girl with desires not discussed in that day and age i guessed at the 'scandal' with the cousin long before it was unveiled both thea's involvement and sam's revenge i wasn't sure of the relevance of the headmaster in the story he seemed awfully wishy washy i really couldn't understand what thea found so enticing about him unless she was just using him to help herself 'grow up' i was also waiting for further past affairs possibly with previous star girl leona to be revealed leona is a character that could have been developed more either as more of an enemy or ally of thea likewise most of thea's 'supporting cast' was poorly drawn eva was underused mrs holmes disappeared off on a fundraising trip before she could become interesting even thea's mother was pretty one dimensional once thea returns from camp it all sort of peters out you don't really find out what happens to thea except that she 'got away' from her family and had kids of her own it doesn't sound like she made much of her life beyond that it feels like the same tired old story that the 'bad girl' always gets her comeuppance in some way in the end i have given the book three stars so 'good' rather than just 'average as i did enjoy the story and kept finding time to read a little more - it was very easy to read - but it doesn't really deserve any more comparisons with the great gatsby are completely unfounded i'm afraid","1272":"i'd give this a 2 5","1273":"i would call this a coming of age story with two twists in it this book also had a lesson to teach us that our actions have consequences and we can't always have what we want","1274":"charming captivating and well written the author creates a fully formed world that serves as a lovely background to a page turning plot some of the characters' actions were unbelievable and unexplainable and some plot twists were a bit tawdry and sensational but i was willing to suspend my disbelief because i was charmed by the whole","1275":" this is more of 3 1 2 stars than 4 stars i started out really enjoying it the book takes place during the great depression thea a 15 year old girl from a well to do family is brought to stay at the yonahlossee riding camp by her father she had led a fairly secluded life in a small town in florida with her family but is brought to the camp after she did something terrible of course what she did is the big secret in the book the book took sort of a love crazed teenage girl type turn that i did not love but overall a fun read that focuses on relationships in a family between twins thea has a twin brother friends mother daughter etc","1276":" i will always and forever be a sucker for coming of age novels set at boarding schools in this book set in during the great depression thea atwell's florida citrus rich family sends her to yonahlossee camp after a scandal that is slowly revealed throughout flashbacks in the book the book is sensual and vivid the horseback riding scenes are one of the highlights of the story thea is an interesting character and as the story progresses my feelings toward her become more and more complex she's not a conventionally likable heroine but i did really like her the book moves fast and feels more suspenseful than it should given the subject matter i felt like i was plowing through the last half because i was so anxious to see what happened i liked that thea was not easy to understand her motives were sometimes unclear her coldness toward some characters and warmth to others seemed random i thought the book was better for it--giving me room to speculate about her several days after having finished it one last warning this is not a book about horses this is a book set in a camp where they ride horses occasionally if you want lots of horsey material you may want to look elsewhere","1277":"the settings were fascinating but i did not find any of the characters remotely realistic typical of my usual disappointment when i depart from my normal patterns and read a book clubby novel","1278":"not anything good to say on my part about this book the story and the characters needed a lot more development if you liked fifty shades of grey you may like this one a fair amount of graphic sex and not much else i read this for a book club the librarian told us before it hit the shelves it was reviewed to much acclaim did the reviewers actually read the book","1279":" this book should come with a warning not for teenage girls when you start reading what seems to be a lovely story about a depression era girl being sent away to a boarding school the book is lovely its painfully clear that the girl did something to get her sent away the foreshadowing is heavy handed the best bits were the girls relationships with each other and the horses the adults were cliches the shocking thing that sent the lead character to the riding camp wasn't shocking or surprising and the plot twists that hinge on sexual awakening were distasteful and felt like gratuitous pandering i felt the heavy hand of an editor telling the author she needed a twist a twist that hasn't been done before also given the twist the psychological profile and actions of the mother didn't make sense if the mother had been sexually promiscuous as a girl and suspected her daughter might be as well why would you let her run around all day unsupervised with her odd brother and randy cousin i'm really surprised the girl didn't have some kind of sexual encounter with her brother too what's the message here if you don't tell your daughter about sexual things and leave her to run wild with her pony all day she'll become a nymphomaniac with no sexual boundaries heck where was the lesbian love scene its like an english professor needed a book that dealt with x y and z themes so it could be discussed in a literary criticism class i gave it 2 stars because the writer clearly has skills as a writer but the story was annoyingly sensationalized and filled with tired tedious plot twists","1280":" intersting and frustrating set in the 30's when rich families began to struggle and their lives changed i enjoyed thea's obession with horses as i loved riding at her age i was frustrated that the author took so long to tell the story of her disgrace and then frustrated that she was the one disgraced her older cousin was the person who was in the wrong and paid a terrible price but her parents clearly blamed her imagine being sent away at 15 and having to stay at the school over the holidays knowing your family doesn't care about you clearly a coming of age story and a tale of a dysfunctional family the mother loved her home more than her children and did not help them grow away from her until she sent away her daughter thea thea grows up and learns how narrow her childhood has been i liked it it was very different from the books i usually read","1281":"i enjoyed the book and felt it was well written the story of a teen aged girl sent away to a summer camp the character is flawed as we all are and does not learn from her past mistakes i was disappointed in this but maybe that is more realistic in the world we live in maybe it's a four star after all","1282":" rating 2 out of 5 this was like reading a portrait of a lady by henry james boring beyond belief the writing is okay but nothing much happens which isn't totally predictable it's the age of the great depression teenager thea half of a fraternal pair of twins has done something horrible and is sent away to the yonahlossee riding camp for girls so that her family doesn't have to see her it seems a bit harsh and she is rather whiny to start with the story of what thea did comes out little by little the depression gets worse the descriptions of the camp reminded me of the first parent trap movie that was my main association other than this book is totally immemorable and i will have forgotten all about it in a couple of days i didn't hate it though thus the two star rating maybe this is worse at least i usually remember the one star books and at least they managed to evoke emotion even if it was of a negative kind","1283":"started off strong but about halfway in i started losing interest overall a decent read","1284":"amazing story loved this book unforgettable heroine nothing so enthralling since harry potter highly recommend","1285":"well written but the subject matter is a little icky and uncomfortable i am looking forward to reading more from this author","1286":"this book was well written and captivating i enjoyed hearing the protagonist's perspective it was not the charming coming of age story i had thought it would be but then again i guess that is why it is not a young adults novel the theme of horses throughout the book not only tied together everything thea's home life with her life at yonahlossee but it was also enjoyable to read about since i am an equestrian hearing about horses and riding is always fun","1287":"pretty good particularly if you are of a certain age group and or like horses nice mostly light read","1288":"explores how coming of age events can careen out of control with tragic consequences also provides a detailed view into the lives of young women coming into their own and how external events shape them what i appreciated most the deft anthropological glimpse into both the striated american society leading into the depression and how that event affected the closed society of the riding camp even my critical brain failed to decipher the results of thea's actions until disclafani revealed them thus delivering on her escalating sense of suspense then there are the horses i love horses","1289":"i'm not quite sure what all the fuss was about i picked up the book because i saw it on a few must read lists while it wasn't horrible written i can't say i even liked the story i was disappointing","1290":"this book held my attention but that's about the highest praise i can give it i loved the horse scenes of course and was intrigued and slightly disturbed by thea's unconventional sexual appetite but neither the writing nor the plot taught me anything new ho hum","1291":"nicely written interesting story","1292":"compelling coming of age story first time novelist dislafani does a great job dragging out the mystery of why 15 year old thea is sent away from her dreamy florida town be forewarned explicit somewhat gratuitous sex scenes make this story not for the faint of heart","1293":"even though it is fairly easy to discern what thea's indiscretion was back home the author beautifully weaves the retelling of it with thea's new life at a school for girls thea's problem isn't a surprise and that wasn't a problem for me i think i may have lived this because i love horses so much and it reminded me of lessons however the author is just a very powerful writer who maybe uses the word pungent too much in describing smells","1294":"although i had a little trouble getting into the story i was amazed at the author's insights into lots of familiar subjects thea is sent to summer camp separated from her twin brother and the only life she's ever known disclafani teases her readers with just enough detail to make us keep reading thea learns about herself how to survive in an unfamiliar environment surrounded by people she's never met and how money or the lack of it colors the world around us the book is set during the depression and reminds us of all the changes it made in many families' lives","1295":" this book was like a car wreck you try not to look try not to look and ultimately you look i read the entire book surprised most of the way through that i was still reading as it definitely left a bad taste in my mouth not pleasant not likable but then i've read books without a single character i've liked e g the casual vacancy by j k rowling that i still enjoyed or if not enjoyed appreciated the main character in this novel thea waffles between being a mean and nasty sort of person and just a girl who was raised in a very remote fashion and not exposed to life in a way that would educate her properly on how to be in the world it took me almost 100 pages just to get used to the writing style which felt very disjointed and odd with short sentences a lot of punctuation and which were often repetitive it felt like reading a tragedy although you hope that with thea's description of her adult life she really did live her life so that there is some brightness in this mostly gray novel even the cover is gray and given the time period i feel like i picture the worlds described as gray the ending was succinct and fair which made me want to give this book closer to 3 stars so maybe 2 5 altogether","1296":"i liked it very descriptive interesting and at time odd subject matter as the lead character has a sexual relationship with her cousin","1297":" horses and horny teenagers what more could you ask for well maybe a few characters with some depth and heart everyone was just a little too cold and reticent other than being full of passion for horses and wieners that i didn't end up feeling much of anything for any of the characters on the other hand the descriptions of thea's natural surroundings and interactions with the horses were often gorgeous and transporting i also couldn't help but laugh at the frequent references to the cliquey atlanta socialite girls sticking their noses up at a girl from the florida sticks","1298":"tedious story of inappropriate relationships i did listen to get to the root of the mystery but was sadly disappointed in the story line and the characters","1299":" thea atwell is one of those characters that i had a hard time liking until i was more than halfway through this novel although i gave the book four stars i really want to give it 3 and a half the writing is wonderfully descriptive and i loved reading her description of blowing rock north carolina where the riding camp is i've visited that little town several times and loved it i enjoyed the story but i lost patience with thea many times because of the choices she made the ending did redeem the book and i would recommend d it","1300":"the aftermath of a family scandalfifteen year old thea atwell is angry and somewhat frightened she knows she's responsible for the tragedy that is ripping her family apart but she hates the idea of being abandoned at the yonahlossee riding camp in the mountains of north carolina far from her beloved home in florida thea has lived a sheltered life with her parents and twin brother sam on their thousand acre citrus plantation taking lessons from her father she's never been to school and has no girl friends her favorite companion is her pony sasi this makes yonahlossee particularly difficult she has no idea what to expect from other girls thea however is adaptable and soon has a best friend she's an excellent rider and shows that she can excel in an area important to camp status although she makes a place for herself at yonhalossee she is homesick throughout the first half of the novel it is only after an illness when she realizes that her parents won't come for her that she decides to make a way for herself and forget her family how well she succeeds is the second half of the book i enjoyed the book particularly the descriptions of the riding camp the author does a good job of portraying a girl who loves horses and lives to ride the thirties were a different time when being respectable was much more important than it is today i thought the setting and time period were well done the characters were interesting the girls all have individual personalities and it was fun to get to know them and become involved in their lives my one criticism of the book is that the secret that seemed so terrible was used a gimmick to keep the tension high personally i figured out what had happened if not in all the particulars at least in general it was obvious from the opening so dragging the secret out through three hundred plus pages got a bit wearing if you love horses you'll enjoy this book i did i reviewed this book for the amazon vine program","1301":"the setting of the yonahlossee riding camp for girls was very interesting it adds a uniqueness to the story and sets the tone in a way that the story i think would've felt different had it been set in just a regular boarding school the story itself was okay it was a bit frustrating that it took over half the novel to find out exactly what thea did that led her to being sent to the riding camp because some of the early flashbacks with her and her family gave nothing away on the one hand i felt sorry for thea and the way that she was always treated as an afterthought in her family at the same time i'm not sure if she learned anything else from her time at yonahlossee the issues she was sent away for were never really addressed by her family though she had come to some introspective understanding of it herself readers of historical fiction particularly those set in the 1930s fans of the great outdoors coming of age stories and young adult may enjoy this novel my complete review of the novel was originally posted at eclectictales com http www eclectictales com blog 201","1302":"this book disturbed me in so many ways not the least of which was the protagonist's incapacity to take responsibility for her own behavior the author seemed to want us to buy into this perspective as well the writing became increasingly melodramatic as the book progressed to the point that i could barely stand to finish it","1303":"i picked up the yonahlossee riding camp for girls by anton disclafani expecting an interesting read about horses friendship and the great depression as well as a romance and maybe a coming of age unfortunately i did not get what i expected instead i felt that yonahlossee was a bit of a chore to read with characters that i completely failed to identify with read the rest of my review here","1304":"i think she described what every single character's breath smelled like at some point in the story","1305":"really quite beautifully written and more to it than i think many reviewers allow good writing quite perceptive not a group of people i'd normally care about but managed to do so here","1306":"this review has been hidden because it contains spoilers to view it click here this was a hard review to write i liked this book and i was turned off by this book all at the same time the writing is strong and the main character was well developed and complex the author does a great job of keeping the reader in suspense about the events that drove thea's parents to send her to the riding camp the descriptions of female relationships at the riding camp were dead on it brought back memories of being a teen however her relationships in this book bordered on disturbing this was a hard review to write i liked this book and i was turned off by this book all at the same time the writing is strong and the main character was well developed and complex the author does a great job of keeping the reader in suspense about the events that drove thea's parents to send her to the riding camp the descriptions of female relationships at the riding camp were dead on it brought back memories of being a teen however her relationships in this book bordered on disturbing i could almost understand the relationship with her cousin but i just couldn't get on board with the idea that she finds herself and embraces her burgeoning sexuality and femininity through a relationship with her teacher who is 15 years older than her if this happened in the real world he'd be a predator not a liberator more","1307":"this book had me thinking of it when i should have been focusing on work i really wanted to see how it ended and was a little disappointed it would have been nice to have a little continuation of the main character as an adult starting her life away from her home i was often uncomfortable with the sex scenes but i think that part of the author's plan i read this in less than a week","1308":" forgot to rate this but i'll take a shot even though my memory is pathetic i really liked the writing overall the author has a definite ability to transport the reader to a very specific time and place namely a riding centric camp school during the great depression with occasional flashbacks to the family home i very much liked the girls that lived in this bunk and it truly shows that the author has history as a professional show jumper the physical emotional and technical descriptions of horses and riding are wonderfully accurate without bogging down the narrative so where did it lose me and my five stars let's just say the main character a 16 year old if i remember right quite possibly younger though gets into not just one but two um uncomfortable relationships and that's just not the type of thing i enjoy reading about it skeeves me out don't let this deter you from reading though it's a fascinating story and setting and the writing really is beautiful","1309":"i ended up really enjoying this book although it did make me feel uncomfortable a couple of times the story is very original and i couldn't put it down until i found out why thea was sent to the riding school","1310":"great book hard to believe this is disclafani's first book well written and a really good story with compelling characters","1311":" i enjoyed this book for its setting and it was a page turner of a story but the moral conclusions of thea and her ability to blame others for the family tragedy she largely caused was disappointing her startlingly poor choices at the camp carried no real consequences for her at all i found most of the characters shallow and their actions mystifying the horses and riding were an interesting setting and perhaps explained in some measure how thea could make the choices she did i found her ability to carry on an affair in the midst of a very small camp to be unbelievable","1312":"meh i wasn't that impressed it had a smutty ya feel to it","1313":" remember when you were young and told that profanity was a tool used by those with a poor vocabulary who couldn't come up with better words than expletives i have come to the conclusion that inserting sex when there is a lull or void in imaginative writing is much the same i didn't dislike the story or characters per se but this book lacked substance when it had the potential to be an interesting coming of age read enough about thea's sexual exploits to try and spice things up the story should carry itself and this one didn't it started out so promising and ended very lacklustre in my opinion","1314":"this book kept me intrigued because i wanted to know what thea had done that was so bad to make her parents send her away but the storyline in between while she was at camp left a lot to be desired i was expecting more intrigue and mystery and at times it became boring and predictable","1315":"the book is set during the depression and deals with a young woman's coming of age she has done something wrong and been sent away to a school as what she feels is a punishment the writing is gorgeous and lush the book is a bit haunting and i can't quite get it out of my head for me though i didn't like the main character and i wanted more from her it really is worth reading","1316":"it is pretty rare that i finish a book this large in two days it was very dark a little melancholy even but very good","1317":"teenage angst is so much more interesting when you're a teenager but then again i'm not much interested in incest either","1318":"really a very good first novel evocative of my own childhood memories in some ways nice suspense and revelation excellent historic setting the only small flaw i found was a passing reference to someone who got too close the the back of a horse and was kicked in the head not a main character or plot point if you get kicked in the head you are always too far away that's basic horse safety pass close and let them know you are there the closer the better or of course be 15 feet away i really enjoyed this and read it in around 29 hours it's that good","1319":" i enjoyed this unique coming of age story that switched back and forth between a 16 year old's life in florida with her family and in the appalachians with a group of girls at an exclusive riding school thea's life in florida with her doctor father mother twin brother sam and cousin georgie is like living in a dream her family is barely touched by the great depression then thea gets sent away for an incident that is slowly revealed she learns to love life at the camp even when she learns that she is one of the girls who has to stay there year round i enjoyed reading this book because the setting was unique to me the girls at the school were believable and interesting characters i did get a little tired of thea when the focus of the book turned to her obsession with men on one hand i don't blame her for exploring her sexuality sex was never mentioned around her and she was just supposed to be a good girl on the other hand it got a little tiresome when the book started focusing almost exclusively on that","1320":"now i just want to run away to the mountains of north carolina and ride horses and drink sweet tea that was definitely not the intended reaction to this book but the setting of the story is so richly described that all i wanted was to go there forever it made me miss smith and virginia and sleep away camp it's an extremely nostalgic book this is no grand work of literature but it's an easy read and an engaging bitter sweet coming of age story a perfect summer read","1321":"horrid book very unlikeable characters and a ridiculous storyline that could have been wonderful if the author had known what she was doing","1322":"a touching and surprisingly smutty page turner","1323":"gorgeous evocative completely absorbing this is a 4 5 out of 5 though i do ride and grew up riding so those that haven't might not enjoy it as much","1324":"at first i hated this author's writing style of beginning nearly every sentence with an abrupt subject verb anyone else bugged by that writing style but then i began to feel empathy for thea the main character thea's coming of age is complicated by never having been exposed to anyone beyond her immediate family for her first 15 years no wonder she and her cousin have sex no secrets revealed by that detail as one can guess from the beginning that this is her scandal yet it is the lack of connection that creates the story's poignancy for the tragic life that ensues other reviewers called her spoiled whining etc i disagree i thought she was so tragically sheltered and not allowed to develop as a fully formed human being because her strange family relationships and lack of a life beyond i loved that horseback riding and the joy it brought the tragically unlived life of thea","1325":"well written story covering all the angst of the teen years yet definitely not a ya book","1326":"read this book on a trip so read it quickly always enjoy those books more this is a really good coming of age story about a young girl coming to grips with her family's expectations for her and her choices for her future would love to discuss this book","1327":" 3 5 stars in 1930 thea atwell is sent away from her florida home to the yonahlossee riding camp for girls also a boarding school due to some mysterious family tragedy that she is blamed for which in itself doesn't really turn out to be too much of surprise one thing i think the novel did excel at was depicting one adolescent girl's sexual awakening and how it was in her case sadly tied to a sense of neediness and lack of self worth in general i found this book to be a pleasant absorbing read the kind you curl up with on a snowy day or bring to the beach depending on the season","1328":"i liked it having just finished it yesterday i'm still considering how i feel about some aspects of this story but i found it interesting enough to keep reading","1329":" what complete garbage the pacing of this story was torturous our protagonist thea is an empty shell devoid of any personality or surprise the premise of the book could have been very interesting but instead it turns into a predictable story about a sexualized 15 year old and her extraordinarily uninteresting shenanigans the author manages to make sexual intrigue boring it was extremely difficult to get through this novel given that there is no real connection made with any of the characters flat uninteresting read i'm sad i even picked it up","1330":"a coming of age story that is an exploration of not only a girl and her blooming sexuality but of social mores of the great depression from the angle of a wealthy family and a very specific havoc it brings within that family it does a great job too of exposing the murkiness the complications of a world of teen age girls this is a musky earthy story with talk of snakes and horses and a particular emphasis on the way things smell which helped me in a strange way to place myself there in the world of the story i wanted to give it five stars and almost did for it's brutal honesty about sexual desire exploration and consequences but the characters at the end remained unattainable to me and a bit unlikable that's okay i don't have to like everyone but for five stars i have to like someone","1331":"it's hard for me to really enjoy a book when i don't like the main protagonist the only character i truly cared about was her twin brother sam good writer but didn't like the story","1332":"i slogged all the way through as it was recommended by a few friends but i just did not like this book","1333":"i thought this book was incredibly boring","1334":" the jacket synopsis intrigued me i love horses knew a lot about camps from my children attending them and so wanted to dive into the book i was particularly interested in the reasoning behind thea's parents sending her to camp in the first place i had to read a long way into the story to get that answer but it was also ominous it must be tough having a twin but it must also be so nice to have someone so close to you when you're growing up i envied thea and sam and their relationship when each of them could sense and know what was going on with the other i could easily picture the yonahlossee camp the caretakers heads the horse trainers etc and we've all known girls as were depicted in thea's cabin thea was a wild one for sure and the revelation about thea's mother was quite interesting the last three chapters of the book made me cry i had to collect myself in the gym locker room the story line in the end reminded me of the relationship with my own daughter how fragile it can be how screwed up it can be at times and how wonderful it feels when it's right i really like the book and it was an easy read","1335":" i enjoyed this book it is however not a feel good story basically i'd describe it as a dark coming of age novel featuring a flawed and not entirely likable narrator that being said i felt a tremendous amount of empathy for the character of thea a 16 year old girl raised in isolated privilege who has been sent away after a family tragedy near scandal thea does not make good choices but to me this seemed more a function of her upbringing than anything else her life with her family in florida is so sheltered and removed from the rest of the world and her parents especially her mother have not imbued her with a value system that extends much beyond good manners proper horse care and being pretty the camp school and its inhabitants is well rendered and the author is clearly a horse person because the joy of horses and riding is wonderfully expressed i also found the time period the early years of the great depression added an interesting tension and poignancy as we see how the lives of these girls who have always only known only comfort and privilege grapple with their shifting realities recommend","1336":"the story while depressing kept me interested if only because the major plot wasn't revealed until towards the end but honestly any reviewer and there were a lot of them who called this book sexy thanks you just made me throw up in my mouth yes there is sex in this book but that does not make it sexy ew","1337":"how do you define a good book what if none of the themes appeal to you i dreaded opening this book but was a bit curious in spite of all my misgivings i couldn't put it down maybe sometimes a good book is defined by a reader at any given moment this was a good book","1338":" a coming of age story about a young girl who is sent away to boarding school after she is caught in a disgraceful in the eyes of her family situation at boarding school she must learn to deal with the complicated relationships of the girls who are there she must also cope with her feelings for and relationship with the head of the school the big secret is revealed toward the end of the book as well as the role of the young girl's twin her brother although i enjoyed the book as an entertaining read i did not believe this book was particularly special there are many coming of age books with a hidden secret however it is obvious that the author has done her homework with regard to the topic of the sport of horsemanship and i was impressed with this aspect of the book","1339":"wow i'm really shocked at the reviews i just glanced over i'm going to have to disagree i really enjoyed this book the writing was beautiful and although this is not a feel good story it felt real and true thea was a flawed character who made some flawed decisions and the consequences echoed throughout her life it was tragic and it left me heartbroken but that doesn't make a book bad in my opinion","1340":"if i could have given this book 3 1 2 stars i would have only because though it is well written the theme differed from my expectations so i liked it but i didn't love it it was quick read and an interesting character study i appreciated the references to the depression from the perspective of someone so largely unaffected by it a new point of view on that dismal time period","1341":"beautiful writing but i was hoping the main character would have a crisis of conscious and grow from her circumstances","1342":"i can't recommend this book not well written in my opinion and it was tough to get through on to the next book","1343":"agreement throughout my book club this was a partially well written book with interesting tidbits about the era and the mountainous surroundings the author did a good job of letting you feel what it was like to be a wealthy young lady during the depression we rarely liked thea or any of the other characters and her odd actions and quite often felt uncomfortable there was ironies on the book that left you feeling confused the only reason my book club made it to the end was that we were just interested enough to find out just exactly what did thea do then it feel flat and wrapped up too quickly i would not recommend this book","1344":"ohmigod this book it's like a modern catcher in the rye and i mean that in the worst possible way because catcher in the rye grows more irritating with age if that's even possible thea is fleeing {spoilers} her incestuous relationship with her jerk of a cousin who has what seemed to me to be pretty non consensual sex with thea he then pays the price oh the tragic tragic price by getting his skull bashed in by thea's twin brother oh that's not enough drama for you don't worry because thea will be recovering from this deep secret past by wait for it having an affair with her married headmaster which he's like 35 and she's 15 how can that not be terribly consensual as well anyway i did not care for this book","1345":"ok this book was pretty interesting and different at first but then it got really weird i'm still not sure what i was meant to get out of reading it quite a strange choice of subject matter","1346":"the book is very well written in that i kept reading even after deciding i hated all the characters it felt like there were several interesting stories to be told from these characters and the author picked the least interesting path","1347":"i wanted to get lost in this book although i enjoyed it i did not love it","1348":"greatly disliked the heroine u0026amp felt disengaged from the story the entire time i was reading","1349":"really disappointing spoiled girl with not much on her mind except sex with her cousin and then headmaster not enough about horses and riding","1350":"this is definitely not what i expected the 1930 s depression era girls at a camp school in blowing rock nc not the story i would've told but it was interesting and disturbing no spoiler alert here","1351":"15 4 13 15 well written a bit more explicit than my liking thea is an interesting character it's fascinating to see the moral journey of someone raised without any real moral compass","1352":" this is the second horse related book that i've read that i disliked and there were similarities between the two that had little to do with horses first i am wildly distrustful of books that are highly touted by friends of the author especially if those friends are writers too and in this case i would be highly reluctant to read anything written by any of the authors who had a blurb on the cover and i'm seriously doubting amazon's book recommendations as well next both this book and the other that i read field of horses have a distinct cold and disconnected narration though the relationship in field of horses is much more chaste to the point of boring hard to build any sympathy for a narrator who's conclusion is that she is not responsible for the questionable events in her life even as she is engaging in acts that have the potential to destroy yet another family if indeed this is fiction then is there really a need for the doomed relationship with mr holmes other than for him to tell her that nothing that has happened is her fault really i kept waiting for her to discover that she's not the only one with whom mr holmes is having sexual relations implied i believe but never stated incest is a distasteful subject but one that the author handles well it's understandable how her relationship with georgie could spin out of her control is her relationship with mr holmes intended to represent her need to control a sexual relationship with a man dunno in 30 years will this book have joined the literary canon with other great works by american writers i don't think so i don't think anyone will still be reading this in 5 years","1353":"a southern depression era coming of age sexual awakening novel with incest statutory rape and horses","1354":" the commercial reviews use words like lush and sexy i found nothing lush or sexy in the fact that the sex in the book occurred between teenaged cousins and and teenager and a 30 ish year old man it might have redeemed itself if in the end she finds a man who truly loves her it started out pretty strong but was just a mess by the middle and i stopped caring about any of the characters i admit i could not even finish it but i read some of the spoilers to find out what happens i think i lost all patience with the line i lay back on my bed and peeled them stockings off surprised by the feel of my bare legs against the quilt talk about melodramatic how can a 16 year old be surprised by the feel of a quilt up until then the writing quality hadn't seemed too bad but at that point i just couldn't take it and i couldn't read one more encounter between thea and mr holmes","1355":"i loved this novel at first it's set in a tumultuous time the great depression in two equally rich and wondrous locations the orange groves of central florida and the majestic mountains of north carolina and it tells the gripping coming of age tale of a bold and somewhat esoteric girl named thea atwell fraternal twin accomplished equestrian sheltered upper cruster as the story opens thea is being sent away to the yonahlossee riding camp for girls in north carolina she's been exiled from her florida home for some unknown transgression and the narrative alternates between her time at yonahlossee and the previous year at home in florida slowly revealing exactly what happened to get her sent away the story is compelling and beautifully written but as it moved along i found thea to be more and more unlikable and unsympathetic she's selfish and cruel and unstable and i had issues in particular with her weird and aggressive sexuality there are a lot of sexual encounters both at home and at yonahlossee and they're bizarrely graphic in a hard nipples through my thin nightgown and his fingers inside me sort of way i kept rolling my eyes and wondering how this story went so far off the rails and turned into fifty shades of grey and as others have noted thea's sexuality is much more dysfunctional and disturbing than it is scandalous which seems a failure on the part of the book it's like the author wanted to write something bold and empowering but ended up with something strange and sad so towards the end of the book i felt like it had slipped from 5 stars to maybe 2 now that i'm finished with it and have taken some time to reflect on the book i'm thinking maybe the author accomplished exactly what she set out to she wrote a complicated imperfect totally screwed up character who still manages at times to be loving brave and kind thea is very much a product of her circumstances and looking back i think she does the best she can with what she has most importantly she survives and she learns to accept herself for who she is sure she makes some terrible choices but haven't we all i think that's why i resented her so much at times she evokes many of the things i dislike and fear about myself but this makes thea an honest if flawed character and that's something i can appreciate","1356":"i came to this book with some pre conceived notions it was the 1970's not the 1930's when the book is set that i was introduced to the camp by my boarding school classmates and friends the devotion those girls had for the camp to this day as they speak of the 90th anniversary celebration and the passion we all had for horses i was looking forward to examining the social norms u0026amp roles of adolescents adults the family conventional and surrogate perhaps if i could have read the book in one sitting this is easy to do i would have found the writing and the story more engaging instead i had to re read pages and by the end wanted to simply be finished","1357":"heavily atmospheric i enjoyed the interplay of the various girls at camp and the contrast of luxury and ease played against the backdrop of the depression i am not generally a fan of in media res storytelling however and this novel abuses that structure in my very least favorite way constant mysterious references to thea's troubled past wore thin fast and droned on long finally the story crosses a moral line for me and i am disturbed by the conclusion","1358":"didn't love it kind of boring","1359":"another coming of age book of a teenage girl written by a man i enjoyed it a lot once again the ending was a bit rushed endings are so hard to write","1360":"fiction book set in the depression regarding a girl that was sent away to a horse boarding school in the appalachians","1361":"self centered girlwoman seeks inappropriate sexual relations with a first cousin and others oh and she likes to ride horses too bleech another more nuanced writer may have been able to pull it off but she did not i chalk this book's best seller status to pretty cover art despite the fact it features a woman wearing jeans it is supposed to take place during the depression","1362":"i wanted to like this book i'd heard so many good things about it but it was so bad uninteresting characters obvious plot twist so disappointing i'm sorry i spent precious reading time on it","1363":"read this in less than 24 hours there was just something about it that kept me reaching for more book is filled with innuendos and stormy relationships","1364":"this was a very good vacation read i read it very quickly and enjoyed it but it didn't quite live up to all the hype it has been getting","1365":"i was an interesting story of coming of age and understanding who you are separate from your family and the ways people dealt with family shame in the 1930's","1366":" i was excited to read this book as both a former horse owner and an always horse lover but i was disappointed in the story i don't consider myself a prude but there was a lot of inappropriate and somewhat explicit sex in this story the main character thea atwell first has a physical relationship with her cousin which tears her family apart but then she has another physical relationship with an adult in the story don't want to give it away if you plan to read this but i would not recommend it very highly she is only 15 years old her family spirals downward and it was kind of a dark story","1367":"i keep having a hard time remembering the riding camp name i think the author could have chosen a name that sounded more beautiful thea is a girl who got into trouble and was sent away to camp the end no just kidding although to me it sounded like that except this camp has a lot of horses to ride as well as headmasters haha okay serious now the writing is excellent i picked up the book expecting to read a chapter before going to bed one evening and ended up staying late almost halfway through i'm not fond of horses but those who are would find a lot to like in this book the author is an experienced rider and it shows of course it just brings to mind again that advice of write what you know the author spends a lot of time shifting from camp life to thea's home life in florida where she led a charmed life with her twin brother at first you think something terrible happened to her twin sam because thea always used the past tense when she talked about him later on you find out that it had something to do with her cousin georgie the girls in the camp are interesting enough the author did a good job in describing their personalities their looks their clothes it reminds me somewhat of little women in how each girl perceives another this is a good coming of age book lots of good writing and themes that women growing up in whatever era had has to struggle with","1368":"thought i'd like this better a gal is sent away by her parents following a torrid affair with her male cousin which resulted in the gal's brother hitting the cousin and mortally wounding him the gal falls for the head of the school and they have an affair she gets sent home and decides to leave again hohum","1369":"this was an enjoyable summer read it was predictable but the descriptions of the horseback riding and the girls at the school were really good","1370":" the yonahlossee riding camp for girls was mesmerising i felt as if i were reading something like a diary from another place in time the descriptive scenes were so vividly displayed that i could picture it clearly the novel is set in north carolina in 1930 after thea the main character is exiled from her home in florida the new world that thea entered change her as a girl growing up in a different setting to what she was used to i felt thea's voice echoed a true experience as i know the author had also had a childhood love for horse riding thea has to forgive and forget for the most of it and learn to take away something optimistic from her mistakes that she made in florida and at the riding camp in a setting of education growth and complexity the yonahlossee riding camp for girls was a hit in my mind something perfect for those nights when you want something passionate and youthful something relatable and deep i thoroughly loved this book and recommend it highly this book will definitely have praise and accomplishment and has the potential to be a huge bestseller a massive 5 stars you can buy the yonahlossee riding camp for girls from june 6th at all major

pick up and it never did i finished it but can't help feeling there's 3 days of my life i can never get back three stars for some nice writing but otherwise snore","1372":"beautifully written book i would have followed him anywhere for a moment and then the moment ended","1373":" i quickly got caught up in the yonahlossee riding camp for girls an atmospheric well written coming of age novel set during the great depression anton disclafani creates a convincing voice for her first person narrator fifteen year old thea atwell late of central florida when we first meet her thea has been banished to the camp nestled in the blue ridge mountains of north carolina a place where wealthy southern girls learn to become wealthy southern wives unused to mingling with other young people she surprises herself by adjusting to life amongst two hundred adolescent girls clad in white uniforms living in cabins riding horses the riding aspect--the nicely appointed barns the practice rings the challenge of competing with other girls--makes yonahlossee \"a little like paradise\" for thea she has \"a way with horses \" and can get them to do what she wants \"in order to ride well you had to stop yourself from thinking had to act on instinct alone and this was something i'd always done well \" thea believes that excelling at riding and jumping is the source of her power what gives her the confidence to believe she will \"emerge from this place \"lest you think this is a treacle y tale of campfire camaraderie and contests more suitable for 10 year olds know this thea is a \"bad girl\" or at least she believes herself to be one she gradually recounts the disastrous family \"mess\" that precipitated her arrival how her parents \"sent her away\" from home and most poignantly from her twin brother sam we as inhabitants of the 21st century understand thea's story from a more liberated vantage point but thea and the people in her world see it quite differently creating the book's interesting tension yet thea's own stance even within the confines of her time and culture still surprised me she's many years older by time she tells this story but she only obliquely offers any hint of having gotten much wiser of having gained any perspective on this incident in a longer life instead yonahlossee and what preceded it looms large she sums up the rest in a few paragraphs given what's happened and what she's done she is a victim but not only a victim perhaps that's the best she can do the yonahlossee riding camp for girls made me think of how in one way children are the pawns and possessions of their parents shaped by them for good or ill or both but at the same time each child has his or her own life thoughts and beliefs--unknown and unknowable by the parents more book reviews at my blog reading salon","1374":"a very different read than i expected kept me interested and i had many questions as i read overall i enjoyed it but it was not a favorite","1375":"miss thea atwell is a character you will never forget a florida girl coming of age during the great depression who learns to become her own woman in spite of or perhaps because of complicated family dynamics this is one of the most exquisitely written novels that i have ever read","1376":"well written and thought provoking novel","1377":"wait until about the 2nd chapter to the end to find out the crime committed the author has put her in a no win situation twice very sad for her too bad the story doesn't extend past the year would be interesting to find out how she turns out i did like this but you do have to remember it's the depression years","1378":"for a book that is so well written it took me a while to finish it i do not want to spoil the story but some of the book contains difficult material and you need to really read the whole book carefully to understand the intricacies of the characters' actions definitely worth your time to read this one","1379":" coming of age stories abound therefore it is always exciting to discover a writer who can make the loss of innocence feel new anton disclafani's debut the yohahlossee riding camp for girls is once such novel it's 1930 and thea atwell age fifteen has been sent away from her family to the yonahlossee riding camp for girls while the girls do ride and thea is a remarkable horsewoman this is really not a camp as much as a finishing school for wealthy young women many who have gone astray thea herself has been sent away by her parents for her involvement in an unspeakable family tragedy her twin sam has remained at home and thea bears their separation with difficulty while thea struggles with feeling of guilt and disconnection she also begins to find a place for herself among the other girls she also begins a journey of self discovery thea recognizes her ambitiousness and is both amazed at it and repelled by it and learns that while it is part of her natural character she must learn to control her desires disclafani deftly unwinds thea's story and her role in the family tragedy by toggling between thea's life at school and the events that tore her family apart creating a sense of suspense throughout the novel the yonahlossee riding camp for girls is at its heart a novel about the loss of innocence and a girl's sexual awakening it is also a suspenseful and atmospheric read one that demand wide readership anton disclafani is a writer to watch","1380":"this was a fast easy read i was taken aback at how sexually charged it was because i didn't read the book jacket and expected it to just be about a girl at a riding camp in the early 30's i enjoyed how the author slowly introduced readers to the event that changed the life of the main character as a horse lover i enjoyed the interspersed horsey parts without horses being the main character anyone could read this book and enjoy the story horse lover or not","1381":"did you ever read the saddle club books when you were a kid i did i loved them i also read children's books about girls who figure skated--not because i personally participated in activities like horseback riding and ice skating but because they were totally outside my experience and therefore glamorous this book is like saddle club except imagine the main character is 8 10 years older and at that stage of life when hormones are pumping through her like someone left the valve open on a fire hydrant making her wild with lust and ripe for some bad decision making yeeeeeehaw thea atwell has spent a beyond sheltered childhood secluded from everyone but her close family members on a thousand acres in central florida in the early 1930s she has always been content with her life small in scope though it has been--she has her pony sasi her twin brother sam and her cousin georgie inevitably however the isolation shatters her perfect life in the aftermath of a family tragedy her parents send her to an all girls boarding school riding camp in north carolina thea shows pretty terrible judgment throughout the book and is at times whiny and selfish but don't let that be a deterrent to you where is it written that narrators must be likable and what teenage girl isn't whiny and selfish there's something alluring about witnessing someone else's destructive choices and i found myself really enjoying the schadenfreude and thea isn't shallow or blase about her failings she owns them all and shoulders a hefty load of guilt the end of the book does not reveal her to be a woman who has learned from her mistakes or is even particularly changed by them but she has settled into herself comfortably and unapologetically she has let go of her need for approval--from her parents from her brother from the girls at the camp she can't change the past or fix what she broke but she can forge ahead salvaging what remains of her life more book recommendations by me at www readingwithhippos com","1382":" see review and more at http katloveofbooks blogspot com thea atwell is a naive sheltered spoiled 15 year old girl sent away from her florida home after a scandal that shakes up her family you figure out pretty quickly what the scandal is even though the full details do not emerge until the very end of the book the story bounces back and forth between the present and the past and we get the background of the scandal slowly through out the book thea spends one year at yonahlossee however nothing much happens and the passage of time can be difficult to understand one paragraph they are at a dance the next its two months later and christmas the scene near the end of the book where she is preparing to leave and is up looking at a photo and flashing back to home really threw me even after rereading several times i just didn't get what was happening when and why some of it was important thea's flippant attitude about what happened to her what continues to happen to her was the most irritating thing about the book she was there and bad stuff happened and she moved on she never learned or grew from any of these experiences i sort of struggled with what was thea's role in the scandal was she a victim or did she know the consequences of her actions and was a willing participant i think she knew on some level but a teenage mind could not understand the far reaching consequences and she was sort of a victim her cousin understood more than she did and i thought a bit manipulative however thea learns nothing and repeats her errors while at camp up until the end she could never see her part in anything that happened bad stuff just happened around her the riding part of the story was interesting however it was unbelievable that she was as an advanced a rider as she was considering she had just been riding around her property in florida on her pony she had never had formal lessons etc hard to believe she was the best rider there overall i enjoyed this book the story stuck with me the descriptions were lush and beautiful and i couldn't put it down i can understand why it is on many must read lists","1383":"an easy read but a little bit strange author seems a little too fixated on the sexual yearnings of adolescent girls think you might have to have a thing about horses to really appreciate it","1384":"good book kept me interested ending was a bit of a let down unfortunately","1385":"really enjoyed this girly coming of age story","1386":"i read this book after my friend leslie recommended it i wasn't disappointed it has a unique storyline and kept me interested the whole way through i really can't decide if i should give it 4 or 5 stars i ended up giving it four stars because even though it was a good read it was a bit on the strange side","1387":"this book is such a slow starter i almost gave up very little happens in the first third of the book and by then i really didn't care very much about the main character thea there is no one to like in her disfunctional family and then she goes to live at the riding camp with other girls who are equally unappealing the whole book seems under developed not a very satisfying read","1388":"i have read better romance novels with illicit relationships between student and teacher","1389":"a lush telling of a girl of privilege who is banished from her family's florida home after some unspecified transgression the book is well done and feels really immersive it was a fast read and not quite what i was expecting but enjoyable nonetheless","1390":"entertaining read by an author with an unusual style of writing i can only characterize it as aloof on a surface level this book is merely a coming of age story at a riding camp for girls but what i found so striking was the main character thea's fearless nature a trait she found served her well in the ring and badly in life overall an intriguing read and it had moments where the author seemed to be reaching deeper than the surface level story however not a book that wow'd me","1391":" i think my favorite thing about this book was the descriptions of florida very consistent with accounts i've read from that time and the author really brought the area to life for readers i'm not sure if i liked the characters particularly the protagonist but it was still an interesting story i started out feeling sorry for her and by the end sort of felt like she got off lightly as annoying as all the mysterious allusions to the incident are you do eventually get all the details of what happened which was good i was worried it would be left a mystery","1392":"this book kept me interested from the first page one of the better books i have read in a while","1393":" there were so many bad reviews that popped up for this book i was nervous about it but i really liked it it reminded me a bit of v c andrews a dark coming of age story about a girl from the past thea is a bit whiny but it is being told by how she felt when she was 15 15 year olds are whiny so that wasn't a shock to me the only thing i think would have made it better was to have more about what happened with her as an adult i think other parts could have been shortened a bit to make more room for that she very very briefly says a little bit about her adult life in the last few pages but it would have been nice to hear a little more i think this was a good summer read set in a beautiful places and had a bit of lady smut to it o take it for what it is","1394":"this book started out ok but never really grabbed me or my attention","1395":"i really wanted to like this more but i found thea's character so spoiled and completely self absorbed view spoiler and by the time she eventually does something unselfish and caring for someone else it felt like too little too late hide spoiler i also felt like the author was going to suffer a mild stroke if she did not mention the title somewhere on each page","1396":"3 5 stars i did very much enjoy this book it was much different from what i thought it was going to be but not in a bad way i expected there to be adolescent drama i expected a coming of age story but it was just a little weird at times i found myself cringing because i kept thinking this just isn't right it was definitely a page turner and even though i didn't necessarily like thea i found the story to be intriguing","1397":"hmmm perplexing book to me i think this would have been a good book club choice to discuss with people i was really into it initially but was losing interest as it went on i liked how it was a coming of age story however i don't know if i got the overall message or theme of the book i found it intriguing","1398":"holy slow i really liked everything in this book technically but felt like it would have benefited from some aggressive editing the story needed to start way earlier than it did i feel that most readers would have given up way before i did i liked the story very much even though it left me rather depressed but thought it was believable and raw","1399":"this was a very good but very strange book you kind of root for and hate the main character throughout the whole book and it's different every page i'm kind of confused by the whole thing but not in a bad way and i still recommend it","1400":"this was a good read entertaining but not exceptional i enjoyed it though","1401":"in 1930 15 year old theodora attwell is sent to the yonahlossee riding camp for girls for reasons of a scandalous nature while trying to adapt to her new surroundings in the mountains of north carolina thea recalls the events that led to her banishment from her privileged yet isolated life in florida with her beloved family the title for anton disclafani's debut novel is misleading the yonahlossee riding camp for girls is less about the everyday life at a boarding school and more about a young girl entering adulthood turning a bit risque in places the narrator thea is complex to say the least and reads older than her 15 years i thought it was interesting that disclafani chose to portray thea in an almost unlikeable way thea has snobbish tendencies that have resulted from her isolated upbringing she treats others horribly if they are unnessecary and her fatal flaw is making rash decisions putting her own needs before that of others for all her faults and they can be infuriating at times this makes thea a much more interesting character to read about what stood out for me was anton disclafani's prose which is wonderfully atmospheric although this makes for slow reading as every detail has to be savoured disclafani has successfully captured the essence of two completely different places through her writing as well as effectively detailing the uncertainty that the great depression caused for people in that era the only problem i had was with the lack of originality plot wise i was hooked by the mystery of why thea had been sent away in disgrace disclafani teasing me with hints for the first portion of the book however once i found out the reason and then reading about thea's subsequent actions at the riding camp i found myself less in a hurry to finish the book and more of a struggle to stick with it until the end overall the yonahlossee riding camp for girls is a decent summer read but probably nothing than that still i look forward to reading more of anton disclafani's writing in the future as she certainly has a fantastic writing style","1402":"too much drama not enough about the horses only kidding sort of but thea sure made it hard for me to like her or feel any sympathy strange story","1403":" this is a tough one on the one hand i liked the protagonist she was a good mix of likable and unlikable like real people are she's impulsive selfish and complex on the other hand i feel like the balance of this book is way off the first 100 pages are all about life at the camp the rest of the book only really talks about the camp in regards to a few key relationships the rest is unfurling the mystery of why thea was sent to camp in the first place by the end it was all backstory and no camp so why would i care what happens to friends like sissy when she's barely been in the last 200 pages the here's what happens to every character ending felt so old fashioned maybe on purpose and a bit lazy this will be an interest one to discuss with my book club","1404":" most of the reviews i've seen have been negative but i loved this book i only gave 4 stars because it did take me a while to get into it it's a slow read but it's thoughtful and insightful the writing transported you to the places written about and made me remember being a teenager thinking about what it would have been like almost 100 years ago the events may be hard for some to relate to but the feelings are universal what i loved most was being reminded that events shape us but don't define us","1405":"wish i liked the characters better","1406":"very interesting since i was a drama counselor here in 1971 but it was quite different by then although the girls did love the horses","1407":" this book was absolutely atrocious and if i could give a negative rating on here i would i wouldn't suggest you read this even if you get it for free like i did the protagonist is one of the most obnoxious idiotic unsympathetic female characters i've read since bella swan in twilight this plays off of stereotypes as southerners being inbred and the plot is largely contingent on the protagonist's whining about how hard her life is her life is decidedly not hard she's at a riding camp for the daughters of the south's most elite families during the great depression and all of the problems she encounters are 100% her own fault and are mistakes that a 10 year old knows not to make on top of that the writing isn't anything remarkable although i will concede that some of the parts depicting the landscape and the horseback riding were well done too bad the entire book is about her being a horny little miscreant instead of her equestrian talents","1408":"it is 1930 the midst of the great depression after her mysterious role in a family tragedy passionate strong willed thea atwell age fifteen has been cast out of her florida home exiled to an equestrienne boarding school for southern debutantes high in the blue ridge mountains with its complex social strata ordered by money beauty and girls' friendships the yonahlossee riding camp for girls is a far remove from the free roaming dreamlike childhood thea shared with her twin brother on their family's citrus farm--a world now partially shattered as thea grapples with her responsibility for the events of the past year that led her here she finds herself enmeshed in a new order one that will change her sense of what is possible for herself her family her country i wanted to like this book a lot more than i did i kept waiting for something more definitely a book that doesn't live up to the hype","1409":"this book lacked depth the author was so off in his understanding of teenage sexuality and seemed to never make it clear that this young girl was a victim of sexual assault it's never ok for an adult much less a teacher to molest a minor i hope that this book doesn't fall into the hands of a victim it will make them feel even worse about themselves he just got it all wrong","1410":"the setting of this book could have led to a serious engaging story and at times the author seemed capable of it instead she chose to write a cheap romance novel that's her choice as an author but it wasn't what i was hoping for from this book","1411":" i don't read reviews before i actually finish a book most of my reading selection and book purchases are based on instincts the cover definitely helps and the little blurb on the inside fold of the cover usually differentiates if a book will be put back on the shelf or going home with me my kindle purchases are simplified but similar versions of the same process however after i finish reading a book i'll read some of other people's review to see if we share similar feelings about the same book...after seeing so many negative below 3 stars reviews of this book my finger hesitated between four and five stars for a long time before i made up my mind to select the fifth one i truly enjoyed reading this story and thea is among my favorite narrators of all times this is another one of those books that people who enjoy plot driven and non wordy books will hate this book is narrative driven character driven but it's definitely not a thriller or mystery we definitely don't read it to find out \"what has she done \" what thea has done or is going to do definitely should not be our main concern in reading this book this book is great because of the characters imperfect yet lovable i also loved the book since the author did a great job bringing out thea's full character her self reflection her self doubt her desire for love parental sexual her worries her passion for riding and her friends and family...it's all there it's a wonderful coming of age novel thea is a conflicted girl yes she's self destructive let her desires rule over her head compulsive rebellious headstrong judgmental...yet she's also smart sensitive curious spirited horse lover a great friend and sister wise beyond her age full of passion and knows herself very well even without much guidance from her parents unfortunately the story took place in 1930 on the verge of the depression when women girls are still treated unfairly i couldn't help but imagine what kind of achievements thea could've reached in our present world she has just the right personality drive and passion it's hard to remember she was only 15 at the beginning of the book and barely 16 at the end \"mother would tell us that we were loved even before we were born but that wasn't quite true one of us was loved the other unknown \"in the beginning of the book thea was dropped off by her father at the yonahlossee horse camp for girls in the mountains of north carolina the camp was only affordable by the rich where the girls could learn all sorts of things including riding and manners among other similar girls although she did not know herself at that time thea was sent here because her family was ashamed of something she did or caused among a bunch of teenage girls thea who was sheltered in a luxurious home all her 15 years of life being home schooled by her physician dad along with her twin brother sam feels out of place thea's mom we later found out was definitely not a normal supportive and loving mom although they had lots of money and physical needs were met she did not provide her growing twins with the emotional support teens desperately needed and she loves sam more sam was the closest \"friend\" thea had along with their cousin georgie the animals in the farms were sam's world and the horse sasi was thea's being thrown into this mixture of girls some nice some not so forced thea to grow up and handle her own affairs being able to still ride offers thea tremendous comfort because it's great to at least have control of something as simple as a horse making a close friend sissy also helps the whole story was narrated by thea's 15 year old voice the voice was sometimes naive sometimes angry and scornful and other times lost and scared the reader couldn't help but get emotionally involved with her life on the other hand we also wait patiently for her to reveal her past which came rather late in the book while her \"present\" error somewhat mimics her past one in a way she made her mistakes over and over again as a mother of a teenager at around the same age i understand how important guidance is at that age view spoiler i also understand the curiosity about the other sex and the pleasures that sex could bring hide spoiler with a mom who kept her in a house without any other human contact was definitely not a good way to teach her about the world or the rights from wrongs choosing to send her away was also not exactly problem solving but it was 1930 thea's actions therefore were understandable in the way she was brought up \"i was a girl of fifteen locked away in the mountains surrounded by strangers but i would be all right i would emerge from this place \"she did as a debut novelist the author's reign on her story was as good as the yonahlossee girls' on their horses it's quite impressive considering her storytelling also alternated between now and then to tell thea's present and past environment story not one instance i felt bored usually an inexperienced author would make the transition from now to the past at the wrong time i find her transitions smooth her story telling prose soothing yet gripping her descriptions involved all five senses sight sound taste touch and uniquely smell thea's character as well as all others along with the camp came alive on the pages i truly enjoyed reading the story and did not roll my eyes at the more sensual scenes i do that a lot since some people are terrible in those kind of writings however a sense of sadness lingers long after i finished the book for thea and for all the other suppressed women in that era","1412":"main character was not so likable she seemed like an adult not a 15 year old girl even if her liaison with her cousin is understandable and forgivable to the reader her relationship with the headmaster made her unlikable it definitely was a slow read","1413":"felt too smutty to be a quality read i mean really kidding cousins then an affair with the headmaster at age 15 thankfully it was a beach read","1414":"not my kind of book slow knew the outcome before i read it don't bother","1415":"i did not care for or connect with the main character thea she was self centered as many 15 year olds are but her analysis of situations was much too sophisticated for a teenager the dialogue was stilted and dry and unrealistic","1416":"odd book thea is not the most likeable protagonist","1417":"i said i didn't finish it because i skimmed it after the first 100 pages the only parts worth reading were the horseback riding scenes you have to skim through a lot of schlock and smut to find the horses writing's not bad characters are abysmal","1418":"i found most of this very uncomfortable which is probably a reasonable way to feel the ending was surprisingly upbeat","1419":" read this book for thea's voice as the classic unreliable first person narrator read it as a very grown up version of all those horse books we meaning girls read as kids read it for disclafani's careful structure built around jealously lies manipulation scheming and frankly erotic sex that always involves an unhealthy power dynamic it's not a perfect book and at 400 pages it drags in the middle like an old sway backed lesson horse can i get away with that simile but it kept me reading on and i'm impressed that this debut novel pulled off a first person narrator so well many of the reviews complain that thea is unlikeable and that disclafani erred in making her so difficult that's a bullshit review a good character should be flawed and thea wins that blue ribbon","1420":"enjoyed the book unexpected plot well written about a 15 year old girl and the results ofpoor choices shemakes inthe areas of sex and romance a great summer read","1421":"lovely coming of age story disclafani gets the primal urges and fears of a young woman pitch perfect","1422":" i would love to give this book 3 stars as it was well written and had an interesting story to tell unfortunately i only found it ok which is 2 starts and can't say i completely like it which is 3 stars the first and last 1 3 of the book were great but the middle 1 3 felt like an overly graphic wet dream i didn't see it coming and it didn't seem to fit with the character of thea the author tried to bring it together but it never clicked for me i liked the protagonist from time to time but there was a real jekyll hyde tone to her didn't fit the 15 year old we met at the beginning of the book of course i was hoping to enjoy the horse scenes and some of them did make sense but i know a lot of horse crazy girls and thea wasn't as horse crazy as she pretends i did a lot of skimming to get through this and would have quit if i didn't care about her twin so much so i can't recommend it but it passed my decent though not exceptional prose test","1423":" this book oozes foreboding and foreshadowing much like the languid heat of its partial fl setting or the fecund appalachian mountains for its other location set in 1930 the heart of the depression the story is narrated by thea who is just arriving at the yonahlossee riding camp in the n carolina mountains she has been sent away and the reason is hinted at flashbacked and ultimately revealed essentially sexual impropriety though thea is a progressive girl and has really not learned a lesson despite missing her home and her twin always a twin for ultimate sensitivity and maximum hurt it is a well written coming of age story but a little morally ambivalent","1424":"not a winner for me gimmicky to appeal to teens it's a disappointment read claire ange instead a delicious story all the way through","1425":"this was a pretty good read but it's only getting 3 stars as i absolutely couldn't stand the main character thea i wanted to give her a slap so many times throughout the book and i'm not big of how wonderful horses are either","1426":"this was one of those books that was so hyped up that i was hoping to love it but really just liked it it seemed to drag on and thea was very hard to like at times especially when it came to mr holmes","1427":"good capturing of young girl's loneliness","1428":"i found the setting time u0026amp place as unique and engaging it asked the question again and again about what is the right reaction to situations and while i often disagreed the choices made for a great story","1429":"i had read good reviews for this book and looked forward to reading it i finished it very disappointed the story had potential but i didn't feel any of the relationships were well developed there were no characters i developed feelings for there was no redemption for all the confusion and mess in people's lives no adults with wisdom or concern for teenagers the fact that thea may have had a normal life later on was written with no connection to the main parts of her teenage life","1430":"a coming of age book for girls and yet a sacrifice of the girl for the boy very cleverly exposed during the book and a great read","1431":"decent read but i felt the end was rushed as if the author suddenly decided to be done with the book","1432":"i liked the technique of switching between present and past with a little bit of future thrown in to build suspense and parallel the situations that occurred are occurring you do get an inkling early on as to why thea was sent to the yonahlossee riding camp for girls though we don't find out the details until well into the story the descriptions of the girls and the scenery are quite vivid creating complex characters as teenage girls are anyway","1433":"i enjoyed this book and became enthralled with it even when i did not like the main character at times it was like i could not look away i had to remind myself she was an adolescent and remember what that is like it was an interesting portrayal of a difficult time for women i love horses and felt the connection there too","1434":" felt like there were a lot of unexplored ideas here nothing really felt complete everything undeserved relationships in particular were not carved out what drew thea to one person what pulled her away from others it semes cliche to say but i kept asking myself what's her motivation here the author seemed to rely a lot on the reader to fill in the gaps expecting the reader to understand the relationship between twins and what made that bond special understand the complicated relationships between mother and daughter understand the inexplicable desire and pull one feels and yes a reader will bring his or her life experiences to a book and recognize feelings and understand motivations but so much of what thea did seemed unearned by the author the book moved to its natural conclusion but thea just seemed to be tagging along for the ride","1435":"read the first few chapters couldn't get into it maybe i'll give it another shot at some point the premise seems interesting i love books set at boarding schools","1436":"a disturbing but captivating book extremely well written","1437":"this book was pretty good set in the depression era early 1930s it begins with a teen age girl from florida being dropped off by her father at a riding camp in the north carolina mountains it soon becomes clear that the girl has been effectively banished from her family for a terrible event that she had been involved with the first two thirds of the book alternated scenes of her days at the camp with scenes flashbacks of her earlier life with her family and the situations that led up to this mysterious event once the event was revealed though and it was pretty bad i found the rest of the book including the ending to be somewhat disjointed and unsatisfying i would say the book had some great scenes of the girls training and racing horses","1438":" i would not normally have chosen this book but i enjoyed reading it the story flows well and is well written its the story how one event in life can have so many consequences for so may other people the main character is likable and a mix if worldliness and naivety that does makes her quite likable the actions of her family after an accident are not explained to her at the time and she is only partly able to understand why they have sent her away however on her return she realises that they have not changed but she has all in all a pleasant read and i would recommend it to others","1439":" borrowing from the publisher's description a lush sexy evocative debut novel of family secrets and girls' school rituals set in the 1930s south in a nutshell 15 year old thea atwell is sent away to riding camp because of a family scandal she at first hates her new life but soon embraces the beauty of the camp told through flashbacks and a few fast forwards the book is beautiful written i loved the author's writing style the story itself is a bit spotty you'll be able to guess at what the scandal is and will undoubtedly want to yell at the characters when everyone starts to interact again the protagonist can really be vapid and vacuous at times which also reflects the personality of her mother i understand why the reviews have been harsh but i really really want to stress how much the writing really stands out gorgeously written","1440":"well written but ultimately disappointing","1441":"as predicted this book killed me i am posting this from the great beyond","1442":"i don't get the chance to read many adult books friends because i spend all my free time trying to catch up on teen books so that i can better advise my patrons but i like adult books they involve ridiculous love triangles on a much less frequent basis it's refreshing so in an attempt to kill two birds with one stone i got a list of adult books that teens will also enjoy and from it chose at random the yonahlossee riding camp for girls god i hope this book doesn't become super popular with the masses books with cutesy but long and hard to remember titles the curious incident of the dog in the night time the guernsey literary and potato peel pie society drive me fucking nuts because no one can ever remember them and yet everyone wants to read them i really don't need six thousand requests for \"that one riding school girl camp book \" anyway the yonahlossee riding camp for girls should be everything that i could ever want in a novel thea our heroine is fifteen and wealthy living in florida and riding her beloved pony and going on endless adventures with her twin brother sam and her older cousin georgie all very far removed from the ever closer creeping disaster that is the great depression life is grand for thea but then disaster disaster and scandal and thea's packed up without so much as a fare thee well and sent to the incredibly remote yonahlossee riding camp for girls view spoiler allegedly just for the summer but as we learn actually for pretty much however long her parents decide to leave her there hide spoiler the school seems perfect at first and her classmates seem perfect at first but of course there's still the depression so wealthy young ladies might at any moment lose their fortune and have to leave in shame and while they're not allowed to consort with men lest their reputations be ruined there are indeed menfolk nearby and anything might happen and thea poor thea has to deal with the loss of her family and the loss of her home and the aforementioned scandal and it should all make for an interesting read and as an added bonus the writing when you pick paragraphs out at random is gorgeous just fucking beautiful lots of details about horses and nature and more horses and also ponies so pretty dead birds littered the lawn outside later by moonlight and a lantern my father would collect them in a wheelbarrow and burn them in the rubbish heap watch feathers float from the plume of smoke blue feathers scarlet brown white that did not hide dirt he would watch and consider he would feel vaguely hopeful by the moonlight his breath its own plume in the air his babies small and pale but healthy as far as the human eye could tell mother would tell us that we were loved even before we were born but that wasn't quite true one of us was loved the other unknown but unfortunately when read as a whole instead of just flipping from one random page to another looking for beautiful descriptions the book is actually weirdly exhausting i felt like i was reading forever and not getting any closer to the end because good god there's another lengthy description of something you wait and wait and wait for all the secrets of this story to be revealed and when everything comes pouring out in thirty seconds right at the end you wonder what you'd hung around so long for i mean the horse descriptions aren't that amazing also lessening my enjoyment was the way the book was set up thea is the narrator--she's telling you this story that you're reading from fifty years in the future or whatever and most of the time she manages to stay out of the narrative but every once in a while she butts in all \"hey it's future me again just wanted to make sure that you were aware this is foreshadowing this reference right here doom doom doom \" which takes away from the immediacy of the text and also forced me to scream on numerous occasions that \"i get it yes i know you view spoiler fucked your cousin hide spoiler and view spoiler now he is probably dead or something hide spoiler can you stop bringing it up already \" future narrator by the way was a total downer the last twelve pages of the book where she took it upon herself to tell us every goddamn thing that happened to her from the time she left yonahlossee to the time she died came completely out of left field and were a seriously depressing drag the other issue and i'll be totally honest with you here is that i loathed our main character i found her so unlikeable which is too bad because she's supposed to be strong and independent and forward thinking all of which are nice things to see in a heroine she's also innocent and naive and conceited and worldly and in love and also maybe kind a home wrecker but maybe just using people for her personal gain and she wants too much but doesn't want enough and she's full of confidence except when she's torn apart by insecurity and--i hope you're understanding friends that thea was all over the map in terms of her personality and i couldn't pin down what we were supposed to think of her aside from \"this is certainly a girl and also she rides horses \"for example she was sent away from home because view spoiler she slept with her cousin in a vaguely dubcon sort of way and then her jealous brother ended up beating the cousin over the head and causing permanent brain damage and anyway mom panicked and was like \"shit shit what if thea is pregnant better get her out of toooooooooown \" hide spoiler all of which is totally unfair and tragic and sexist and should encourage lots of good discussion about how easily one's reputation can be damaged except then once she's actually at yonahlossee she promptly view spoiler enters into an affair with the attractive headmaster mr holmes while his wife is away for an extended trip and for fuck's sake holmes she's practically an infant albeit one who is oozing eau de seductive temptress but anyway hide spoiler it's all wildly inappropriate and sort of takes away from that \"i'm a much maligned innocent\" vibe we'd been getting off of her earlier in the book dammit thea i really want to cheer you on for reclaiming your sexuality but i wish you didn't spend so much of the book whining and being a total bitch i don't know the writing again was lovely so i feel like i can't totally reject the book but hating the main character is always a bad sign as is finishing the book and wondering why you'd started it in the first place so... two stars two stars and a pony","1443":"i really liked how the story was told and the descriptions of the environment and the thoughts on women's roles in the time period","1444":"fantastic book although towards the end it dragged out a little wonderfully written","1445":"reading this book was a bumpy ride for me parts of it i really liked but other parts made me crazy the settings were right up my alley teenage girl gone sent away to horsey boarding school and idyllic childhood in old florida but something about the protagonist just got under my skin too strong too wise too impulsive too close to home that said i very much enjoyed the narrator's voice through all of it and i wonder if the parts that made me nuts were just my middle aged reaction to hormone driven teenage behavior sigh probably","1446":"i think this must be a ya book","1447":"loved the first half and anticipated what the big secret was but felt the story stalled out and just stuck there","1448":"an engaging historical fiction choice that follows a young woman whose circumstances and choices bring her to a girls' riding school in the south during the depression the narrator tells the story of her downfall in the eyes of her parents lots of interesting historical detail with characters to care about","1449":" i enjoyed this and am looking forward to her next novel it's an odd time and place to have chosen a horsey ladies school camp deep in the mountains of north carolina during the beginning of the depression i liked the narrator and although i had my doubts about the way the author kept a big secret i liked the ending too the problem with keeping big secrets is that then the reader expects a really big payoff but in this case it became clear that the way the protagonist related to the secret was more important than the specifics which felt right to me","1450":"though i know that the author was staying true to the period i found this story very depressing try as i might i'm not quite sure why she named the story after the camp though she says the character fell in love with the place the writing didn't make me feel that she did her love for the headmaster seemed contrived the wrap up at the end of the book was like a to do list finding out that she shared a character trait with her mother also seemed contrived overall i'd say that this book was a disappointment i did finish it though","1451":"interesting coming of age story about a girl at a riding camp during the depression but there is an ick factor in her background","1452":"easy read coming of age among elite group of girls","1453":"thea a privileged but socially isolated girl from florida is sent away to a boarding school against her will i enjoyed the writing setting plot everything but the main character who i grew to dislike for her relentless pursuit of her own goals at any cost but this very antipathy is what drew me into the story and made me think had the character been a boy i doubt i would have even noticed which made me question what i expect girls to be like now and why what i imagine them to have been like in the past and what the other characters in the story expected of thea","1454":"fantastic read the pacing was perfect to keep me interested despite the 1930 timeframe which i expected to be more infused with emphasis on manners and decorum the setting is material to the plot because it is a story of how shame brings down a family the depression is a very significant backstory for its characters as well","1455":"i really like this book the author hooks you from the beginning and you don't want to put it down until you uncover the whole secret great read","1456":"quick read it was easy to become immersed in nc u0026amp fl settings recommend","1457":"great coming of age book about 15 year old thea atwell who is sent to the riding camp after she is involved in a family tragedy the author does a great job of describing thea's new life at the camp while going back and telling the events that led up to the tragedy would be an interesting read for a person who has a twin as thea has a twin brother sam that she must leave at home","1458":"a book about strong willed thea atwell who at fifteen was sent to camp for bad behavior at home thea was from florida and sent to camp in the blueridge mountains of north carolina the time was 1930 in the midst of he great depression this camp was for southern debutantes the book was slowmoving and not one of my favorites","1459":" the yonahlossee riding camp for girls a novel by anton beatrice disclafanibefore i start with the actual review i would like share my initial thought when reading the title of this book what exactly the title is \"the yonahlossee riding camp for girls a novel\" seriously yes i am completely and utterly serious anton beatrice disclafani published her debut novel in 2013 and because of a fortunate meeting at the local bookstore i was given this book a month ago as you can imagine i was very much confused by the title why 1 it is long like very long 2 there is some unpronounceable name in there 3 it says \"a novel\" like that was not already crystal clear but despite this very confusing title i was intrigued to read this book and i was proved right i did not think i would but i really enjoyed reading disclafani's debut novel it is nice to read with an interesting main character a bitter sweet love story and a fascinating setting \"the yonahlossee riding camp for girls\" is about thea atwell who is sent away to an elite boarding school at the age of 15 the reasons of her being sent away are very mysterious and thereby intriguing as a reader you know that thea did something wrong and you kind of get the feeling that it had something to do with a boy - but you get the whole story in fragments scattered across the plot this particular structure the alternation between fragments from the past and the present makes the book so interesting and a treat to read piece by piece you unravel thea's secret and you start to understand her character and her motives thea atwell is interesting because she is both the kind of person that you can easily relate to and the kind of person that you would like to be she is fierce and passionate but is also selfish and mean sometimes before thea was sent away to boarding school she lived with her twin brother and her parents in the country side she grew up very isolated with her brother being her best friend and only her family and her horse to talk to as the title suggests this book is also about horses thea rides her pony sasi every day except when her cousin georgie drops by for a visit in the flashbacks to this sunny past thea is a quiet but strong willed young girl but in the present she learns to out this strong willness disclafani's writing is good it is not going to move mountains but it is very constant throughout the book and the author gives her main character a strong and relatable voice \"the yonahlossee riding camp for girls\" is nice to read because it offers a beautiful and simple escape the book is not difficult to read in fact i found it very easy and thus makes for a good story to curl up with also disclafani did a great job on the fragmental structure of the book then the romance part of the book i found the romantic plot a bit transparent from the moment thea arrives at yonahlossee a certain character is described in such a detailed way that you already know that thea is going to start something with this character - and she does despite of the transparence i really liked the romance in \"the yonahlossee riding camp for girls\" thea's relationship with a man whose name i am not going to write down to keep this review spoiler free is very realistic and exciting their affair is forbidden and ends exactly like you know it is going to end but because it is so realistic you do not want it to end despite the very confusing title i very much enjoyed disclafani's debut novel \"the yonahlossee riding camp for girls\" is a joy to read but nothing more than that http wp me p2wils 23","1460":"the yonahlossee riding camp for girlsbyanton disclafanimy in a nutshell summary thea is sent away to an all girls riding camp trouble at home unforgiving parents her brother's part in the trouble all factors that contribute to sending thea away my thoughts after reading this book i cried at the end of this book the ending was so lovely and so real and so sad the ending also was calming and i was oddly strangely happy that thea finally reached a degree of peace but back to the beginning thea and her twin sam live an idyllic life in central florida it's the thirties their family is wealthy and each of them are able to work on their own interests they are schooled at home by their physician father they are taught other things by their somewhat rigid mother thea loves horses and rides daily sam loves animals the earth and all things outdoors they really have no need for other people in their lives other than their aunt and uncle and their older cousin georgie enter dangerous relationships sexual yearnings and an explosive situation that is the cause of this family's destruction all through the book this explosive situation is alluded to without totally being explained of course that leads to wonderful guessing mystery and suspense thea is sent to an all girls' riding school in the mountains of north carolina she believes it's just for a few months but it is the intention of her parents that it be much longer throughout her stay she has no physical contact with them they write rarely their silence is yet another rebuke for thea she has been taught by her mother that her family and their home is all she needs yet without explanation she is sent to live among strangers her year at yonahlossee is both satisfying and explosive things happen and she has yet another misplaced relationship at this juncture thea doesn't seem capable of an untroubled life what i loved about this book oh my i loved yohnahlossee horses elocution rest periods dining halls dances uniforms rules boys books and handsome troubled headmasters and riding girls lived in cottages they had maids to make their beds and draw their baths they had to rest each day the paragraphs about riding were some of my favorites naari the horse thea rode at yonahlossee sasi her pony at home leona and her horse king i loved all of it also this was a troubled time people losing their fortunes the great depression girls leaving school all of this happening outside of the bubble of protection that these pampered girls lived in at yonahlossee what i did not love thea was difficult to become fond of she was sexual to a fault she could not seem to stop her shall we say yearnings don't misunderstand this wasn't a novel that was consumed by sex but thea young and yearning didn't seem to know what was proper and what wasn't she did not seem to know how not to cross certain lines and this was her burden even when she offered to teach the headmaster's children how to ride her motive was muddled really muddled final thoughts i loved this book i loved every word thea with all of her flaws was an unforgettable character this was one of those books that i thought about for a long time afterwards there were so many different choices that all of these characters could have made but all the while i knew that they couldn't make them this is a beautiful book troubled lives flaws secrets make it unforgettable","1461":"we skyped with the author last night at the maquoketa public library and i did enjoy this book it was a fast read as i wanted to know what terrible thing the thea character had done the story takes place in the 1930's and showcases the states of florida u0026amp north carolina while blending all the characters and elements into a great read","1462":"i enjoyed the author's style and the way he kept unfolding the back story but overall the story felt a little vague to me and for such a character driven novel the motivations for each character seemed unclear","1463":"i have mixed feelings about this book the writing is evocative and the author does a good job building suspense before the big reveal but it was hard for me to sympathize with thea did she not learn her lesson i got frustrated with her foolish decisions and admitting that she was reckless but seeming not to care about the consequences of her actions","1464":"this is a story of a girl who is sent away to a riding camp in the blue ridge mountains of north carolina partly as punishment for something that happened and partly because her family is suffering through the great depression like most families the camp is solely for daughters of wealthy families however and she quickly finds herself navigating social situations she is not accustomed to having grown up spending most of her time with her fraternal twin i cursed the author through the first half of this book for not telling me what thea had done which made me keep reading it is obvious it is probably something about sex but she withholds the details for a long time the writing about sexuality is a bit uncomfortable but only because i think she actually nails that awkward period of sexual awakening that girls go through where they crave touch and experience and don't fully understand consequences a lot of the characters are underdeveloped which is why i am only giving it three stars the story is certainly engaging and the contrast of orange groves with tiny mountain towns is one i have experienced personally and it did set the tone nicely the author clearly has a horseriding background and people who are horsey people would probably enjoy it more for those details","1465":"i was disappointed in this book because the main character was so selfish and self destructive i prefer characters that i would choose as friends and thea is not my kind of gal","1466":"more like a 3 5 for me kept me intrigued and got through this quickly but the coming of age theme has never been one of my favorites this felt a bit like a harlequin making me blush at times","1467":" thea atwell is sent away to the yonahassee riding camp for girls after something happens at her home in central florida an avid horse rider she resists the camp at first but grows to love the girls and the routine the novel alternates between the goings on at the camp and the back story on why thea was sent away during her stay she comes to grips with her role in the problem at home and comes of age in many ways this book has received praise in numerous reviews and while i enjoyed it i thought it was a little overlong and that reviews a little overdone however i will seek this author out again","1468":"this was a slow burn about 1 3 of the way through it grabbed me enough to finish it wasn't the type of book that kept you wondering what was on the next page you just wanted to get to the end i enjoyed the historical aspects of the story most i'm a horse lover so was expecting to be plain out sold on the riding component but was left feeling neutral about it but on the bright side disclafani has a knack for sexualizing a young girl's world and might be an amazing erotic novelist this is a girl coming of age with a twist of 1930's naughty it wasn't a total loss and a decent first novel","1469":" this book is the definition of a 3 star read good enough to justify the time spent reading it but nothing special the writer creates atmosphere well and there is some interesting commentary on class southern mores and familial dysfunction however i think the plot and characterization were hampered by the way the story was told thea the shamed 15 year old protagonist narrates the story in first person as an adult the first person narration means that readers don't get any insights into how other characters think and feel and the fact that thea is so many years removed from the events of the story means that we don't get the emotional intensity and immediacy first person narration is supposed to provide i thought the best parts of the story were the flashbacks leading up to the scandal that led to thea's banishment from the home and thea's reflections on her feelings thea's complicated relationship with her sexual awakening is probably the most fully developed and interesting part of the book i thought the author did a good job showcasing the contradictory combination of insecurity and arrogance that teenagers often possess the ending is rushed and anti climactic there's not too much horse stuff i could not care less about horses and i was never bothered by the information the author included about riding","1470":"just okay thea atwell goes to a residential camp school for girls under protest after a a serious incident the campers know it was because of a boy it takes nearly to the end of the book to know what really happened to make her parents choose that consequence the setting is during the beginning of the depression so many girls families lose their fortunes there wasn't a single character that was likable","1471":"i kind of hate the descriptor coming of age but i guess that's largely what this is mixed with a heavy dose of noir illicit romance and a certain element of whodunit lots of ominous foreshadowing backshadowing since the events in question already happened from page one i have to admit that i developed a major crush on the protagonist who was kind of badass in a 1930s sort of way and devoured this one in about five seconds flat don't know if i would classify this as chicklit but i certainly think it would appeal more to ladies of a certain age particularly those who still harbor a certain post adolescent horse yen or really i just seem to go crazy for anything set in the jazz age","1472":"this was a nicely paced well written and interesting story all in all set in 1931 during the depression it's narrated by 16 year old thea atwell the disgraced daughter of a wealthy family in florida she is sent to a riding camp in north carolina where she lives for a year with 200 other girls and where she slowly unravels the 'series of events' that have caused her to be sent away i listened to the audio version and at first i wasn't enjoying the girl who was narrating she seemed flat and unconcerned but in retrospect adina verson was the perfect voice of thea as i was reading certain parts of this story i was put in mind of lolita another psychological story involving sexual promiscuity and an older man but this story has a provocative conflict and by the end thea has figured out how to survive the loss of her family and how to forgive herself this narration goes back and forth between the present 1931 at yonahlossee and the year before and what led to thea's banishment one of the stories told to thea by her parents is the story of her birth they were expecting a boy so when thea was born there was a subtle disappointment until her twin sam was born shortly after the author mentions a few times how thea's twin sam is always put first even the headmaster of the camp tells thea that she was the sacrificial lamb who was sent away in lieu of her twin what bothered me about this story was the undeveloped characters we are given hints about why thea's mother and father acted the way they did and why her twin only wrote her one letter in the year she was away the twin who she was so close to before the 'event' also thea and sam live isolated from other children their teacher is their father and they have no interactions with anyone outside the family except their aunt and uncle and their son georgie who are frequent visitors how protected how naive would they be i found it unbelievable that thea would be so worldly about sex and the male body the sex scenes aren't so much a description about a young girl and her first sexual encounter as much as graphic descriptions of sexual encounters between two eager and knowledgeable partners surely this is a story about the role of women in 1930's america women who aren't allowed to show an interest in sex and who must find out somewhere about it because it isn't talked about women girls who are encouraged to find a suitable man to marry and discouraged from impractical pursuits and have we really transcended these old attitudes i am curious to know how many people reading the story blamed thea and not georgie and how many absolved the headmaster from any wrong doing because clearly thea was the temptress who instigated the affair i have a feeling the author hinted at things that we the readers are supposed to figure out by what was said or not said and done or not done but in many cases i am left with trying to piece together subtleties that may have had a deeper meaning in the story i am left with a vague feeling that maybe i missed something important that would help me understand everyone's motivations","1473":"enjoyed it is quite explicit not for ya readers","1474":" normally like most men i would judge this book by the dust jacket and move on far too girlie for me the blurb tells me it is that it is for fans of the great gatsby so that would be me i was quitely surprised and moved by the storytelling in this debut novel by anton di sclafani the story takes us back to 1930s america in the midst of the depression and that how it touched some families but the underlying theme through out the book is of a very modern girl turning for a girl to a young women it shows her voyage of discovery from being a florida girl to a young women with the complication of hormones boys and family thea atwell our protagonist is sent in to exile from her home for the first 15 years of her life as a punishment and in disgrace and she has been sent to the yonahlossee riding camp for girls in north carolina it is only as the story opens up do we learn of the disgrace that she has brought up on herself and her family taking the blame for what had happened between her twin brother and her cousin as she learns about her role in the tragic events in her family for the first time in her life she has to fit in to a social strata of wealthy girls which like today is ordered by money and beauty but throw in to this story equestrienne prowess she learns about herself and her needs which while conforming she does not want to fit so easily the story covers her year at yonahlosse and her yearning to go home into the mix brings new friends new feelings teenage crushes and above all family a wonderful story told well and you are willing the best for thea a totally engrossing story that even us males will enjoy","1475":"interesting book but not great the trick of telling the reader something awful happened and then teasing with bits and parts over the course of the book felt cheap and i was let down my the ending worth reading though","1476":" really more of a 1 5 i didn't mind the writing style which other reviewers seem to have disliked i always find it so hard to review a book when i don't like the main character thea is a stupid selfish girl who basically ruins her life and the lives of others by wanting and getting something that she should never have had she has plenty of chances to learn from her mistakes but instead just hurries onto her next mistake not giving a damn about the consequences i thought that in the end she might realize the error of her ways but no she just continues to be selfish as if the world revolves around thea she is an unlikeable character and i really didn't care what happened to her though i pitied the victims of her terrible behavior","1477":" pretty vague spoilers ahead if you are a purist you may want to avoid i enjoyed the atmosphere of this book and all the scenes dealing with horses i'm not sure that i would recommend it though at some point it starts to feel a little heavy and over thought and i think disclafani comes to rely too much on sex scenes to move the story along in the end i just didn't enjoy the plot very much and the characters weren't really engaging enough to make up for it the author also really glosses over a majorly horrifying moral problem which was really frustrating that said i enjoyed the writing enough and disclafani's use of place and scenery that i'll probably read one of her future novels a lot of what i didn't love about this book can probably be attributed to its being a first novel","1478":"started out strong and then just got depressing","1479":"i don't think sexy is an appropriate adjective for this novel it was a fairly compelling coming of age story that dissects both the timeless difficulty of becoming a woman and the perpetual complications of one's own family but with more horses","1480":" there is something almost mystical and dreamlike about this book told in the first person thea is something of an unreliable narrator thea has spent her life cosseted by her family and its wealth surrounded only by close family members she has never had any contact with strangers before thea believes that she will only spend the summer at the yonahlossee riding camp for girls and although she finds it very strange suddenly thrust amongst a group of girls she has nothing in common with she welcomes the chance to go riding every day this is a coming of age story with a difference not only does thea discover things about herself she learns that beauty wealth and the ability to ride better than others can affect how people judge her thea longs for home and her family especially her twin brother sam she finds it difficult to understand the dress codes the behaviour of these pretty almost alien southern girls thea is not always the most pleasant of characters she often appears selfish and self centred but she is also determined and quite daring at times anton disclafani writes descriptive prose with ease from the southern countryside to the florida heat all beautifully drawn and very alluring her handling of adolescent girls' relationships is impressive detailing the jealously the closeness the adulation with ease this is a slow paced character rich novel that should be savoured for it's sense of place and fine detail the author has drawn upon her own childhood when writing this novel she grew up in florida and visited her family's cabin in the blue ridge mountains near the real yonahlossee","1481":"the characters were shallowly developed i especially didn't like the main character writing was choppy","1482":"this book was a solid attempt by a first time author and emory alum the writing sometimes felt contrived and the dialogue a bit stilted but i barely put it down for two days it is a troubled coming of age story and offers a compelling narrative","1483":"loved this book","1484":"a story to lose yourself in a story to lose yourself ini chose this book to read for three reasons it is set largely near asheville nc it concerns the experience of attending a girls only boarding school and all that brings it was on the ny bestseller list last yea rit did not disappoint and held me in its grip during the busy days it took me to finish it loved it","1485":"i really struggled to finish this book and really only read until the end because i don't like to abandon a book in the middle this story was incredibly odd and very slow","1486":"i won a free copy from the goodreads first reads giveaway program and think that it interesting i would recommend it to everyone","1487":"this book isn't going to go down in history as being particularly original in subject matter or tone but i still enjoyed it it covered a lot of the bases i value in fiction horses coming of age 1920's 30's setting a firebrand female lead the south the blue ridge mountains a smattering of racy scenes that fit the book and weren't gratuitous i would recommend this book","1488":" set against the beautiful background of the blue ridge mountains in blowing rock north carolina this interesting debut novel tells a rather poignant story of lost innocence in the story of fifteen year old thea atwell who has been sent away from her parents and her twin brother sam to the eponymous yonahlossee riding camp for girls the reason why she has been uprooted from her family in florida is only implied however as the story unfolds the reason for thea's banishment is revealed in tantalising glimpses the languor of the 1930's and the dreaminess of a bygone age is encapsulated in the almost surreal atmosphere of the riding camp where some of the girls ride sedate horses by day and yet sneak away to illicit assignations under cover of darkness throughout the narrative there is an underlying sexual tension which is made all the more evocative by the gradual revealing of thea's involvement in a scandal of epic proportions overall i enjoyed the descriptions of life at this rather strange boarding school which in many ways reminded me of the enid blyton boarding school stories i so enjoyed as a young teenager but obviously this books' more adult theme set a more risque tone to the story my thanks to real readers for my review copy of this book","1489":"i was hesitant to read this book given the divided reviews but i'm glad i did i found it beautifully written at times poetic a reminder of how 'messy' life is and how complex the dance of interpersonal relationships are","1490":"while at first i enjoyed the book as it went on the 'secret' became much more obvious though with a small twist it was a nice summer read but i'm glad i didn't spend money on it","1491":"this review has been hidden because it contains spoilers to view it click here being an avid horse lover and rider i really wanted to love this book the writing was excellent the descriptions rich and i read through it quickly i had a difficult time with thea and ended up not liking her very much not only did i not care for her obsession with her cousin and mr holmes there were times where she was cruel to sasi u0026amp naari i find that unacceptable","1492":" i debated giving this 2 stars but have decided that 1 is fair after finishing this book i said out loud yuck i don't understand why this book has received so much praise i don't get it thea a wealthy 15 year old living in florida is sent to a remote boarding school in north carolina because of a family scandal i kept reading this mainly to find out what the scandal was and it is revealed painstaking slowly the main problem thea is a completely un likeable character even cutting her some slack because of her age and her apparent childhood spent in total isolation with her parents and twin brother on a 1 000 acre citrus farm she continues to make terrible decisions that have a wide affect on those around her selfish doesn't quite describe her behavior despite lengthy professions of love for her parents and twin brother her actions belie her words double yuck for the family scandal including her parents whose primary concerns are clearly not for their daughter especially as she's a minor and despite the truly terrible consequences of the family disgrace thea continues down a merry path of creating more scandal to be fair some of this was interesting the timing during the start of the great depression and the daily lives of the young girls living at the riding camp and i don't have fault with the writing style but the story and thea are just well yucky","1493":"very cliched and embarrassing to read at times i finished to find out what the reason was she was sent away it wasn't really such a humdinger after all and what kind of a super slut was she really awful i felt badly for the 'portly' mistress of the camp who was 'saddled' with such a loser for a husband","1494":"i don't have anything nice to say about this book i cannot believe the way sex was used in this book i don't know if i'm a prude or what but oh my god so unnecessary this is a very bad coming of age tale very very bad i wanted to love it i love reading about horses","1495":" the synopsis of the book turns out to be more intriguing than the book itself i had high hopes to read about complicated relationships between girls at a boarding school how families endured the depression to find out what a riding camp was all about etc instead we get a good glimpse into the life of a girl who hasn't been taught that pleasure is sin and gets herself into some trouble because of this but shows no remorse because of this the main character is not the most likable but does invoke some sympathy would have given it three stars if not for the sex","1496":"overall the writing was good good flow between fl and the camp leading up to why she was at the camp to begin with i struggled with the adolescent scenes of sexuality amongst the main characters it felt forced and awkward almost shades of grayish through a minors eyes so overall good certainly not great","1497":" yet another first novel that blew me away not a word out of place the author gets it all right descriptions of place the heat of florida the light of a summer evening the politics of teen girls the bond between twins a girl's feeling of powerlessness and then her first feelings of power etc this is a beautiful sensual heartbreaking novel with well rounded developed characters a strong sense of place and evocative emotional drama that any woman can relate to cannot wait to read more from this writer","1498":"i actually really enjoyed this i'm a horse person but there was just enough drama to add to the horse world the author's clearly intimate knowledge of horses was nice to see and kept me from being distracted from the story thea is pretty likable and i think we all sympathize with the rebellious streak of teenagers and the way that life sometimes seems like a series of events when you are growing up and sometimes even after you are grown","1499":"the yonahlossee riding camp for girls is one of the best books i have ever read it was so beautifully written the way it wove through past and present the main characters were all dynamic but even the secondary characters were developed this book did not only make me cry but it made my soul hurt it completely changed my perspective on life this is such a wonderful coming of age story","1500":"t i dont know if it was caused jus i am not sure what to think of this book nothing at all happened in first third of this book second third was overflowing with sexual scenes and finally in the last third there was the deeper stuff secondly i hated the horseriding scenes how could she possibly beat her beloved pony bloody just what and the scene where thea explains decca that whip is used for beating horses pure nonsense and i strongly disagree that horses are dumb they just aren't i don't know if it was caused just by mistranslation or things were that way in 30s but i simply didn't like it in some parts it looked like thea was looking at her teenage years through her older self like when she said something like we didn't wear helmets we weren't afraid of anything in those days then this retrospective or what dissapeared completely and appeared again at the very end the last but not least disturbing thing was thea's character she just refused to learn from her mistakes and kept repeating them i had the feeling she was quite the same at the beginning and at the end at the end she was just more socialised overally i consider this book a relaxing read for long winter evening but nothing that i would return to","1501":"interesting","1502":"a 2013 staff fiction favorite recommended by becky k and andrea read andrea's review https www goodreads com review show check our catalog http encore cooklib org iii encore riding camp for girls","1503":"beautiful book effortless to read but multilayered i never wants to lay it down it went everywhere with me till i finished","1504":"disgusting book on many levels what a bunch of disfunctional characters","1505":"3 5 stars the prose was choppy and not because of the flashback storytelling but i liked reading about the horses","1506":"i am one who likes to gulp down a book in a night or two but i stretched this one out for nearly a week so that i could savor the lush melancholy atmosphere of this novel this book is not a romance nor is it a book with a particularly sympathetic protagonist however to me those things made it both more unique and more real thea the narrator does not always make good choices do things for the right reasons or get along with the authority figures in her life although thea's situation in the book is connected to its historical context and rather scandalous tragic i think that thea's emotions are true to what many people experience in their growing up years the author captured thea's feelings of loss regret self awareness guilt and invincibility in such an honest way this book will stay with me for a long time","1507":"this book is so beautifully written it is hard to believe it is a first novel beautiful headstrong thea atwell is sent to the yonahlossee riding camp fir girls as a punishment her transgression is slowly revealed this is a novel about families the depression and coming of age in the '30's","1508":"this was a 4 plus star until the reveal from the reveal on about 20% of the book the narrator lets us know everything we should have taken from the book with little character and no story development what a shame as the book does a wonderful job of talking about what it was like to be a young women of privilege in the midst of the depression and the sexual mores of the time","1509":"clever enough storyline but could not get past some of the writing style and technique so i could truly enjoy stilted and forced although i finished it to find out how thea fared","1510":"i really enjoyed this book i was confused by mr holmes role in the story but i understand now that he was the turning point in the way thea viewed herself the ending was neatly done but i had hopes to glean a little more about thea's actual future rather than the vague references when everyone else was given a concrete ending","1511":"i wanted to love this i was grossed out by some of it and not really touched by parts i should have been invested in i got annoyed half way through","1512":" a lovely sensual debut novel for me thea atwell was easy to invest in even with all of her flaws mainly because of them and her sexual awakening and self discovery in the early days of the great depression made for an enjoyable read the details enmeshed in her experiences on the horse when she's riding both her pony at home and her horse at the yonahlossee camp are so vivid that you feel that you too are an accomplished horsewoman and you can see how she's able to leave her troubles behind each time she climbs into the saddle it does start a little slow as you're not told what exactly thea has done to be sent away to yonahlossee but once she dives into those memories i was glad i stuck with the book","1513":"it was meh took a long time to tell the story i was very let down by this book","1514":"i read it in less then 2 days it was ok the ending was dials appointing although it was a quick easy read there wasn't too much substance to the book","1515":" quite the page turner this novel set in the early 1930's in northern florida and an ashville n c camp boarding school for horse loving moneyed well bred high spirited but sometimes misbehaving like the main character complicated 15 year old thea girls of the south the author does a good job of keeping your interest both by alluding to a scandal yet to be revealed that occurred at the isolated 1 000 acre florida estate where thea grew up with her beloved twin odd mom and kindly doctor dad that landed thea at yonahlosee and promising adventures and yes more scandal to come the novel also gives you a good feel for the privileges and limitations facing young women of this era and offers interesting insights into the pecking order at least in the 1930s among horsey women in the south the memphis girls were among the elite and into the disruption the great depression caused to these rich girls lives horrors some even had to give up their beloved horses the novel was also quite the bodice ripper i should add with some saucy scenes","1516":"wow i won the yonahlossee riding camp for girls in the giveaways and i am so glad i did this book has kept me completely engrossed from the beginning to the end very well done","1517":"wow while this book seemingly began with an innocent 15 y o girl it soon became quite compelling and riveting as it is a coming of age book this teenager is far beyond her years in her thinking and actions it's a good read i enjoyed it","1518":"i never heard of this book before i saw it on a shelf in a small book shop i liked the idea of camp as a theme and setting for a story and as much as the camp is described and certainly in an era where camp was a much different experience it turns out it is not a camp by my definition turns out it is a school or something like that never got a grasp of what exactly was going on there which is one my criticisms of the book the setting was described but i never got a feeling for it nor did i get a real feeling for the characters with the exception of holmes and georgie thea's brother sam also kind of get left out he was vague and veiled and as he plays an important role in the plot it was disappointing that we never heard from him much the scandal that brings thea to the camp gets a huge build up but we all know what happens we can guess it was rather anti climatic when it is finally revealed i really wanted to like this book but i was left a bit disappointed for all the accolades for the author and my goodness she had editors agents etc the writing was so so the characters were not compelling the setting of the camp was not interesting i was way more interested in the florida wilderness of thea's home","1519":"i was hooked in the beginning but the plot simply didn't develop as much as i'd hoped the ending felt like the author wasn't sure where to go and had to wrap it up however possible it was a quick read but just didn't live up to my expectations","1520":"certainly a page turner one i couldn't put down but probably wouldn't pick up a second time it riveted me i was absorbed into the story for the life of the book but it didn't soak into me as soon as the last page was turned the plot melted away and i was ready to move on to other things as this is a starting novel i'm quite looking forward to seeing more from this author","1521":"the writing in this book was gorgeous the action moved slowly though and while the slow reveal of the circumstances that led to thea's removal from her home and arrival at the camp was effectively done at times it seemed like the book needed something more however upon finishing it's a really beautiful book to reflect upon lots of connections and parallels that aren't at first obvious i really enjoyed it","1522":"disappointing expected to see the development of the character from injured to femme fatale instead it seems like the older version of the character who occassionally injects flash back style analysis into the narrative hasn't yet decided if there was anything she learned about it all she occassionally sounds as though she's defending one of her own poor choices of youth then she abandons her position of judgement","1523":" this is the story of a girl who is sent by her family to a boarding school during the 1930s she is sent there because of some unnamed terrible reason and much of the story involves discovering what that terrible reason was at the same time the girl starts to define herself on her own terms at the school while entering into an illicit relationship with an inappropriate person the blurbs on the front and back cover of this book describe the story as sexy however i thought both the problem that sent the girl to the boarding school in the first place and the illicit relationship at the school were for the lack of a better word icky the icky ness interfered with my ability to really consider the coming of age themes in this book there is also horse stuff here lots of it but if you want to give this to your horse loving teen please think twice due to the above mentioned icky ness","1524":" sigh i was so excited to find this at the library but it was a disappointment to read the cover is beautiful and i couldn't wait to disappear into a world of early 20th century wealth and privilege for a while but it was a disappointment mystery surrounds 16 year old thea atwell when she arrives late in the season to the yonahlossee riding camp for girls in the mountains of nc slowly the story unfolds about her life of isolation in florida where the only people she was around were her immediate family mom dad twin brother sam and her aunt and uncle and cousin who made periodic visits from gainesville you expect thea to grow from her banishment from the family become a better person learn from her mistakes perhaps but she doesn't she's incredibly naive and stays that way no personal growth no desire to become a better person she lives every moment in the moment she does reflect back on the past but she doesn't look forward she brushes off the depression and it's effects on other girls within the camp some families lose everything and the girls have to be sent home she's very glib just looked that up to be sure it was what i meant to say and the definition is fluent and voluble but insincere and shallow perfect description just didn't like her didn't like the book or the writing of the odd sexual situations she got herself mixed up in with no consequences i certainly wouldn't market this book to the young adult audience i as an adult didn't understand thea's personality her family dynamics or the rationale behind thea's actions just an odd book i really think this book is an excellent example of when a book should tell the story though sam's eyes as well as thea's he seems to be a more in depth character than thea we","1525":"i went to a very horse centric women's college in the blue ridge mountains so i expected to love this book sadly i did not thea is not a terribly likable narrator and her actions throughout the book show her to be continually selfish and immature the horseback riding parts of the book lacked veracity and i felt like overall it was a depressing read definitely not what i'd hoped for","1526":"the main character thea vacillates between being powerless and being the one with all the power someone should slap her for being a snotty self absorbed bitch i didn't love this book but it did draw me in","1527":"this is a thought provoking well written book that avoids cliche i found it disturbing at times but in a way that made me challenge my own assumptions i wouldn't recommend it for the historical fiction aspect the start of the depression is used more a as a backdrop literary device and readers won't learn anything new about the time period","1528":"this review has been hidden because it contains spoilers to view it click here i'm on page 62 but i am utterly bored by this novel and don't think i can stomach another page i was trying to get it a good shot because it was a christmas gift--in hardcover besides--but i just don't think i can manage it's just drivel a whining narrator who says the title of the book the yonahlosse riding camp for girls just about a billion times per page who wants to be popular yet also unnoticed at her new camp school who was sent away from her childhood home and family including h i'm on page 62 but i am utterly bored by this novel and don't think i can stomach another page i was trying to get it a good shot because it was a christmas gift--in hardcover besides--but i just don't think i can manage it's just drivel a whining narrator who says the title of the book the yonahlosse riding camp for girls just about a billion times per page who wants to be popular yet also unnoticed at her new camp school who was sent away from her childhood home and family including her twin brother sam due to a scandal at this point i'm not even sure i care what the scandal was i can guess from the vague hints the narrator gives that the narrator probably slept with some boy and is pregnant or is viewed as ruined 1930s american south and that her twin brother got into a fight with his sister's mysterious lover i really don't care to read anymore i was wholly dismayed to realize this book was nearly 400 pages and at page 62 i have only a little idea of the narrator's-thea--role in the whole scandal i have not connected with thea or any of the other characters i think reading this book is a waste of my time more","1529":"some good reviews and promise but didn't love it not my cup of tea","1530":" i loved the detailed descriptions of the two lush landscapes the north carolina blue ridge mountains and an orange plantation in northern florida and the time in us history they were such detailed known settings as always i love coming of age stories the main character thea after being banished to an elite equestrian boarding school mirrors the same behavior in her new home as in her childhood home and the inappropriateness of her sexual conduct and the shame she lives with was disappointing i didn't want her to feel powerless and blameless the writing was so compelling when she wrote about the complexities of family loneliness and horses with that said sitting on the beach so many women stopped and commented that they loved the book and i have to admit there were so many bits to love","1531":"i really liked this book","1532":"i enjoyed this book even though some whacked out stuff happens the bad reviews surprised me","1533":"a coming of age book during 1931 during a challenging period of time in a young girls life having to find her way through her sexuality without any knowledge liked the pace of the book along with the way the author handles the topic i feel for the young lady and i find myself having no sympathy for her parents","1534":" as i was slogging my way through this book i noticed that curtis sittenfeld author of prep had praised this book i thought no wonder really the yonahlossee riding camp for girls is just prep with horses i kept reading the ever dull prep to see what all the fuss was about i kept thinking surely there must be something to this book there wasn't by the way i learned my lesson this time anton disclafani does himself a favor by teasing the reader with thea's banishment our curiosity is piqued because we want to know what on earth she did finally though i had to give up i didn't care enough about thea perhaps the book world's most under developed main character of all time to slog through the over blown prose and under plotted story to find out disclafani thinks that if he tells us thea is passionate and interesting we will take his word for it his writing is the anti example for the show them don't tell them writing maxim finally i just put the book aside and looked for goodreads reviews spoilers now i know what thea did and i am thrilled i didn't spend any more time on this over marketed ho hum book","1535":"let me be clear this book is full of sex i read it late at what seemed to be late at night on my bottom bunk by headlamp at family camp this summer i kept feeling like my counselor might catch me reading and then realize what i was reading about","1536":"not a great book disappointing from the very beginning thea atwell is set to this riding camp because of something that happened at home while at the camp she has an affair with the director and we find out she was sent to camp because of a sexual relationship with her cousin what way over the top","1537":"this book was not at all what i was expecting but i read it quickly and didn't want to put it down it was interesting to watch the main character mature and the last few pages really get you thinking about life love child rearing families and upbringings","1538":"the big secret was so easy to guess thea was very hard to like maybe if you love horses you will enjoy this book more than i did also very undeveloped characters throughout at same time i did read it quickly so good bus read","1539":" another absolutely wonderful book that i discovered by chance as i was on a southwest flight and used their wifi to access entertainment i started reading the several free pages of this book that i found there and then had to buy the whole thing i was so engrossed i love the time period around the early depression and the coming of age piece of the story however i adore horses i was one of those girls who rode daily and the idea of a camp like this in the blue ridge mountains sounds idyllic to me","1540":"started out really well but then became very predictable about half way through","1541":"could not get into the melodrama meh","1542":"i listened to this on a long drive and actually think it might be better that way where the narrator sounded as if she were the main character as it is told in first person i felt like i was hearing her tell me her story good not great what i liked was the story of this odd on clave of girls from wealthy families in the depression i'm indifferent about horses and actually enjoyed hearing about the connection between horse and rider as well","1543":"a stunning debut and a compelling read that i did not want to end this story of a 15 year old girl's initiation into adulthood moves between the present and past the pacing of the horrible event that led to the girl's being sent away from home is perfect creating both tension and suspense the narrative voice is distinct the prose is pure and clean and the author handles technique like an old pro there is a transformation in the character but it is neither or sugar coated","1544":"a fabulous summer read i could not put this book down for so many reasons i could not wait to find out exactly why thea was sent away and i couldn't believe what she did while she was away disclafani writes in a way that allows you to both love and hate thea i felt so sad for sam from beginning to end not a way that i want to think of boy girl twins growing up for that reason this was also a very uncomfortable read for me","1545":"i can't say this one did anything for me rich selfish clueless people who don't seem to learn from their mistakes","1546":"young girl has sex with her cousin in 1930s florida is sent to a riding camp as a punishment stupid premise stupid writing stupid situations","1547":"it would have gotten 4 stars if it hadn't been so obvious what was going to happen and what was going to happen was just stupid","1548":" at the end of this book i was left feeling confused i enjoyed it but once i was thinking about things when i was done i started to feel there were definite problems another reviewer called this the dirty dancing of the depression era although i can see that in some ways thea is certainly no gentile innocent like baby the book hints early on at what thea's secret was but i wasn't expecting for things to end up being described so vividly and then around the same time her discretions at home are being described she's committing even worse discretions at camp also described vividly the character is constantly presented throughout the novel in two different ways the poor naive innocent who doesn't know how the world works and the sneaky devious femme fatale who will get exactly what she wants regardless of hurting other people or animals it's impossible to like a character that is written in this way i'm not sure if that was the authors intent or if she just wrote a very confusing character","1549":"this was an awful book the characters were cardboard the library lists it as suspense fiction to me the only suspense was would the writing become any better the more you read","1550":"the language of flowers","1551":"beautifully written really quick and absorbing read","1552":"vacation read really enjoyed this sweet coming of age story of a privileged girl set in the south on the even of the great depression a tender but non moralizing take on a young woman's sexuality and consequences of her actions didn't love how the bad thing that happened was drawn out and out over the book","1553":" this is really a very good book about an adolescent girl who is sent away to camp and school during the depression because of a series of unfortunate events in her family it is disturbing and sad in ways and very interesting in other ways this is sometimes described as a thriller because you don't really find out about what exactly the final traumatic family event was until almost the end of the book i got very tired of that and thought it detracted from the more literary aspects of the novel","1554":" this is anton disclafani debut novel i was keen to read this book as the cover intrigued me and took me back to my childhood books would this be a mix of boarding school and pony club books and yes it had reminisces of these running through the book i was not sure reading this what age group this was intended for this is a frank novel about a 15 year old girl from a middle class background in the 30s who arrives at the yonaholssee riding school something has happened to this girl at home but at the beginning the reader is searching for answers the reader is let into the reasons why as the book moves on it is interesting to read of florida at time and rural america during the depression the attention to detail during this period impressed me this is both moving and bittersweet and i would recommend this book - i did enjoy reading it i will look out for this author and seek out her next book","1555":" the yonahlosse riding camp for girls which i won from goodreads giveaways is a provocative and haunting novel set in the 1930's during the depression it is the story of fifteen year old theodora atwell who is rejected by her family after a tragic incident that will haunt her throughout the year she spends at a riding school for girls emerging from the confines of a restrictive and overprotective family she is cast into the social rigours of a new social order that will change her life forever theo atwell is a determined passionate and fearless character which leads her into making decisions that will cost her reputation and possibly destroy the family of one she loves anton disclafani draws all her characters with ardent realism sissy theo's best friend at camp is somewhat naive affable and good natured her riding competition lenora aloof and cold to many and boyish mr holmes her love interest is torn apart by deep seeded longings all the girls hold tight to their secrets even mary abbott who must hide her sexual strangeness intertwined within a story that is centered around the love of horses are elements of friendship heartbreak loyalty and self sacrifice as theo struggles with her sense of identity a loss that haunts her and her relationship with her family told through theo's memories letters from her family and general prose anton disclafani weaves a story that grips the reader from the first page to the end","1556":" this book is written well and very readable it is told by theo a 15year old narcissistic horny teenage girl or should i just say a teenage girl i think a 15 year old could identify with her feelings and observations but story is told with so many sexual details don't think parents would want their daughters reading this book kind of an odd book had the backdrop of the depression life in florida and blue ridge mountains numerous relationships mother daughter twins cousins horses boarding school friends it kept me hooked just didn't care for this mean girl who thought the world revolved around her","1557":"this review has been hidden because it contains spoilers to view it click here my day job is dealing with sex offenders so i expect i saw the lead character as less of a vixen and more of a victim she wanted to seem so in control of her choices but young girls so rarely really are","1558":"it was okay held my interest while reading but i can't say i ever warmed to it or its characters throughout i had an urge to roll my eyes a little bit the drama was just so dramatic","1559":"too many predictable moments for this debut ride of a novel","1560":"most people i spoke with either did not like this book or didn't finish it i actually really liked it","1561":"not my favorite relied on a lot of sex to fill out time and ending left a lot to be desired not my cup of tea","1562":"interesting lacking spark","1563":"it was a good read and i had to see how it ended but i did find it disturbing","1564":"what a sad story a young girl born before her time","1565":"i don't know what internet list recommended this book to me but it just wasn't my style","1566":" i am enjoying listening to this audio recording of a young girl thea sent away from the only family she has known to a camp for girls because she made a mistake a mistake many eyes should have seen and did not as they were family and families just don't do that to each other or at least they aren't supposed to i was empathetic with thea's story but then i was critical as she was so selfish in her wants and desires crossing many moral lines of honesty and self worth thea didn't consider others who might be hurt by her actions as she was so self centered but then again she was never taught how to behave except with family so the fault is not all hers i have not finished it yet so perhaps she will redeem herself at the conclusion so far it doesn't look like it this was recommended by a friend from my reading group and she was spot on i am enjoying it especially as an audio book","1567":"i would have given this 2 5 if possible the whole time i was reading this i was thinking stupid stupid stupid girl her big secret is completely obvious from the title of the book i give this a big meh","1568":"clearly i'm all about moody books this summer i didn't live this but it was a quick read","1569":"this review has been hidden because it contains spoilers to view it click here i debated about whether this is a 2 or 3 star book thus 2 5 stars i found the story line somewhat disturbing which i guess the author wanted although i know it happens it bothered me that a headmaster would engage in sexual relations with a 16 year old student and don't get me started on the cousin i also never understood girls fascination with horses","1570":"there was so much i loved about this book and it hooked me right from the start that being said there were things i really hated as well and that surprised me given such a strong start the two scandals seemed so highly inappropriate in both cases it was a disappointment that she couldn't at least have made thea make bad choices that were at least understandable","1571":" i was intrigued by this novel but not sure what to think upon completing it it is a coming of age novel set in the 1930's thea the main character is sent to a boarding school after a family incident but while there falls upon the same mistakes not sure what lesson she was to learn and kept reading to find out i found the ending to be unsatisfactory i think more character development of the mother and why she behaves the way she does would have made for a better resolution 4 stars because i kept with it","1572":"i was very disappointed in this book i had read some good reviews and the book started off very intriguing but it fell flat","1573":"i wanted thea to be a heroine in this story but her twisted relationship with mr holmes ruined it for her and me beautifully written i lived for the scenes of citrus groves and of her childhood home i was really saddened by her family's dissolving relationship what's up with that","1574":"this book i hated very depressing not well written with no vocabulary included this is a book that i found to be to sexually orientated to the point that i didn't think highly of the story line or the main character i won't go into details but for me i found this novel to be obtuse and strange","1575":"i'm really not a big fan of coming of age stories but i was surprised at how much i enjoyed this book i enjoyed it as much as i did because i loved the main character thea atwell disclafani writes in a stunning and clear manner and sees the details in things that we are too busy to note but should see thea is driven by her passions each seems so simple a boy a family a skill a friend but when they intersect the complexity of her world is rendered to the reader in shattering clarity the book lagged in its pacing for me but finished strong it helps that the book is written in the first person creating an intimacy in reading it it is on the strength of its final pages and the perspective given on the events that really carried the book for me","1576":" so glad to be done with this story the criticisms poor character development of many characters and a few very flat characters e g thea georgie mr holmes and so many others as a reader i enjoy being immersed in the characters' stories this wasn't the case in this book i despised the main character and her family 'situation' especially when so many people were suffering from the depression i suppose one could say this is an example of such a suffering but not i just a wealthy shallow group trying to cover up indiscretions as an fyi i read this for a book club not a choice i would normally read","1577":"yet another pick from the too good to miss shelf at the library i enjoyed reading it but it was certainly a let down after 'the orchardist ' it's not going to linger in my mind for a long time but i did find the concepts of responsibility to other people vs living life just for yourself interesting i thought the narrator was really self absorbed and it seemed excusable because she's young maybe it's an accurate portrait of being young there was lots of horse riding and no horses were seriously injured in this book rebecca there was also more sex than necessary and that doesn't generally pose a problem for me","1578":"this review has been hidden because it contains spoilers to view it click here wednesday group","1579":"i loved this book it is a good read for anyone especially anyone who knows horses a good read but you will be depressed at the end its not sad just depressing a dark coming of age story","1580":"it was decent with some parts making me want to read more still much of it had predictable parts","1581":"the story of a teenage girl in 1930 who is sent away to a very exclusive finishing school riding academy because of some trouble she gets into at home there is a real presence to this book and the tale it tells the social intricacies of a camp of mostly privileged girls the power of sexual romantic longing the complicated interactions of families it has stayed with me even after i finished it","1582":"i'm glad i read this book i loved it beautifully written i could hardly put it down","1583":"the editor in me was annoyed at the overuse and misuse of commas the reader in me ended the book feeling conflicted yes the main character was complex and the book has the theme of atonement but it was really difficult to like many of the main characters in this story flawed yes dysfunctional yes glad they aren't my family yes","1584":"spoilers a dark coming of age tale i can't say i didn't enjoy this book i did but it was slow at times the story is so simple that it really could have been told in about half the amount of words a teenaged girl lives completely isolated on an estate in florida with only her immediate family parents twin brother and visits from relatives she develops a sexual relationship with her older cousin here the book tries to mysteriously weave whatever bad thing happened because of sex into her currently story which was about her being sent to a riding camp to be isolated from her family and be punished for whatever happened as you read the book you get flashbacks ultimately you find out that thea had sex with her cousin and her brother and cousin fought about it and her brother hit her cousin in the head with a rifle and he was badly hurt details no you won't get them but he lived til he was 25 having fits of anger and then died this thea points out is fortunate because of the fact he died so much later than the accident her brother could not be pinned for murder they are a lucky family they are a dysfunctional family and reading this book is kind of like peeking into a family that is way more screwed up than yours but you just can't pinpoint what is wrong with them but you know something is wrong why thea's parents would want to punish her when they kept her completely isolated from other people her entire life and yet with her father and educated man a doctor neither of her parents seemed to understand that young people will do what young people are curious about and sex is part of that there were plenty of signs she was involved with her cousin but her parents turned a blind eye but of course she needs to be punished she's a girl isn't she it's her fault she had sex so off she is sent to a camp with other rich girls to ride horses and become socially adapted in an institutional type setting here thea spurns the healthy and normal advances of boys her age and goes for the headmaster yes she has sex with him too but she likes this much more than with her cousin in the end thea figures out how to finagle her way back home to her dysfunctional parents and brother who are now living in a rich hotel in orlando florida they sold the estate and her pony the family is scarred by her sexuality the novel ends with thea firmly planted in the north at a rich girls boarding school riding and working with horses she made it through puberty thea never shows much conscience or a dawning about right or wrong she never really leaves the psychological valley her family set up for her which is rather sad and makes the novel a bit more boring that had she left it","1585":"this book is beautifully written i found myself rooting for the main character to make a better choices the consequences of her actions affect so many and she seems to remain relatively unscathed","1586":"good summer read","1587":"i love the way she describes central florida and the blue ridge mountains","1588":"wouldn't recommend to read disappointed after reading especially after seeing it on so many summer reading lists","1589":"strange but interesting and well written not what i expected and a lot of weird sexual exploration interesting exploration of family relationships","1590":" i really wanted to love this novel and did for about the first half while i still enjoyed the rest of the novel the minimal characterization of henry holmes bothered me since he seemed to be thea's main and only focus i felt we should have understood his motivations more i could accept not getting much more than surface observations about the other yohnalossee girls since thea was mostly unconcerned and unobservant of anything that didn't directly affect her situation but since holmes was her obsession we should have understood him more deeply as a character what i enjoyed most about this book was the character study of thea atwell a narcissistic and self destructive girl on the brink of adulthood i felt that her sexual relationship at yohnalossee was mostly unbelievable considering what we discover about her experiences at home and parts of the novel felt a bit harlequin romance to me i was very impressed by curtis sittenfeld's review of the novel and wish that i had found it as lush and vibrant as she did or as fascinating as her novel prep which yonahlossee has been compared to since it's publication","1591":"beautiful language i didn't want this book to end thea is such an amazing character a real girl with real appetites problems challenges this book made me want to get on a horse","1592":"disclafani evokes a lush dreamy world one that feels both alluring and authentic the character at the center of it all is both fierce yet tender naive yet full of the world combinations that unwind themselves gorgeously","1593":"at the age of fifteen thea atwell is sent off to a summer camp in the mountains of north carolina however readers do not find out why until the story starts to unravel the camp is called yonahlossee riding camp for girls and it is an equestrienne boarding school for southern debutantes the story is set in the blue ridge mountains which is very close to my childhood home the book is set in 1930 and the great depression is taking its effect on thea's family but as she travels to the rural mountains of north carolina readers will understand that something else has uprooted thea's family roots something that thea may have had a hand in what did she do why did she deserve banishment to this remote summer school you have to follow alongside thea as she tells you her story to find out i would definitely call this a mature coming of age story most coming of age stories give us a younger character who is slightly immature and annoying at times or at least make terrible decisions while some of thea's decisions are terrible she is still a mature character with a grasping voice and point of view this book is written from her perspective and allows readers to dive into her life at the riding camp while slowly learning what happened that put thea so far away from home i enjoyed the flashbacks look into thea's family and past and i felt that it was better experienced this way instead of if it were happening right in front of my eyes this book deals with a lot of sexual tension issues and experiences most of them are of course thea's thea really learns a lot about herself while she is away at summer camp she has time to reflect on what she did that hurt her family and got her sent there in the first place this book is not to be taken lightly because of all the sexual undertones this is a teenager's first experience of freedom and coming alive i enjoyed see thea grow and learn how to control herself and best of all follow her heart a copy of this book was sent to me by the publishers at riverhead books in exchange for my honest review","1594":"really enjoyed this sexy coming of age book fast read and she painted a vivid picture of the time and place","1595":"a book i tried to like more that i actually did there was a definite problem with the pacing for me i saw what the author was trying to do but i saw all of the strings too it simply took too long and had repetition that didnt' serve the story well i also did not buy that thea had such sexual prowess for a girl who was sheltered her whole life i may have enjoyed this more if i were a horse girl i'm not sure i think that it needed quite a bit of tightening up","1596":"loved thea","1597":"spoilers i have conflicting feelings about this book while i enjoyed reading it and it was an easy read i had maaaajor problems with some of the characterizations and plot points for one thing the author seemed to have a lot of trouble with writing characters as their actual age most of them read too young to me and the biggest issue i had was with mr holmes i just didn't find it believable that he would let thea get that close to him in the first place let alone have an affair with her it seemed out of his character for most of the book i found myself rooting for thea even though everyone else thought she was pretty awful but that changed by the end i had wanted her to be okay because i liked that she was recognizing how unfair the sexual double standards in her society were but then she went along with it anyway and she just seemed to have no empathy whatsoever i don't regret reading it but i wouldn't read it again or recommend it to anyone","1598":"read this for a bookclub disliked there wasn't anyone in our club that enjoyed it i was disgusted while reading it when i finally came to the end it seemed as though the writer tried to sum it up too quickly as though trying to meet a deadline would not recommend it to anyone i know","1599":"i received this book for free from a goodreads first reads giveaway some parts of the book seemed long and drawn out but overall an enjoyable read i liked how the ending fast forwarded to tell how the characters lives played out years after the story","1600":"started promisingly but weaker as it progressed","1601":"darkly written coming of age story the main character thea is not very likeable and very much self centered though i think that being self centered is the norm for most young girls of this age 15 16 the prose is very descriptive and the story keeps you guessing concerning the mystery event that compels thea's parents to send her away to what is basically an equestrian based boarding school for young women despite not liking thea very much i found myself hoping that she would make better decisions and eventually get her young life back on track no i'm not telling","1602":" i knew from the minute i started this book that the story was going to completely envelope me the character of thea atwell strong willed intuitive pained sensual completely absorbed me into her being yonahlossee is the name of the camp to where thea is banished after a horrific family incident and where she ultimately comes of age while this is thea's story it is also a story about the people who love and raise us and what can happen when parents shield their children from outside influences and experiences how parents have the choice to allow or disallow the series of events in our lives to unglue us or make us stronger how in the end we can only experience life when we are away from our families and the people and things we grow up loving the most i was so privileged to receive a pre release copy of this book which will be available for purchase on june 4 2013 i can't do the book justice by what i say you must experience it for yourself","1603":"the story of a self centered spoiled young lady who get sent away as punishment for ripping her family apart to an exclusive riding school for young ladies and she then gets to ride horses all day long while sulking and taking deep breaths feeling so sorry for herself how could they","1604":"i have always been intrigued by stories about camp this story was no different anton disclafani does a great job describing what camp was like for thea atwell down to the greatest detail you get to know the girls servants and the family that owns the camp while examining the social structure of money beauty and horses it examines the power that gossip can have and illustrates the secret that thea is keeping from everyone i enjoyed how the story progressed from beginning to end making me wait for the final clue of what happened with sam and georgie throughout the book thea examines who she is in relation to the world around her dealing with a family whom she does not know will accept her back after the tragedy that she thought she caused this is a great read it's sexy intriguing and suspenseful","1605":"pretty smutty and ridiculous but i did find myself wanting to pick it up a beach read","1606":"i'm not sure how to feel about this one the writing was beautiful and the scenery was gorgeous but the story was weird and kinda gross and i hated all the characters alas","1607":"dark coming of age story the lead character thea is pretty hard to like the big secret is pretty easy to figure out mostly well written with flashes of what the heck still enjoyed it though","1608":"for thea atwell the teenage heroine of anton disclafani's volatile debut novel the yonahlossee riding camp for girls camp is a punishment she's sent away following a family tragedy she unwittingly orchestrates and what she initially believes to be a season at riding camp \"a summer equestrian respite for young ladies since 1876 \" according to the book turns into a full year at an all girls boarding school in the north carolina mountains but even as tragedy swirls at the novel's periphery thea is separated from her twin and lifelong confidant sam her family has to sell their home life goes on there are dances and riding competitions and boys the latter perhaps most important because yonahlossee is a coming of age novel girls are sent to and then away from the camp for indiscretions with boys for being \"fast \" that kind of mistake spelled social ruination but in the n c mountains free of her family thea discovers \"that my life was full and rich and my own \"read my full review and interview with the author here","1609":"literary fiction with a world appeal","1610":"it looked so intriguing a period piece set in the 1930's a riding camp for upper elite girls from tony backgrounds there's an aura about such settings well this was a dud the characters lifeless and the strange story of taboo sex did not excite or add to the intrigue it was unpleasant reading so much buzz on this title but it's over hyped","1611":"i loved this because i spent three summers in a riding camp in montana","1612":"this book started so well it was well written and there was a mystery to be revealed and i had trouble putting it down unfortunately in the middle of the book the plot took a bad turn i stopped caring about the heroine and it was a struggle to even finish it","1613":" meandering and humorless occasionally some chapter had my full attention but when you're reading about view spoiler a 16 year old girl who slept with her cousin and a 31 year old married father not at the same time although i kind of want to write that book now hide spoiler you kind of expect something messy raw and honest and this book is not that this book is polished and bland and book club ready is it any shock then that this teenager who's had these involvements view spoiler summarizes in the last chapter that following the camp where she slept with a married adult she went home left her family to go up north got married herself and had kids hide spoiler a conventional ending for a girl who did unconventional things like where is the life in her not even a cold hearted adult would have the icy distance thea as written has from what she's done even as she acknowledges it","1614":"parts are nice although the woe be unto section at the very end felt a bit heavy handed to me there are some problems with pacing as well as conclusions reached that weren't necessarily earned given what the protagonist has experienced given her youth but a nice couple of evenings passed with it","1615":"this was a let down for me 2 5 stars i had to push through to finish","1616":"i'd been waiting to review this until i could say something coherent but i can't the lives of the characters were interesting to me but the main character's sexcapades just made me feel icky at first i thought i felt that way because i thought the author was a man seriously all the way until i read the acknowledgments knowing that it was a woman gave me pause maybe i should see it as a girl taking control of her own sexuality but no it's still not okay she was given too much power and rather than empowering her it left her lost and without direction without a compass for her life so despite the horses and i did love the horses it gets three stars for it's otherwise disturbing nature","1617":"the worse book i ever read if i could give it a zero star i would this book is about nothing but something that is so psychotic so crazy so disgusting so desprett and so much more that have all the unpresentness not to mention she is so mean and has such a bad attitude and so unpresentness to be around she has no moral and i hope this is not a life of the author","1618":"this is a title i had heard good things about when it came out a year or so ago but just was never really driven to pick it up i'd glance at it consider reading it and then just kinda keep going so when it came to my turn to pick a book for book club i wanted to choose something i wouldn't actually pick up on my own this was the choice and i'm so glad it was this was not the type of book i was expecting i was expecting something fairly heavy literary and a little stuffy instead it was quick sexy engaging emotional an unexpected smart beach read if you will there was definitely more sex than i was expecting so be prepared for that but it led to a really interesting conversation with my book club buddies about leading a sheltered life what's normal what's not normal what makes people make the choices that they do i would recommend this for book clubs for sure a really nice surprise that became better after being able to discuss it with other women","1619":" perhaps the pieces are better than the whole but i really loved yonahlossee riding camp for girls the pieces a close knit family in florida lives an isolated but privileged life thea and sam are 15 year old twins womb buddies all their lives the depression hits and wealthy families are forced to redefine themselves thea commits an unspeakable act tragedy ensues and thea is banished to the riding camp she remains mostly apart in that setting excelling only in the equine arena again she becomes entangled in a web that this time threatens to disrupt her education and perhaps her future the resolution seems realistic and not completely predictable the whole sometimes the story events moved too swiftly too decisively too uncompromisingly too disjointedly the characters were somewhat flat but overall i found thea to be a worthy if flawed heroine engaged in a very troubled coming of age process i appreciated that the author was not judgmental and that she did not spare thea or her family from the devastation of their circumstances","1620":" just finished the yonahlossee riding camp for girls found it to be a fairly easy read read it over a couple of days kept reading the beginning to see just exactly what crime thea atwell had been sent to the riding camp after discovering the secret i wanted to blame her mother for living in paradise with her brother and having no clue what was going on then found out that she was a bit on the wild side herself but was able to get out of the situation i'm not sure why she needed the conquest of mr holmes but to realize that men or boys were just stepping stones did like the ending when she came back to the family and found that she would never fit into that family again would recommend this to book clubs as there are many discussable topics","1621":"loved it hope she writes another she gets it","1622":"i loved this book the writing was elegant and the plot was mercifully free of cliche i learned a lot about horses too an added fascination highly recommended for fans of laura moriarty and curtis sittenfeld who gave the book rave reviews","1623":"interesting book about the depression errorthis wasn't what i expected but it was well written about a girl shipped off to a girls school in the south","1624":"great read kept me engaged and excited to read the rest manageable length historical fiction that is fascinating","1625":"i was all excited to get my hands on this one but when i finally sat down to read i felt cheated and duped with his drab and predictable read one of the best reads for me is claire ange not as well publicized as this title but it is ingenious and hilarious comparing this to jane eyre the publishers must be desperate to make good on their investment don't be fooled check out claire ange you will love it i'm not kidding","1626":"i really enjoyed this one","1627":"not something i would have normally picked up at the library but it was a great story","1628":"$2 anyway i liked it a lot i did feel that thea's character was inconsistent at times but she's also a teenagers so that was natural even if it wasn't intentional i adored the setting both thea's isolated home growing up and yonahalossee both plac it seems i liked this book a lot more than most people on goodreads perhaps this is because they are all mentioning it being the it book of 2013 really i missed that and i picked it up at half priced book out of the clearance section for $2 anyway i liked it a lot i did feel that thea's character was inconsistent at times but she's also a teenagers so that was natural even if it wasn't intentional i adored the setting both thea's isolated home growing up and yonahalossee both places felt so completely fleshed out that i have detailed ideas of them in my head more than the characters inhabiting them i am enamored with southern gothic lit which this book nods to often and appreciated thea's point of view as an outsider but not really to the south as a floridian to me the plot took second place to the sense of place and world building i was of course very curious about the scandal that sent thea away and about the dynamics of her family but those who complain that nothing happened are i think missing some of the point i was in it to watch how thea grew up and why she made the choices she did i think the author gets an 80% on that front i would also compare this book to a great and terrible beauty by libba bray like gemma thea is a teenage girl coming of age after leaving a very isolating home both are forced to find their place in a rigid society both struggle though thea could have struggled a lot more i thought with the female friends acquaintances and enemies in their day to day lives at boarding school as a total gemma doyle lover i appreciated seeing some of that novel's themes play out here overall i would recommend it","1629":"this review has been hidden because it contains spoilers to view it click here i just can't decide what i think about this book first of all i knew so little about it that i spent almost the entire reading experience being shocked but i could not put it down i normally tire easily of teenage narrators but i was completely captivated by thea i can't really tell you why despite having a pretty strong voice filled with a real account of coming of age i didn't find her particularly likable i didn't find many characters likable actually and maybe that was my problem i just can't decide what i think about this book first of all i knew so little about it that i spent almost the entire reading experience being shocked but i could not put it down i normally tire easily of teenage narrators but i was completely captivated by thea i can't really tell you why despite having a pretty strong voice filled with a real account of coming of age i didn't find her particularly likable i didn't find many characters likable actually and maybe that was my problem but i actually think my problem was that i don't think dischlafani properly dealt with the sexual relationship thea had with an older man the book never made clear that the relationship was rape and it really bothers me yet as i said i couldn't stop reading it and that has to count for something right more","1630":"though there were a few parts of this book that might have moved a little more quickly overall i was very impressed with both the writing and the story telling","1631":"this kept me reading but i found the main character baffling self absorbed and reckless the biggest moral issue was not addressed","1632":"this book was just 'ok' in my opinion i think the author could have developed the storyline more...it was a good idea some authors have a knack for writing from the viewpoint of a young girl i e wally lamb but i don't think this author has developed that skill","1633":" anton discalafani has written a wonderful debut novel the yonahlossee riding camp for girls is a story about a young girl and her path to adulthood thea and sam are twins they all grew up together in an idyllic world in florida georgie is their cousin georgie's family is struggling with financial concerns during the depression however thea and sam's family help them a interesting situation occurred and thea was sent away to the yonahlossee riding camp for girls the coming of age book brings a story with an understanding of families and family relationships thea's growth of herself both physically and mentally is the story the incidence that started the family's dissolution is slowly revealed as thea's year at horse camp is chronicled the story is a study in how families can self destruct i think a four and a half star is a better rating i look forward to reading more of her books","1634":"i loved the first 2 3rds of this book the writing style really contributed to the storyline and i was thoroughly engaged but sadly it seemed to lose its way and i got bored i ended up skimming the last part because it was just a repetition of what went before i kept wondering if a more assertive editor might have saved what began as and should have been a satisfyingly good read","1635":"a fabulous read with a satisfying ending","1636":"great story highly recommend","1637":"leaned towards giving this 4 stars it's basically fluff but i found it page turning and quite lovely great beach vacation reading","1638":" i have mixed feelings about this book it was very well written and so was a pleasure to read in that sense the story begins with the main character's arrival at camp clearly in some sort of disgrace the rest of the book slowly reveals the story of why she was sent away this was interesting and definitely kept me reading however i did not appreciate some of the main themes of the book in fact i was somewhat disgusted also i did not think any of the characters learned from their experiences at least not what they should have learned","1639":" readers are borne back to the great depression with the yonahlossee riding camp for girls a novel set in the 1930's blue ridge mountains that features castaways at a boarding school and the girls rituals that are their becoming these women are sent to the boarding camp to become better or to be dealt with in a manner their parents didn't desire thea atwell our protagonist has stirred her families reputation and comfort at the risk of releasing spoilers i will only say that a terrible accident makes it impossible for anyone in her family to ever feel their slice of paradise is real again i wanted everything i was a girl i learned who got what she wanted but not without sadness not without cutting a swath of destruction so wide it consumed my family and almost me i almost fell into it with them i almost lost myself the atwell famiy is affluent on citrus money so thea's experience is far different than some girls would have been including the keep at yonahlassee boarding school who are less priveleged and hired from appalachian country there are scholarship girls who are less respected and must use smarts to hold their place in the mix all of the girls are here for a season be it a summer or years but they are in transition disclafani expresses this best when she refers to the girls as ghosts their artifacts shifting about the cabin to be found by other girls but none of them ever being able to claim the house as theirs they are temporary in a society where girls are kept in the country away from boys it is no surprise to the reader that a few of these girls will be overcome with loneliness and desire a recipe for risking everything disclafani's book is heartbreaking because we experience thea's banishment become real and her realization that her happiness is now entirely dependent on her every new risk presents a consequence and in a time where the fault falls squarely on the girl thea is surprised to find herself suddenly disinterested in the boys at dances but instead the possibility of her own independence thea is a surprising heroine a fallen girl who takes efforts to protect others but in modern times she would be like most of us including myself she had desires and her life was changed by them for better and worse a gorgeous first novel by anton disclafani it's atmosphere and seductive unravel held me like marilynne robinson's housekeeping the only fault is perhaps the plot could have been more surprising still the writing of female ritual horses beginning sexuality alongside complex character development was a spell i fell under i hope this book is an instant classic","1640":" i usually give a book about 100 pages before i give up on it and that rarely happens but as i turned the pages of this novel i began having mental conversations with the author that went something like this i get it she loves horses she has the passion of an adolescent she no longer lives in florida and north carolina is not the same state as florida for the love of god when is something going to happen that is not trite or a complete cliche i gave up some folks clearly loved this book not i","1641":"i really sincerely did not like the main character not that i believe you should like every main character but there should be a point to a main character from whom you want to recoil and disassociate yourself i found myself pitying those left in her wake and having very little compassion for the ways she was wronged in the end i wondered what was the point of reading the novel","1642":"this book was horribly slow and uneventful maybe if it had been cut down by 50% it might've been enjoyable","1643":"never grabbed me i love coming of age stories but this one seemed overworked and the main character's life seemed exceedingly unrealistic","1644":"just okay if the story had been about riding i wouldn't have picked it up saw this title mentioned in real simple magazine i think so i thought i'd check it out since it was free from the library no harm no foul maybe if i would've liked the protagonist it might've been a more satisfying read","1645":" this was sort of a difficult book to give stars to there were parts that were wonderful and parts that were simply not i will admit i initially picked this up because of the word \"camp\" in the title and though i was pretty much one hundred percent sure that the experiences of a character at 1930s riding camp would have little in common with my experiences at summer camp anyone who has ever been to camp will know this is a singular experience you want to talk about constantly and rather irritatingly to your friends from home so camp was why i picked up this book but not the reason i stayed theodora \"thea\" atwell arrives at the yonahlossee riding camp for girls after a family tragedy sent away because of the part she played in it there high in the blue ridge mountains of north carolina thea meets girls of her own age for the first time a world away from the isolated country life she enjoyed with her parents and twin brother in florida but soon past mistakes start repeating themselves and the question is not whether she can return to her old life but rather if she can keep her new one i read a lot of complaints about this book because it dealt with wealthy girls and that the protagonist's ostensible camp punishment going to a luxe camp with maids and daily riding lessons isn't exactly much of a punishment valid perhaps but this was the south in the 30s what exactly did these readers think would be the punishment of a southern belle she was not being punished really she was being removed from a situation this is what happens in the face of impropriety that you don't want anyone else to know about real punishment begets some real questions from the neighbors so is thea's fate bad certainly not in fact this is probably the best thing that ever happened to her a sentiment she seems to reflect by the end of the book not really a spoiler wealthy characters seem to have fallen out of favor lately but i still find them entertaining first world problems are still problems if they make you unhappy this book was certainly not without fault however as mentioned above i went to camp i was molded at camp and was spit out after two months every year with a coat of dirt on my skin and caked in my feet but with a much deeper understanding of the important things in life camp can't be explained to people who did not go because it's just not something that can be understood stories are stories but what camp leaves you with is feeling cheesy but true this was present in this book a little in my opinion the opportunity was lost this is not a book about camp so please if that is your only reason for picking up this novel set it down again it's not for you instead this is a coming of age story about a girl who picks very bad bedfellows her internal struggle is recognizable but many of her actions are not there are two romances in this novel both are inappropriate the first was perhaps necessary but the second was not it added less than nothing to this story in reminded me a bit of this film 'mona lisa smile' starring julia roberts and kirsten dunst and took place in 1960s wellesley college i couldn't help but think that movie would have been better without julia roberts girls can teach each other far more than a misguided authority figure that often bogs down the story the adults in this novel did the same thing tidbits are necessary of course one can not live in a world without adults but this would have fared much better had thea's journey been about the girls she met at yonahlossee and not the adults she ignored them for overall i liked this book i would give it three and a half stars truly worth a read and half filled with great stuff the other half however pulled down the narrative and i couldn't throw it an extra half when i had to choose between three or four stars","1646":"i was an okay read but i kept feeling it shoud have been better i liked the interaction between the main character and the girls at school and the family relationship was interesting but i didn't buy a lot of the tragedy","1647":"i found many things about this book troubling least of which may be the number of characters' breath smell described","1648":"this was a very good book and led to a wonderful discussion in my bookclub it highlighted the miscommunications and issues that can create long dark secrets within a family that may or may not tear ones apart a girl is sent away to a boarding school to keep a family secret and she reflects back on this decision while coming of age during the depression era","1649":"this book was recommended to me however unfortunately i found this book infantile and couldn't finish it a coming of age book something i may have read in high school or college","1650":"i wish i could send this book back in time to myself when i was a young teen i would have been even more enthralled by this lovely book","1651":"beautifully written however it was a predictable plot liked the time period and the unique perspective on the depression era lifestyle return optional read","1652":" this is a jewel of southern fiction written in the voice of thea atwell a 15yr old at the start of the book she tells of her charmed life with her family in florida in a beautiful home with orange groves behind it her days are spent riding sasi her pony and spending time with her twin brother sam things begin to change the great depression is at hand and her father's brother has made some poor choices in investments her aunt and uncle and her cousin georgie come and visit often the three thea sam and georgie were always close as children they are growing up now and both thea and georgie are experiencing hormonal changes that bring them closer than they should be because of this and the results of this thea is sent away to the yonahlossee riding camp for girls she knows she is being punished but she comes to love it she makes friends for the first time in her life continues to excel at horsemanship and finds that her burgeoning sexuality has followed her this is a coming of age story people will either love it or if they don't understand the heart of the character they will hate it","1653":"all i can say is interesting","1654":" unlike many other reviewers i didn't expect to like this book i never expect to like a book that has been raved about the way this one was and at first i didn't like it i probably wouldn't have kept reading it except that i wanted to know exactly what the main character had done that had caused her parents to send her away i'm glad i did because i ended up liking the book immensely i think the problem with the first part is that we know so little about the main character thea atwell that it's hard to make sense of her thoughts and actions once the back story starts to be filled in it's much easier to relate to her i wouldn't call this book sexy as much as frank and realistic it isn't easy to depict what it's like when adolescents first begin to awaken to their sexual potential and i applaud the author for doing such a fine job of depicting the burgeoning sexual awareness of a young girl in depression era america i fault the reviews that emphasized the sex in the book in the end this was about growing up and coming into one's own in the world beyond one's family and one's past","1655":"creating an atmosphere that's as dreamy and misty as a midsummer southern night anton disclafani in her debut novel transports us to the early years of the great depression and the waning days of finishing schools for privileged young ladies weaving fifteen year old thea's love of horses with an undercurrent of smoldering passions disclafani artfully builds the tension as the mystery of the girl's disgrace is tantalizingly revealed keeping us mesmerized until the story is fully played out","1656":"great coming of age story told in flashbacks and present day in the 1940s the story centers around an incident that really drew me in trying to figure out what happened after i finished the book i missed reading about some of the characters always a sign of a good book for me","1657":"really nothing about this book did it for me not even being set in my beloved mountains too much teenaged angst convoluted family stuff dragged out plot lolita ness without nabokov at the pen there was not a single character i could find footing with except maybe thea's pony big disappointment","1658":"engaging but also disturbing the book has an undercurrent to it that is unsettling i fluctuated between sympathy for and distaste in the main character","1659":"i would have found this book egregiously boring if there hadn't been horses in it","1660":"thea atwell is sent to the yonahlossee camp after an horrible incident tears apart her family and shames her reputation although a beautiful camp filled with horses and temptations thea is a rich girl full of self discovery that does not illicit much sympathy","1661":" i would actually almost go with about a 3 5 here since i enjoyed the writing but could have done without quite so many details about the main character's sexual awakening even though her sexuality was integral to moving the story forward i am still not really sure how i feel about the book overall but i think the fact that i'm still puzzling it out tells me that the author did a good job of making me care about what happened to her characters or at least being interested in what happened to them even if i didn't particularly like any of them being somewhat impatient i had to skip to the end early on to find out exactly what precipitated thea's exile to the school in order to be able to read the book in less than hyper speed","1662":"another book club selection it kept my interest and kept me entertained but i can't say i loved it the main character is pretty selfish and doesn't seem to learn from her mistakes i also got a little annoyed after a while that she wouldn't just say what she had done that was so bad and was getting impatient to get to the big reveal overall it was just kind of meh","1663":"15 year old thea gets sent to riding camp after a scandal i got caught up in the rich depiction of thea's inner life and the world of the 1930s riding school thea's not always a sympathetic character but i appreciated her survival instincts","1664":"i almost didn't read this because of some of the reviews i'm glad i did good story that i would give 3 5 stars if i could","1665":"it was so badly written i almost didn't rate it please save precious time in a short life which can accommodate only so many books and avoid this one","1666":"blech i'm still not over finishing the art of fielding this book didn't help at all it only made me wish this book was either the chaperone or atonement hrmph","1667":"i liked the book but the main character seemed to have no regard for consequences that others would suffer from her choices very disturbing","1668":" in 1930 15 year old thea atwell is sent away from her rural florida home to a girls' camp in north carolina she has done wrong in the eyes of her parents and is considered to be in need of correction as she settles in to life at yonahlossee thea tries to come to terms with what happened to bring here there get used to a less isolated life and look to the future there's much to like in this book and i enjoyed it a great deal there were also aspects of it that i didn't enjoy as much which took away from my experience of it and there's one major aspect that i'm still undecided about the book starts at the point when thea arrives at the camp so the reader doesn't know what led her to be there and must rely on her to tell us her story we quickly gather that what happened relates to a boy and draw the obvious conclusion but it takes thea till very near the end of the book to tell us exactly what went on and when she does we have to remember that we're hearing only her version of events which may or may not be wholly reliable i'm still not sure whether having to wait this long for the reveal contributes to the book or is detrimental to it there's a fair bit of thea almost telling someone but then deciding not to which i began to find annoying and i'm not sure how realistic it is for a 15 year old girl to keep her own counsel that long it makes sense for the author to keep the secret till virtually the end in order to keep up the tension and make the reader finding out the secret more dramatic but i'm not sure how realistic it is i felt that thea was a well drawn character but in many ways she seems older than her years - i kept having to remind myself that she was only 15 however she does exhibit much of the self centredness of that age the author portrays the urgency of burgeoning sexual attraction very well and makes us believe that thea would have acted as she did almost despite herself thea's relationship with her parents is well done and believable as is the almost mystic union she has with her twin brother i felt that most of the rest of the girls at the camp weren't portrayed as well and tended to all be too similar to appear as real people i also didn't feel that the period in which the book is set came across as well as the author would have wanted - it felt like it could have been set at any time as thea and some of the other characters seemed too modern to come from an era earlier than our own i'm not a horsey person and never went through the ponies stage common in young girls but the riding motif in the book is well done and used in both a realistic and symbolic way i enjoyed the book though i am still undecided about some of its elements and would recommend it to others","1669":" this book caught my attention and it started out good but it didn't last for me you can read many reviews that tell you the story so i will just say that i didn't really like it could not care what happened to thea or really anyone else in the story it seemed a bit unreal that all this would happen to a well brought up girl in that time period the first love affair made sense but the second it just felt like more opportunity for the author to add more sex when the story didn't need it the ending was the author telling you what happened to everyone very unsatisfying read","1670":"i had high hopes for this book it started out well enough but i wished the main character's relationships with the girls at the school would have taken on more meaning","1671":"i wanted to like this one so much more than i ended up more of a review to follow","1672":"i found the characters in this story unconvincing as to the probability of their existence the protagonist and voice of the story thea is a 15 year old girl from florida the story's back story is the great depression thea and her twin brother sam have been raised in isolation from society on a ranch by her doctor father and recluse mother thea is a horse lover and excellent rider while her twin is interested in nature the only other people that they have much to do with are her aunt and uncle and cousin george who is a couple of years older than the twins at the beginning of the story thea is sent away to a boarding school in north carolina which is the title of the book she has done something very bad and is pretty much dismissed from the family it takes eons to find out what exactly that bad behavior was but hints of it are revealed as the story flips back and forth from the riding school to flashbacks on the ranch thea is simply too much of any number of adjectives good looking head strong sexy the best rider in camp and generally not a sympathetic character as she goes about her life taking what she thinks she needs","1673":"this book was a small masterpiece the settings and characters were perfect but it was the way the plot unfurled that made it a tremendous read anton disciafani did a fantastic job of giving away small pieces of information but keeping the best until the end highly recommended","1674":" i put off writing this review for a little while because i wasn't sure exactly what i wanted to say i loved this book but i don't quite know why once i picked it up all i wanted to do was curl up in the sun on a comfy chair and read all day and shut everything else out but when i think about it i can understand some of the criticisms i've seen it was slow not a great deal actually happened thea was not always the most likeable or relatable protagonist i think a large part of it is that i am powerless to resist a good coming of age story my boyfriend likes to tease me because he doesn't know what that phrase even means and whenever he sees it in a film review or on tv he'll immediately shout out look a 'coming of age' story you'll love it when i tried to pick out specific quotes to include in this review i struggled to find any particularly poignant ones but to me as i was reading it the entire novel was poignant it's just the way disclafani wrote it breathy dreamy a little somber a lot sexy it's romantic but it's not it never made my heart ache there is no real first love and although there is tenderness and there are emotions involved ultimately the relationships are all based primarily on lust there is always a sense of things ending in this book by having it set on the brink of the great depression the girls at yonahlossee start to feel the effects but at the same time are removed from them they own their fancy gowns and lavish jewellery but it could always be the last dance the last letter stuffed with money and some of their days are numbered the end of prosperity the end of childhood see very poignant thea was wonderfully complex but i wish sam had been fleshed out further he was such a big part of thea's life but he mostly only came off as an overgrown kid i did however appreciate some of the details that were given about other secondary characters sissy leona and the horses i have barely ever even approached a horse but my past pony pals reading self was delighted by the particulars of horseback riding and showmanship i love that this was disclafani's first novel because it means i will have so much to look forward to in her future as a writer","1675":"i couldn't completely submerge myself in this book because of the situations the main character shall i say found herself in i liked the voice of the thea and enjoyed the author's writing style and language but the sex and whatnot and the people involved honestly turned me off i realize the situations of this novel could have been more plausible in the time period it was written in but i just couldn't get into this i would give this author another try though if she comes out with anything new and not quite this variety of tragedy","1676":" horrid i had high hopes for this book when i first saw it advertised and read the early reviews needless to say those hopes were dashed in about the first 10 pages when i had the hardest time following the authors writing style the characters are not even characters as we really go no feel for any of the girls at yonahlossee you felt no sympathy for anyone even though this was a book about the depression the only depression feeling i got was from reading this thea is sex obsessed as is her cousin and she becomes a sexual predator in my opinion as she set her sights on the headmaster everything about this book just was poor if i could give this less than a 1 star and have it count in the ratings i would having just finished the exquisitely written middlesex by eugenides i had such a major comedown when i read this book to be quite honest after finishing this book i threw it in the trash was it trashy not really in the pure sense of trash novels but it did not deserve to see the light of day any longer","1677":"tragic engaging and suspenseful i tad unbelievable but pretty good characterizations","1678":"disappointing could be subtitled 'an author in search of a plausible plot '","1679":"good summer read about thea atwell and her twin brother and her family in the florida orange groves during the depression a tragedy sends her to a riding camp in the blue mountains","1680":"i liked reading about the camp and this time in history but half way through it all seemed to focus on sex","1681":"this was a sad tale of a reclusive family and the unexpected pin that burst their bubble","1682":" i liked the book but i didn't love it it was good though i liked how it showed that girls are sexual creatures it is not just teenage boys who have urges the story looked at growing up and learning about yourself and your family thea is sent away to the yonahlossee riding camp after an accident at home you slowly learn what happened thea loves horses is fearless and can be rash the stories describes her life at camp her interactions with the other girls it is set during the depression so you see how the crash changes the way of life for the upper class whose income is not as secure as it once was the story also shows the standards that women were held what was proper and what was improper and how a female's innocence was important to the good name of the family i liked that thea represented the sexuality of girls i liked that she wasn't shown as a slut or an angel but in between the two overall the book was good but it didn't stand out as top 10","1683":"this book i so wanted it to be wonderful it was not i was expecting something totally different this thea she starts out at 15 and possibly the dumbest girl ever bad decision after bad decision i really didn't like her i think the author wanted the reader to be sympathetic to her situation the depression over bearing parents the connection to her twin but i really wasn't there were points i felt for her but overall she was unsympathetic that being said the author kept my hopes up for her i guess she grew and matured but not really she was rich spoiled and selfish even in her most giving moment her motives still selfish","1684":"so many interesting quotes so much gorgeous equestrian description such coldness in the spare multilayered dialogue and descriptions of and between the family members how sad that the relationship between the twins was irrevocably lost and how strange how apart these 2 children were raised from the rest of the world is it the best book i've ever read no was it a book that kept me reading on to see what new and bigger destruction would befall the characters yup an interesting and matter of fact account of a family during the beginning of the great depression add in a lot of horse sweat some teenage angst lots of florida imagery and a bit of incest and you have the general recipe for this book its saving graces include the horsey bits the lovingly drawn descriptions of the nc mountains and the true way in which the author is able to draw the reader right back into their 16 year old brains bodies thoughts and feelings and omg am i glad i'm not who i was when i was 16 any longer i think it was overall a well crafted story of personal development and interpersonal relationships but perhaps not the most original of plots despite all of the bad reviews on here i still think it's a worthwhile read we wanted a certain handsome boy to take a fancy to us to become half of a pair for a night and then maybe most of all we wanted them to leave so that we could pine away it has always been a great comfort to me that i could bring a book anywhere to any place to any part of my life not missing home had at first seemed inconceivable but i understood how the human heart operated that it was fickle they'd send you away anyway in a few years with a husband and i saw that sissy was good that she had learned to move through this world and love people and let them love her back that she did not love too intensely as i did or not at all as i imagined leona did leona and i tiptoed did not let the hard soles of our boots meet the ground though there was no one to hear except the horses who all watched us curiously eyes wide ears tipped forward their necks pressed against their stall doors i slipped naari's bit into her mouth and led her to the front of the barn she whuffed into my shoulder nervously and i murmured soothingly she was a ball of energy and after i mounted she danced beneath me like some sort of overgrown sprite clumsily her hooves knocking against each other 'she's fast ' leona said which i knew was half a compliment have a signal that i had nothing to do with naari's speed but horses weren't raced without jockeys it is a simple thing to love a horse mother said that i rode with my head not with my heart and that riding with my head would serve me well in many instances but it would not ear sasi's enduring loyalty i always through that was a romantic view of it i rolled over and faced the window it was like looking into nothing the night was so black i had wanted her there tonight i had wanted her to see how i floated above the earth would she have loved me then watched me and known in her heart that i was her daughter her daughter who could ride so beautifully sit atop and not interfere with a horse going as fast as time and space would allow mother it was as if we were floating mother if you cannot love me with your heart then at least with your head and i was such a foolish girl seeing signs where none existed believing always that i was an object of desire there was always a problem a difficulty when one rode that was the whole point of the endeavor the constant striving and this reaching depended both on me and my mount and more generally on our natures and then it was over quickly as my fights with him usually were we fought deeply and briefly i nudged sasi forward his head hung low i had exhausted him he would forget he might have already forgotten but he wouldn't forget the fear and the memory of pain would be replaced by an instinct of mistrust that was the problem with horses they were too dumb to remember properly but there was still a memory to contend with a memory that could not be reasoned away i put my arms around sasi's damp neck and he hung his head low he loved me i could feel his enormous heart pumping in his plump pony's chest drawings of his pretty face were in all of my notebooks you were supposed to be pretty you were supposed to be beautiful but you were not supposed to care i'd come out here for exactly that reason i needed power i needed him to clear the highest jump he ever had not for me but because the jump was pointed into that great and mysterious beyond i realized as soon as i turned that i'd given us too much space too long a straight line too much time and reason for him to run away for me to lose control but i felt him gather his legs beneath him in clear anticipation of the jump 'yes yes yes ' i murmured in rhythm to his canter my braid thumped on my back my vision narrowed and i was only aware of the particular way sasi's hooves hit the ground the hard sound that made and the closing distance between us and the jump it was all instinct now there was nothing anyone could teach you about this instant before leaving the ground 'now ' i said and we flew decca stood i interrupted the caressing of my hair i was vain i was sixteen years old and would never again feel so watched when mr albrecht's whistle blew i was lined up with the first jump naari rolled her eye at one of the pots but i pushed her through my legs and she cleared it i jumped like i always did everything everyone else disappeared all the people watching were a blur i focused on the sharp smell of naari's sweat her trembling movement between my legs i liked the fierce leverage wrapped reins brought i bent my elbows and naari slowed quickly and then i turned my toes out and dug my spurs into her sides and i had her trapped i had all her power harnessed between my legs and hands beneath me i'd never felt such energy rolling beneath me like a violent wave and all is fair in the jumping ring where there cannot be favorites where what matters is skill and speed in that order girls it is a lesson that is well suited to life in all your endeavors strive hard and honestly and great rewards will be yours at yonahlossee i learned the lesson that i had started to teach myself at home my life was mine and i had to lay claim to it 'what is there for me here ' i asked 'there is not even a horse here ' and horses were always a part of my life a blessing taking comfort in them had always been something i'd done by instinct and it was an instinct i never outgrew i took pleasure in how good i was in the saddle how well i knew my way around a horse i was good at something in a way most people are never good at anything in their lives horses were a gift how many people have such a constant in their life separate from the rough and often beautiful mess that is their family","1685":" i would give the first 2 3 of the book 4 stars and then it went down hill for me thea is sent away to horseback riding boarding school in 1930 during the depression she was raised in florida with her twin brother where the two of them were kept extremely isolated from anyone else other than their cousin georgie thea is extremely angry at being sent away and separated from her twin sam but she also feels very guilty about the reason she was sent away at camp she makes friends with one of the most popular girls and tries to fit in luckily she is one of the best riders at camp but as the story unfolds and you learn why she was sent away and you see that she doesn't really learn anything from her behavior i found it all disturbing and not enjoyable to read i did have a hard time putting it down for most of it","1686":"started book with high expectations it was on a couple of must read book lists for summer book never rose to the hype for me the slow drawn out piecing together of what happened that caused 15 year old thea atwell to be sent away from her home was almost irritating basically a coming of age novel set in the depression in the hills of nc","1687":"not sure how i feel about this book i have to think it about a little more and get backi am back i have been thinking about thea and while her actions decisions may have been selfish and disturbing why wouldn't they be when her life has been self centered and a little dysfunctional thea and her twin sam did whatever they wanted to at home and were sheltered to the point where the only people they interacted with were their aunt uncle and older cousin georgie for 14 years that's it well what did they think would happen so while i can't say i particularly like thea i kind of understand where she was coming from overall i really liked the author's writing style though could have done without the soft porn sex scenes felt they devalued the novel i would have liked to know what became of the girls at camp","1688":"well written but the pace was not really to my liking the back story is interwoven with the present so you don't really find out what happened before until almost the end of the book if i was the sort of reader who looked ahead i definitely would have done so in this book reviews had described it as sexy but i was troubled by the relationships described by the 15 year old protagonist","1689":"wasn't a huge fan of thea maybe that speaks to the ability of the writer to create a more realistic protagonist that you don't have to like","1690":"the only reason i kept reading after the obligatory first 50 pages was to find out what terrible thing thea the narrator had done that made her parents send her away to the yrcfg the daughter of a well to do doctor in a small town in florida during the depression thea has never been away from home before has been home schooled along with her twin brother and has spent all her free time with her horse at 15 the self described half girl half woman is banished to the school in western north carolina she doesn't even get to go home for christmas although her parents who send her letters full of love and concern may consider her bad seed she seems to be just a teenager undergoing a sexual awakening the best part of the book are the descriptions of horse riding but the human characters aren't developed well enough to be sympathetic and the pedestrian writing and all the melodrama get in the way of what might have been an interesting ya novel curtis sittenfeld blurbed the book enthusiastically so perhaps some readers will enjoy the book i found it a waste of time","1691":" i'm not entirely sure how this book ended up on so many omg you should read this lists it's not a bad book and maybe people like it because they think disclafani is a talented writer and are looking forward to reading more from her i could kind of see that but this book was too far from perfect the writing itself was distracting early on especially before i got into the story i kept wanting to rewrite sentences and some of them i just wanted to cut out completely because stop talking and just tell the story thea atwell has been sent away to the yonahlossee riding camp for girls and for much of the book it's unclear exactly why i understand authors wanting to reveal something like that slowly but i found myself wishing that story telling technique wasn't used in this book and she would just tell us already but i did find myself caught up in thea's story i read a few reviews that complained about how unlikeable thea is and i didn't find her that horrible she's not a pleasant girl really but she seemed simply like a self centered thoughtless teenager other characters were sadly flat or simply unoriginal certain things the way thea's mother kept the family so isolated for example could have been drawn out more i was still drawn into the story i just wanted to like the book more than i did","1692":"loved the setting 1930's wealthy bad girls at a posh riding academy camp the storyline reminded me of a lot of foreign films that never seem to have any great big message or moral to the story like american writing i thought the explicit sex not necessary to the story found the book entertaining","1693":"it was just ok different than i thought it would be much more adult the character wasn't that sympathetic and didn't seem like she learned that much from her experiences","1694":"it was really well written and i liked the general storyline but it bugged me how selfish and irresponsible thea was while maintaining thus air of superiority","1695":"more like 3 5 star well written period piece beginning better than the end","1696":"couldn't make it through this one never got hooked","1697":"really really good gave me the same feeling afterward as when i read reconstructing amelia kind of an emptiness a wait there must be more i'm not ready to be finished with this yet the author has a very interesting way of writing pulling you into each person in the story and is able to get you to fully feel as if you know them like you've always know them like they are a part of you","1698":"this review has been hidden because it contains spoilers to view it click here i read all the way through to the end of this book not because i enjoyed it i didn't not much but because i was curious to see how the story ended for that i gave it 3 stars as well as its unusual setting but it was entirely too long and too full of inconsequential descriptions of how someone's hand moved a spoon on the table or how thea took a glass of water and drank it and took another for heaven's sake usually the descriptions in a good book have some sort of meaning or lead y i read all the way through to the end of this book not because i enjoyed it i didn't not much but because i was curious to see how the story ended for that i gave it 3 stars as well as its unusual setting but it was entirely too long and too full of inconsequential descriptions of how someone's hand moved a spoon on the table or how thea took a glass of water and drank it and took another for heaven's sake usually the descriptions in a good book have some sort of meaning or lead you to another plot device but these all seemed gratuitous and useless or maybe there was symbolism in each button lock of hair pearl and i'm too stupid to pick up on it also i did not care for thea the main character and narrator the actual plot is interesting but thea who is supposed to be 15 16 years old does not have the voice of a teenager besides she is selfish i want all the time i want i want she is thoughtless and reckless well yes that could be a teenager she only cares for herself this does not make for a pleasant read i was angry at her a good deal of the time not rooting for her at all there doesn't seem to be any overriding theme or great lesson in this book any time a character makes a statement about life about the situations thea finds herself in about her personality and development it seems vacuous and meaningless there's nothing there or again maybe i'm too stupid to figure it out women's roles certain play a part the author constantly bashes us over the head with she's just a girl or she's just a woman certainly in 1930 women had much less power especially in the upper classes than they do today and thea's situation would have been entirely different had she been a boy but then what does thea do anything special to overcome her situation is there a great epiphany no nothing disappointing finally while the plot idea is interesting the switching back and forth between past and present gets a bit tiresome especially in the last chapters in which the switching is from a certain day and the preceding day or hours what this was just ridiculous so while this book has some fine points it is too long and too enchanted with itself more","1699":"i could not put this down the novel is a coming of age story of a young girl from a wealthy family during the depression the text is expertly sprinkled with hints of why thea is attending the exclusive riding school it is a beautifully written story about an all to common family situation","1700":"loved this book","1701":"the book was very slow and could have benefitted from some editing the book has some interesting concepts for a book group to discuss but i doubt if everyone would get through the book","1702":"i have so many mixed feelings about this book and man are they extreme the beginning was hard for me to get into but the last half flew by i needed to know what happened next and what had happened in the back story in terms of setting and suspense this book is flawless i also loved the development of the main character but keep going back and forth about how i felt about the characterization of her sexuality hmph very confusing but glad i read it for sure","1703":"excellent writing it kept me turning the pages to find out why thea was sent to the riding camp recommend","1704":"i am extremely disappointed in this book i waited 3 months for it on hold at the library so i read the whole thing ugh it is a very weird disjointed story i guess it is supposed to be a coming of age story but you know it's bad when the best parts are about the horses","1705":"enjoyable read that kept me turning the pages and wanting to find out what had gone so wrong in this girl's life to send her away to a boarding school oh the tangled webs we can create with our families and what one person may see as trying to protect a family member may be seen as a punishment and what may be seen as a punishment may turn out to be a good thing enjoyed reading about the horses too and how sad it was set amongst the great depression","1706":"eh didn't live up to the hype saw the plot twists coming a mile away tried to be a grander novel than it was","1707":" i wanted to like this a lot more than i did it wasn't bad or anything but it wasn't as magical and lyrical as i'd hoped the language was a little stilted for me due to the period and the characters at the camp blurred together i thought the parceling out of information about why thea had been sent away paid off with the situation but not with how it was revealed and the way the book ended didn't sit well with me as a way to tie together the characters and the story it had a lot going for it for sure but the whole wasn't quite everything i'd hoped it would be","1708":"great debut novel really enjoyed this book about a young woman sent away to a boarding school for equestrians during the depression following some boy trouble","1709":"original review http alexandrampatterson com 2013 0 rating 4 5lately i've been loving historical novels -- above all things z a novel of zelda fitzgerald the bookman's tale when the yonahlossee riding camp for girls a novel showed up in my mailbox last week i knew i had to put it at the top of my pile luckily it didn't disappoint thea alwell is the daughter of a wealthy heiress and a doctor born a fraternal twin her life has been about carving out a place beside her brother when a certain someone starts paying attention to only thea she becomes caught up in the attention rather than watch her perfect family unravel as a result of her actions she's sent to the yonahlossee riding camp for girls built as a retreat for wealthy girls the riding camp has become a haven for daughters of the rich during the great depression the girls are given lessons in elocution french manners and of course riding though at first thea feels like an outsider she quickly comes into her own this book read a lot like a season of downton abbey thea reminds me a lot of lady mary - she's headstrong and has a brief dalliance that threatens to ruin her life all in all i really liked this book and recommend it if you're looking for something to read during your commute read a likesi capture the castle by dodie smithevery day after by laura goldenthe grapes of wrath by john steinbeckrules of civility by amos towlesmiss pettigrew lives for a day by winifred watsonsince this book reads a lot like a coming of age novel i thought i'd include some additional picks for ya readers children ya booksbud not buddy by christopher paul curtisout of the dust by karen hessekit boxed set","1710":"this novel has all the elements of a story i would love a mainly all girl cast a prep school setting a mysterious event in the past that is haunting one of the girls discalfani is a lovely writer who made the rural southern camp in the 30s and its students feel real and richly drawn the story revolves around a girl named thea who is sent to the titular camp for reasons that become clear during the course of the book i just couldn't love it though primarily because i didn't think that thea felt real to me i didn't understand her motivations particularly in her relationship with her headmaster and her return to her family felt completely out of character for her and unrealistic given what we had learned about them i am definitely interested in reading more by this author though a total on the fence review i know","1711":"this was a book that i could not put down while at times i despised the main character i realized that the author wanted me to feel that way it has been quite some time since i have read a book that was so engrossing enjoyable upsetting and perfectly suspenseful the back story unfolds over the course of the entire book and does not disappoint","1712":" i really loved this book and thought it was excellently written the characters were well rounded enough for me and i didn't long to know more about them the plot kept me guessing and searching with an ending i did not guess but was content with i think this was a wonderful book but more sexual in areas than i had expected i would have appreciated leaving a bit more to the imagination but those parts did not take away from the overall mystery and lure that this book had there was something wonderful about it in the beginning that kept me wanting more and that was never lost a beautiful book that was incredibly well done i read it start to finish in three days loving thea for the whole time even if she was a bit too scandalous for me curtis sittenfeld author of prep was spot on i fell completely under the spell of anton disclafani's amazing first novel and was gripped by its lush and dreamy evocations of southern decorum family secrets and boarding school rituals she is wildly talented and this is a sexy suspenseful gorgeously written book","1713":" received a pre release copy of this book lyrical and literary this novel captures the awakening independence of a young woman as well as the essence of the dirty 30's the plot moves carefully and artfully between the events leading up to and the current events at the riding school we get to know thea her upbringing her relatives her spirit and her sheltered naivete her passion for living and loving boils over time and time again and she is helpless to her urges be them towards achieving a higher jump on her pony or to creating intimacy she learns that her life is her own that her parents also have flaws that families are never perfect and that she has to live with her mistakes the descriptive passages in this novel steep the pages in the wilds of florida and appalachia the equestrian content is accurate at least according to my two decades of horse experience the writing is superb best book of the year so far highly recommended","1714":"the secret of why thea atwell is sent away to riding camp is slowly revealed and makes this a page turner thea and most of the characters are flawed but very relatable highly recommend this well written story of transformation","1715":"lovely and original story great writing","1716":"amazing the story line was so fascinating the characters so well developed difficult to put down","1717":" nothing of note happens in the first half of this book the scene is simply being set the scene being a girls' riding camp during the great depression where our main character 15 year old thea atwell has been sent by her family for some yet untold indiscretion i would put the book down and completely forget that i'd been reading it for few days then remember and pick it back up again not a good sign i had a hard time connecting with this book on any level the main character wasn't strong enough as in well drawn enough in terms of her motivations for me to understand and i couldn't keep her classmates straight because none of them were distinctive enough also i think writing a book for a modern audience that reflects 1930s mores is a challenge it can certainly be done but this book had some modern sensibilities so i just never got completely pulled into that world i kept at this book but i'm not sure why","1718":"three stars is a rounded up rating if i had a 5 it would be 2 5 decent not great the premise was promising but the sense of place and time was really lacking so i had to keep reminding myself that the story was set in 1930 thea the narrator wasn't really a three dimensional character so i had a hard time sympathizing with her overall just an average but worth finishing book","1719":"great story","1720":"the author got the name and some of the details for this book from my beloved childhood camp which was for girls but not just for riding","1721":"3 5 stars it was a good book but left me feeling sad and a little unsettled","1722":"did not like i wanted to put it down 1 2 way into it but have never not finished a book i started reading","1723":"i liked this book it has a good story and keeps you interested that said i wanted something more from it i thought the big reveal why our protagonist is at the camp took a little too long to get to also i was just not satisfied that there was enough change for anyone in the novel the quibbles might sound petty but they gnawed at me as i was reading it still it's a great summer read and i recommend it","1724":"couldn't put this down fascinating quietly terrifying and everything made sense when you looked back to early events as the main character does a great story especially for any girl who has ever loved horses riding and or had a hard time waiting to grow up to get what she wants the effect that it has on her family is totally believable","1725":"i enjoyed this story very much hope she writes another novel soon thanks ab for recommending it","1726":"i am baffled by people who say this book is beautifully written the author fills it with run on sentences the characters and their motivations are not developed none of the characters seems real what plot there is feels like an excuse for the sexual scenes i felt like reading it was a waste of time i was distracted by the author's sentence structure the narrator's observations were filled with nonsensical non sequiturs this is the first time i can remember feeling such disrespect for an author while i was reading her book i'm sure glad i didn't buy this one","1727":"this review has been hidden because it contains spoilers to view it click here it was a page turner for me i realized at the end i had been waiting for the exciting sexy part of the story it never came the ending was such a disappointment the best things about the book are the descriptions of the culture the feelings of riding horses and they're care","1728":" i saw a review that said this is one of those books that i wanted to love and yet i did not bingo i loved the idea of the story young girl gets sent away to an equestrian boarding school comes of age during the great depression family secret and for the first 1 3 of the book i loved it suspenseful excellent writing page turning but then woof i wanted more character and plot development where was the coming of age in the coming of age story the book really slowed down for me instead of speeding up i appreciate this when there is some big pay off at the end but i just didn't feel it i want to love a character or love them because i hate them or hate them because i love them i want to feel something i had a hard time connecting or getting emotional involved this book made me think a big of prep which i really enjoyed has that same kind of coming of age in a boarding school vibe i give it 4 stars because i did enjoy it and the writing was well produced and who doesn't love horses but i feel a little cheated by it all for some reason i have the feeling that if this had been submitted to me by a creative writing student i would write great ideas but keep going you are better than this","1729":"do not bother","1730":"i can't remember where or from whom i got this recommendation but i'm no longer trusting that person or publication first i was really annoyed by the whole ooh there's this big secret that i'm going to talk all the way around but not tell you thing that was going from the very beginning of the book it's fine to do a slow reveal throughout the course of the book but don't be so darn obvious about it second the characters felt so wooden and fake maybe the author was going for a tone that was reminiscent of books from the '30s and '40s where the dialog and emotions were a bit more constrained but because the book was written in the first person the flat characters felt particularly jarring in relation to some of the themes and action in the book which brings me to third enough with all the sex honestly the whole book really felt like an excuse for the author to write about a teenage girl's budding sexuality and exploration in semi explicit detail it was just unnecessary and didn't feel realistic this is a two star book if i ever read one who's apparently female despite the name the emotions in the book felt so untrue to me that i was firmly convinced it was a male author writing out of his wheelhouse until i just googled the author","1731":"loved the story and how you don't know what happened to cause all thea's problems right away it was slowly given to you bit by bit just to keep you wondering great read","1732":"a good start but went downhill from there a non story written badly with no apparent point to make if it were an autobiography i would put it down to the indulgent ranting of a self obsessed neurotic with nothing of value to say but it was written by a guy narrating as a 15 year old girl how can this stuff make it into print i know 50 shades of grey~ and all that nuff said","1733":"if you want to read a tedious book about a selfish girl who sleeps with her cousin and then her married headmaster to come to an understanding that it was all a series of events to which she had no control than this is your book","1734":"for all the hype this was pretty underwhelming a fairly straightforward plot an a lot of repetition also i'm just so tired of clutching my pearls","1735":"i was ultimately disappointed by this book for anyone who considers this book know that the secrets are dark and may be disturbing to some readers while i was not disturbed by thea's secrets i found myself completely uninterested in any of the characters","1736":" taking this book for what i wanted it to be a summer read it did not disappoint for the most part it wasn't quite up to the quality of writing that last years gone girl achieved and i have to admit i was taken aback that the nyt review completely omitted the extremely sensual and sexual tone of the book really it borders on harlequin romance if not cinemax movie material at times but sometimes that's not a bad thing for a summertime diversion it is definitely an addictive story and the author shows moments of real literary prowess particularly in passages describing the natural environment but in the end i was disappointed with the resolution of the story when you are choosing a summer guilty pleasure read like this everything hinges on the quality of plot and inventiveness and craft of the story itself and for me that is where this novel ultimately failed and failed in a big way after loving it for 90% of the read i found myself skimming through the last 60 pages or so because the story just unraveled completely it was almost as if the author either gave up or the story itself got away from her a terribly anticlimactic and unsatisfying end to an otherwise enjoyable summer read","1737":"this review has been hidden because it contains spoilers to view it click here wow what a bad book i was expecting a lot more about a girl going to riding camp but it's all about a spoiled girl who's family has issues not to mention her when she is weirdly super affectionate with her twin sam but also her having sex with her cousin it's horribly written and there's all this fake suspense as to why she was sent to the camp but it's pretty obvious halfway through the book or at least georgie is introduced then she has this weird relationship with the headmaster he wow what a bad book i was expecting a lot more about a girl going to riding camp but it's all about a spoiled

just horrible and horribly written more","1738":"i think i would give this 3 1 2 stars thea is a fraternal twin who is sent off to camp at the beginning of the novel for something she has done wrong for most of the book you do not know exactly what she did but you know it has something to do with a boy the camp is seen as a punishment by thea for what she did and she spends most of the book coming to terms with her transgression overall i felt compelled to find out exactly what happened and the ultimate fate of her brother and cousin who were also involved with the tragic events","1739":" this book was underwhelming i'm giving it 3 stars because it was compelling enough for me to want to finish it but that is unfortunately the best thing i can say about it the book doesn't actually go anywhere there is no character growth or development every other scene is a perfunctory sex scene i'm not opposed to sex scenes in general but come on now for someone who claims to love horses thea is a holy terror to them when it serves her own wild emotional needs dragging out the revelation of thea's big secret seems to stand in place of any real plot or substance i wanted to like this one but it just didn't work for me","1740":"didn't realize how much sex was entailed not really my kind of book","1741":" 3 5 stars i am now very thankful that i was not a teenage girl in the 1930s though i think we can all relate to the consequences of wanting too much and of being let down by those from whom we expect too much the author writes beautifully and poignantly though the pervading feeling of the book is mostly one of wistful melancholy regardless i liked thea very much however unrealistically worldly and observant she seemed for a 16 year old we should all be so lucky as to have a friend like thea and also to be as aware and accepting of our place in the world regardless of whether it's the one we truly desire","1742":"the yonahlossee riding camp for girls by anton disclafani is the story about a young girl who gets sent away to camp after an incident comes to light the camp is a riding camp for girls she learns a lot more than just horses there is not a lot of action but i really enjoyed the main character's interaction with her family and the other girls at the camp it has a pretty good ending too gerard's review","1743":"i was so interested in reading this after reading a review in the local paper i found the story slow and the main character whiny the story was interesting but had a lot of building to the next point was not a page turner for me","1744":"this review has been hidden because it contains spoilers to view it click here i hate to give one star because the writing pulled me into this novel and kept me there until the end however how disappointing was this plot the protagonist is sent to this riding camp because she did something horrible at home her adored twin brother is damaged and her family does not want to see her for at least a year she agrees that she deserves abandonment that's the set up and the reader is of course curious to know what terrible incident occurred especially since the protagonis i hate to give one star because the writing pulled me into this novel and kept me there until the end however how disappointing was this plot the protagonist is sent to this riding camp because she did something horrible at home her adored twin brother is damaged and her family does not want to see her for at least a year she agrees that she deserves abandonment that's the set up and the reader is of course curious to know what terrible incident occurred especially since the protagonist was extremely isolated home schooled to the extreme and so has no street smarts no malice no experiences with her peer group etc the reader likes this innocent girl and assumes some accident for which she takes the blame is the cause of her family's misguided cruel abandonment however a bit past the halfway point of the novel the mystery is somewhat revealed and wow it is so disappointing the protagonist also reveals that she doesn't fit the original set up she is more like a victim of sexual abuse seducing practically every male she encounters including married old men ugh it seems like the 2nd half of this novel had sexual scenes thrown in just to add prurience they only served to make the reader lose affection for the protagonist and become revolted with the novel strange it's like 2 different people wrote this story and they switched about halfway through more","1745":" i spent much of this book wondering who the intended audience might be that's ok it doesn't need to fit in a box it's definitely not an innocent book i have to appreciate any book that has the potential to be challenged by some raging small town conservative schoolteacher and this book has the potential if i had a daughter i would hope that she has the kind of mind that could deal with the story or at least be able to discuss it intelligently but i'm not sure i would see the value in assigning it or recommending it to her i guess it could be a book for young women who are interested in sex and looking for a healthy outlet and it's got horses in it as an added bonus on the plus i liked how the author didn't judge any of the characters she simply told the story and i'm not sure i would have made it to the end if it had not been that way","1746":"find this book at kennedy library","1747":"i tried to like this book i really did with beautiful language and settings depicted in such detail that the reader can almost feel them there was a lot to like further the author's depiction of the onset of the great depression hangs a lovely shadow over the piece that looms with far more menacing beauty than the real secret that's unraveled far too slowly through the course of the novel seriously if you can't figure out said secret in the first few chapters you only get a pass from me if this is the first book you've ever read with that said however i don't even know where to begin in order to discuss the substantial flaws in this piece for time and space's sake let me cut it down to one central thing ultimately for me i think it boils down to the fact that thea the main character is completely utterly unlikeable selfish and even on several occasions downright dumb but not in the redeeming way that many wonderful teenage female characters are in the world of great literature no instead thea is written in such a way that her like ability factor declines substantially over the course of the novel while she continually makes decisions that she freely admits are wrong all while the author tries to pretend that thea's choices are all a part of some greater life changing lesson that will somehow help her become a worldly wise adult one day spoiler alert they aren't they're just the ridiculous and selfish choices of a ridiculous and selfish girl and please don't get me started on the horse stuff i've lived with horses over 30 years and trained with some of the finest instructors in the u s i know an accurate horse book when i read it and this is not it i realize that this is the author's debut and i will admit that she has the tools to produce something great in future but this first novel is unfortunately the opposite of great the fantastic use of language which i'm a sucker for and even the well assembled summation at the book's conclusion aren't enough to redeem the horrid characters the weak plot and occasionally softly pornographic nature of the story not kidding about the porn fyi let's hope the author's next novel redeems her talent because this one just annoyed me through the very last page","1748":"meh i finished this book the same day i started it and although structurally it was very well crafted i just kept hoping i'd reach a point where i cared about its characters was it a morality tale or coming of age story or just over hyped","1749":"the main character is vapid i didn't like any of the other characters and the narrative is repetitive oh and the fact that something bad happened is mentioned about two dozen times over hundreds of pages before it's finally all spelled out though it's not hard to guess what went down i really couldn't wait for this novel to wrap itself up so i could return it to the library","1750":"this was another quick summer read that was entertaining but not one i will remember too much teenage angst and the main character was really unlikable","1751":"while initially gripping this was ultimately a disappointment when the big scandal was revealed and then repeated and its heroine became increasingly unlikeable as she dismisses mistake after mistake and endlessly brags about what a good horsewoman she is while abusing her horses the writing was confusing at times and i grew tired of everyone saying thea's name over and over it began to seem like the author couldn't think of anything else for her characters to say i think this may have worked better as a ya book with the romance y sex scenes toned down but its hefty debut deal and scads of glowing reviews make my opinion the odd one out","1752":"this was such a good book i didn't want to put it down it really brought to life the characters people and horses and the setting early '30s north carolina and florida i'd recommend it to anyone who likes stories set in that era horse stories and or coming of age stories","1753":" the description for this book hooked me coming of age set in an all girls camp in the 1930s family secrets big reveal i could not wait for a copy at my library i ran to the bookstore to buy it and then i ran back with my tail between my legs to return it it's hard to explain why these seemingly awesome topics failed for me the writing was good the main character was not likeable but for me that is often a plus i just found myself bored and unable to feel a single thing for anything or anyone in this book not love not hate no curiosity or suspense it was flat and life is too short to finish or own a book that fails to interest me next","1754":"i read this because laura moriarty gushed about it during her appearance for read st louis reading the yonahlossee riding camp for girls was a great way to spend an afternoon on the patio as the shadows grew longer and the main character's life overtook my own i didn't always agree with the abundance of commas but i'm odd that way","1755":"this is a haunting story of 1930's depression era society sexual awakening and family bonds thea atwell and her twin brother grow up largely unsupervised roaming the grounds with their cousin on a citrus farm their personal paradise is shattered due to a series of events that lead to a tragic outcome one hot summer day thea gets sent away to the yonahlossee riding camp for girls where she finds out that her family doesn't want her back she has to find her own way to come to terms with the events in her life and who she is","1756":" i was not so angry with my situation that i could not discern beauty 2 5 stars the above phrase from the book describes my exact feelings about yonahlossee riding camp for girls i can't remember the last time i've wanted to love a book more than i wanted to love this one when the tale is about young women coming of age at an equestrian boarding school sequestered away like only the protected rich in the middle of the great depression could be you'd think that there would be so much potential for greatness in the telling yonahlossee an island of rich girls in the middle of the poorest my nana had fascinating stories about what it was like to live through the depression i love looking at our family album and seeing all of these glorious glamorous even wearing hand me downs everyone seemed so well coiffed and beautiful snapshots of history while this book was full of beautiful prose i would not consider it a beautiful snapshot of history i was a young woman when young women were powerless i was expecting a lush and scandalous story not unlike what the blurbs promised in fact i did manage to find both lush and scandalous happenings within the pages of yonahlossee the descriptions of even the most trivial things were beautifully designed and explained the amount of highlights which i made in my copy of yonahlossee were many the pain was part of the pleasure and both were my memory sadly the beautiful prose was not enough to carry a story which floundered for a great deal of the first half with no real purpose other than to serve as filler until enough time had passed to recall the main character's scandalous past i kept stubbornly reading because i knew that a big reveal was coming up around the bend heck every reader knew it this is what we'd been prepped for from the first page i was still more child than adult i was not a monster but a confused wronged girl they blamed me and so i came to yonahlossee a person worthy of blame even with the slow first half when the secrets started to come out when everything started coming to a head i was completely sucked in to the story hints of scandal past started to blur as scandal present came in to focus while i think that some of the happenings were almost too over the top once things started happening which i hadn't been expecting i was suddenly glued to the pages while i waited to see what would become of thea would she finally find the happiness that she so desperately needed after being cast aside by her family they traded you thea they sent you here and kept your brother so what happened well that is not for me to tell or i'd be giving too much away all i can say is that for me it's not necessarily about needing a good ending or a bad ending but more about finding a conclusion which resonates with the reader unfortunately i felt like i spent so much time waiting for something to happen and didn't get much to show for it other than a bunch of answers which came with little fanfare and not enough resolution for me to feel like i'd spent my precious reading time wisely back then all that want was a dangerous thing who would i recommend yonahlossee for if i had to find a niche i would probably lean toward the literary fiction crowd those preferring an emphasis on darker or vintage feeling literature while i wasn't a big fan of this book i think there's enough material here to provide for some interesting discussion a movie would be absolutely gorgeous with this setting even though the main character is of a younger age i am shelving this as adult for themes and content because it wouldn't really appeal to the mainstream ya circle but if you're going to go vintage for this book you'll need to have a martini to accompany your reading after all it's what my nana would have done","1757":" reading other reviews i'm surprised i thought that the writer takes us through the sexual awakening of a young girl in a world where young women were shut down and shut away the treatment of her becoming aware of herself her position and her struggle to make her own choices was an unflinching look at at a young woman who had grown up in complete freedom only to encounter exile and rejection when she became sexually active how she handles this and how she rights herself after a family tragedy involving her sexual explorations resolves into a beautiful statement by the author on the inner workings of separation and growth in a young adult female i am wiser and happier having read it","1758":"this book is not for everyone set in the 1930's at a boarding school in the blue ridge mountains of nc this book is about family secrets southern decorum boarding school rituals and adolescent sexuality it is provocative very engaging and the relationship between thea and her horse brings back memories of our daughter i am looking forward to reading other works by this author","1759":"if i could give this book 10 stars i would it has been so long since a book has captivated me and pulled me into another world the way this has thea is a fantastic heroine and her observations on her place in the world and what it means to be a girl with all the expectations placed on them is beautifully explored i feel emotionally exhausted after reading this but in the way only a really great book can make you feel","1760":"if you love 1920s 1930s lit are a girl ever went to summer camp or were in love with horses read this book if you're like me and all of the above apply read this book now ignore the other reviews immediately","1761":" theadora atwell is a teenage girl growing up in florida in the 1920s around the time of the depression she lives with her parents and twin brother sam and is also close with her aunt uncle and cousin georgie and loves to ride her horse at the beginning of the novel she is sent away to a boarding school for girls due to something she has done which you don't find out about until later in the story this is a coming of age story about growing up and finding who you are and your place in the world well written with an interesting central character this is a great book to read on a vacation or curl up with at home","1762":" beautiful written novel that captures clearly both the niche of the privileged during the great depression as well as the moment in time of a passionate young woman coming of age the horseback riding is a large part but i greatly enjoyed that she captured the heart of it without getting stuck on trivial novice explanations it didn't need the plot might be pretty silly if the author weren't so wonderfully talented its easy to see early on where it is going but her writing sucked me right into the story and i read it in one afternoon hope her following novels are as fantastic as this was","1763":"a really good coming of age story of a young sheltered girl who is sent away to 'camp' the reason for her banishment is cloud hanging over the story that is not revealed until almost the end of the book very well written i loved it","1764":"i finished it but i did not like it meh pointless plot of a rich girl who is moderately impacted by the depression","1765":"the writing style is beautiful plot development not so much overall it felt boring and there wasn't much closure to many of the characters in the end but maybe that was the point","1766":" fifteen year old thea atwell is send to the yonahlossee riding camp by her parents as a punishment for something she's done that has disgraced her family though it's not immediately revealed to the reader what exactly this is as it is a riding camp the novel is heavily focussed on equestrianism which is a fascinating topic to read about as an outsider while thea often treats the horses in her care with a sense of authority almost power hungry at times it's clear from the author's descriptions of the sport that not only she is an expect on the subject matter but she also feels a deep admiration for the animal unfortunately despite the promising blurb on the back cover i felt disappointed with the execution of the story thea is an unlikeable protagonist a spoiled little rich girl who really only considers her own needs her selfish actions are what land her at the yonahlossee riding camp but she doesn't seem to learn greatly or anything at all from this punishment as she simply continues to focus on what she wants and in the process repeats her previous mistake there seems little reasoning behind her actions other than perhaps boredom or stupidity and because of that i simply did not care what would happen to her next or even what terrible ordeal had forced her to the camp in the first place having said that it was obvious from early on what she had done so when the big reveal finally came it felt anticlimactic and too late despite the novel's title the yonahlossee riding camp is more a boarding school than a summer camp in fact the relationships between the girls sometimes reminded me of a classic enid blyton novel but instead aimed at an adult audience another misconception is that in spite of the frequent mention of the great depression it's not something that has many consequences for thea herself and the story could've easily been set a few decades earlier or later it's certainly an interesting setting but because of the camp's remote location this dark period in economic history doesn't have much of an impact on thea or the story as a whole the one thing that does stand out in a positive way is the truly exceptional writing author anton disclafani certainly has a way with words and her atmospheric writing paints a beautiful and almost poetic picture to the reader but the novel's only saving grace is also yet another hindrance as it makes the already slow going storyline drag even further 2 5 stars","1767":"it was pretty good nice writing style that drew you in seemed to be missing something in the plot not sure if i was just expecting too much","1768":"i must have been in the mood for this book because i loved it","1769":"this book was a very enjoyable summer read the writing is steps above typical chic lit and the setting is interesting i liked the author's style and character development","1770":"a terribly sad story about multiple people making bad choices it's beautifully written","1771":"boring very very boring barely finished it","1772":" this is terrible i have struggled through half of it and i give up the narrator thea is a whiny vacuous twit and the narration itself wanders around pointlessly while nothing much seems to happen at this point in the novel it's pretty obvious why thea was sent away eh who cares and that something distasteful may happen with the headmaster of the girls' school in the near future and that someone else like likes girls and blah blah blah i just don't want to read about any of it i thought i would like the horsey bits but i did not the author may be an equestrienne herself i don't know but she doesn't come across as having much of a feel for horses in my opinion and she does a poor job of portraying any real warmth between thea and her pony in fact i pretty much decided to stop reading after she describes an instance wherein thea beats her horse with a riding crop and states that horses are dumb they are many things and they don't obviously think and reason the way humans do but they are far from dumb i read on through the accident at the riding ring where thea is teaching the headmaster's daughters how to ride how is it that they live at a riding school with an in house riding instructor and yet it never crossed anyone's mind that they might like to learn until idiot girl thea came along btw and then i said ah screw this life is too short to read bad books","1773":"i loved this book a family tale a coming of age ~ with a bit of nc thrown in for fun","1774":"2 5 stars there are many things to like about this book i enjoyed the depression era backdrop especially when contrasted with the privileged characters the writing itself is plain but beautiful in its simplicity at times and it works for the tone of the story we can feel thea's remoteness and despondency as she takes up residence at yonahlossee unfortunately the middle dragged for me thea's remoteness grew tiresome the girls were virtually indistinguishable from one another aside from leona and while the horse aspect is a nice touch and rounded out the storyline it was a bit too much horse talk for me plus i thought thea's twin sam should've been more distinctly felt then on the heels of a somewhat mundane middle suddenly we are thrust so to speak into about 100 150 of quite graphic sex the majority of which is superfluous to the plot and by sexual i mean it would put some erotica i've read to shame i'm no prude but this was over the top and seemed like an about face from the tone and cadence in the rest of the novel not that it should've been left out entirely it just read like a flat out romance at times it's as though the author was trying to be avant garde or edgy the first few scenes were like \"oh okay wow \" one hundred pages later it was more along the lines of \"seriously \"also thea doesn't have much of a character arc she doesn't really grow or change she does come to love yonahlossee but if you like things working out as they should or as would prove interesting or even as would be \"right\" this is not the book for you in fact the ending though extremely beautifully written is really kind of blah","1775":"this book was one that reminded me much of my youth i also spent time at a girls school after high school and it was very similar to the yonahlossee riding camp i can identify with a lot of her time there but aside from that the author anton disclafani wove a tale of love murder jealousy with a bit of history into a a class book i believe all women will enjoy this book a great first book","1776":"just the kind of thing i wanted after the struggle of the last book really lovely writing easy to read pretty enjoyable plot i would have preferred more ponies however","1777":"solid writing but a little slow i finished the book still unsure of whether i hated or felt bad for the protagonist the characters were all extremes of sorts and most all of them were flawed but still not particularly endearing i didn't care for the storyline and found many aspects of it to not add up or seem out of place for the era","1778":"this book was so boring and the quality of the writing was not enough to elevate it above a 2 star rating a disappointment especially considering all the rave reviews i really don't understand all the reviews that say this book is well written it is completely dull and uninspiring and the characters are flat i kept waiting for something to happen and nothing ever did there is no conflict if you're going to have a book that isn't action driven then your characters had better be complex and interesting thea is neither in the beginning the main thing that kept me reading was wanting to find out about thea's terrible secret but one the nature of her transgression starts to become clear the book becomes a complete snoozefest dull dull dull","1779":"this review has been hidden because it contains spoilers to view it click here i wanted to like this book so much more than i actually did it's got so many things going for it from the writing to the setting but i suspect a great deal of one's enjoyment of the story will hinge on whether you need your books to have likable characters i don't require my main characters to be likable it helps but it's rarely a deal breaker because usually there is at least one supporting character to pick up the slack yonahlossee is lacking in supporting characters at all sure there i wanted to like this book so much more than i actually did it's got so many things going for it from the writing to the setting but i suspect a great deal of one's enjoyment of the story will hinge on whether you need your books to have likable characters i don't require my main characters to be likable it helps but it's rarely a deal breaker because usually there is at least one supporting character to pick up the slack yonahlossee is lacking in supporting characters at all sure there are other characters but they never seem to exist outside of thea's orbit this means that if you begin to wish thea would be hit by a massive clue by four as she makes yet another incredibly stupid decision you don't have anyone else to look forward to reading about instead you are left with thea before yonahlossee and thea at yonahlossee despite staying at the camp for the better part of a year she never seems to learn anything or change for the better or undergo any real growth at all i thought there'd be some bonding at the camp but even her best friend sissy is treated almost superficially and the rest of her bonding is reserved for the headmaster i had such high hopes but if i weren't the kind of reader who hates to leave a book unfinished i probably would have walked away more","1780":"overall it was good however i didn't like the ending it just kind of wrapped up just to wrap up that part was disappointing to me","1781":"this book over promised and under delivered very boring i could care less about the characters and struggled through it easily forgettable","1782":"this review has been hidden because it contains spoilers to view it click here enjoyed the detailed descriptions connected to the love of horses interesting study in how she survived trauma shame and family disapproval","1783":" on the surface this book has all the pieces to make an enjoyable read but something was missing for me something that's hard to put my finger on maybe soul is the word i'm looking for maybe heart maybe energy something was lacking and that made it hard for me to love this book a lot of the story is told to us rather than acted out and shown in interesting ways we don't really get to experience thea's life so much as watch it happen we are told to feel things whether that emotion rings true or not i wanted more from this book more atmosphere more horses more history more tension more dark hearts and secrets final thoughts started out promising sagged in the middle ended on a flat note","1784":"really enjoyed this novel a well written page turner great beach read favorite quotes but your family is your greatest friend my life was mine and i had to lay claim to it","1785":"this book was boring and obvious the main character has a dark secret in her history but even that extremely cheap tried and true method of creating suspense is unsuccessful because the secret is incredibly easy to guess from the beginning nothing much happens in the story as we plod along waiting for the dark secret to be revealed to us except some very repetitive sex scenes that start suddenly with no precursor around page 200 and continue until the book ends at least spacing the unimaginative sex throughout the book would have made things more consistent","1786":"spoiler free review i find it difficult to write a review about a book which i disliked especially when the book most likely isn't bad just that i didn't enjoy it the yonahlossee riding camp for girls was a strange book strange and weird and odd and predictable the writing starts with consistent short sentences which could possibly be overlooked when you become engrossed with the story however that point never really came as the book just feels shallow and naive as shallow and naive as the protagonist thea is portrayed throughout the constant switching between yonahlossee and 'before' although meant to build on the reader's understanding of thea's life simply left me slightly confused about how such moments in time are relevant and interrupts the flow to give the book a disjointed feel when the main character who is consciously reciting her past to you has absolutely no redeeming qualities it makes it incredibly difficult to 'like' the book and thea really was a naive i realise i've already called her that but honestly she was narrow minded way too sheltered child despite thea supposedly being only a year younger than i am i couldn't find anything that allowed me to relate to her in order to further my understanding of her story a major problem i had with this book was the predictability of what had happened and what would happen it was slightly boring having to slowly read through this dull build up to the big reveal of thea's scandalous past and i found the book lost my interest in the middle because of this for me a book should show a character's development over time with their lives unravelling in front of you word by word then building up to what is to be achieved progress should be made from the first page to the last allowing both the character and the reader to learn if this doesn't take place and it doesn't in the yonahlossee riding camp for girls as thea ends up repeating her self destructive senseless actions and cold hearted attitudes right the way until the end then i have to ask myself what is the point of this book why should anybody read this what can one take from such a strange story what is there to learn my only answer is that it shows you how not to be but then i don't think i'd ever act like thea anyway so honestly this book just felt pointless to me","1787":"hard to rate this one not a single likable character the parents backstory was underdeveloped","1788":"yonahlossee started off with an intriguing southern gothic sounding premise depression era teenageer thea atwell is hastily sent off to a southern finishing school to cover up a dark family scandal but it somehow veered into lurid vc andrews territory if a high class version of same it's undoubtedly a page turner but it left me feeling vaguely unsatisfied i don't know that i entirely understood thea's motivation for doing what she did eccentric family aside","1789":"ugh and that's it are the immediate reactions sad","1790":"i wanted to love this book but somehow it never came together for me the storyline was a bit disjointed jumping back and forth between the past and present and i didn't find the heroine thea particularly likable however disclafani is a good writer the best part of the book is her rich descriptions of the setting and this is only her debut novel","1791":"not worth it","1792":" i first heard about this book at the beginning if the summer and with a plot featuring 1930s society and scandal it automatically sounded like my kind of thing it took me until now to get round to reading it but i eventually demolished it over two days on a work trip a couple of long distance flights and morning of pool time was all it took i was slightly surprised at how trashy it was in parts thoroughly enjoyable but more a period romance book than the comment on society i was expecting perhaps my bad for not reading enough reviews in advance but a surprise none the less the sheer quantity of sex was also a surprise and i have to admit that the writing of these scenes also made it feel more like a romance novel than anything else kind of difficult to read at times too incest and schoolgirl sex with a much older male both feel slightly incongruous with the horse riding camp background there were other surprises too big ones involving the plot i found many of the decisions made by thea and her family interesting and the ultimate fates of other key characters were certainly unexpected it was definitely a good holiday read scandal high society and the deep south all make for a good plot and having recently returned from the area i loved the descriptions of the country landscape and weather if you're a horse fan you're also in for a treat although i suppose that goes without saying i hadn't read any horsey novels since i was a little girl and i was surprised at how much i enjoyed these bits of the plot the story also lead me to some interesting reflections on what it meant to be a woman both at the time and in the southern states ultimately though i didn't particularly thea and found myself with a slightly bad taste in my mouth and feeling slightly empty inside afterwards much like her after one of her romps in fact","1793":"i liked this book but did not love it had read some rave reviews when it first hit the shelves and was expecting much more it was a typical coming of age book although it was supposedly set in blowing rock nc which i have visited there was no mention of that beyond the first page which i found curious the plot was nothing exceptional and the story followed a typical path it was easy reading and i personally found it enjoyable in spite of its simplistic writing style","1794":"at first i thought i had picked up a ya book by mistake and perhaps that is the official category but this book offers somuch serious food for thought its a beautifully written story of family as well as a young girl's coming of age story i listened to it and really enjoyed the reader and the pacing not sure if it would feel too slow on the written page buti loved the feel of it","1795":"this review has been hidden because it contains spoilers to view it click

uncomfortable not only does the main character a 16 year old girl have sex with a first cousin but she also ends up seducing a married man with no apologies this is the only book that ive disliked

been generous and given it 2 stars if that expectation was fulfilled on the scale of grim disappointing and worthless endings id give it an 8 more","1796":"scandalous a great summer read","1797":"i wavered back and forth with this i actually liked the character even when i was really frustrated with the choices she was making beautiful writing too i'm surprised at how angry some reviewers are about this they seem so surprised by the content i knew what this was going to be about from the start maybe that's why i was only meh about that don't know anyway i think disclafani has talent will be interested in seeing her next piece of work","1798":"another first reads win june 1 can't wait for it to arrive book arrived today june 6 and the reading has begun the novel is set in depression era florida and north carolina and is narrated by the achingly human fifteen year old thea atwell alternating between present and past the story unfolds in her voice she has been banished to the elite yonahlossee riding camp for girls away from all she knows and loves why this is so is not revealed completely until well into the book the reader accompanies thea as she evolves from naive girl into a more mature young woman in the year she spends at the school prior to her banishment thea has had an innocent idyllic childhood shared only with her twin sam and her slightly older cousin georgie much of her days are spent with her beloved horse sasi when she is not being home schooled by her physician father the family is unusually isolated and self contained with only georgie's family for social interaction this world explodes when a family tragedy occurs and thea finds herself hurriedly transplanted in the mountains of north carolina slowly she finds her footing in the previously unknown world of girls friendships and social class the one constant is her love of horses riding and her fearlessness while competing much to her surprise what first seemed a punishment becomes a gift which expands her horizons and leads to a richer future ms disclafani has delivered a tour de force with her debut novel the language is gorgeous the story is complex and tantalizing and thea herself unforgettable thank you first reads for the opportunity to read and review this wonderful book","1799":"waste of my time","1800":"so this book has some trashy bits just enough to make it kind of a romantic page turner for shallow girls who are super into horses the title of the book comes from the name of the camp school where our main character thea atwell has been shipped off to after scandalous behavior it's the 1930s and thea is a floridian from a wealthy family mom has citrus money dad is a doctor and her twin sam is super into animals add dad's brother's family a more pedestrian lot and it's a tight knit group out there in the heat and oranges by contrast the camp is in the blue ridge mountains of north carolina and is chock full of southern debutantes being from florida thea is not necessarily their kind as we all know florida is a little different when it comes to the rules and regulations governing this type of southern wealth this is where girls from cotton textiles wealth are sent to hold tight until marriage and ride their horses thea is sent there unexpectedly and as the reader we are carefully strung along to learn exactly what went down that would cause her to be sent away in this rash manner this event creates a lot of the tension within the book you get an idea of what happens soon enough but maybe just not the magnitude since the story takes place during the great depression and it involves characters reeking of money you can expect that not everything is going to turn out swimmingly for these debutantes on ice up there in the mountains one would think that would make for a darkness within the book but really it played second fiddle to the sexual awakening of thea there are some salacious scenes please refer to my previous mentioning of trashy bits this part of the book coupled with debutantes off riding horses all the time made it difficult to really take anything seriously and maybe you shouldn't cause the story is steamy the girls are gettin slutty and the boys have throbbing members straining against their linen pants oh my oh my oh my","1801":"i loved the first half of this book as it explored a young girl's family life and her subsequent exile to a riding school because of a secret shameful act the second half dragged on once we learned the secret and were reminded of it in more ways than anyone really wants to know","1802":" tigers in red weather for girls and with horses and it sucked me in quickly thea atwell found herself in the middle of a scandal at the age of 15 and was exiled by her family to yonahlossee riding camp in north carolina the camp is a world of complex social rules that thea struggles to fit in to and i was transported back to my youth though mine was notably less scandalous a camp for girls new friendships horses and crushes but this book has so much more full of lies scandal and sex it's beautifully written and the exquisite details make the book come alive the yonahlossee riding camp will stay with me for a long time","1803":" i stayed up late plummeting through the book and would still recommend it as a good read the setting a riding school for rich and sometimes wayward girls is near blowing rock nc the great depression is at least a minor character the terrible secret that unfolds slowly drives the plot effectively but there was something about the 15 16 year old narrator that never quite gelled maybe it's just that she didn't really know herself maybe disclafani wasn't willing to let us inside quite far enough","1804":" this book was just strange let's just do this what worked for me i liked the setting i don't know much about the 30s or the great depression so i liked reading about the impact that had on some of the richer families in the south i like horses i liked the description of the dresses and jewelry the girls wore to the dances what didn't work for me i didn't like the main character thea to be honest i didn't like many of the characters they weren't very well written or believable and they weren't very damn likeable but they were supposed to be likeable the big secret was guessable from about 30 pages in and it was kind of ick i think the book was supposed to be feminist but mostly it was just annoying i didn't like the way the horses were treated the author had a weird fixation on thea's menstrual cycle and the sexual scenes weren't as much titillating as they were clunky and kind of gross to be honest although given the situations they were in maybe they were supposed to be the whole book fell flat for me i find it more depressing when a book could be great but just can't get there than i do when a book never had that potential this book could have said a lot about women's roles in the 30s about feminism women discovering their sexuality exploring taboos etc but it would skirt the edge of these things and then give up not impressed not at all","1805":"closer to 3 5 as a reading experience i really enjoyed this book you fully inhabit this world of girls and horses and the complicated relationships with both but as a character i really couldn't like thea but as a former teenage girl i could also identify with her in lots of ways so there's that too but she really just is kind of the worst but at the same time not i don't know how to put it","1806":"i enjoyed this book somehow it read quickly without being a fast paced story i can understand why some people have not liked this book but you pretty much know where the whole thing is going from the beginning if you can get past certain aspects of the storyline that are a little disconcerting it is an enjoyable read the one thing i wish is that the author would have dug deeper into the girls' friendships","1807":"i liked this book but was a bit turned off by the coming of age sexual encounters perhaps 40 years ago i would have liked it more but thought it did not fit with the time setting of the book oh well maybe that's just because that's pretty much when i that age","1808":"this book was just not for me","1809":"a good first novel a coming of age story set in 1930's florida and north carolina the author should have trusted her stories more the narrator tells us what to think too much and most of the secondary characters contain cliched two dimensional attributes despite all that it kept me reading","1810":" summer and camp well that's not what this is about it takes place at a camp but it makes us face the issue of female sexuality and how scary that is in any era for those around her to want to need to enjoy what as a girl you have never been told about except to be told you don't have those feelings like boys or you are abnormal if you do when in reality you are perfectly normal it is 3 5 4 star book the consequences of being aware and acting in those notions and the guilt that they will bring it is an interesting story set against the depression","1811":"i really liked this book and its personal and emotional journey of 15 year old thea even as you may not sympathize with the main character it is interesting to watch the story unfold and the changes and dynamics within her relationships family and especially regarding her twin i thought it was very enjoyable and a neat account of a life during the time of the depression although this was a wealthy family who managed","1812":"i would have given it four stars for the first 3 4 of the book which is riveting but the ending is lifeless","1813":"this review has been hidden because it contains spoilers to view it click here i'm not sure how i feel about this one i gave it 4 stars because the writing was wonderful and i could picture a camp of girls in the 30s however the secret that got thea sent to the camp is not at all what i was expecting this book was a tad disturbing and slow going in the beginning but toward the half way point it really picked up i think i would have liked more details on the fight between sam and georgie and also more about how the parents found out and how that all went down it wa i'm not sure how i feel about this one i gave it 4 stars because the writing was wonderful

toward the half way point it really picked up i think i would have liked more details on the fight between sam and georgie and also more about how the parents found out and how that all went down it was this big secret and then the author was so vague about it more","1814":"thought she captured teens on the brink of adulthood beautifully a bit nerve wracking to read as a parent but it read true","1815":"i love novels about boarding schools and summer camps so i thought this was going to be fun to read but it's dull and predictable well written though so i'll give it the second star","1816":"very slow book","1817":"unfortunately not a very well written book the characters were not believable and the author did little with the history of the time","1818":" i almost didn't read this book even wanted to start one of those books left unread shelves because of it it was a little slow to start a little annoying a little scattered in the narration but i'm glad i stuck with it because it gradually became one of those books i really looked forward to reading every night i appreciated the time period and how the characters changed it clearly depicted one of those eras in our american history when things changed quickly and irrevocably and looking back now we can see how it would affect us as a people don't give up on this book","1819":"this review has been hidden because it contains spoilers to view it click here want to know what i liked about this book the horses and the connections the kids had to the animals otherwise most of the 'coming of age' parts freaked me out and waiting until 2 3 of the book is over before finally telling us why she was sent away really i was hoping i would love it not so much at least i was able to check one book off on my way to reading a few more books than last year","1820":"although parts of this were well written i had a hard time connecting with any of the characters in the story","1821":"great bittersweet coming of age story from the female perspective","1822":"beautifully written","1823":"historical fiction fifty shades of gray looking for alaska ick how did this book garner the great book reviews that it received","1824":"this review has been hidden because it contains spoilers to view it click here my feelings are so conflicted about this book i really liked it at times but despised it at others is this how i feel about most books perhaps i thought the tension of \"what had she done \" was so excellent at the beginning and it drew me right in as did the author's ability to describe everything with such precision but i found these two things were what ended up driving me mad over the course of the book as well i was disappointed that the thing she had done wasn't revealed until the en my feelings are so conflicted about this book i really liked it at times but despised it at others is this how i feel about most books perhaps i thought the tension of \"what had she done \" was so excellent at the beginning and it drew me right in as did the author's ability to describe everything with such precision but i found these two things were what ended up driving me mad over the course of the book as well i was disappointed that the thing she had done wasn't revealed until the end and it was really only that she'd had a sexual liaison that she shouldn't have i know this was made worse because of the time period the novel was set in but i couldn't help but think it was much ado about nothing then when i found out that there was a near murder involved it is much too late in the book for me to care about what part thea played in it all because i'd grown to dislike her i feel a reader should never dislike the protagonist so much that he doesn't care about her...he always needs to care even if it is to hate the person the relationship with mr holmes was so wrong and truly disgusting to read i skimmed those parts at best while it was meant to show that thea was normal and what she had done was not her defining characteristic i thought it cheapened her made her immoral like she was trying to prove she wasn't and really an unfortunate way to move the plot forward the author has some beautifully descriptive prose and for that i did enjoy the book i also loved the description of the horses and the outlet they created for the other characters the tension between the girls at the camp gave me a window into a time period and a world i'll never actually see so that too was engaging overall i'd recommend skipping this one more","1825":"not my cup of tea didn't care much about the sexual awakenings of teenage girls in the 1930s or whatever didn't care about the family didn't care about the characters","1826":"good interesting brings you into it but it's ultimately sad especially sad to imagine a child in that position","1827":" i feel like i should be drinking whiskey or something while i write this review for some reason instead of my coffee this book felt a little sordid to me a little dirty and tarnished but that was ok this review contains spoilers so if you don't want to know what happens i am letting you know here that i talk about it thea is a good girl from a good family in florida she is smart spoiled curious and daring she has a little pony that is all hers her twin brother sam and the many adventures they take under the sun and over the land together but as thea gets older this isn't enough something big and terrible happens and thea is sent to yonahlossee riding camp as punishment this is where the story begins with thea's arrival at camp the reader does not know why this is happening but you feel the tension between thea and her father that she has committed some offense and now she must pay and wait it out away from home and all that she loves but at least she riding thea loves to ride and takes solace in the horses she also begins to take solace from the headmaster who is young handsome and romantically tragic he is also married with children as thea sets out upon her seduction of the headmaster holmes the reader begins to form an idea of the nature of thea's big bad thea and her twin brother live in a dream world on the citrus farm but it is also a prison of sorts as thea grows older and more mature her sexuality is awakened unfortunately for her the boy she is experimenting with is her cousin george the only other boy around her age that she has contact with there is more to this story than i will reveal but it doesn't end well for thea sam and george it is really quite tragic the ending trailed off a bit for me i felt like we were delivered the boom and then blah it was anticlimactic i was disappointed i read this book with only a few breaks i just had to know what the heck this girl did it was a pretty good book minus the ending in my opinion i immediately loaned it to my friend jennifer who enjoyed it as well it's not an easy read with the underage sex and incest but books don't need to always be comfortable","1828":" i don't get why people are describing this book as compelling or sexy or even worthwhile i was bored and i thought the writing was pretty bad and the supposedly sexy scenes seemed either randomly placed or too awkward to elicit any real emotional response i never went through a horse phase like so many girls do so maybe that's part of the disconnect but i love camp and western nc and weird family stories and coming of age tales so it's not like the potential wasn't there for me also i feel like disclafini uses too many commas i do not recommend","1829":"really great novel about a girl during the great depression coming of age and coming into her own sense of sexuality her parents send her off to what she believes is a riding camp but becomes more of an education about herself her desires and the workings of the world it's a sexier book than i expected the pacing is great while she's at the camp but the ending falls flat for all the energy the rest of the novel maintained still a lovely engaging summer read","1830":"i love riding camp all girls schools and the 1930s i did not love this book","1831":"i only read this book because it was supposedly about camp yonahlossee the camp in north carolina i went to as a child it used the name but otherwise did not accurately depict the camp or its history as someone mentioned on the camp yonahlossee facebook page this book would be more accurately called 50 shades of yonahlossee if you like romance novels you'd like this i don't read fiction typically and i never read romance novels not since i read forever as a preteen generally the book is about a teenage girl from florida near gainesville who is sent away to the yonahlossee riding camp for girls because of some family scandal it's fairly well written although a bit cheesy and predictable but i wouldn't recommend it to my friends","1832":"i was hesitant to start this book after reading some of the reviews but i couldn't put it down once i did start it i'm glad i decided to read it i will be sharing this book with my friends","1833":" 3 7 stars if we're being specific here's why my main criticism is perfectly expressed by priscilla gilman in her boston globe review \"the book has been praised as romantic and sexy but to me it was anything but it's not about romance at all and the sex scenes that riddle its pages are at best leaden and awkward and at worst comical there are a lot of throbbing groins and \"slick\" or \"trembling\" thighs tongues thrusting and hands groping groaning and moaning but very little erotic energy or sensuous description \"that being said there are many admirable qualities about this novel and for me she was the most successful in capturing the dynamics of teenage girls disclafani really hits on that need one feels to impress others almost more than oneself that so often stems for adolescent insecurity by having thea enter the hyper cliquey environment having never before interacted with girls her own age she's able to illuminate the girls' seemingly minor interactions in a way that feels revelatory of our own teenage years it might be of interest to know that i originally thought the yonahlossee riding camp for girls was written by a man which seemed a valid explanation of why he was so wrong regarding female adolescents and their sex lives now that i know that anton disclafani is actually a she i'm not sure what to think ultimately i would love to know why thea's voice was so thoughtful and realistic when speaking about other girls and so terribly off for a 16 year old when discussing men","1834":" i have been anticipating getting my hands on a copy of this book for quite some time when i saw it sitting on a shelf at one of my favorite used book stores i jumped at the opportunity to read it much soon than originally thought i plowed through some things that i had started only to be really disappointed bah i'm an emotional reader and have never attempted the massive undertaking of writing a novel i'm not here to critique form or content more my assessment is that i was left outside of the fence from the beginning of the book and can't say that i wanted to enter after the story unfolded i liked not knowing the reveal of the purpose for thea being sent away but it was also predictable enough","1835":"a young girl trying to understand her complicated feelings growig up withonly her twin brother and male cousin thea has much to learn","1836":" i was deceived by the good reviews this book had and wish i had read goodreads reviews first the protagonist thea isn't very interesting or engaging in fact she's downright unlikeable the book tries to make you feel sorry for her situation but her character negates any pity her family is also unlikeable and flat what about the new people she meets at the riding camp are her school teachers and classmates quirky and memorable not really no they are either generic and nice or unlikeable none of the characters or locations had any charm or endearing characteristics the story is a waste of time i wasn't emotionally stimulated and did not come away from it having learned anything or felt entertained don't bother with this one","1837":"novel set during the depression about a 16 year old twin girl who is sent away to finishing school after a horrific family incident chapters weave back and forth from present time at the girls riding school to the time around the incident thea grows up through her experience at the school","1838":" i figured this book is right up my alley historical fiction set in the depression era about horses and an elite boarding school i love boarding school tales perhaps because the only kids i knew who went to boarding school were very bad or else obscenely wealthy but even those tended to go to private day schools in the pre harry potter era most kids viewed being sent away to boarding school as a punishment and that's how it functions for thea the 15 year old narrator the problem is as so many other reviewers noted she's inherently unlikeable and it's not clear whether the writer made this choice intentionally because she is not meant to be likeable or whether she simply failed to generate any sympathy from the reader about her protaganist it's easy to hate thea's wealthy parents who kept her and her twin brother isolated from the rest of the world on their sprawling estate near the family orange groves social snobbery deems the local school not good enough and the twins are home schooled by their father but most of their days are spent outdoors thea rides her pony and her gentle brother looks for natural specimens for his menagerie the only other child with whom they are permitted to interact is their cousin george and strangely even after the three kids reach puberty they are still not only sharing a room but very often a bed maybe this was normal for the 1930s but given how often the author describes their mansion house it seems a bit odd that the kids don't have their own rooms it is also entirely predictable that barred all company of children their own age and poorly socialized outside their own families the three kids develop an unnerving dependence on each other it hardly takes 20 pages before you catch an ominous foreshadowing of incest although that may or may not describe what actually happened which is dangled before the reader like a huge dark secret for 3 4 of the book even though it's fairly easy to guess why thea was sent away the chapters are interspersed the past in thea's florida home the present in the riding camp which she sadly realizes is not just a summer destination for her but also a year long private school during which time she is not permitted to see her family not even for christmas at first she's horrified but eventually learns to love the school she makes friends becomes popular has an affair with the headmaster and excels at riding yet for a narrator who purports to love horses as the author does she's surprisingly cruel to them in several scenes drawing blood by whipping her pony in florida raking her school mare's side with spurs yanking the bit so hard the horse bleeds from her mouth this is not how a skilled rider operates i rode for many years before moving to the city and never did i find cause to draw blood from the bit whip or spur if that is what it takes to get your horse to perform for you then you've gone way way wrong in the schooling horses aren't smart enough to forgive either in likelihood such actions would have made both her pony at home and the mare at school terrified of thea i have seen such cruelty in those who like to ride because it makes them seem important but not in anyone who truly loves horses thea is no horsewoman just a spoiled girl who wants to be the best rider because it flatters her ego it's not entirely clear how much we the readers ought to despite thea or whether we're supposed to sympathize with her she had a very poor upbringing despite being materially spoiled for example she had no discussion with her mother of what to do with the onset of her period and likewise her sexual irresponsibility is probably also a result of no sex ed whatsoever not even the usual preserve your virginity until marriage discussion that a typical well bred girl of the 1930s might have had because she is a child it's easy enough to blame her horrible family but even at the conclusion of the book when she is a grown woman her relationship with her formerly beloved twin brother is destroyed forever and she barely speaks to her parents i think that is a reflection of what a dreadful person she is or maybe she is supposed to be likeable and the author just failed altogether in all fairness she's a decent writer i wasn't bored but i was very often depressed by this dreary tale of a spoiled rich girl's character being ruined forever mostly by her own actions","1839":"i absolutely loved this book it was so sad and beautiful and heartbreaking so many things","1840":"this book was so promising when it started the author can write beautiful passages but the story was just not there for me i gave up with about 100 pages to go the characters are either unattractive or not really developed the whole thing made me impatient","1841":"not sure why so many people disliked this i thought it was a lovely summer read","1842":"i just read this one and although it was interesting i found the first person narration flattened some of the other characters in the book i did not get a real feel for thea's twin brother sam or her mother when thea talked about them i felt it was one dimensional and would have liked to hear the story from their perspective the story itself was interesting and different but again i would have preferred a different style of story telling","1843":"i have to agree with the slow burn comment i will review this one later","1844":"meh disappointed in this after the massive pr hype merged review i must say i was underwhelmed by this book but i am most impressed by the publisher's pr prowess because it has gotten rave reviews in every magazine i routinely read and trust for such things not bad pretty good but not great","1845":"i did not love this book it was at times vulgar and just gross to read i did finish it because i did want to see what happened but morally it is way off","1846":"about halfway through book i had a hard time trying to keep my attention to book but finally finished it not too impressive leaves you a little sad","1847":"this book reminds me of homes' may we be forgiven koch's the dinner shoul's the burgess boys u0026amp tartt's the goldflinch a horrible disaster occurs u0026amp the hero in this case heroine can never quite get out from under the shadow of guilt but this book is more then that it's a coming of age story back in the day when girls weren't supposed to come of age it's a story of a strong girl when girls u0026amp women were supposed to be weak it's a survival story","1848":"enjoyed this coming of age period piece by discalfani it had a mellow pace that suited the story and helped create the tone and atmosphere it was a story of a girl and how the result of her sexual awakening affects her life and those around her","1849":"i thought this was a good story very interesting i was not put off by the main character at all and while this is a coming of age story it is also a story of family and how one can overcome one's family and how some people never do it had a good message and a unique take away","1850":"i was very disappointed in this book i'd heard good things but none of the characters were at all likable the backstory when revealed was neither interesting not sufficient to motivate her current behavior","1851":"not what i expected","1852":"not my favorite probably because the main character wasn't that sympathetic still some nice writing and intriguing plot twist at the end with her sacrificing herself for her friend kicked out of school for an infraction she didn't commit as opposed to not being kicked out for the more serious offenses she did","1853":"i enjoyed the north carolina and florida depression era setting of this novel the writing is lush and sensual and details about horseback riding were evocative and convincing the competition between the girls at the camp creates tension and i kept turning the pages to find out what happened to the young woman's cousin","1854":"this book was ok it kept my attention the whole way through because i wanted to see how it ended but most of the characters were pretty flat and i wasn't a fan of the hugely inappropriate relationships thea was involved in i wavered between thinking she was a victim and an aggressor in them i did enjoy the imagery of the camp u0026amp thea's passion for horses","1855":"this book by disclafani was surprising and enjoyable to me i did not know what exactly to expect but the book was better than all my expectations the main character is very complex and because of that she is very interesting the interplay between the girls and others is interesting the story goes back and forth from the original family to the riding camp as e learn more and more about thea as she works out more and more about herself a good read j robert ewbank author john wesley natural man and the isms wesley's wars and to whom it may concern","1856":"wow in reading the reviews people either love this book or hate it i thought it was okay i read it really fast because i wanted to know what was going to happen but the story is just a tad too scandalous and tried to be covert about it for too long i would kind of categorize this as a blend of southern writing and chick lit definitely not a literary masterpiece but maybe a good beach read","1857":"a very fluid read beautifully written a story of growing up a loss of innocence and self discovery excellent","1858":"the yonahlosse riding camp is a place set in the 1930's where rich southern girls are sent away from their families to live due to their improper behaviors improper friendships mostly improper relationships with boys the narrator thea is sent away from her florida home southern but not the real south after a series of shocking incidents threaten to ruin thea's family and their good name the author's love of horseback riding is very evident and it provides the setting of the story and the context for several incidents in the book the story is compelling i always wanted to know more it's not in my humble opinion the blockbuster summer read that some critics claim it is but it's a great book interesting story and enough intrigue to keep you out of trouble","1859":"plus points for being a not 600 page page turner minus points for incest awkward sex scenes and weird feelings","1860":"an interesting intriguing story about twin thea a 15 year old girl from a wealthy florida family who is sent away from her home because of an inappropriate relationship with her cousin georgie at yonahlossee she is finally around other girls for the first time and continues to be fearless and strong minded she becomes the school camp's best horse rider and begins another inappropriate relationship a sad but well written and thought provoking book","1861":"this is book is very well written and an important story of what it was like to be a certain kind of girl at this time in american history and it is sexy and subversive and interesting but it left me with some uncomfortable feelings particularly about the lack of connection in the main character's family of origin i felt it could have been explored more in any event i do recommend this book but don't expect it to be all camp and ponies this book is darker than that","1862":"from what i have been told this book was touted as a ya novel the sex is explicit in it and in no way should the book be in a young teens library i have talked to others about this book we all agreed and laughed over the fact we stuck with the book as it held our interest but never went anywhere with the plot i said i kept expecting something big to happen but it never did it was more just a slice of life of the main character thea i guess that's really what family life is about always waiting for something big but really for many nothing big ever happens just life happens it's a strange book that you commit to read and keeps you holding your commitment but i found myself waiting and waiting and waiting for something big for that reason i think the ending is a bit weak i think the book should've been a couple of chapters longer to finish up more business from the beginning of the book","1863":"yikes i'm not sure what to make of this on the one hand i was reasonably engrossed for much of the book it held my attention yay on the other hand i'm left just a little baffled whatever the author was trying to achieve with thea's character i didn't get it i didn't understand her or her motivations for doing the things she did i did not find her to be a sympathetic character it's not even that she was intriguingly flawed which i appreciate in a protagonist i just found her pretty distasteful it seems like the author wasn't sure what she wanted to do with the character or what she wanted to say with the book as a whole","1864":"this was a different kind of story about a girl who couldn't follow the path her parents planned for her they sent her away and she was a better person for it","1865":"liked the book but didn't love it i liked the writing style found it kept my attention","1866":"3 9 intriguing yet very different than what i expected but maybe i didn't read the initial reviews carefully","1867":" free pre publication copy provided by real readers this book provides an interesting twist on the coming of age story though parents may wish to check out the content before gifting it to their teenage daughters theodora is sent to yonahlossee after some 'incident' the full details of which we don't learn until late in the book however the lingering question is played with throughout the story and the reader gets a good idea of what has probably happened what we don't find out until the very end however are the far reaching and tragic consequences the rest of the story is a playful and somewhat steamy romp through a teenage girl's stay at an all girls riding school in the 1920 30s however don't be fooled by the 'all girls' reference i think there were additional elements this story was lacking which could have presented the reader with a more realistic boarding school experience there were some quite detailed sex scenes but really that seems to be what this story is about one girl's love of horses and having sex with the wrong people and of course the unforeseen consequences of her actions that said it was well written and i would rather read this book than '50 shades' at least yonahlassee has a good story behind it","1868":"i was equally enthralled by and disappointed in this book exquisite prose alone does not a great book make the story had so much potential but many thoughts seemed unfinished and hollow i sure wish it could all have been fleshed out more except the parts that qualify for erotica oddly i can completely see this being turned into a movie a la girl interrupted i'd love to be able to rate this a 2 5","1869":"the author missed a big point sex between a 15 year old and her 31 year old school director is rape even if it is consensual","1870":"this book should be subtitled a memoir of masturbation and menstruation and that's part of the big problem really i feel like the author way trying too hard to be provocative rather than actually write a good and well thought out story while disclafani's actual writing is good no doubt the story often did not make sense i totally do not understand why thea did much of what she did as well as several of the other main characters motivation was consistently unclear i feel like a story about a sheltered girl learning about life would be good a story about a girl's complicated relationship with her mother and or her twin would be good but throwing in completely random and provocative details just for the sake of writing the next great coming of age novel doesn't make sense to me it's not reality coming of age does not have to equate with had lots of sex with people i never should have this book could have been better than that","1871":"well written but sad families deal with all sorts of problems no matter what their socioeconomic status","1872":" i didn't know anything about this when i picked it up at the bookstore after overhearing a woman tell her friend that she really liked it it was a perfect beach read but she couldn't remember anything about it now not a ringing endorsement exactly but i was at the beach and wanted something light and i agree about it being mostly forgettable but i can't say i liked it much i didn't feel like i understood thea enough or cared enough about her to find anything interesting in her terrible choices","1873":"'i smiled too but not bc i was amused i smiled so that i was indistinguishable from the other girls' p44an olive fork as two tines a lemon fork three

p383","1874":"for a first novel disclafani did an incredible job being a native of the nc mountains and having been to a 'riding' camp there as a child but certainly not during the depression i was anxious to read this book great story line well written and a nice change look forward to seeing what she writes next","1875":"an excellent read an intriguing story with a young protagonist who seemed so real","1876":"very pretty prose not sure about the message but i enjoyed it","1877":"i didn't pay close enough attention to what this book was about before i started reading it is not a book i would recommend to anyone i know since it is an overtly sexual one it should have been called the sexual awakening of a girl with no moral compass i can't say it wasn't well written but this was just not for me","1878":"this review has been hidden because it contains spoilers to view it click here quick easy read i liked the way it jumped back and forth between the present and past sort of revealing things slowly it was a little unbelievable how every boy or man she came across had to instantly have her but i guess that kept the story's momentum going i liked the ending too that she moved on and got past what everyone thought of her especially her parents and had a normal life","1879":"i loved this it was a juicy escape to being a confused teenage girl it's not that i enjoyed my teenage years i didn't so awkward i simply appreciate being transported and i was it took me back to how i felt when i was a teenager except with a lot more drama angst and scandal","1880":"50 shades of dreck horses and horny debutantes swooning over the loss of their daddy's money during the depression the poor horses","1881":"spoiler alert mr rochester is keeping a horrible secret from jane eyre and the longer he delays telling her what it is the more horrible his secret had better be after months of anguished sighing we don't want to find out that he cheated on his taxes or ripped the tag off his mattress we want to be appalled that's the challenge anton disclafani sets up in her first novel a dreadful secret keeps accruing our compound interest but can the author pay off the debt of suspense when the bill comes due trust her -- she can \"the yonahlossee riding camp for girls\" is a 20th century gothic tale that reads like a lusty cousin of bronte's classic in the year 1930 thea atwell has been banished to a remote boarding school in north carolina she's scared and humiliated but no one must know her \"terrible secret \" her gossipy new classmates can only guess what would bring a new student to their leafy finishing school mid summer trouble with a boy the headmistress seems to know but even in private she can't bring herself to mention it directly she advises thea to keep an eye out for \"anything unusual anything bodily \" acne dandruff thea will only reveal that she \"could not be forgiven \"for all its overwrought mortification there's something delicious about thea's ever escalating unnameable shame the nubile students prance around the truth in their leather boots riding their stallions until the pages feel sweaty and still thea keeps teasing us with this burlesque dance of concealment \"i was a nasty girl with nasty thoughts \" she claims but on the contrary we see a serious observant young woman disclafani who teaches creative writing at washington university in st louis may be under more pressure than thea one misstep and all this erotic tension could collapse into prurient melodrama fortunately \"the yonahlossee riding camp for girls\" is no one trick phony even as thea keeps wetting her lips to tell us the unspeakable truth we're lured into more complex and provocative aspects of her story although the narrator recalls this troubled time of her life from many decades later we experience these shocks and revelations in the cloister of her 15 year old mind \"half girl half woman \" we're caught in the current of those momentous months of 1930 when she came of age there's nothing unpleasant about this pricey girls school but until arriving here thea has led a life of almost unimaginable seclusion on her family's \"private utopia\" in the florida wilderness \"i had never been alone with so many girls \" she says \"i almost never saw other children \" homeschooled by her father she and her twin brother have lived their entire lives like characters on prospero's island learning how to make friends how to behave around boys she's not related to how to interact with adults -- all the social skills of a normal life compose a crash course for thea and in the distance we can hear the reverberations of another crash between the irrational exuberance of \"the great gatsby\" and the grinding starvation of \"the grapes of wrath \" disclafani presents an eery transitional moment in these early months the great depression is still just a depression surely good times are just around the corner at yonahlossee everything goes on as it always has the maids draw the baths and the girls practice their elocution lessons but periodically a classmate vanishes amid rumors of a family fortune ruined what charges this finishing school story is the clever way disclafani has structured the novel as thea struggles to find her place at yonahlossee in \"the nuances of hierarchy the subtleties of position \" she repeatedly flashes back to the febrile weeks before her expulsion from home where as her mother used to insist \"your family is your greatest friend \" there we see vignettes of a proud compound insulated from the outside world like some larger version of her brother's carefully maintained terrarium somehow her self satisfied parents never imagined that anything could infiltrate the clammy atmosphere of their paradise -- as though adolescent hormones could be controlled and tended as expertly as the family's vast orange groves this ultimately is the novel's most daring aspect its winding exploration of adolescent sexuality no thea doesn't sleep with her brother -- keep guessing at yonahlossee disclafani re creates the spun glass fantasy of decorum complete with corsets and lessons in lady behavior \"we understood that desire was a dangerous thing that needed to be carefully handled \" thea says \"like a mother's antique perfume bottle \" there's wry wit in that simile but when the wild horses of desire gallop through this novel they prove to be extraordinarily dangerous from one angle -- say above the neck -- \"the yonahlossee riding camp for girls\" seems like the most old fashioned counterrevolutionary kind a novel despite some explicitly lubricated scenes it's downright victorian in its insistence that when a young woman strays outside the bounds of sexual propriety she ruins herself and those around her but disclafani is a crafty mistress of those pious conventions her heroine must confront the old harlot or saint choice but she won't ultimately accept either role here is a young woman coming to understand the varieties of sexual experience -- from abuse to delight -- without renouncing her desire \"there was always this \" thea confesses \"the hard kernel of want in my throat i could not push it away i did not want to \"that sounds subversive even today -- that a young woman can luxuriate in sexual pleasure sow destruction acknowledge the pain of her actions and still conclude that she's ultimately worth it watch out men are allowed complicated regrets about moral transgressions but women rarely get such a pass sensing that harsh judgment from home and school and world thea concedes \"i'm not a right girl \" but she's fearless and she's riding to win","1882":"not what i was expecting one of the storylines was entertaining while the other was a little much for me","1883":" i enjoyed this book about depression era times and the coming of age for a 15 year old her wealthy family status protected her from the usual financial woes of that time but her misbehavior in regards to discovering her sexuality led to her family's punishment of being sent away to a riding camp the puritanical thinking of that time and the dual standards for boys vs girls in dealing with raging hormones is evident a family struggles with these issues and an underlying tragedy is revealed as the book progresses","1884":"just not that interested to finish the book while it seems to depict the life of a young southern girl of privilege during the early '30's not a compelling read will watch for author's next book because her skill with language flow pressed me","1885":"this took me longer than usual i didn't love it and rush to devour it but neither did i avoid it it was just a very slow read for me i'm glad i didn't give up though while not a favorite i am glad to have read it","1886":" i loved this book out of the gate i loved the era the characters u0026amp the unknown aspect of what really happened about 3 4 of the way through the book i started to not like the main character as much her behavior u0026amp internal dialogue seemed very different from her in the beginning i guess i was hoping for the best out of the character despite the trouble she found herself in but i didn't really see that out of her i would probably give this 3 5 stars since i really couldn't put it down however i was disappointed i suppose the emotion the book pulled from me even the dislike of the main character means the book was a success","1887":"this is an arc courtesy of librarything early reviewers i was not compensated in any way for this review the yonahlossee riding camp for girls takes place during the great depression in the south and tells the story of thea atwell a 15 year old girl who was sent away to this camp due to an unspeakable event that had recently occurred the reader is teased with this mystery as we get pieces of the story on and off throughout the book until we find out what indiscretion thea actually committed the camp was a bit of a culture shock for thea as the only interaction she had with people her own age was with her twin brother sam and her cousin georgie thea is a very flawed character she is coming to terms with her sexuality and develops crushes on unsuitable people with disastrous results thea very well understands the inappropriateness of her actions and continues to do so anyway which in my mind made her a very unlikeable character however surprisingly she became a fiercely loyal friend to one of her roommates at camp and even took the blame for an infraction this roommate committed which was her redeeming quality she also came to care strongly for the daughters of the headmaster and headmistress of the camp the youngest especially and even began teaching all three of the daughters how to ride although thea had some ulterior motives overall this book enraptured me i was lured through the book with promise of the revelation of the mysterious incident that set these events in motion i found myself craving the occassional memory scene and grimacing during the camp scenes as she led herself further and further down a self destructing path this was not a typical happy ending book and in fact had some very unpleasant conclusions it was however a book about reaping the consequences of your actions and that's exactly what thea had to do","1888":"this is one of those peculiar books in which you love the story but despise the main character the scenery the horses the other characters i loved it all thea not so much view spoiler i'm typically totally non judgmental when it comes to sex but come on first having sex with her cousin whom she had had a sibling like relationship with and then seducing her married teacher and then she had the nerve to act rather self centered about it sorry but i had to draw the line there hide spoiler","1889":"i wanted to like this book but it was a disappointment i disliked most of the characters especially thea","1890":"for me this book was just some good candy i enjoyed it found it easy to read and got quickly roped in i'm surprised really by all the grumpy reviews it was not life changing but a good story i don't think a character has to be sympathetic to be good we are all flawed aren't we","1891":"i wanted to like this book a whole lot more than i ended up it had horses north carolina teenagers and a touch of mystery unfortunately i was disappointed by the main character's cruelty selfishness and unfortunate behavior too bad because it had a lot of potential","1892":" this is such a perfect summer read i was pulled into it very quickly and it is so wrought with sex and drama that of course i wanted to keep reading it's also about an equestrian camp and i'm a rider so it made me fall in love with horses and riding all over again thea's relationship with a horse is her one true constant and it was impressive to see so many other aspects of her grow while that remained the same the writing is honestly gorgeous it is very reminiscent of curtis sittenfeld who is acknowledged by the author and provides the review on the cover in that the phrasing is just perfect even for things i wouldn't think to be beautiful in themselves i kept writing down all of these quotes and god only knows what i'll ever do with them but they were great","1893":"the book was entertaining but very predictable the author tried to do a lot of foreshadowing but it really failed","1894":"this a story steeped in the intensity and desire of adolescence it is not gentle or romantic rather intense and sometimes raw it is about individuals societies and eras it is about the human soul it is about one girl and all girls this story is about claiming your life","1895":" unfortunately was not able to get ahold of this one before the cap choices summer ballot was due in july i thought that it looked very good but it was not quite as good as i was expecting very very slow start and when the sexiness kicks in it seems kind of abrupt given the beginning that may be intentional on the author's part i'm having a hard time imagining many teens sticking with this until it gets juicy for lack of a better term i did really appreciate the ending which followed all of the characters to the ends of their lives but it seemed slightly tacked on all in all this book seemed very uneven to me good but not great 12th book on my 2013favorites shelf but doubtful that it'll stay there for long","1896":"i think my coworker is right this would make an excellent movie it is the story of thea and her family during the depression her wealthy family sustained a huge scandal for which she was blamed that eventually caused her parents to send her the yonahlossee riding camp for girls a camp boarding school for wealthy southern debutantes after the initial shock of leaving her family for the first time ever she settles into the rhythms of life at the camp she makes friends for the first time develops crushes and finds her competitive streak this is also as much a book about sexual awakening in a time when a girl would be ruined for having desires as a teen","1897":"thea was a great heroine i enjoyed seeing how she handled all the changes in her life","1898":"very disappointed i read such good things about this book and i could not get beyond the base reason the main character to get sent away and then go away disturbing to me but wont say more and ruin it for others","1899":" this is a story of a girl called thea atwell and how she relates to a period of her life in america during the depression in 1930 thea has been sent away by her family to the yonahlossee riding camp for girls after an incident that has shamed her family as the story progresses we find out the story behind this move and how it has now impacted on thea in her daily life we also get an insight into the american daily life of the daughters of upper class families and how they are affected by the depression that is going on in the outside world to the camp the story had a good start with detailed enough descriptions so that you could get a feel for the place that thea had found herself in however as the story progressed it seemed to jump around and lack detail in places as well as irrelevant storylines that appeared out of nowhere without explanation when the whole story was revealed to the reader and the book was coming to a conclusion the author seemed to struggle to finish the book in a way that made sense and it seemed like it was a race to the end i found the story easy to predict and it is also hard to work out who the target audience was as it could have been aimed at teenagers but there were adult scenes in places too it was a book with promise but unfortunately did not live up to expectations i know i am more of a suspense lover but i can still appreciate a good book however this one was not one of those with tweaking though i'm sure there would be room for improvement","1900":"loved her writing style and the complex characters especially thea and her mother she nailed the boarding school setting while offering a clear picture of living with uncertainty during the depression a perfect escape i loved it","1901":"somewhat of a grim coming of age novel set during the depression skip it and instead read some things that stay","1902":"beautifully written book loved the characters scenery and story line it tells a story about a young girl coming of age and how choices sometimes selfish can tragically alter lives the writing is so descriptive you feel as if you are actually in the mountain air the ending was okay but it did tie up loose ends highly recommend as a book club read it was a very quick and enjoyable read for me","1903":"4 5 stars is more like it i really loved this book the writing was beautiful","1904":"very different from other books i've read a thinker at the end","1905":"this wasn't my favorite book i was mad at the main character she acted like mme bovary and i did not like mme bovary the character","1906":"could have been good but not enough character development connection between protagonist and her twin felt very told not shown plus i had some aversion to semi explicit sex scenes involving a fifteen year old","1907":" i really loved this book and may be increasing to 5 stars when i think about it more the protagonist is sent away to the titular school for girls basically a reform school from there she looks back on why she was sent there and finds out what it means when your family is no longer the sum of your peers this is a great book for book clubs i also really like the cover even if it reminds me a lot of the people of forever are not afraid i kept thinking this was about israeli's until i started reading yonahlossee is a native american term which tribe dunno","1908":"painful tender heated and beautifully put together i knew very little going in and highly recommend that approach it will surprise you no matter what i finished it in about three days","1909":"this book i liked the whole idea of growing up in the 1930s as a female and how it explores that but the back story of thea just took way too long to unravel the only reason i finished this book was because i ultimately wanted to know what happened to thea in the past and what would happen to her in the present i'm still not sure what all the hype about this book is from","1910":"sent away from her home after being involved in a family scandal thea atwell attends the yonahlossee riding camp for girls while the story is interesting i lost patience with her inability to learn anything from her mistakes","1911":" a good literary summer read thea atwell age 15 has been banished from her florida home what for we don't know and finding out is half the fun but it's 1930 the country's in the midst of the great depression and a 15 year old girl has been suddenly and irrevocably removed from the only place she's ever known - the obvious conclusion boys the place of banishment the beautiful secluded all girls' equestrienne camp from which the novel takes its title thea is angry and lost strong willed and self contained in 1930 she simply does not fit in but she soon learns the social hierarchy of the camp the chapters alternate between thea's idyllic life in florida and her new life in north carolina each chapter reveals a little bit more of the event that changed thea's life it quickly becomes clear that my obvious assumption was right - thea had been involved with a boy intimately in her new life thea is just as helpless as she was with her family simply because she is female she quickly learns that the only power she holds is her sexuality and this realization will have repercussions for the rest of her life while this coming of age tale is not perfect it's as lush evocative and yes provocative as the storyline sounds thea atwell is a young girl learning what her body is capable of - love lust desire control - at the same time that women are encouraged to suppress such urges it is no wonder she feels like a 'wrong girl' i think this is a sentiment that most teenage girls can relate to at one time or another while this novel is not written for or marketed to young adults i would've loved it as a teenager the sexual undertones and innuendos leap of the page many having to do with horseback riding however it's the mysterious near southern gothic handling of the revelation that keep the pages turning one of the novel's strengths also serves as its primary weakness thea's voice though astute observant and not wholly likable is slightly beyond what is believable in a precocious 15 year old this coming from a former precocious pretentious teenager however the prose is beautiful and the sense of place is wonderfully developed anton disclafani's debut novel has its share of flaws but it well worth reading - a good coming of age novel set in a decadent southern summer camp is not to be missed if thea sounds beyond her years and the initial plotting is a bit slow this is more than made up for by the author's sense of place time and her clear love of horses 3 75 5 for my full review http fourthstreetreview com 2013 06","1912":"my mother never steers me wrong this one was so engaging loved every minute of it","1913":"bottom line highly recommended should be picked up by all public libraries would be a good choice for book clubs reminds me a bit of the secret life of bees strong female relationship centered southern character driven drama it might be the depression 1930 but wealthy 15 year old thea atwell has been sheltered from that and many harsher other aspects of life in her extremely insular family however after a family tragedy which thea can't bear to think about or acknowledge her role in she has been cast away from her parents and twin brother for the first time in her life specifically they send her to an exclusive girls summer camp finishing school in the appalachian mountains there for the first time she must learn to create friendships with those outside her family and navigate the tricky waters of teenage girl social interactions all while she denies and then comes to terms with her family situation books like this are a very special type of crack to me if you love books with a thing a big unrevealed secret or past event that is hinted at and gradually revealed you'll like this the secret is not what i expected and reveals a great deal about the era her family and provides an interesting mirror into our own world in other words it is the best example of this type of book i was worried about this one because i don't like horses and much of this book is centered on the narrator's love of riding and horses i think i missed that part of the girl gene that likes horse books however while the horses and riding were expertly used to help portray character growth and as a window into the souls of the girls at school it was never beat over our heads characters and their growth are at the heart of this novel for a large cast and in a girls school none the less i never got confused as to which girl was which and more impressively i never felt like any of the characters was a stock character stereotype setting and historical element was well developed the effects of the depression even upon the wealthy characters at the heart of the novel it was subtly but wonderfully done to place and then hint at the irony of an enclave of wealth and exclusivity in the heart of crushingly poor appalachia a couple of times the author seems a bit prescient in her awareness of the lack of equality and education for women but those rare and fleeting moments of high handedness are among the few blemishes of this otherwise extraordinary work of fiction overall i am highly recommending this book i already passed my copy onto a friend and plan to continue to spread the word about it review published here","1914":"a coming of age story that is tragic in many ways but redemptive at the same time a character caught between childhood and maturity who learns that a family's expectations of her are not the end all be all seamless writing woven between past and present i couldn't put it down","1915":"this review has been hidden because it contains spoilers to view it click here this book has burned through any positive regard i might have had for coming of age stories the fault may be that the main character is too vivid her inner monologue believable enough that it is easy for me to despise her for her selfishness and naivety rather than empathetic about her journey towards developing perspective and passable decision making skills the final chapter helped me develop a little empathy for her but it also reminded me of reading an undergrad essay on character motiva this book has burned through any positive regard i might have had for coming of age stories the fault may be that the main character is too vivid her inner monologue believable enough that it is easy for me to despise her for her selfishness and naivety rather than empathetic about her journey towards developing perspective and passable decision making skills the final chapter helped me develop a little empathy for her but it also reminded me of reading an undergrad essay on character motivation i would have rather had the revelations that lead to the character's emotional maturation given at the beginning woven into the narrative or not given explicitly at all more","1916":"poorly written disgusting incestuous relationship with cousins made my skin crawl","1917":" ms sclafani created some lovely and interesting characters but i felt that she spent all together too long in the exposition and suspension of details in the beginning we know that thea is sent away from her south florida home in 1930 because she did something wrong and scandalous it takes about 2 3 of the book before we know what that misdeed was the riding camp is the temporary home for the daughters of the rich and as the season unfolds the depression thins their number as fewer fathers can afford the fees i continued reading because i liked thea and wanted to know more about her but the book's attention to the secret became boring and by the time i learned what the secret was i scarcely cared","1918":"deftly handled plot and some beautiful writing about the relationship between riders and horses and the landscape of the nc mountains i was disturbed by the narrator's inability to accept personal responsibility for ruining lives always assigning blame for her reckless behavior to conditions outside herself","1919":" totally shocked by some of the ratings here this book is a beautiful atmospheric gem of a book with so many real life truths sexuality is complex not necessarily bad this book makes you feel the same passion that some of your more impulsive actions had led to and you know you wouldn't take them back either the deft interweaving of past and future moments and thoughts is done with such delicacy it feels like your own mind a truly brilliant different and unstereotypical novel one of if not my favorite this year","1920":"wow i'm really surprised at this book's rating on goodreads for me this was a 4 5 i loved it","1921":"for the first 100 pages this was a 5 star read if the book had been even 300 pages perhaps it would have saved face the prose it turns out is strong but one note this was a lot of exhausting time to spend with this character in this conflict getting squicked out by femininity u0026amp gender politics some people know that i really like the meanwhile in florida meme and it feels so uncharitable and dismissive to say that about this book but thea basically says it herself so that's my tl dr review","1922":" disclosure i am a horse person i would have loved nothing more when i was in junior and or high school than to be sent to a a boarding school where i went to classes in the morning and rode all afternoon in books i am ok with characters with no redeeming qualities or a conscious spoiler spoiler spoileri am not ok with a story about a girl's sexual awakening that involves a first cousin and a headmaster that can not control his sexual urges with a 16 year old girl i am not a prude but i do not appreciate shocking turns to create a story in an otherwise uninteresting book where is the judy bloom for the modern girl","1923":"did not finish i so wanted to like this book but i read to page 252 and gave it up it was just too brooding too slow took too long for the reveal of just why thea was sent to the yonahlossee riding camp i flipped to the end and read a couple of pages and was content with that","1924":"really this should be a 2 5 i sped through it but this book is not what the early reviews made it out to be","1925":"i received this book from the goodreads giveaway program i really liked this book which begins as a teenage girl is taken to riding camp by her father as the formally isolated young woman discovers herself at the camp the incident that precipitated her being sent away is slowly revealed this takes place during the great depression so there is a backdrop of more formal times and worry about money there is an interesting cast of characters lessons about love friendship and family and a very compelling story","1926":"so overwrought and generally boring it was so highly suggested that even when i was about to give up on it completely about half way through i soldiered on i wish i had just saved myself the time","1927":"kept me reading to find out what the scandal was but main character thea was so inconsistent it was frustrating how can she be so controlled always watching and then throw herself headlong into several stupid situations because she wants too much some beautiful writing but ultimately not a fun read disappointing","1928":" it was a slow book but not in a bad way mostly it was just building and building but really beautifully written so while you noticed that you'd read 100 pages and nothing really had happened it didn't really bother you all that much there were a couple of things you saw coming but were still happy to see come to fruition and a couple of things that were introduced and then never resolved disclafani really did a good job of planting seeds quite subtly so that if you happened to glance away and skip over a sentence you could miss something potentially important the seclusion the main character grows up with not knowing any different clearly molds the teenager and the adult she becomes and it was really fascinating to get in bits and pieces the story of her past and learn how it contributed to her present","1929":"starts out strong with sensual prose and a gorgeous sense of time and place but becomes a bit repetitive once you figure out the dark secret way before it's revealed horse fans will be much more satisfied with the horse riding scenes than erotica fans will be with the sexy scenes","1930":"what i loved most about this book was the tension i also found it pleasantly unpredictable and very well written not sure i really liked any of the characters i am always impressed by books i enjoy when i don't have empathy for the main characters","1931":"another good recommendation from mom interesting to see the depression from the perspective of the 1% and an enjoyable if naively selfish narrator loved how the story of thea unfolded in snippets and flashback chapters","1932":"i liked the writing style but overall am a little ambivalent about this book","1933":" didn't love but didn't hate this book when i first picked it up it struck me as shades of shirley jackson's we have always lived in the castle however it failed to sustain its gothic y premise the narrator isn't completely likable but that wasn't a huge turn off for me the time period 1930s depression era felt irrelevant at times and forced at others the bildungsroman aspect of the novel felt at odds with the creepy suspense portions of the novel that said i read this book in one sitting so it was clearly interesting enough to keep my attention","1934":"not sure why i bothered to finish","1935":" well that was bleak is that the difference between adult books about young adults and young adult books written for young adults a terribly depressing ending i enjoyed this book the writing was splendid the characters were interesting enough but the plot was a bit slow to begin with i understand why she waited so long to reveal the incident that sent thea to camp though it was easy to guess after a certain point but it was very frustrating to begin with i just felt so hopeless at the end i'm glad she learned to live life on her own terms and it's sad that her family did not learn the same lessons that she did but damn i suppose i'm used to happier endings","1936":"i am loving this book came highly recommended did not disappoint almost done","1937":"this book wasn't quite what i thought it would be i'm slightly disappointed in that aspect but the book was nicely written","1938":"there is a line in this book a paragraph really that i want my daughters to read when they're older i won't repeat it here because i don't want to spoil anything but it struck a chord impressive storytelling","1939":"i liked the idea of a girl in a horse riding school after being sent there after doing something wrong what i really did not like was that a 16 year old girl keeps flirting and eventually seduces a 31 year old this is the problem in our society when we romanticize sex with minors","1940":"meh too much buildup too much drama and then she owns her shame at the end how is that a new story a little disappointing and - very sexy but in a lolita kind of way awkward i don't mean to be picky but i have pretty high standards","1941":"this was an entertaining enough read although i didn't love the main character found the transitions to flashbacks to be a little awkwardly done at times and thought the plot line pretty predictable","1942":"this review has been hidden because it contains spoilers to view it click here major spoilers reviews called this book sexy and yes it contains a fair amount of sex but it's between cousins and between children and adults judge for yourself the main character is raised in wealth driven talented entitled pretty thinks she and her family are better than anyone else and gets everything she wants along the way she hurts people some fatally and excuses it by calling herself reckless as if that's a something she's proud of and b something she can't do anythi major spoilers reviews called this book sexy and yes it contains a fair amount of sex but it's between cousins and between children and adults judge for yourself the main character is raised in wealth driven talented entitled pretty thinks she and her family are better than anyone else and gets everything she wants along the way she hurts people some fatally and excuses it by calling herself reckless as if that's a something she's proud of and b something she can't do anything to change she learns nothing about herself or life in the course of the novel the first half is ok because of interesting settings in north carolina and central florida including the citrus industry horses and riding and the great depression but it nosedives sharply at about midpoint and i started to be distracted by thinking that the book could be saved if she said or did things differently at various key points but she is consistently despicable wrong headed and smug and that makes for a boring main character more","1943":"my first kindle experience the book was good reading electronically not so much","1944":"while i enjoyed the act of reading the book there were missing pieces that left me unsatisfied there was a compulsion to understand the back story of thea's unforgivable sin then once discovered it paves the way for her unimaginable follow up discovering the aftermath of her earlier indiscretion we understand that she can't learn from her mistakes because she is not privy to the true cost other characters are left a little sketchy and that is where i found myself lacking enough information to process this as a whole book","1945":"we have no say in who we love and woe be to all of us for that","1946":"i was very disappointed in this book the early reviews spoke more about the riding aspects of the story instead it was more about a teenage girl who doesn't understand the seriousness of actions and relationships old story in a new setting","1947":"i classify this as a borderline young adult novel but some illicit sexual encounters make it adult material i'd really like to give this a 3 1 2 star rating the story held my attention but there were too many plots and sub plots for any depth also too many characters to keep up with not crazy about the title either but from what little i know i give disclafani credit for her knowledge of horses and horse lovers","1948":"i thought this was a very nice debut effort the writing was very good and the story had a good flow unfortunately i never felt close to any of the characters i never really got a complete grasp of how their minds worked or what truly motivated them","1949":"i read this because it was on a must read adolescent reading list i would never recommend this book to any of my students the protagonist was an adolescent and it was a coming of age book but the themes were very mature and the protagonist wasn't smart enough to learn what was really important","1950":"the author is incredibly talented and writes beautifully but half way through the book i realized that i despised the protagonist and that i didn't want to waste anymore of my time reading her story i did something i've not done in a very long time which is i skipped to the end and read it yes it turned out pretty much like i thought it would will i read this author again probably she does an outstanding job of creating a sense of time and place i just hope that i won't despise her next main character as much

critical to the book i'm not 100% a fan of the end the fast forward move seems a bit of a cop out but it does also allow for perspective and for a broader view of how things turned out without the need for another 100 or 200 pages waldman does a nice job of catching us up on most of the characters i only missed knowing what had happened to asma's son overall i found the book to be an authentic

ugly side of the 9 11 aftermath it doubles as a state of the nation viewpoint drawing characters from many sections of us society and as a psychological portrait of a naturally liberal woman having her viewpoint slowly eroded by attrition from the media and her own self doubt interesting read for those interested in this aspect of usa social history","12":"i loved this book the characters were well drawn and it was such a good story i am not so sure i liked the ending when we go back to him years after would perhaps have preferred to end it nearer the occasion so i could wonder what had happened to everyone","13":"interesting read but suffers from contrivance and stereotyping no reluctant terrorist which was a better more thoughtful read","14":"great novel on a complex topic what happens when an american architect who happens to be a non practicing muslim has his submission for the 9 11 memorial selected by a jury there are so many ripples created by such a decision so many competing characters and interests in this story i know the tale will linger for me","15":"cool book but seriously heavy stuff it's the type of book that makes you reconsider your standpoint your beliefs and your ideals it made me reconsider at any rate the writing's sombre heavy and at times depressing i felt a little suffocated when reading it but it's probably a mix of both the style of writing and the topic there's a lot of doubt in the book and so little silver lining to look forward to but it's definitely a realistic take on this type of situation not the type of book that one can speed read through it demands a lot of attention and focus","16":"finished this last week and i only kind of liked it but i now find myself thinking about it and realizing it's stayed with me worth while","17":" there has been much art informed by 9 11 hell even the avengers with it's 40 minute destruction of new york city by a batch of foreign speaking aliens who descended from the sky in the name of a god could be considered a statement about 9 11 but not many books literally take stock of the country post that day this one a satire as much as an exploration of what makes america america has a hell of a hook in 2003 new york city holds a design competition to create a memorial for the victims of 9 11 when the winning design is selected after an arduous fight among the jury turns out the designer is a muslim i loved this book and it's a testament to waldman's skill as a writer that this doesn't devolve into the ridiculous she crafts a number of complex nuanced characters and reactions but maybe none so fine as mo khan the architect instigator in question the ending khan's last statement on the whole process is a wonder and had me thinking about what it is he meant the only reason i don't give this five stars is timing i wish this book had come out in 2003 because i think it would have had considerably more cultural power and heft than it does now not that the wounds of 9 11 have completely healed but the conversation the book might have started then would have likely been considerably more valuable","18":"three quarters of the way through this book i was prepared to write a rather negative review of the book but i do think it did do a good job really looking at what were to happen if a the situation in the book occurred interesting concept but tough to read at times both in style and content","19":"story about submission of plan for 9 11 memorial at ground zero and what happenswhen there is a problem with the selection","20":"the story starts so strongly but peters out as the author and subsequently the reader run out of inspiration the bonfire of vanities this is not sadly","21":"the ending felt a bit off the rails but it was very good otherwise totally believable","22":"what a book slow beginning but what a finish it could not have been any better","23":" \"the submission \" by amy waldman farrar straus u0026amp giroux 2011 audiobook read by bernadette dunn the aftermath of 9 11 and its effects on everything the device a jury of artists important people a representative of the families gathers to pick the winning entry for a 9 11 memorial they debate two finalists an elegant walled garden with canals and trees and flowering shrubs a huge black stone obelisk thrusting into the sky after debate they choose the garden championed by claire burwell whose very wealthy husband was killed in the attack but then the winner's name is mohammad khan what to do they begin to debate how or whether to choose again claire stands by her man the name is leaked by a smart tenacious unscrupulous reporter for the post the storm begins there is a wealth of characters the chair of the memorial committee wealthy confident claire khan american through and through secular knows nothing of islam born and raised in the us other families led by the surviving ne'er do well sibling of a hero firefighter who discovers the only purpose he has in life is to fight the memorial a bangladeshi widow whose husband was killed in the attack too but they are illegals she has to fight her own government to get him acknowledged as dead she can't get his body she has no support she knows no english a great deal of racking of brains of intense internal arguments over what to do how to live with this to fight the islamophobia or to give in to it what did khan really intend etc etc finally asma the widow speaks at a hearing about the memorial the only muslim victim there her haltingly eloquent plea has some effect and it makes her famous oprah wants her who is oprah she says so the ambitious governor leaks that she is an illegal as she is leaving to be deported during a tumultuous bangladeshi crowd she is stabbed to death all are shocked and shaken finally claire supported by the muslim establishment comes out against the memorial it would cause too much conflict and heartache khan withdraws there is an epilogue 20 years later khan is now a world famous architect wealthy and alone he has built nothing in the us he builds the garden for a wealthy emir claire's son a filmmaker does a documentary about the whole affair claire sees the garden on film and realizes it is wonderful restful actually brings her back to her husband she wonders if she made a mistake her son leaves a little cairn of stones inside the garden--finally a memorial for her husband fascinating book superb recounting of all the conflicts that raged around the era perhaps inspired by the ground zero mosque affair my sole complaint this is a formula story each character has a specific place and a specific position to exemplify and they never change no one grows no one moves they hold their positions all the way through because the author has to get every nuance of the debate into the novel it ultimately is didactic not alive but i enjoyed it learned from it http www thesubmissionnovel com","24":"very thought provoking and the main characters were very believable with the exception of debbie she seemed like a caricature of what that character could have been","25":"a great portrayal of how a controversy begins and can spiral out of control the author captures so many different points of view in the wake of sept 11 and the heartbreaking inability of people to understand each other","26":"i feel like i have met every character on this book from my time living in ny a good read that doesn't pull it's punches it sticks with you","27":"the premise of this book was better than the actual book but i still enjoyed","28":" i checked out the cds of this book to listen in the car but after the 3rd cd i was intrigued enough to continue more quickly so i listened to it when i could on my computer sometimes i was distracted from focused listening which is probably why it only got 4 instead of 5 stars i really did enjoy the complexity of the issue and the characters who bring it i love how the title of the book not only refers to the competition but the practice of islam i liked the time jumps into the past and future i might have to actually read this but first onto other books the library has available to me","29":" this novel examines the tensions between muslims and americans following 9 11 and how the media collective ignorance and general xenophobia have the potential to destroy the basic tenets of american democracy and tolerance i was very impressed by waldman's handling of the story which is gripping and heartbreaking but less so with her characterization in her attempt to create nuanced characters who vacillate between supporting and rejecting the 9 11 memorial designed by an american of muslim heritage waldman accidentally i hope creates two dimensional didactic puppets mo in particular the architect whose design causes so much controversy is a character that is never fully understood even when waldman is narrating from his point of view i am curious how much of the submission is based on real life incidents obviously it is not hard to imagine the media driven frenzy behind the koran burning threats mosque near 9 11 and general fox news commentary fueling waldman's portrayal of journalists afraid to stop at nothing to get a controversial story particularly concerning the memorial itself i found this article on the actual 9 11 memorial http www latimes com news nationwor and discovered that the actual architect michael arad grew up in israel and was selected by a jury i definitely recommend this novel for its insight into the mass hysteria our national is currently capable of submitting to in the face of unknown terror threats however for a less fictionalized and thus more effectively harrowing account of muslim american relations in contemporary america i would recommend dave egger's zeitoun","30":" spoilers i am waffling between 2 and 3 stars the submission is about a contest to build a memorial on the 9 11 site all submissions are anonymous but once the winner is chosen by the selected jurors they discover the architect is of muslim descent his name is leaked to the media and the backlash ensues i did not have a lot of strong feelings for most of the characters except for alyssa spier the journalist and i use that term loosely because she did nothing because she believed in it but because it may advance her career i strongly disliked her all she did was spew hate and miss report facts atleast sean who lost his bother when the buildings collapsed had some justification to his hate asma the bangladeshi immigrant was the only other character i felt for she and her pain at loosing her husband was denied by so many people and alyssa ruined her life and in my opinion is the person who ultimately caused her death as for mo and claire i never felt their characters where fully fleshed out i never understood why mo would not explain his design to atleast claire even though i understood why he didn't feel he should i kept wanting to hear it i could picture his design in my head and it was beautiful and i wanted to know why he built it that way and what emotions he thought it should bring about i would want to know that no matter who designed it the rest of the characters like the governor tv personality and group leaders felt so stereotypical at times they were laughable for the most part i thought the book was boring nothing was happening it just went round and round but the last 4 5 chapters were very good and the last was great i loved getting to see the garden mo visited in kabul i assume that this is where his vision for the memorial garden came from i imagine the site of this garden surrounded by the rubble that was kabul was very visually beautiful and i could see it translating to the 9 11 memorial where it would come out of the destruction there i mean it was built in 1526 and was still there i felt for mo through the whole book i wanted to see his garden built and for people to get over their hate but when you see the garden built in the end and on the walls in place of the names you have the quran i lost a little faith in him he was adamant about not changing a single thing in his design and had just showed that he would not change another of his designs for a prince \"you will take all of it or none of it\" which made his changing the garden feel like a betrayal weather that was his intention or not anyway however jumbled these are my thoughts","31":" this book challenged me and made me uncomfortable which i loved despite my surprise it is in many ways powerful raw provocative honest the novel explores a cast of characters including a muslim architect a 9 11 widow and many others from a variety of backgrounds all trying to make sense of 9 11 how it happened the world context in which it happened and how best to remember and move forward the story dragged on a bit but i think this may have been purposeful or at least advantageous there could be no quick resolutions and feeling the limbo made for a more vivid experience for the reader i disagree with other reviewers who found the characters unrelatable and hard to root for i fell in love with these characters all of them because of their deep flaws and their internal struggles because when i asked myself the questions each of them must ask in the novel the answers i was expecting of myself the liberal open minded tolerant accepting answers didn't come easily this book in eliciting discomfort in an engaged reader elicits a visceral understanding of just how hard it can be to make sense of a diverse world to balance trust and ignorance to do the right thing even when the consequences are unknown and possibly disastrous highly recommend","32":"ending was amazing but that's all","33":"this is one of the better contemporary novels i've read in at least six months since the marriage plot about a contest to design the memorial in nyc for 9 11 and our attitudes towards muslims the title is brilliant working on multiple levels but i was left a little disappointed by the ending well worth your time","34":"to learni believed every conflicting word of this novel my understanding of what a garden is or could be depending on its designer is now more enlightened all americans should read this book we seem to ha e lost a true sense of who we are what we stand for the crazies have too much of our attention we need a quiet space a garden where we can begin anew the ever ongoing changing process of discovering the pure beauty of what is possible","35":"this book really captures the mixed emotions gripping america post 9 11 in an eloquent and intelligent way it doesn't try to answer or make sense of these feelings you'll find yourself empathetic toward characters you wouldn't expect to be all in all a challenging and thoughtful read","36":"excellent fast read and makes you think","37":"expertly written book about a fictional contest to design a 9 11 memorial and what happens when it turns out that the winning submission was designed by a muslim while it's clear where the author's sympathies lie she does a remarkable job of conveying the varied political and emotional responses to this turn of events","38":"the title of this book has an intriguing double meaning the submission of a plan for the 9 11 memorial that becomes controversial because the submitter is a secular muslim and what it means to make a submission to allah the novel explores the prejudices and motives of many new yorkers affected by our national tragedy that these two submissions force into the open","39":"i would rate this book a 4 5 i loved how it explored all sides of each indviduals struggle to honor and heal with a tragic situation","40":" this is the type of book that when you are finished you want to find someone to discuss it with it will be great for book clubs an event similar to 9 11 occurs in ny two years later a jury composed of artists fund raisers politicians and a widow meet to choose a design for a national memorial the submission selected features a garden with canals the envelope is opened and lo and behold the winner is mohammad khan a yale educated american born architect of muslim heritage but not practicing any faith all sorts of chaos breaks out khan is pressured to withdraw the jury considers whether it can make a different selection the governor threatens to overrule the jury the victims organization rallies the muslim community rallies talk radio gets involved the situation heats up to the point that there will be violence if khan's design is built and there will be violence if another design is substituted i was particularly captivated by a sub plot involving another widow from bangladesh married to a minimum wage janitor in the towers who was an undocumented immigrant the treatment she received from victims groups differed greatly from the families of firefighters and executives there is lots to discuss in this book assertion of rights v conciliation immigration racial and religious prejudice anger revenge and what motivates the complex human heart","41":" i really enjoyed the submission both for the ideas it contains and for waldman's writing which i found pleasantly lyrical it's a story of new york society deeply divided when indian american muslim architect muhammad khan wins an anonymous competition to design a 9 11 memorial tolerance is clearly an important theme of the book but i think that questions of individual and group identity are equally important and interested me more waldman avoids portraying any of the competing factions in the book as monolithic and in doing so illustrates the folly of labelling people and maybe even oneself in almost every case the characters are drawn sympathetically even those who represent intolerance even though waldman disapproves of their viewpoint these characters are not one dimensional bad guys each has a history that makes their intolerant views understandable and credible the style of writing reminded me very much of biography most of the time and i think this helped me believe in the world of the novel for some reason though i didn't feel much connection with the characters themselves despite their three dimensionality there are no easy answers in the submission but plenty of interesting questions raised about who owns public spaces and about where the meaning in public symbols lies","42":"a most interesting premise the many points of view in this book clash and interweave and raise all kinds of every shifting questions about who we are in america i found the middle a bit slow and the ending a bit too good to be true but even so i really enjoyed reading amy waldman's fine novel","43":"ok claire khan the lawyer were all incredibly annoying characters this book was certainly not without flaws like er the plot five stars for nuanced exploration of important contemporary political dilemma","44":" this book was chosen for the mandatory summer read for ohio state freshmen it deals with the repercussions when an appointed jury selects a then anonymous design for a 9 11 memorial then finds out that the designer is a muslim man the book brings up a lot of issues and feelings that were prominent or divisive in the aftermath of 9 11 the writing dragged in parts but it was still a good read i would love to sit in on the freshman class discussions of this book since these kids were only 6 years old at the time of the attacks i think their reactions might be different from mine","45":"reasonable people get pushed to side with the muslims or the non muslims on the question of who should design a memorial to an event similar to 9 11 a muslim wins the design contest on merit but hardly anyone will back him because he is a muslim even though he doesn't practice and is a muslim in name only the only recommendation that made sense to me was for him to change his name but really that wouldn't fool people for long it's amazing that the author was able to put herself into the shoes of so many characters who would have been affected by such an event and make each character sympathetic and pathetic at the same time i found myself getting lost in her descriptions without stopping to put my own feelings into the scenario because her choices just made sense to me","46":"i found this quite readable and a very interesting study of our dealings with racial identification my sympathies switched several times during the course of the novel and i was quite unsure at the end where i might have made my own stand nicely done","47":"while this book is a work of fiction there is no reason that it could have been a real scenario in american society post september 11th the book deals with a national memorial competition for the site of the world trade center attacks the designers and architects behind each submission are kept anonymous until the final selection has been chosen on the selection committee are members of local government art scholars architects and a representative of the families of those who died in the attacks everybody's sense of right and wrong is blurred when it is revealed that the winner is a muslim by the name of mohammad khan the author told this story through many character's unique stories from the architect with the winning design to the widow of a wealthy businessman who died in the attacks the story that struck me as the most moving was that of the widow of an illegal immigrant from bangladesh who was working in the towers on 9 11 this was a point of view that i feel did not get addressed at all following the attacks in 2001 whether or not an illegal immigrant had the right to be acknowledged on the memorial is an ethical dilemma that i had never considered before","48":"i've read a few books about post 9 11 and very few seem to have captured the essence or achieved the purpose the set out with this one however really gives the reader an excellent view of a wide variety of reactions to the event and its aftermath the premise is that america is two years after the attacks and a jury in nyc is choosing a design for their 9 11 memorial it's a blind choice based solely on design a choice is made the name of the architect who submitted it is revealed and the name is that of a muslim the rest of the book displays the best and worst america had to offer with passions raging in both positive and negative reactions to this selection it's a very interesting story and very well laid out i felt as if i have known people on every side of the debate displayed in this book the outcome is really well crafted as well well worth reading","49":"this captured my attention from page one and caused me to think and think and think there are some really ugly characters in the mix and i found myself desperate for them to realize they were wrong and i wanted the book to have a happy ending then i realized that is exactly the kind of ending i hate so what the heck was i wishing for the ending was as captivating as the rest of the book and i'm still thinking and thinking and thinking great book","50":"possibly the best book i've read this year a thought provoking look at america's response to 9 11 and how american muslims were treated in the aftermath an intriguing premise and a cast of complex characters none of whom are purely the good guys or bad guys","51":"this was my second ever audio book but unlike the first one i read i did not really like this one i've been waiting a long time to read this and i don't know if it's because i disliked the narrator or what but i couldn't wait for it to be over it's a difficult subject matter and there is a lot of cynicism and prejudice in the story but the narrator spewed venom with every word and made me want to slap her this is one book i wish i had read in paper or e form","52":"i really like this book it is an important read for our time at first i couldn't stand the writing but then i realized it was just outside of my comfort zone u0026amp i grew to like it even be influenced by it i am dying for someone i know to read it so we can discuss","53":"this novel felt so true to life that i often wondered if it had already happened waldman sets up a hypothesis and portrays the resulting scenarios in a frighteningly accurate way any possible thought or action that could be expected in such a situation is touched upon hearing from the different people involved allows us to gain more sympathy for the varying perspectives at first when i realized the last chapter was set 20 years in the future i was annoyed it was an abrupt plot device but as i read on and closed the book after the last line i was content with the knowledge that it is a befitting touching end","54":"a very compelling and solid book which left me wanting more particularly in terms of the epilogue waldman did a compelling job of depicting the very human side of all her characters revealing everyone to be complex and usually motivated by purer intents than their actions imply","55":"talking about 9 11 is still i understand quite difficult for americans to talk about this book is about what sot of memorial should be available to families and visitors to understand the loss that happened that day a competition takes place to find the right fit and it all becomes very difficult when a gentleman by the name of mohammed khan is the winner people are very quick to judge him and the possible reasons for his even entering the contest in the first place i started reading this book on one level but quickly saw that when opinions around you differ it is easy to be swayed i wasn't the book is full of misunderstanding and browbeating that should never have happened i enjoyed it greatly","56":"a thought provoking investigation into attitudes in the usa and by extension the rest of the west to islam after 9 11 an anonymous competition to design a memorial for the victims of 9 11 results in a garden designed by a muslim being selected through the eyes of fellow muslims victims families and right wing extremists the author explores attitudes and prejudices particularly impressive is the variety of views expressed within each group the author has avoided lumping people together","57":"the submission details the story of a contest to design the 9 11 memorial the winning design is chosen by a blind jury that is unaware of who designed each submission when it turns out that a muslim mohammed khan submitted the winning design essentially all hell breaks loose this book handles its subject matter very well showing the issue from every possible angle the families' the media the contest winner the american muslim community etc this novel was extremely realistic to the point that i almost didn't feel like i was reading a novel until the final chapter it almost read more like an in depth news expose not quite sure why i couldn't give this five stars it's very well done but i think because it is so focused and also has a lot of messaging i think that the impact of the book as a whole is a little bit dulled i didn't quite care enough about the characters because i didn't see quite enough of their lives outside of the particular specific issue with which they were dealing at any rate if you are interested in 9 11 i definitely would put this on your list i also feel it would be an excellent book club read with lots to discuss","58":"well written but not a work of fiction so much as an extremely detailed philosophy exercise it's profound but far from poignant","59":"wonderful concept with some really strong moments but the execution on the whole was super sloppy i'll be very interested to see what waldman comes up with next","60":"a man enters an anonymous competition to design a memorial for 9 11 in new york his design of a garden is chosen and when it is revealed that his name is mohammed khan all hell breaks loose from the american public the racism and hurtful comments directed at him and islam by the public made me want to throw this book sometimes it made me so angry a really good look at the high emotions surrounding this event and the hateful opinions some people can spew","61":"i wanted to like it more","62":"i listened to this book instead of reading it found it totally compelling didn't give it a five because it didn't have the poetic language that i look for in a 5 i loved that the author was able to see both the strengths and weaknesses of each character you could see how each person was limited by their own pride grief and ambition highly recommend for a book group","63":"thought provoking novel about a contest to design a memorial on the 9 11 site all submissions are annonymous until the winner is chosen mohammed khan a muslim american the news sets off a controversy similar to the debate about the mosque near the ground zero site all sides are represented the artist the widow the reporter the mayor the illegal widow the angry brother etc an excellent read by this first time novelist","64":"the submission is a provocative intensely realistic portrait of america today we are struggling with our traditional values and our identity the issues are complex and they all involve the conflicts of principles pragmatism and the public for me satisfactory resolution of these issues would benefit from enhanced leadership which has been sadly lacking for too long","65":" how is this for an opening chapter a jury of various important people including politicians artists historians and one representative of the victims' families have finalized their choice for the memorial to be built at ground zero for the dead of 9 11 there are some arguments but finally at the insistence of claire burwell whose husband died in the attacks a peaceful garden is chosen the submissions were anonymous all seems well until the winner is disclosed he is a muslim so begins amy waldman's wise and sardonic novel the submission which includes just about every facet of american life from government to the media at the center is mohammed kahn the american born and secular muslim who becomes the center of a firestorm defended by the intellectual left but pilloried by various groups including the right wing media victim's family groups and even some who he would have thought would have supported him even the new yorker who cites his rights to win the contest also believes he should withdraw mo set down the magazine and flipped through his stack of unread new yorkers to be written about this way in its pages was like being called shifty by a roomful of people he had thought were his friends kahn enlists the help of muslim advocacy organizations who use him as a political football burwell supports his design angering other victims' families including the gallaghers the family of a fireman who died his brother sean leads the charge against the design which is deemed to be an islamic martyr's paradise rubbing the noses of everyone who died in extremist gloating he also starts a wave of hate mongering by purposely tugging the headscarf off of a muslim women waldman also includes a wide kaleidoscope of other characters including debbie dawson the head of america against islam which has a very real counterpart in real life i got a kick out of the discord in her own family of three daughters all three had signs saying no islam zone on their doors debbie wasn't allowed to talk about 'the cause ' as they disdainfully referred to it in their rooms when they didn't get their way they threatened to marry muslims other parts of the caravan are an ambitious governor of new york who baits the public anathema to islam a morally bankrupt reporter for the new york post is there any other kind a vitriolic radio host who is actually something of a gentleman in real life and most intriguingly a bangladeshi muslim woman whose own husband died in the attack but because of her background and citizenship status is not included in the many events for the families of the dead this book has been compared to the bonfire of the vanities and to be sure it sprawls across the tapestry of new york city and america feeding on petty fears and insecurities of the public this book is sharper though and less smug than wolfe's at times the book is a little too jerry rigged kahn is in the right but his prickly personality and stubborness get in his way burwell is a forward thinker but is prayed upon by voices on the right who undo her sean gallagher is basically a lout but has moments of personal doubt etc these characterizations are fine etched but at times seem too convenient but nonetheless the book is an outstanding read i still haven't seen the memorial at ground zero that was built was there any controversy over that","66":"how do you take the trauma of a nation and spin a story that translates people's personal ownership of tragedy into a fictional piece of art ask amy waldman this is a really poignant read that will pull your conscience in a thousand different directions and have you questioning what you thought was a firm viewpoint","67":"debate debate debate the whole book was an endless back and forth of viewpoints between the characters i understood the reason but i found it to be exhausting i admire the author's descriptions but again it was just sometimes too much too wordy she seemed to enjoy using 10 words to describe objects people that only took 5 words","68":"fucking brilliant","69":" this was slightly dull it's one of those books with relatively little plot but lots of first person reflection on situations primarily the central situation of a muslim having won the competition to design the 9 11 memorial it's dull because the characters are all a little 2d and only consider the situation from within their given view set there's no meta reflection if you like on the wider problem of religion causing dispute i'm not sure if the author intended to leave that to the reader but i missed any hint in that direction from a plot point of view i'd have liked to have seen the reaction to the final decision explored in more detail outside of the central characters as that's really the most interesting concept to me so it's an interesting discussion to a point but feels a bit empty overall","70":"$26 the submission by amy waldman centers on an anonymous contest to design a memorial at the site of the destroyed world trade center when the winner's sealed envelope is opened it is discovered that he is mohammad khan mo an architect has this was highly recommended by two literary friends it took me a while to read it as i put it down and then when i picked it back up to finish i couldn't put it down again the submission by amy waldman farrar straus and giroux 320 pages $26 the submission by amy waldman centers on an anonymous contest to design a memorial at the site of the destroyed world trade center when the winner's sealed envelope is opened it is discovered that he is mohammad khan mo an architect has a muslim name but is an agnostic however most new yorkers are furious that he won the competition instead of a real american the gossip that races around the country is that the design a garden is an islamic one meant to glorify the world trade center's attackers two of the main characters are family members of two men who died in the attacks clare who lost her husband was on the selection committee and believes the garden will be a place of healing sean whose brother a fireman died hates it and starts a group to overturn the decision asma a muslim and an illegal immigrant from bangladesh introduces a critical counterpoint to the dispute between claire and sean asma whose husband inam was a janitor who died in the attacks wonders why the death of american citizens is more significant than her loss amy waldman a former new york times reporter has written a completely believable story prejudice life in an immigrant muslim community in new york city and the mourning of families set against the backdrop of the sept 11

com entertainment b","71":"so thought provoking in a really interesting way i would recommend to everyone","72":"i could not shake the idea that this book was meant to be a satire that i just wasn't getting unfortunately i don't think it was","73":"i rarely spend almost an entire day reading a book but i couldn't put this down when a muslim wins the entry design for a trade center memorial i'm sorry to say all hell breaks lose the book covers many of the prejudices that surround this and through the characters you get a close up view of both sides of the story a very thought provoking book a real page turner excellent","74":" a very intelligent book through its large cast of characters the reader has access to many points of view reasonable people slowly become pushed to more narrow positions i was most interested in the fracture lines among the surviving relatives and between them and the extremists who claim to fight for them intense scenes of intolerance--i winced like i wince watching news talk shows sometimes this book will be read for its topic especially this year and it should be i also want to point out that the writing on almost every page made me catch my breath some examples \"ariana herself was as usual dressed entirely in a shade of gruel that she had patented in homage to and ridicule of yves klein's brilliant blue the mockery of pretension claire decided could also be pretentious \"\"her dread built crows landing one by one in a field \"\"a parliament of the dead deserved respect too \"\"the members of save america from islam dominated cable news with well lathed lines... \"\"next came the picketers two or three or ten of them mostly women foot darned a circle in the park across from his house \"\"the safis hadn't lost anyone in the attack radical islam was their freelance obsession his mother's rage most of the time was so quiet you forget it was there not so with the safis they were the professional wrestlers of activists \"\"horrible as the attack was everyone wanted a little of its ash on their hands \"\"fabricating reality was criminal editing it commonplace \"","75":"i loved this book it's engrossing thanks to complex interesting characters all drawn with sympathy waldman's prose is elegant straightforward and illuminating of the many layers and nuances of her story rather than drawing attention to itself some character arcs have not much plot although others have plenty but it never drags for a second i highly recommend it","76":"outstanding powerful it makes you look inside at your own experiences and yes your own prejudices","77":" there were parts of this book that really worked but overall it suffered from the author's failure to decide what kind of book she was trying to write swaths of the book read like satire and overall the satire is better than decent but then the book turns in another direction toward straight ahead drama and an examination of healing and hate and that part of the book bounces between pedestrian and straight up ridiculous the writer created characters like the post journalist and the governor who are pure satire but then she plunks them down in the middle of an earnest allegory it makes the whole sort of ridiculous imagine buck turgidson from dr strangelove being featured in saving private ryan so reading this as satire there are situations and characters which are too straightforward and objective and reading it as a serious novel which explores america's anti islam direction and the ways in which it isolates us it is a book filled with underdeveloped characters some of those characters are straight up snidely whiplash evil debbie dawson alyssa spier the governor and some are imbued only with everything good and noble asma leila and not one reads like a real person there are things to like here its a fantastic premise but a surer writer would have been very welcome","78":"whoa very interesting book about the submission of an architectural rendering for the 9 11 memorial and the fall out when the selected winner is a muslim the book tells the story from every imaginable perspective and is all the more fascinating because of that you find you have to think about where you would fall in the discussion i rate this book a 5 because of all the thinking it made me do","79":"my last book of the year powerful thoughtful well written and readable can't ask for more","80":"again wishing for the 1 2 star would have given it 4 1 2 an excellent read that kept unfolding","81":"memorials have a history of controversy how could they not the author creates stereotypical characters caught up in the anxieties of post 9 11 america what makes this book worth reading especially book groups are the questions it raises about human nature life is ripe with uncomfortable situations how we deal with them makes for a compelling investigation","82":" go and read this book do not hesitate any second buy it or borrow it or at least bury it in your tbr list i can not predict whether you will love it or hate it but you will have a strong response to it trust me if you are unsure go to a bookstore and read the second chapter you will realize how brilliant it is the submisson which in german is called the american architect is about the controversy fictional by the way that arises when the winner of an anonymous architectural contest to build a 9 11 memorial is found out to be a muslim of all things the jury liked the memorial they just don't like it from him but of course we are not discriminating anyone surely one has the right to voice one's opinion i liked everything about the book from the first sentence which introduces the topic of names and what they imply to the characters interconnected all related to the problem all interesting and well written to the main plot and writing style the conflict was realistic as were the characters' actions it caused anger and shame in me and i was not able to put the book down until i was done i applaud ms waldman for her bravery to write this book it is bold and painfully true it sugar coats nothing and criticizes the american public and its response to muslims post 9 11 truly what an amazingly brave book very well observed and then transformed into book form it makes me feel guilty for what i sometimes instinctively think i can only imagine what it does to less liberal people it is a book as seldom seen before with a critical voice in novel form coming from american within holding a mirror to society instead of plainly lecturing the submission shows all angles of the conflict it gives them all a voice and a character in the end it is unclear who really wins just like in real life it features romance action betrayal friendship patriotism religion philosophy morals and so much more it is a difficult book but so brave so on point rubbing so much salt into the wound so important in the end in what if makes us think about","83":"how often does a book really make you think about tough questions in a different way despite the depth of the subject the book is very readable and i never felt like it was a chore for me get through it i look forward to checking out amy waldman's future works","84":"the best 9 11 novel i've read so far easy to read and yet complex and intriguing so much that is relevant to our current national conversations so far my course for the spring studies in the novel the post 9 11 experience will start with in the shadow of no towers then read falling man and extremely loud and incredibly close and end with the submission not sure what else is a must read","85":"you must read this book","86":"it's a fascinating look into all the stakeholders of a 9 11 memorial the word count is too dense which is something of a turn off","87":"i really liked the story and the way it unfolded although it speaks to a very distinct moment in time that one moment pervades the on going struggle with culture religion difference and the things that feed our fears and judgement i wanted more closer and i felt there were a few threads that remained unclear but it was a challenge to read and not get swept up in the darkness that motivates our actions","88":"i found this book very disappointing i am surprised it received the reviews it did and that it was a 2011 notable book by the ny times this book did not live up to the hype the ridiculous characterization of the ny post reporter coupled with claire's befuddled reasoning about how she ultimately felt about the garden and khan were huge glitches in this novel i will note that the plot moves fairly consistently but in the end there is no real depth to any of the characters in this book i also felt the end was too convenient and dodged some of the didactic overtones the book seemed to be employing in earlier chapters at times it seemed the author was trying too hard with creating political tension instead of evolving some of the characters this book did not work for me on many levels","89":"i heard a story about this book on the radio and thought it sounded interesting the basic premise is that 2 years after 9 11 a memorial is being planned for ground zero designs are submitted anonymously and when the winning design is selected its architect is revealed to be a muslim american or at least an american with a muslim sounding name controversy ensues beyond this interesting premise the author did nothing to sustain my interest the characters were flat stereotypes and the plot unfolded too slowly","90":" claire messud in her new york times review describes amy waldman's \"the submission\" as \"elegantly written and tightly plotted \" michiko kakutani in an earlier review in the times sees the novel as \"nervy and absorbing\" and notes waldman's prose as \"limber and detailed \" those descriptions are certainly accurate \"the submission\" is an extraordinarily solid novel at once sophisticated and accessible it is as strong a piece of plotting and writing that i have read from new contemporary american novelists over the past year so much is pitch perfect the novel opens as the committee organized to select a design for a memorial of a 9 11 type event learns that the architect it chose from a number of anonymous submissions is muslim with the stage set the rest of the novel explores the national reactions to that selection--to both the architect and the design which some come to view as an islamic garden in the process of that exploration waldman gives us a vivid and hauntingly accurate picture of one face of american society in the wake of our actual 9 11 event the novel's major controlling theme is the confusion and fear generated by islam in the public's mind as a result of the religion's linkage to the terrorist event waldman is a well regarded professional journalist as well as a new novelist with a journalist's eye she plays out that theme by charting the histories of six major characters--their histories and the interactions among themselves and within the broader national discussions claire burwell a member of the committee and the representative she lost her husband of the effected families paul ruben chair of the committee and with linkages to the political arena mohammad khan the winning architect born and raised in the united states and initially disengaged from his family's religion alyssa spier reporter sean gallagher the rootless brother of a first responder who died in the line of duty asma anwar an undocumented muslim immigrant from bangladesh whose muslim husband also undocumented was employed as a janitor in the office building with the possible exception of the journalist alyssa spier those characters are not simple stereotypes they are three dimensional figures with their own doubts contradictions hopes and concerns there are no clear cut villains or heroes they all struggle in the novel's vortex and all are changed by novel's end what was probably for me most gripping about the novel was it articulated out my own \"confusion and fear\" in regard to my post 9 11 view of islam in trying to write a newspaper column about the conflict the journalist alyssa spier attempts to characterize the confusion and fear that permeates the scene about which she is reporting she reflects \"islam was violent it believed killing innocent people was acceptable it didn't like women it didn't like other religions \"i have been a longtime supporter of women's equality islam's attitude toward women alone alternatingly angers me and confuses me how would i react to the prospect of a muslim designed and motifed memorial finding myself as a character within waldman's novel i am not certain which banner i would have rallied around","91":"this book felt so true it's a devastatingly accurate portrait of american civic life after 9 11 and as such it's a pretty painful read","92":"i picked this book up because i was intrigued by the premise and the sly double entendre of the title two years after 9 11 a committee hand picked by the governor of new york including a woman widowed on that fateful day selects a beautiful and peaceful garden design among the blind submissions as a memorial for the world trade center big reveal the first the winning designer though american is a muslim man big reveal the second the winning design may or may not be inspired by historic islamic gardens thought to be the origin of the martyrs' paradise concept although this book was not what i wanted it to be it was mostly head not much heart it was an interesting read throughout and a timely one too with the tenth anniversary of the 9 11 tragedy fast approaching though the end in particular was not what i was craving for america u0026amp its politicians to do the morally right thing it was both satisfying and more realistic along the way we get multiple characters' perspectives claire the widow on the committee paul the chair of the committee mohammad mo to his friends the winning designer whose story gets leaked to the press asra an illegal bangladeshi woman whose husband also died in the towers that day alyssa a tabloid journalist whose ambition to scoop any aspect of this story far outstrips her humanity and a sad sack fellow whose brother died in the towers and whose mother thinks the wrong son died although i suspect most readers who pick up this book will feel true sympathy for very few characters waldman does a very good job of presenting this varied cast with as much empathy as possible all perhaps except for the tabloid journalist and the politicians whose machinations twist the brouhaha into something much uglier than it needs to be this book is published in late august from fsg and i received an arc of it at my request from my sales rep the arc cover ivory with cutouts of a garden as seen through a moorish window is vastly different from the final more somber cover which puts me in mind very much of the new yorker issue design immediately following september 11 2011 i think waldman a journalist for over a decade has carried off her debut novel with great credit to her profession","93":"deep down dark the untold stories of 33 men buried in a chilean mine and the miracle that set them free","94":" this could well be titled immolation of the vanities in that it mirrors the current age as did tom wolfe's 1987 exploration of greed and hubris of the 80's the events surrounding a proposed memorial to the victims of 9 11 are personified by an extraordinarily rich cast of characters each is an embodiment of a different aspect of the attacks but none are one dimensional their conficts and high emotional responses are recognizable and complicated as described events are set in motion due to the the winner of a closed contest for memorial design being an american born of muslim parents he bears the name mohammed the reader shifts focus inwardly when it is revealed that he goes by the name mo and being muslim has not featured significantly in his life until now waldman is a passionate writer who delves deeply into the subjects of racism personal ambitions grief and pride without ever resorting to cliche highly recommended","95":"i really liked book at first up until 2 3 of it the idea of a muslim designing the memorial for 9 11 and the chance that would have for forgiveness and understanding between the cultures looked intriguing and the role of the media and politics trying to not let that happen sounded like an interesting conflict to solve but after 2 3 into the stubbornness of the protagonists began to really annoy me and overall for me sounded almost unrealistic","96":"a very good book that made me think i was surprised the author could remain so objective for the course of the book","97":"this was good it reminded me a bit of tom wolfe perhaps it's the novel written by a reporter coincidence i was eager to read this because many reviewers said it was amazing and probably the best 9 11 book written yet it didn't quite live up to that although i cannot name a better one and that's ok with me","98":"no spoiler here because you learn this in the first chapter the winner of a blind design competition for a 9 11 memorial turns out to be an american muslim it's a genius premise making for an excellent and provocative novel readers experience the depressingly convincing fallout through the perspectives of a number of disparate characters as a result each character may be somewhat less rounded or examined relative to novels having a smaller cast but that's a small quibble and indeed is in complete accord with one of the novel's takeaways that an individual can quickly become rather puny and powerless once his or her own unique circumstances become symbolic and significant to outsiders in this case the world if a media political religious narrative crashes into your life forget it you--your choices your beliefs your wants--pretty much stop mattering there's a lot more to notice in this book--the irreconcilable clash between mohammad's values and his interests for example--and indeed my book club had one of its best discussions to date","99":"3 5 really enjoyed it quick and compelling read for a busy time in the semester inventive plot but needed further character development for me to feel like i truly cared about the characters","100":"not sure i loved the book but it definitely kept me thinking","101":"an american named mohammed khan enters a contest to build a memorial for 9 11 he wins but there is much controversy when the committee discovers he is muslim the story revolves on justice against prejudice","102":"a very intriguing plot art or design are open to endless interpretation does the meaning behind either change if we know the story or history behind the artist or creator should certain art only be allowed for certain settings the story pushes the reader to really think about their own bias","103":" and a half i loved this book for the plot the characters and the fact that it made me think which argument could i agree with all of them or none of them an impossible situation should a muslim be allowed to design the memorial garden for the 9 11 victims dammed if you do dammed if you don't and what a clever title the plans for the garden submitted or submission to the will of allah god the relatives of the victims the american public the press and i did like the ending perhaps this should have been a 5 review after all","104":" while the depiction of what it's like to be a journalist in new york city is pretty spot on waldman used to be one so write what you know eh i have to say i didn't love this book every significant plot development came up so suddenly almost like waldman just sort of backed into it that i found the progression of the novel to be hurky jerky i also felt the book didn't know what it wanted to be a commentary on semi real life events a spoof time lines were also inconsistent more hurky jerkiness i really wanted to like this book but really found it a chore to soldier to the end","105":" amy waldman is a writer to follow she is an experienced journalist and this is her first published work of fiction great start i would encourage her to continue using her journalistic knowledge while also encouraging her to flesh out her characters in less of a reportage fashion she's really close to doing it all great fast paced story realistic conflicts breadth of characters worldly knowledge and challenging denouement this is a quick read that will hold your attention ah the premise after a tragedy based on 9 11 a prestigious jury reviews anonymously submitted plans for a memorial when the winning envelope is opened the selected architect is mohammad khan an american of muslim descent well as you can imagine the events spiral out of control submission answers to all of its webster definitions","106":"a group is choosing a design for a memorial of those lost on 9 11 the entries are kept anonymous until the committee makes their final selection and then they discover that the creator of the garden is mohammad khan a muslim chaos ensues as some support khan's rights to have his submission selected and others vehemently oppose him based solely on his religious background this book is told from the perspective of a number of characters khan's of course but also an illegal immigrant's a reporter's a woman claire who lost her husband on 9 11 and who was the most avid supporter of the garden a man named sean who lost his brother on 9 11 and so on great character development the thing i found quite remarkable about this book is that other than the reporter who i found detestable you come to really understand each character's perspective even those perspectives that i personally am completely opposed to i found i could understand and on some level appreciate where they were coming from the story did not end as i would have hoped but the ending seemed very believable","107":"interesting theme certainly thought provoking however it was apparent that the the american way would not prevail for mr khan from early in the book similar to the mosque controversy the debates were tiring for me","108":"i really enjoyed this story of possible circumstances today","109":"thought provoking and intriguing complex characters that make you think about your own prejudices and perspectives lots of unintended consequences in the course of the story whose fault are they","110":" one of the best books i have read in a long time i read a review when it first came out and had it on my amazon wish list waiting for it to come down in price on the kindle edition however i found it as a real book in a 2nd hand stall in hungerford arcade it was a pleasure to read a paperback after reading most of my reviews on here on kindle i loved it it was easy to read the story flowed but touched on some really important subjects in a sensitive way it was engaging and the characters were drawn so well that i could empathise with them and many moments when i had to catch my breath and a few late night the ending caught me out but some characters should have been 'revisited' i think you'll know what i mean when if you read it but i don't want to give any spoilers for a first novel from amy waldman it was superb and i will read her nest","111":"really 4 1 2 stars a rewarding read glad 9 11 is pretty far back by now the story of a muslim who designs the award winning monument to 911 in ablind competitiion really good premise well told story good development of multiple characters the artist the surviviors both sane and extremist and the contest bureaucrat gave some interesting insights into the mindset of a very american muslim american very sympathetic character i assume waldman isn't muslim and am amazed at how she appears to nail it in my estimation one of my favorite reads of the year","112":" i had a hard time assigning a number of stars to this book on the one hand i found it to be very thought provoking an interesting story and beautifully written on the other hand i thought the character development was uneven we did get a few well developed characters by this i mean we see them for both their strengths as well as their flaws mo claire and paul for example but many of the other important but not necessarily central characters were cast as stereotypes and really unlikable stereotypes at that i e alyssa and debbie given that waldman's background is as a journalist i found it interesting that the journalist character is such a sleazeball although she did work for the post and not the times so i ended up with 3 stars but i still think it's a book that is worth reading","113":"i really wanted to like this book at some level i did for example the author dealt with the complexity of culture religion and racism pretty well there wasn't much character development though and i kept wanting more","114":"i'm glad someone recommended this for our book club i think it will prove to provide an interesting discussion in summary a jury judges anonymous submissions for design of a 9 11 memorial once that anonymous winner is selected they find out he is a secular american muslim obviously controversy ensues waldan does a great job with character development and reaction i read that this book has garnered much comparison to bonfire of the vanities another great read","115":"good fictional account that captures the shades of gray around making a very public memorial","116":" this is the seattle reads selection for this year although i have not managed to participate in any of the activities beyond reading the book it is a fine book although i did not enjoy it the fault is entirely my own it's a book about new york and new yorkers and people being themselves and none of those things are things i enjoy reading about it is well written and i did keep reading in spite of my dislike for the majority of the characters it's a good look at how things are complicated and how that gets abused by people with hidden or not so hidden agendas i find that a frustrating aspect of real life and literature both","117":"exceptional we often talk about non fiction that reads like fiction this is the exact opposite","118":"this is a thought provoking and disturbing book it left me thinking about the characters and story long after i finished reading america's feelings about 9 11 are explored pain fear forgiveness anger and integrity","119":" this was fabulous i listened to it on a long trip to and from northern vermont and was immerse in a particular moment in new york city and america when our country was still trying to heal from the attacks of 9 11 here the submission refers to a design entered in a competition to erect a memorial to that event a defining monument and contemplative space that is meant to serve the needs of the victims the families and all americans but the title may also refer to the way we humans submit to the views and beliefs of those around us to the point of succumbing to a form of mass cultural prejudice what is art how does architecture symbolically serve a society who gets to choose our nation's symbols how does faith come into play is america a christian country at its heart how does wealth and class determine how ideas and beliefs are perceived by others how does one maintain personal integrity and principles in the face of mounting hysteria how does the press feed or even create that hysteria who is american and who gets to decide this distinction these are just a few of the questions waldman takes on in her novel about an american muslim whose design for the memorial is chosen by a group of artists historians and critics and one representative member of the families as frictions mount first within the selection committee then among the various factions of the families the action builds to outright muslim bashing and violence the author writes with great authority on this time and place while she may not actually answer all of the questions above she certainly turns the reader's attention to them a week later i keep thinking about this book and all of its tensions","120":"this book was a little disturbing for me probably because it is so well written the premise is that 2 years after 9 11 a memorial committee has chosen an architect to build a memorial at the sight the twist is that the architect who remained anonymous until the design was chosen is an arab american this twist creates the conflict that pits character against character and character against self some characters simply choose sides we must not condemn all arabs for the acts of these few vs we must see that the acts of these few prove that arabs cannot be trusted for other characters the sides are not so clear does choosing this architect strike a blow for them or for us does denying him his win mean they win or would it be allowing him to build his garden paradise that allows them to win should we build a memorial that is a lightening rod for so much controversy and stress waldman does not really ever answer the question and i was never really able to answer the question for myself but even though i was disturbed by some of the ugliness portrayed in the book i was also immersed in it and feel richer for having read it","121":" entertainment weekly had this as the #1 fiction book of 2011 if so this was a really really bad year i just did not think much of the book the characters i found annoying and not compelling at all the end i found predictable i would put the night circus way way ahead of the submission i hesitated to read it because it was a 9 11 book and maybe that tainted my perspective anyway if you are an avid reader with time on your hands its not a total waste but if you have a backlog of books and aren't just yearning to jump on the pop culture band wagon i'd pass","122":"outstanding evocation of the complex and varied reactions when the designer of a proposed 9 11 monument is revealed to be a muslim thought provoking and always engaging","123":"outstanding scope of characters all portrayed so so well in this striking moving post 9 11 story gorgeous prose deft style crisp dialogue will seek out more from amy waldman","124":"boring","125":" this is waldman's first novel and it's very good she's a strong writer precise economical those two talents carry the book forward the tale of a contest in new york to identify a design for a 9 11 memorial is character driven for about the first two thirds of the book and it moves along splendidly the characters drive the plot as it should be then in the final third waldman's precise descriptions of every nuance of every character's emotions as the ending nears serve only to slow the pace which is the last thing you want to do in my opinion these explorations didn't add much to the overall story and therefore weren't worth it by cutting about 50 pages waldman would have achieved a read all night page turner but this is a quibble by exploring the nature of america's reaction to islam in those early days following the attach waldman has made a great contribution to our literature about it which i've been finding piss poor in the submission we learn a great deal from characters who are deeply drawn while it's hard to avoid stereotypes when telling a tale like this one waldman mostly achieves that avoidance i'll eagerly await her next book","126":"one of the best and most insightful novels i've ever read it kept me thinking for weeks a must read for every american","127":" what a lovely story of an alternate new york that could have emerged after the twin towers fell the premise is that the anonymous garden design chosen for the memorial turns out to have been designed by a muslim american named mohammed khan khan turns out to be more of a bro than a religious zealot but his pride prevents him from defending himself or assuaging the fears of certain members of the public and much misunderstanding and intolerance ensue i enjoyed the writing and the woven together story lines of various characters who had been affected by 9 11 and by the memorial controversy the debates became didactic at times a telling rather than a showing but i ended up speeding through this book because the story and the characters were so compelling","128":"a thoughtful and provocative novel waldman masterfully confronts some very heavy contemporary issues","129":" the submission is a story that is told from many different view points about what happens when a member of an unpopular religious group albeit by birth only has the winning entry in a contest to build a memorial for the victims of a terrorist attack that was orchestrated by members of that same religious group yes this is a fictionalized account of post 9 11 events in new york city the best thing i can say about this book is that it is very thought provoking the premise is rather interesting until you get a few pages into the book that is when the cliches and stereotypes start to appear i absolutely hated most of the characters they are all stuck into their rigid roles holding strong to their own beliefs never wavering or submitting to the views of anyone else i really think i would have liked this book a lot more if there weren't so many characters or if the main three were more fully fleshed out and the others were more periphery the one spark of enjoyment was the character asma anwar a bangladeshi widow of 9 11 with a child born a month after the tragedy who is in this country illegally but then the author ended her part in such a typical fashion that i just have to ask why why write a story that has nothing truly original in it why did it all have to be so predictable and especially why did the characters have to be so boring there wasn't any growth or learning from past experience in any of the characters the one good thing that has come from reading this book is a reminder that we as individuals need to be mindful of each others' feelings and beliefs different doesn't mean bad or wrong it usually just means different","130":"shoulda coulda won the pulitzer","131":"amazing i read this based on recommendations from friends who had read it in their book clubs i suggested it to my club and i can't wait for the discussion the premise is pretty simple what if a jury chooses a 9 11 memorial from an anonymous nation wide search and the winning submission turns out to have been designed by a muslim the layers to this simple idea are just astounding who is affected and why the subsequent consequences and the public debate it causes in the country i highly recommend it","132":"this was of course my 9 11 anniversary selection although the characters seemed a bit too neatly slotted i liked the way waldman gave most of them a twist so that their motivations and opinions about the muslim designed memorial looked believably different at the end of the book than at the beginning just as in life i would say","133":"this novel came in for me during the weekend of 9 11 being the 10th anniversary of the attack i looked forward to reading it over the weekend i was very disappointed it begins two years after the september 11th attacks and a jury has been assembled to select a wtc memorial from thousands of submissions that are anonymous after much discussion \"the garden\" is selected when the sealed envelope is opened the architect is revealed a muslim named mohammad khan \"mo\" as his friends call him is an american born and raised in virginia the son of immigrants from india the book contains a cast of characters including family members of 9 11 victims including a firefighter that died the widow claire burwell that is on the jury and fights for the selection of \"the garden\" an illegal immigrant from bangladesh who has lost her husband in the attack assorted politician artists activists and one particularly vile journalist the author tries to portray the anguish of the survivors along with the ever increasing paranoia and hatred of all things muslim unfortunately she falls short in these goals the problem is that all of her characters are flat one dimensional and underdeveloped i found myself not caring for any of the characters and could not get inside of their skin to develop any empathy the only character i found having a strong emotional reaction to was the journalist that worked for one of the nyc tabloids she was the only one in which i could sense desperation and the corruption of her morals as she did whatever she could to make a name for herself other than that i was frustrated at not being able to be drawn into claire burwell's grief or mo khan's anger or frustration this is a hard book to be drawn into and a hard book to finish","134":"i'd put this book somewhere between 3 and 4 stars an interesting premise but too many characters the build up was too slow and the ending was unsatisfactory although i didn't love reading this book it would make a very good book club choice as there are lots of discussion points raised","135":"i enjoyed this novel that reflects much of our current political atmosphere good and bad in a fictionalized story of a post 9 11 memorial the story never specifically mentions the wtc or 9 11 for that matter but the context is clear i was actually reminded more of the controversy surrounding the proposed mosque near the ground zero site than the actual 9 11 memorial selection the novel does a pretty good job of depicting various character's motivations and changing perspectives while some of the most strongly anti muslim characters are depicted as crass manipulators i guess that wasn't too hard for me to buy i'd recommend this as one of the better post 9 11 releases","136":" i've had this on my to read list for awhile and have really looked forward to reading it it did not disappoint the premise of the book is intriguing as it is believable in the aftermath of 9 11 a competition is set up to design a memorial for the victims of the attack the committee charged with selecting the winning design from anonymous submissions picks a design that was submitted by a muslim american what happens next is the strength of the novel how believable the reactions and the course of events following disclosure of that information but what helps set the novel apart is that the primary characters claire the widow on the selection committee mo the muslim architect who submitted the design asma the bangladesh undocumented immigrant whose husband was killed in the attacks among others are complicated souls and waldman gives the reader honest glimpses into their confusion and mental struggles with the decisions they make compelling read that will make one think about how we define ourselves as a country and provide opportunities for moral judgments discernments in how the primary characters and ancillary characters make decisions","137":"the writing isn't my favorite style but the story was thought provoking it isn't a book where you fall in love with any of the characters","138":" this book was selected as the 2012 all fairfax reads book part of the fairfax county public library system i had to wait a long time to get the book from my local library but it was worth the wait it is a compelling read and speaks to the complexity of what it means to be american but also the terrible way in which humans can be toward one another it almost felt like i was watching a car crash occurring as i sped my way through the book like it was a disaster that i couldn't stop from happening but couldn't tear my eyes from at the same time update on 27 september 2012 amy waldman came to speak in fairfax va as part of the 2012 fall for the book program i was considering going and finished the book just in time but i didn't feel up to going out that night you can watch a pbs newshour interview with the author here interesting quotes at the moment he planned to disavow his muslim identity his subconscious had unearthed its kernal p 31 amazing how chaotic and impossible things could seem when they were concentrated into a few pages of

something good gets punished for doing so horribly all the hurtful words and deceit and actions foisted upon those who want to do the \"right thing \" seem all too plausible in our overly invasive news cycles of course trying to figure out what's the \"right thing\" is difficult and smartly in this book possibly a moving target importantly this book paints many characters as not merely black or white but differing shades of gray and critical to the narrative arc these shades of grey change over the course of the story the story starts with a simple premise that explodes with complexity \"what if the winner of the 9 11 memorial was a muslim \" author amy waldman paints an authentic picture of all the various parties who try to bend this event to their own advantage from victims to network commentators to reporters thirsting for the one big story that makes their career given all the recent particularly alarming news from the middle east this book published in 2011 seems to capture all of american's wide range of feelings about muslims and the middle east and prejudice i was drawn to the seemingly realistic portraits of the muslim characters and the varying opinions and arguments among them as much as the varying opinions and arguments amount americans from far right to far left and folks somewhere in the middle i read this book for \"the guy's book club\" and i'm glad because it's a book that cries for discussion you should know that i have a bit of a quibble with one aspect of the ending but that's the sum total of my complaints \"the submission\" engaged me on an emotional level which in turns upset me surprised me and reinforced some fears about all of us if you read it tell me if you like it","140":" the submission of the title is a garden to be built on the site of the twin towers as a memorial to the victims of the 9 11 disaster there were other submissions the void for instance but the only one that matters in amy waldman's novel is the garden that is because it was designed by an architect with the unfortunate name of mohammed khan that a muslim man should be chosen to create such a memorial breeds much controversy the novel is structured around the repercussions of selecting khan's garden design for this purpose waldman introduces a large cast of characters in order to demonstrate the complexity of this problem we see many points of view from paul rubin the chair of the selection committee to sean gallagher the brother of a firefighter victim to asma a bangladeshi illegal immigrant who lost her caretaker husband in the collapse of the buildings there are many others too but the two most important characters in the novel are claire burwell a beautiful widow who was on the selection committee as a representative of the victims' families and the architect mo khan himself there is a ripple effect here one reaction leads to another then to another and so on the reader sits on the sidelines and observes as the story bounces from one resulting event to another i liked this structure although at times i thought the novel rather slow as a result ultimately the submission is a novel that is well wroth discussing","141":"though provoking reminded me a bit of a tom wolfe novel albeit a little with a little less of his flamboyance the characters often end up in corners fighting for things they're not sure they even believe in","142":"i found all of the characters unpleasant then i attended an authors reading and found out i was suppose to not like them she was captivating","143":"this review has been hidden because it contains spoilers to view it click here thought provoking story about the turmoil around the submission of the twin towers memorial by an architect mohammed kahn a non religioius muslim","144":"the most interesting part of this book is the double play if the title on the surface it is about the submission of a plan for a 9 11 or 9 11 like memorial however the true essence of the book is about changing viewpoints or not changing and thus not submitting with the tide of public opinion good book i'm just not into 9 11 themed books","145":"this story takes a look at a fictional scenario suppose a contest were held for designs for the 9 11 memorial at ground zero and suppose the winning entry was submitted by a muslim this story takes a look at the scenario from many different views family members of the deceased politicians public figures who specialize in hate and the journalists who not only report the news but also cause it to happen this story is set two years after the towers fell and everyone involved is still very raw emotionally the tone of the book heavy with angst and every decision seems to have a multitude of views and no one seems happy with anything","146":"in trying to assign a number of stars to this book i was in a quandary if it was on content i would probably give it no more than a 3 an engaging quick read on the surface it seems to simply be a replay of some old themes surrounding 9 11 however after completing the book and thinking about many of the issues raised i decided to give it 4 on every page i turned i saw the anger bigotry jealousy hubris and need to find someone to blame above all else hiding under the themes of the memorial's possible more noble original intent to rebuild remember honor the dead and demonstrate the need for nationalism one america unity healing humility peace the examination of those themes impressed me if it encouraged a more thoughtful approach to 9 11 and its aftermath it became more worthy in my eyes it is not quite about 9 11 but is more about how people approached the proper way to memorialize it the memorial was designed to be selected in an anonymous contest to create the ideal atmosphere of fairness and equality it was a liberal idea to be the most democratic in the end it makes a mockery of the words since fairness is interpreted weighted heavily on the basis of who is being judged when the winner is chosen the controversy begins because he is a muslim the overriding disturbing factor is this can a muslim design the memorial for thousands murdered by muslims even if this particular one is neither a practicing muslim nor a guilty one i was disappointed when the author in a typical knee jerk reaction assumed the anger came from the right glorifying liberals who were more open minded the book became a bit too political then but in the end perhaps the ultimate criminal the ultimate fiend was possibly on the left when an innocent voice was silenced by someone who thought they had the only right message like with the occupiers of today sometimes a message can be contaminated with irrationality even though the masses may support it i don't know the author's intent but the book made me think about the many misguided self righteous people who rally round a message without understanding its ultimate meaning or consequence i am certain that some will dislike this book observing that it is unimaginative and really raises no new issues that have not been explored ad nauseum but i found that what it did really well was the exploration of the emotions behind the characters' actions the dialogue made the reader think about the why it happened not just that it did happen it did a good job analyzing motives inner feelings behavior and end results what provoked each character to react as he did in each situation was it altruism nationalism patriotism egotism self promotion professional growth greed were any of the motives pure were any of the players ultimately guilt free with regard to the novel's conclusion is it possible for anyone to be free from outside influences is it right for the media to incite the public just for readership when it serves no purpose except to shut down dialogue and perhaps incite fury do we need an enemy even a contrived target in order to find a solution the book made me think about the philosophy of life that motivates each of us and how we each think we are right in a given situation are we victims of the press of our own prejudices secret and overt what drives us all are we all submitting to our hidden agendas in some way would it be better if we always had a cooling off period before we reacted so our response would be thoughtful not charged or agitated the title is a double entendre which is more apparent as the book evolves at first it is about the main character who submits a design to memorialize the victims of 9 11 on the site of the original buildings is his submission worthy it also becomes an investigation into the act of submitting submitting to a religion submitting to the contest results submitting to fate submitting to one's g d one's spouse one's government to any and all outside pressure we all engage in the act of submission when is it acceptable respectable there is one scene which is poignant and revealing which sums up the act of submission in its varied costumes a character shows up with his cohorts at the home of the representative of the families on the 9 11 memorial committee there he finds a small heap of stones he picks them up as he contemplates breaking her windows because he is angry and does not agree with her position about the memorial in attempting to get his way to have his wishes pleased he unwittingly destroys the cairn built as a memorial by her children to their father submitting to his baser instincts he destroys one memorial in favor of another which points out the true tragic failure of the project and the wrongheadedness of the misguided vengeance is never the right answer","147":"i can't remember the last time a novel caused me to think like this a blind competition for designing a 9 11 memorial is won by a muslim what happens next an excellent choice for book clubs","148":"good read waited for something to happen but it took a long time to resolve the problem","149":" i have not been any good at reading the post 9 11 literature my feelings about 9 11 are complicated and passing time has not made that any easier but one thing i know is that reading literature on a topic can help me dissect and accept complicated emotional reactions and so i figured better late than never and this book about the 9 11 memorial was as good a place to dive in as any stripped to the core this is a story about what happens when the design for a 9 11 memorial chosen after a painstakingly careful blind submission process turns out to be one by a muslim man the selection committee the political leaders involved the 9 11 families and the muslim community are all rattled by this when it is suggested that the architect khan withdraw his submission it opens a pandora's box of questions to which there are no satisfactory answers what does it mean to be american what does it mean to be muslim who is entitled to grieve publicly over 9 11 who indeed is most affected what does it mean for america to be both a victim of terrorism and a bastion of free expression where is the dividing line between public and private how do we as civic bodies make decisions waldman is adept at creating sympathetic characters even those who say and do things i hate are human and the characters who share my personal ideology make as many mistakes as the rest using a metaphor of a garden waldman creates a story with room for reflection and wandering encounters with the other and self it is an apt image to consider our human natures and the ways we try to be more expansive","150":"the anonymous competition for the proposed 9 11 memorial goes hay wire when it is revealed that the selection committee has chosen an american born muslim architect's garden design this thought provoking novel examines how difficult the healing process is for our country in the aftermath of our worst national tragedy the submission contains much that is worthy of discussion and should make an excellent book club pick highly recommended","151":" this book has a great premise its a good example of one of those issues where there isn't a clear or obvious solution the author does a good job at arguing all sides through her characters in a way that is sympathetic to all parties the characters are quite well defined but the story seems to peter out at the end and falls into the 20 year later catch up of all the characters the writing was pretty good and engaging for the most part but there were times when it felt like i was reading the notes for a particular section notes that were intended to guide what would later become the prose large portions of the plot's development seemed to be covered in two paragraphs at the beginning of a chapter but those are actually minor points in what is a really good attempt to explore the contradictions within america around religious tolerance immigration and politics in a post 9 11 world","152":"the 9 11 novel every american must read full stop and one of the most vividly nuanced portrayals of muslim american identity as any i've encountered in a work of contemporary fiction","153":"this was a 3 5 read for me","154":"topical examination of our ideals under stress author is a journalist who presents a wide variety of characters personality social religious educational financial and national traits all over the map characters function as types that sometimes feel stereotyped but works for this book it's a book more important for its ideas it's a good read","155":"i really liked this book it was engaging and thought provoking the characters were complex and not predictable a lot to think about","156":"interesting premise i appreciated the way the book went about viewing a complex topic from many angles but wow did it rehash those angles to a fault","157":"i'm not sure where to start on this review other than to say that the book is amazing the author's amazing ability to cover all viewpoints in an honest authentic manner is what makes this book unique i believe this comes from her professional experience as the co chief of the south asian bureau of the ny times combined with some rare human talent for understanding other cultures and human experiences the book is about a mythic competition for a 9 11 memorial where the winner turns out to be a muslim and then the after effects the competition takes place just 2 years after 9 11 so emotions are raw prejudices hurt feelings attacks on muslims sentitivities etc the submission explores america's feelings re the 9 11 attacks the muslim attackers america's muslim community america's prejudices what are they how do we feel about them etc etc points of the book that i marked because of their impact in the book many don't think that an american muslim should be allowed to design the 9 11 memorial an illegal immigrant whose husband died in the towers responds we are grateful we have all tried to give back to america but also i want to know my son he is muslim but he is also america or isn't he you tell me what should i tell my son this struck me hard i am an american muslim my grandfather fought in wwii we have been in the us for multiple generations my 9 year old son recently asked me mom why do americans hate muslims so much how do you encourage love for one's country and loyalty to one's country when your son clearly sees so much hate pointed directly at him and when he so often has people telling him go back home to your country he asks me what country and people tell him islam and american are incompatible so he wants to know what that says about him in the book the muslim architect doesn't feel that he needs to explain his design against anti muslim rhetoric i e any more than catholics would need to explain extremist catholics' actions claire a jury member trying to understand the memorial design states mr khan says he shouldn't have to say what the garden is or where it came from and he's right but i want him to i appreciated this line because as a muslim i get sick and tired of being asked as an individual to explain the actions of extremist terrorists as if they have anything to do with me or my community timothy mcveigh was a christian but he was is in no way representative of christianity and christians would never be asked to explain how or why his actions represent or don't represent christianity it's obvious they don't we are educated enough about the religion to know that his acts were are prohibited by his religion many american muslims feel this same frustration as i the constant demands for explanations and apologies with that said the last part of the book's statement is fair the truth is that most americans know very little about islam and there is a long history of misrepresentation of islam in the christian world for centuries so it is fair for christians to ask muslims to explain their religion to ask for information and clarification to better understand it muslims should not be offended that non muslims want information and clarification especially given the violence of self declared muslim terrorists although they might want to understand the fatigue of muslims being asked this over and over again often by a questioner with impure intentions and antagonism the statement above was written is the perfect words to help me as a muslim better understand the non muslim inclination for information and clarity another line in the book that has a similar effect is \"...asking them the families of 9 11 victims to operate on trust when he refused to give us any reason to trust him \" and that's fair in such a tense period when people are losing love ones to terrorism and fear prevails how can you expect people to operate on trust for things they don't know or understand the other thing in the book that personally struck me was the emotional harm done to mohammad khan through the memorial contest experience he starts out as a devoted american a non practicing muslim barely even aware he is muslim a successful architect excited to contribute a beautiful design to help people heal from the 9 11 attacks after the whole memorial context experiences he says that \"he found himself reinvented by others so distorted he couldn't recognize himself \" and at the end of the book he mentions the desire for an apology for all he suffered during the experience acknowledgement of the wrong done to him and credit for his refusal to agree that the 9 11 attacks justified america's suspicion of all muslims without going too personal as a white muslim who wore the muslim hijab for three years during those years i experienced being violently driven off roads spit at yelled at shoved had my children threatened once my two year old was pushed off a 15 foot slide etc etc i lost my educated at georgetown \"white identity\" and became to most americans an oppressed illiterate non english speaking despite my absolutely perfect mid western english immigrant woman not worthy of any respect told i was no longer worthy of being american told to leave america and more what this basically taught me was that the america i experienced as a on the surface white middle class american is not the same america that you experience if you're a visible muslim or pick your minority and so for me at least reading about khan and how he is changed throughout the book his pain through the memorial process he obstinacy his refusal to explain himself his part in the book where he just states over and over and over again \"i am an american \" makes a lot of sense and i just feel for him but... i also really understand all of the other personalities too which is why i think this book is absolutely brilliant it covers multiple perspectives with accuracy i don't know many people who can create such a story and do justice to all of the various perspectives involves bravo to amy waldman","158":"i put off reading this for some time because i was afraid it would be predictable and it pretty much was well done but i thought some opportunities for increased texture were missed it might have been an editorial decision perhaps the editor or an agent pushed the author away from too much complexity too bad if so i found the sean and debbie characters unenlightening for example i'm sure there are in fact people just like them which is why i would rather waldman had enriched them or found other more interesting reactionary muslim haters to portray mo was interesting claire not up to the role she is placed in all too human for the tremendous pressure she is under there were a couple of things that disturbed me deeply because i didn't feel the author was examining them closely enough how is a non practicing muslim a muslim islam is a faith not an ethnicity so if you are agnostic or atheist or just secular you are not a muslim right it makes as much sense to say secular muslim as it does to say secular catholic or secular christian right i realize mo wants to withdraw from the public discussion of the question of his religion on the principle that if a white person from east bumfuck michigan had won the contest no one would be interrogating her background or beliefs nevertheless the fact that he is secular seems perfectly accessible to anyone investigating his background certainly he has other friends besides the one coworker other past girlfriends childhood friends etc certainly this could have come up there must have been journalists sympathetic to him even if only a few worse mo himself seems to refer to my religion internally and among his coworkers and friends and he says things like because i am a muslim why would he characterize himself as a muslim if he is non practicing this is very confusing but of course we have all been confused about this before jews seem to share in this confusion i have had many discussions with jewish friends about whether judaism and jewishness is an ethnicity or a faith and even when jewish people including an anthropology professor who taught a holocaust course in college insist that it's a faith and not an ethnicity and even when they insist they are secular they still also characterize themselves as jews and yet i would not call myself a christian or a catholic despite having been raised as both it's very odd people need to clean up their thinking about this matter i feel re this book when a fatwa is issued against mo once he reveals his assumption that the quran is written by a human rather than divine hand the jig should be up but no one seems to pick up on this outside the muslim world i bring this up because i think it would have complicated the book nicely to have some of the jury members and even the press public get more involved in the intricacies of islam i also wish that someone on the jury had leaked the competing design not claire not within her character to do it but to emphasize that the process was anonymous a fan of the other design ought to have leaked it hoping to win support for it only to have the public recoil in horror at the void then we could have have even more fun over the idiocy of the american people regarding art and also the fact that maybe people actually do like mo's design better and the cognitive dissonance around that oh well interesting premise and some nice writing a little too hopeful on where america might be 20 years after all this","159":"an american muslim wins an anonymous contest to design a memorial to the victims of 9 11 and the complex characters in this novel try to navigate the political and personal repercussions of that situation amy waldman writes characters of opposing viewpoints but sympathetic motivation the reader yearns for a reasonable resolution and some compromise and finds almost none yet since the characters remain true to themselves one cannot fault the author in fact i completed the book feeling the tragic but honest truth of humanity exceptional","160":"what a fabulous book this novel will make a great book club selection","161":"this review has been hidden because it contains spoilers to view it click here i would give this book 4 5 stars if i could just short of a masterpiece it really made me question how i have thought of and treated muslim people since september 11th it didn't catch me right away but i got swept up in all of the characters and their perspectives i really enjoyed how we got a little bit of closure by flash forwarding 20 years later at the end","162":"read with book club and we voted read with reservationsitbwas an interesting story about people acting on influences of others their own prejjustice news media influence","163":"interesting exploration of the american psyche and reaction overreaction to sept 11 events and the aftermath i will now explore what really happened with the selection of the memorial design just for my own information and hopefully i'll be able to keep separate what really happened from this fictional account","164":"pretty good read kind of a slow burn until the end but kept me engaged","165":"excellent books to make you wonder what is american and how are fears always come back to make us do the unamerican thing","166":" i had a hard time getting through this book part of me wanted to put it down but my more logical side demanded a reason why is this book not worth finishing i came to the conclusion that a book that is not clearly good is as bad as one that is clearly not good nothing about this book turned me off enough to give up on it but nothing made me excited enough to keep reading it was more a matter of willpower and determination plus a teeny bit of white guilt however i am glad that i persevered as the ending was surprisingly cathartic","167":"this struck me as overwrought at times also maybe more relevant now than when it was first published the latest presidential political campaign and world events seem lifted out of the pages of the submission the characters are a bit flat but maybe necessarily so to represent the variety of ideologies","168":" rare is the book that makes you truly question your own beliefs and how you would respond in the given scenario in 2003 an appointed panel chooses a design winner in a blind competition for the world trade center memorial in downtown manhattan the group is a smattering of ny elite include attorneys artists historians and a wealthy widow whose husband died in the wtc the first few chapters describe the inner workings of the jury as they narrow the field to two designs with advocates and dissenters on both sides i liked the inter play between the characters here and i do wish that some of that would have continued through the rest of the story finally the jury votes and in a slight majority the garden design is selected after hard campaigning by the widow claire but when the designer is revealed to be an american muslim a whole lot of scrambling happens the jury decides to sit on their decision for a few days but in the meantime the winner is leaked to the press and the windfall begins at the heart of it is mohammed mo khan the intensely private designer and architect just as one would suspect he is eaten alive by the press and many citizen groups very few people including the jury that chose his design come to his defense mo's motivations come into question and he is thrown into the role of villain hero and martyr all at once by the different factions swirling around this nexus is the story of two other families sean the brother of a fallen firefighter and asma the illegal bangladeshi immigrant whose husband was a janitor in the wtc these two stories were so heavy and full of gravity i really like the way waldman wrote both of these characters who couldn't be more different than each other this is a ripe choice for book group discussion because there is so much to chew on extremely powerful book one of my favorites of the year","169":"very smart but without a soul","170":"couldn't finish it","171":"very good 9 11 novel gets a bit weaker towards the end","172":"i probably would have given it 4 stars but the ending was flat it was a pretty easy book to be drawn into with an interesting premise but i was expecting more from the ending","173":"i thought this was good though a little drawn out the ideas behind what motivates us as individuals and as a nation to act are thought provoking and definitely good discussion material","174":"by far the most thought provoking book i've read all year","175":"fascinating premise for the story and really interesting characters","176":"painfully horrible","177":"sloppy structure flat characters the only redeeming factor is mo's integrity in staying true to his inspiring design i read this for a book club but otherwise would not have bothered finishing","178":" set in manhattan as a jury of artists decide on the design for the memorial honoring the dead of 9 11 this book explores the reactions when architect mohammed khan's design called the garden is chosen khan called mo by his friends is moslem by birth not necessarily by practice we meet a variety of characters the surviving widow of a wealthy ceo journalists politicians xenophobic activists and of course the architect himself i liked this book very much it has always been clear to me that people living on the left coast did not really comprehend the enormity of 9 11 the cast of characters is an interesting bunch the premise absolutely fascinating as an exploration into american values author waldman has been associated with the new york times at the south asian desk and her journalistic values and skills make this a fascinating study","179":"well written and interesting perspective on post 9 11 dynamics sad commentary on racial stereotyping seems it will never change","180":"my rating for this is really 3 5 the book could use some editing as the pace of the story seemed to drag unnecessarily however it's a fascinating examination of the wide variety of opinions prejudices and behaviors tragedy this should provide rich book club discussion","181":"after suffering through this turd i'm going to spend a few months with the classics","182":"complex satisfying story","183":"liked it in the beginning pleasantly surprised with the ending the middle not so much also not sure i liked most of the key players","184":"this is a better story than it is a novel and could make a fantastic screenplay and film","185":" waldman's first novel is the seattle reads pick for 2012 the premise was interesting to me what if a muslim were to win the competition to design the 9 11 memorial and even better yet what if the winner was muslim in name only mo short for mohammad the architect who wins the anonymous competition was born and raised in va of parents who immigrated to the us from india the firestorm that breaks out is what one would expect religious indignation political posturing media frenzy a multitude of groups talking at each other the tension builds and does come to a boiling point of sorts while the ending feels a bit contrived trying to tie up loose ends it does seem more believable than say ann patchett's ending to bel canto the characters seem flat or one dimensional most of the time and the fact that several of them waiver in their beliefs doesn't really change that they all seem so cold i found it interesting that the most despicable character at least to me in the novel is a journalist waldman's own profession and that brings me to the writing itself definitely journalistic with a sprinkling of adjectives added and a bit of gratuitous sex thrown in for good measure","186":"while reading i sometimes had to remind myself that the story is fiction and not truth the actions and reactions thoughts and justifications felt so probable it's amazing that the author was able to put herself into the shoes of so many characters who would have been affected by such an event the choosing of a memorial for victims of a terrorist attack and make each character sympathetic and pathetic at the same time i found myself getting lost in her descriptions without stopping to put my own feelings into the scenario because her choices just made sense to me i will be recommending this to all of my friends who enjoy a book that makes you think","187":"i really enjoyed this novel even though i only liked two of the six main characters i think the author did a marvelous job of imagining the feelings of various people and the societal ramifications of what would happen were an american non practicing muslim architect to submit the winning design for the 9 11 world trade center memorial would the best in us rise to the top or would our darker impulses prevail","188":" this was a fantastic thought provoking book two years after the 9 11 attacks a competition is underway to design a memorial at ground zero a jury composed of noted artists historians critics and claire burwell a young widow whose husband was killed in the attack has narrowed down the selection to two finalists after an impassioned discussion led by claire the jury selects a winner known as the garden and when the name of the architect is revealed all submissions were anonymous to this point a stunning discovery is made the winner is an american muslim named mohammad khan the jury is fraught with indecision--should khan be disqualified because of his religion since americans would most certainly not want a memorial designed by a muslim when news of khan's selection hits the public new yorkers--and those across the world--are fueled by twin arguments some adamantly demand that khan withdraw from the competition while others feel that unfairly tarring all muslim people as terrorists is a dangerous behavior the debate over whether or not khan should be disqualified ripples into a conversation about whose grief carries more weight who should be the final say about a decision with the potential to affect the world and what makes a person an american amy waldman did a fantastic job with this her first novel she deftly evokes a troubling time in our not too distant history giving voice to all facets of the anger fear sadness and hatred that emerged following 9 11 waldman never takes sides in the argument yet allows her well drawn characters to explore the familiar and uncomfortable a few times while reading this book i worried that waldman would take the plot down a path that i didn't feel would be true to the story but she surprised me each time i did feel at times that there were too many characters to keep straight but that didn't affect my overall feelings this is a book that will make you think it may anger or sadden you but in the end you'll realize what power it contains truly amazing","189":"what a great opportunity to discuss point of view prejudice and intolerance following the tragedy of 911","190":"so much to admire here ambitious novel large cast of characters who intersect believably in a compelling plot definitely worth the read","191":"a truly thought provoking meditation on 9 11 grief public spaces the media religious tolerance and our current political discourse waldman does an amazing job weaving together a fictional story that feels ripped from the headlines","192":" the story at the heart of this novel is reminiscent of the controversy over the proposed construction of the cultural center near the original site of the world trade center sometimes referred to as the 'ground zero mosque' i was slightly disappointed by this book expecting to like it more than i did i didn't think the characters were particularly well drawn and i thought the dialog was a little clunky at times overall i think the idea of the story depicting a competition for the memorial to the events of 9 11 is interesting but didn't feel it was fully realized","193":"this book deals with the prejudices we all carry within us and the destructive power that those prejudices have on our own lives as well as the lives of the object s of our prejudice an amazing book to question ones own motives ideals and ethics the 911 destruction was a very difficult time for our country and our citizens but the way we react to the tragedy carries even more meaning","194":" i enjoyed this alternative history the committee choosing the design for a 9 11 memorial at ground zero finally arrives at a winning plan only to discover the architect who created it is named mohammed kahn lots of well drawn characters that i cared about much insight into how difficult it is for a community particularly a large diverse one to plan and carry out a public project the submission reminded me in many ways of scott simon's windy city in that it looked at how all the parties to the city's decision making have their agendas that must somehow be negotiated","195":"very well written impressive first book for waldman thought provoking and timely","196":"rich and powerful novel about the destructiveness of prejudice in this case american prejudice against muslims post 9 11","197":"on the whole the concept there is a competition for a 9 11 memorial and the jury inadvertently picks a design by a muslim architect was intriguing waldman makes the reader take a good look at american culture preaches it in places she also makes the reader take a good look at themselves where do we think we would stand in a situation like this once the arguments are laid would we stick to our beliefs or waiver however the book did have flaws it was hard to like any of the characters they all were cold maybe that is realistic the book dragged in spots as waldman was a little repetitive about what the characters felt or were doing","198":"a thought provoking book on both a personal and societal level","199":" a surprisingly great read surprising because i admit i was skeptical about a novel written by a journalist in the shadow of 9 11 the jury of eminent new yorkers charged with selecting the winning design for a ground zero memorial unleash an avalanche of unforeseen consequences when the anonymous architect awarded the honour is revealed to be a muslim with a cast of grieving widows art critics politicians rabid right wing hate groups loathsome journalists and fearful undocumented bangladeshi workers this could easily have deteriorated into farce but never did while some characters are more authentically drawn than others there were some brilliant moments of both introspection and engagement in this novel i read it compulsively to the end","200":" a novel that really makes one think about how we would stand on the building of a 9 11 memorial designed by a muslim would we react as claire or as debbie hopefully not what an interesting idea and an exploration of all the parties involved family members of victims muslim community tea partiers liberals the press and government officials an in depth novel about all involved plus how perceptions and feelings change over time i thought i would hate the ending but this novel got 5 stars after i read the last 2 lines of the book powerful","201":"compelling story despite some very forced dialogue and pre destined characterizations","202":"this book was not a quick read for me it was hard to get through because of how probable the story is well worth it","203":"this was interesting and thought provoking but i found the writing flat and often tedious","204":"very unusual and thought provoking premise it forced me to confront some of my own beliefs and question whether i could be true to my values if i were in a similar situation the book was a bit long and some of the characters did not achieve the same multi dimensional development as others but i found it worthwhile and am looking forward to discussing it with my book group","205":"extremely thought provoking well written and a great premise you get the opportunity to see the good and bad in every character and you hope you would do the right thing in the same circumstances a great read","206":"after only 3 chapters the conflict is clear and disturbing then i completed the rest of the book in one sitting thoughtful realistic the resolution is satisfying in that no one is satisfied i recommend it highly","207":"thought provoking book that made me consider how some americans continue to unfairly judge those of different religions or backgrounds the backdrop of 9 11 makes it more realistic to see how even those open minded people question their beliefs","208":"very thoughtful examination of the post 9 11 hysteria towards muslims for me at times difficult to read but worthwhile the final short section set several years in the future is disappointing though","209":"fascinating book about post 9 11 politics told through the process of the creation of a memorial site","210":"a very good look at the emotions and ethics around the design of a 9 11 memorial makes you wonder what side you'd be on","211":"interesting premise great ending but what was between put me off this book mostly the author's writing style it was meandering characters morphing every other chapter but the worst of all was the language it was as if the author wrote her manuscript and then went back and used the thesaurus feature in microsoft word to find big words to replace ones easily understood i found it off putting by page 100 it was after that i started keeping track of words that were unnecessarily difficult there were over 30 there were many more big words that i knew the meanings of but maybe lots of people wouldn't examples doyenne ablution allees expiated juddering talismanic enrobement disputatious seraphic reproach brio patois specious diaspora dhimmitude unctuous contrapuntal then there were the ridiculous sentences examples jealousy clings to love's underside like bats to a bridge their words sesemed to be layered like the complicated somewhat mystifying middle eastern dip the chef had put out on the buffet table really a decent book thought provoking sentimental ending but hard to get beyond all the gobbly de gook","212":" the submission by amy waldman takes place in manhattan following the 9 11 terrorist attack the plot involves a jury that gathers to decide on the design for the memorial to be built based on an anonymous competition the jury selects a design known as the garden but the majority of the jury members become opposed to this design upon knowledge of the name of the designer mohammed khan the sole supporter of this design is claire burwell the only member of the jury who was lost a family member to the devastating attack when information that a muslim won the competition is leaked outrage spreads throughout the country claire burwell and the jury must find a way to appease the public and the enigmatic designer at the same time the general elements of this book can be related to the 2008 united states presidential election many americans opposed barack obama as a presidential candidate because of his middle name hussein both involve the public judging an individual solely based on a name in the submission the majority of the jury and the public refuse to allow a man with a muslim name to win the competition similarly many americans refused to accept a president whose middle name is hussein i personally thought the submission was a decent book i liked several elements such as the story and the characters but the submission was not one of my favorites this book incorporated difficult vocabulary that may challenge the reader additionally several parts of the plot can be considered mature i would think that i would appreciate the book more if i was older since the submission is an adult fiction genre even though the book was not one of my favorites it met my expectations i wanted to read a book about what would happen if a muslim was selected to design a 9 11 memorial and how the general public would react and waldman provided me the opportunity to read and gain an understanding of this topic","213":"this is a marvellous book as a brit american special interest politics both interests and horrifies me amy waldman's imagining of the events surrounding the commission seems only too real to me i have been waiting for a novel that deals with the aftermath of 9 11 and this is it","214":"interesting fictional take on the struggle to design a 9 11 memorial and what would happen if a muslim won the competition goes off the rails a little at the end but vivid personalities and details about architecture made thhis compelling for me","215":"two years after the devastating events of september 11th a nation still grieves in an attempt to offer some surcease of sorrow to the country and to those who lost loved ones on that terrible day a memorial has been proposed and a blind competition held to pick the best design for the memorial now the jury who will make the final recommendation is down to two names but when they choose and realize that the winning architect is a muslim can they uphold this choice or will it destroy not only them but the memorial and divide a grieving nation among the members of the jury is claire burwell the sole representative of the families she lost her husband her two children their father it is she who fought for the garden design unknowing of its origins as being most soothing and healing to the families as well as to the nation opposing her is ariana montagu leaving the head of the jury paul rubin to play peacemaker and voice of reason the design that ariana promotes is far more bleaker than the simple lovely garden when claire's eloquence prevails the discovery is made that the designer mohammad khan is a muslim now what are they to do the submission deals with some very important issues questions that dig deep into the psyche of a nation mohammad or mo as he prefers to be known is an american with little interest in or ties to his religion but he resents that he is being pegged because of the fact that he was born a muslim when claire presses him for answers he refuses to give them on the grounds that the questions should not have been asked nor would they be asked of anyone else in that respect the submission reminds me of the contender in which a woman senator is being investigated because she has been proposed as the next vice president of the united states some very race photos alleging to be of this woman taken during her college years have surfaced causing quite the scandal but when asked to confirm or deny that these photos are of her she says she will not answer on the grounds that were she a man no one would have even asked the question is the design suspect because proposed by a muslim does that change what the design is what it says this was the purpose of the blind competition was it not to prevent the personality of the entrant to interfere with the choice of the design as being two separate entities and not relevant one to the other where does art begin and politics end is this a beautiful american garden or was it designed with islam in mind the submission is filled with memorable characters on both sides not the least of which is asma whose husband died also on that terrible day the difference in her situation and claire's is that asma and her husband are from bangladesh and he was an illegal immigrant many profound questions are explored in this tale it is amy waldman's first novel and quite the debut the only criticism i can make and this is just my own opinion is that i get no real feeling for the story by which i mean it's told in an almost cold distant manner maybe that's what she intended maybe that's a means of keeping an objective perspective i'm not saying she needed to take sides or anything of that nature but i would have liked to have seen more warmth in the people as people regardless it's well done and a provocative look at the nature of america and americans a real eye opener i'd like to see what else ms waldman can do","216":"very thoughtful commentary on our society and the individual circumstances and choices that lead to collective action well written but the progress of the story line the end in particular was not as good as the beginning","217":"fascinating tale of a jury of 12 attempting to select person to design post 9 11 memorial turns out the \"winner\" is a muslim and what an uproar occurred over that characters are well developed never a dull moment and read eagerly 2011 hardback","218":"really well written and researched the author was very effective at sympathetically presenting multiple viewpoints it was slow moving at times though and i was so aggravated with many of the characters which i shouldn't detract the author for after all she realistically portrayed people with honest flaws and honest although often ugly reactions","219":"i don't know if anger is the feeling this book is meant to evoke maybe it is it is about america's own worst self where racism rules the day and people are allowed to be vile because they're afraid and angry it is 2003 in this book and a selection committee has just chosen the design for the 9 11 memorial turns out that the anonymous architect of the winning design is a muslim named mohammad mo khan and then all hell breaks loose because every single white character in this novel with the exception of two both bit players and one sanctimoniously smug is a bigot i mean it's not like the racist venom doesn't come out in real life when an islamic community center was proposed a couple blocks away from the world trade center site some people got nasty but people also were supportive of the center including mayor bloomberg who showed more courage and humanity than any of the white characters in this book there is a scarily clear divide between white characters racist and muslim characters often heroic not a single white main character comes out well mo's boss does support him and tells mo that he will get other prominent architects to sign a letter of support for mo everyone keeps trying to get mo to bow out of the competition to avoid the controversy but then the boss is never heard from again and mo's best friend is white but besides some fumbling support in an interview he refuses to have mo's back and mostly just wants to stay out of it and the best friend's wife comes out and says that she's okay with mo being the architect in charge of the memorial but would not be okay with any other muslim thanks racist wife claire burwell initially looks like she'll be sympathetic she's the wealthy and beautiful young widow of a 9 11 victim and a member of the selection committee for the new memorial she loved mo's design known as the garden and felt it was perfect she was also the only committee member who didn't flinch when it was revealed that the architect was a muslim man and then i can't tell if it's from weariness or lack of spine or the fact that mo never said exactly what she wanted to hear or just really poor character development but claire eventually slips into the same racist bullshit as everyone else the quote that just made me give up on her forever was when she is arguing with an ex boyfriend a smug do gooder about supporting mo's design and says you with your liberal causes how do you reconcile your support for islam with your support for gay rights for feminism when you look at how women or gays or minorities get treated in so many muslim countries \" i cannot even at the point you are smearing an entire religion because some people in it are terrible people you are being a bigot fullstop other poor examples of characters are geraldine bitman the ny mayor who uses the anti muslim sentiment to her political advantage paul rubin the successful elder gentleman in charge of the selection committee who spends the entire book trying to get mo to withdraw despite the fact that he grows to deeply respect mo i think he is supposed to represent the soft apologetic liberal form of bigotry sean gallagher the heated angry violent form of bigotry who assaults a muslim woman and stalks claire weirdly enough he becomes the only white character who seems to have grown a spine and seen the error of his ways but whether he actually has become a decent human being or backslides is unknown and alyssa spier a tabloid reporter who will do anything for a scoop she's not a bigot she's just out for herself as a workaholic who will do anything to get ahead she's basically mo's foil and i may not like her but i respect her simple amoralness which is at least more palatable than all the characters pretending their motives are pure and good the muslim characters are less reflexively unlikeable and some of them are downright heroic mo is a non practicing muslim whose sole focus is his ambition he doesn't have long term relationships or even hobbies because his goal in life is to be a great architect he's married to his job and so he's unprepared to be thrust into a national controversy he's not a great guy per se just a simple workaholic but his ability to withstand the immense pressure of unwanted public attention is admirable laila faithi is a female attorney who gave up a lucrative firm career to handle cases involving muslims she is someone doing the right thing for the right reasons asma a bangladeshi 9 11 widow and i suppose this makes her claire's foil who is a billion times better than claire is the most admirable character of all she risks deportation she's an illegal immigrant to stand up to all the bigots and support mo's design malik the executive director of the muslim american coordinating council is ambiguous he may be supporting an effort he believes deeply in he may just be ambitious he does ultimately throw mo under the bus and i'm saying the white characters versus the muslim characters because that's basically the groups that waldman gives us i could be mistaken but i don't think any of the non muslim characters are any race but white or at least it doesn't come up and the focus is on the fact that the muslim characters are muslim regardless of their race or national origin i think the major problem is that no one is a person they are all just mouthpieces for whatever ideology or thought that waldman felt like sticking in their mouths if waldman just scribbled some stick figures on a piece of paper spouting off what the characters in this book were saying it would be no less developed i think waldman is playing with a very interesting idea and i read it compulsively which says that the writing is solid or maybe just that it held the same fascination as a car crash i just i just didn't want to hate everybody i wanted more complexity in the characters i felt about this book what i felt about the film crash and this awesome review pretty much works for both crash and this book","220":"terrific i was hesitant to read this novel about building a memorial at ground zero but i'm so glad i finally picked it up this book is thoughtful well written and somehow unexpected despite its subject matter","221":"i found this book to be thought provoking i agree with some of the other reviewers that i had a difficult time relating to or feeling much for any of the characters but i was caught up in the firestorm that surrounds the selection of the memorial i also love how the submission refers to so much more than the actual entry in the contest i highly recommend this book","222":"best book i have read this year excellent characters story and timely subject best post 9 11 story yet captures america's fears etc","223":"of all the 9 11 novels i've read this was the best also the grittiest with the most to say about human nature","224":"i give it 4 1 2 stars i would probably give it 5 stars if i read it straight through but i got stuck for a couple years and it was hard to get back into it i liked it a lot and would like to read it again thanks for the recommendation billy and for the actual book","225":"really pc basically accuses all americans of bigotry for being suspicious of a muslim who wants to design a 9 11 memorial the ending was really really rough the prose itself was lovely and light the pacing was excellent and the characters were knowable i just found the preachiness insufferable","226":"we read this for our book club was one of those great books where we had a lot of great conversation would definitely recommend reading it made me really research the true story of twin tower monument and how the design was chosen very interesting book","227":"4 5 stars actually this book raises so many good questions and points about trusting the other i'm pretty sure we could all do with a good reminder","228":"one that causes you to question how you might react in a similar situation what price are you willing to pay to stand up for what you believe is right","229":"this novel chronicles the passions and politics of the creation of a 9 11 memorial the selection committee unwittingly selects an american muslim as the winner and then has to deal with their choice","230":"a well written and thought provoking book that makes us examine our hidden prejudices as a result of 9 11","231":"i finished this book as the 10th anniversary of 9 11 occurred it really hit home for me well done","232":"a nuanced emotional and difficult look at our country post 9 11","233":"seldom held a book so much suspense for me i loved how waldman manages to describe a web of insecureties careeer driven people media that can lead to almost anything the ending couldn't have been better a true masterpiece","234":"in classic required reading style it was awful way too repetitive and drawn out 100 pages too long","235":"this is one of the best books i've read in a long time i particularly enjoyed amy waldman's writing style and appreciate her background as a journalist i felt she drew very real characters each with their own motivations values assets and flaws to tell many sides of a complicated story waldman's knowledge of the city the tenor after 9 11 and the factions involved added to the fact that her prose was at times simply beautiful i will continue to recommend this book to friends and family","236":" in amy waldman's debut novel a muslim man wins the competition to design the memorial for the victims of a terrorist attack in manhattan the worldwide scandal that erupts includes the families of the victims muslim leaders right wing radio hosts an intrepid reporter hot for any exclusive she can land the weakest character in the book and just about every other type you've seen express an opinion over the real life events connected to 9 11 the book's tone is a little too reportorial at times waldman was the co chief of the new york times's south asia bureau but this is a cleverly structured narrative with a pace that never flags and well drawn characters","237":"well written and thought out fascinating glimpse into ways in which a community under attack responds to the same event hmm i was thinking about the muslim community when i wrote that sentence but i just realized it could also apply to the american community who experienced 9 11 so interesting where our perspective takes us as someone who cares about civil rights i thought this book was well worth reading","238":"thought provoking and wonderfully written very insightful observations about people and human nature that are so interestingly articulated","239":" this is an intricate complicated very engrossing book about 9 11 islam and america grief and healing art and politics it follows what happens when the artist chosen to create a 9 11 memorial turns out to be an american architect who is muslim it bogged down for me a little in the middle but i was complete re engaged particularly with the plight of asma an illegal immigrant from bangladesh whose husband was killed in the attacks while she was 8 months pregnant while there is some resolution it remains complicated and thorny to the end no easy answers but a very engaging and thought provoking story","240":"i was put off a little at the beginning to find this was about 9 11 as i thought it was too soon to be capitalizing on this event however it draws you in quickly a jury considers the blind submissions for a 9 11 memorial and the winner is a muslim obviously this leads to all sorts of complications and the author handles them well","241":"a real page turner with some very human and believable characters it was very thought provoking and raised some interesting questions about the lines between religion and culture recognising difference and what separates values principles and prejudices it also made me think about whether you can separate art from the artist and i'm not sure i have an answer","242":" a book worthy for book group discussions and for high school history discussions the book explores ethnic stereotyping prejudices racism misunderstandings of religion and intentions interpretations hysteria fanatics public opinion and slanted snarky journalism all based on the design of a memorial at the 9 11 attack on world trade center site i would have liked to have seen more character development or growth but perhaps the author's intention was to leave them stunted similar to and unresolved like many views and discussions around themes in the book for ours and many countries","243":"wow so first it's a great read because it's so well written a diverse lot of characters' stories interwoven into a great tale but more than that the characters themselves are avatars of the attitudes fears and prejudices following the attack on the twin towers really thought provoking entertaining too what more could a reader ask for","244":"i was prepared to give this book 4 stars until i reached the epilogue up until then waldman had done an able job setting up a thorny premise and then letting her characters stew in it everyone in the book has his her own agenda and the reader is left to grapple with some timely moral questions possible spoliers ahead then the final section skips ahead 20 years and does its best to leave no question unanswered it felt like such a tack on following 280 pages of real thought provoking fare that i dock another star just because of it also the attempt to crown this book a modern day bonfire of the vanities is a bit forced i get that it's trying to be be a big social novel but waldman's book has not one sentence of humor in it nor is it as gleefully over the top as wolfe's was","245":"in the aftermath of 9 11 a contest is launched to find the perfect design to honor the victims of that horrific day members of the selection committee include politicians ny society and families of the deceased the entries are submitted anonymously to the committee to assure an unbiased decision when the selection a garden is made and the winner's name is revealed the selection panel as well as the entire city finds itself caught up in a spasm of fear and pain for it is mo mohammed khan american born raised in virginia successful architect and resident of nyc whose design is chosen and whose religious affiliation threatens the very fabric of what it means to be an american one nation under god allah with liberty tolerance and justice for some there is so much here that needs to be tended to","246":"omg if you were living in ny and witnessed 9 11 this story is unbelievable at first i did not want to read it re the content but do it it is wonderful and a big twist on the aftermath of 9 11 i loved it","247":"some of the writing starts to drag but overall such an interesting and thought provoking concept for a novel","248":"powerful it challenges you to examine your preconceived judgments toward nationality race religion and faith keep an open mind","249":" i had high hopes for this book the storyline as presented on the back cover suggested it would give a glimpse into the troubled relationship between mainstream american culture and the other in a post 9 11 world instead the story lingered on character development and personal narratives that while interesting and delivered with polished prose left me with few new insights into our current social and political climate to its credit the submission kept me guessing until the end but now that i have finished i have few sections that linger in my memory i would rate this two stars if it weren't for the final 30 pages which presented a nuanced portrait of the main character mohammad khan","250":"it was a difficult book to read in view of the attacks of 9 11 i don't understand what she was trying to achieve besides writing a controversial book which she knew would sell","251":"thought provoking well written","252":"this review has been hidden because it contains spoilers to view it click here 3 5 stars this was an interesting book and one that i really wanted to like more the characters were well drawn if not stereotypical and the moral dilemmas the book explores from all angles will make this a good book club selection however less would've been more it started to feel overwrought and drawn out perhaps tighter editing would've helped me enjoy this book more","253":"this is the seattle reads book for 2012 i think it will lead to some excellent book group discussions lots to talk about and consider","254":"amy waldman's the submission is an excellent read for americans of all ages we all remember how the terrorist attacks impacted our personal lives but many forget to look at the situation from other perspectives after the attacks many muslims living in america became outcasts in society as americans desperately tried to place the blame on someone for their suffering the submisson portrays the societal conflict between justice discrimination morality and popular opinion waldman introduces the reader to a variety of characters each impacted differently by the attack as each character develops and changes it becomes clear that the aftermath of the attack will never fully leave our society tthe submission begins in 2003 inside a courtroom where a jury of politicians in new york as well as one grieving family member meet to discuss and choose one submission to become the 9 11 memorial as they sort through applicants they come to the conclusion that mohammad khan's \"the garden\" would be the best choice that is until they read the name attached to the submission the jurors are shocked when they discover that the designer of such a beautiful design is muslim some of the jurors immediately want to reject the design to avoid creating conflict within the public while others fight to save the design from discrimination the submission makes society as a whole question morality as the novel progresses some begin to make shocking changes in their point of view as they discover who they are leading to a dramatic turn of events mohammad khan himself faces the internal conflict between pride in his design and dedication to america this novel helps one see that there is a very thin line between right and wrong and that sometimes morality doesn't always prevail ti personally really enjoyed the submission i loved seeing all of the different perspectives and experiences unfold into one story one perspective that impacted me the most was the life story of a woman named asma she and her husband are illegal immigrants from bangladesh seeking a better life after her husband is killed in the world trade center where he worked as a janitor asma fights to secure him the same recognition as the other people lost on that day asma's courage is honorable and opened my eyes to a perspective that i would have otherwise never thought of it was shocking to learn that there were people who died on 9 11 who went unnoticed this novel is a must read for all americans as it opens our eyes to how 9 11 affected our society as a whole and also individually there is no way to change the future if we don't learn from the past","255":"really found it hard to read only because i felt it was a train wreck in the making and it was but thought it was well written and glad i read it in the end reminded me of atonement or house of sand and fog","256":"this book isn't perfect the characters are distant not likeable almost cold but the story is fabulous an ethical dilemma that is played out well","257":" mo's father tells his son an architect i know buildings are your religion but they shouldn't keep you from god and they can't bring you to him mo's proud reserve claire's tortured ambivalence and the entire identity of a nation provided the narrative for much of the story along the way politics journalism tv personalities and american bigotry were skewered but at its core this novel forced a reckoning of sorts one in which the us did not come out on top i didn't appreciate the title of the book until the end mo's submission to the memorial committee as well as one of the meanings of islam were debated for all of their ambiguities another thing i appreciated the female characters an opportunistic journalist a grieving conflicted widow and an ambitious governor waldman did not try to make her female characters likeable only interesting","258":"thoroughly enjoyable creative and ironic critique of american culture a great read and an excellent choice for book clubs even non fiction focused ones","259":"this review has been hidden because it contains spoilers to view it click here waldman's prose and use of language are skillful and enjoyable despite the occasional over wrought over thought metaphor her writing has a literary quality that is seemingly rare among current novelists and that makes the reading quick and enjoyable i have two major reasons for not rating the book more highly 1 the characters are cartoon characters the predictable one dimensional aspect of

over thought metaphor her writing has a literary quality that is seemingly rare among current novelists and that makes the reading quick and enjoyable i have two major reasons for not rating the book more highly 1 the characters are cartoon characters the predictable one dimensional aspect of the various key players is out of sync with the gravity of the book's topics and detracts almost fatally from the reader's interest in where they fit in and what fates they face the misunderstood american muslim the angry new york irish firefighter and his tough as nails ma the wealthy suburban widow the

her son the acerbic right wing radio talk show host the modern islamic woman who shuns the head scarf to make her way in america the only thing missing was a hooker with a heart of gold not that these characters don't exist in post 9 11 nyc but their invariance and predictability make them cardboard placeholders for real people spoiler follows sort of 2 the final chapter takes us 20 years past the tumultuous events of the immediate post 9 11 period in which the story plays out and tritely ties all the loose ends into a bow i was truly hoping that the author wouldn't stoop to tell us what happened in the end because the book's narrative stood on its own without any nice neat wrap up in fact to say what happened to each of the cardboard cutouts suggests that the plot is more important than the issues it carries with it which isn't true the issues around which waldman weaves the narrative are much more important than any one character's fate it's the literary representation of each character that holds the sole hope of making the book successful as literary fiction but by telling each character's story from the perspective of 20 years later we're wrenched out of the thought process that accompanies big questions and dropped into a prosaic and cliche narrative about whether the memorial got built what happened when that child grew up and worst of all a shocking revelation about the true identity of a minor character who turns up in the final pages but whose presence does nothing to enhance the work or improve on the author's points about the big questions before us in a post 9 11 world i better end this review before i take away another star from my rating more","260":"believable story that covers all sides of an interesting issue but becomes repetitive and features stereotypical caricatures for characters made me think which is good but also made me zone out after the book exhausted all of the debate points","261":"even though i have a few cds to go this is a wonderful exploration of 9 11 and how america is split over treatment and tolerance of muslims a committe is assigned 2 years after 9 11 to choose from thousands of anonymous submissions a design for the memorial and the one they choose creates a firestorm of turmoil","262":" a muslim american named mohammad mo khan wins a blind design contest for nyc's wtc memorial that premise alone tells amy waldman's debut novel is a work of fiction but the events that swirl around the submission proves to be an all too true examination of post 9 11 america i found the novel to be quite reminiscent of what has been my favorite best post 9 11 novel to date colum mccann's let the great world spin both novels operate under a similar structure a large and swirling cast of characters creating a multi perspective patchwork quilt of a story tonally they are quite different mccann's novel taking place in 1970s nyc was lyrical and poignant tale of grief and loss that slyly evoked 9 11 whereas waldman's work is a bold provocative and quite raw take of the lingering emotional aftermath of that day great companion pieces that i could easily see being paired up by literature classes there is so much gray area in this novel readers are continually challenged to re think what they think they really think got that allegiances and empathy for various characters are in constant flux for instance and especially as someone likely tagged as a liberal elitist i intellectually and emotionally would not have an issue with a muslim rightfully winning such a design competition but could also understand why it may not be the best idea for the country the architect or muslims in general while the novel is mo's architectural contest submission the theme of submitting being submissive to and by peer pressure politics political correctness the media is a theme that will have book clubs debating for hours also debate fueling i'd be curious what a more politically right leaning reader would have to this novel as i think it does play to left liberal slant waldman is a former co chief of the south asia bureau of the new york times overall i'd rate the submission a 4 5 stars i was close to rounding it up to 5 stars for goodreads but felt it lost some steam in parts and was a bit conflicted about the ending which felt a tad tacked on trying to tie things up in a neat bow in what had been so murky muck ily thought provoking throughout","263":" i started this book on the anniversary of 9 11 based on a rave review on npr by maureen corrigan to quote the submission distinguishes itself by its panoramic scope and also by the ease with which it pulls off the literary magic trick of being at once poetic and polemical uh no forget the poetic and the polemic is just confused this book read like it had a laundry list of issues it had to cover including class anti muslim fervor in the wake of the attacks immigration and ethnic identities they're all there but they don't add up to a coherent whole character development is so superficial that you get each of the characters within the first few pages of their introduction and they skate the surface of every conflict and connection revealing nothing new or surprising the dramatic climax is oddly flat and bloodless and the end is just weak big disappointment","264":" the submission is a highly thematic book certainly not one driven by plot or characters the plot is pretty straightforward a contest to design a memorial to the victims of 9 11 has a \"problematic\" winner a muslim architect controversy ensues additionally there is not one sympathetic character not one character drawn deeply or made complex we only superficially know a few of these characters and several are outright stereotypes no the plot and characters we are given are simply a backdrop to explore the multi layered themes presented by the author themes that are complicated are not black and white and have no easy answers some of the topics seem to invite the reader to choose a side such as the media's lack of scruples driven by sensationalism rather than truth or that selfishness drives all people or the role public perception plays in human interactions under pressure nobody really cares why you do things they only want to believe what they already believe other themes however require some introspection for example how far do we let the feelings or wishes of victims and families dictate what is right for us as a community or nation do we give in to hate the answer at first blush is of course \"no \" but are certain feelings or actions understandable in the face of tragedy does one extreme act cause an equal but opposite reaction even among \"enlightened\" people what is america's true position on freedom of religion does that include every religion or just the ones we \"like \" what if a national tragedy is perpetrated in the name of a religion does that change the perspective thorny issues indeed i really liked the way the author explores identity in all its facets a wife turned widow a ne'er do well with the opportunity for renewed purpose and esteem a non religious man suddenly connecting with his religion and heritage out of rebellion an oppressed widow finding her voice only to be silenced permanently these are the undercurrents of humanity a thinking person is not content to be one dimensional or unchanging but oftentimes it is the trials of life that force us to define and possibly reassess our identities are we living to please others or ourselves should one be true to themselves or do what's best for the community espousing a collectivist mentality on one hand american values espouse rugged individualism over subjugating self to the group on the other hand isn't it someone's right to live within a collectivist culture without infringement from those who don't adhere to that belief this book gave me a lot to carefully consider and i'm sure that was the author's intention i'm still undecided on several of the ideas brought forth in the book but that's okay life is a classroom and a thinking person is not content to remain unchanged for long this book is a good choice for a book group and should spark some lively discussion i enjoyed it 4 stars","265":"ironically i was reading this as the martin luther king jr memorial controversy was in the news again and the anniversary of 9 11 is a few weeks away this is a wonderfully complex and well written novel with a perfect mix of fiction and fact the author's characters are wonderfully written and there are a lot of stops along the way to give pause to in terms of reflection and self examination","266":"fantastic and poetic writing that dod a great job of giving a clean perspective of every party definitely raises a lot of thoughts about art the artist society and the united states and its perception of the rest of the world","267":"i read this book for a class and was surprised at how many things it made me feel i found myself deeply upset by the paranoia and islamaphobia presented the characters were flawed as people are my favorite character by far was asma i think that given different opportunities she could have done incredible things and it upsets me to be reminded that so many people even in the us are denied access to opportunities","268":"for someone who is a european this book felt very us american while i found the book interesting from what i read about it i was rather disappointed about it that may be due to my looking at it from a distance and lacking the connection part of that idea is found in the book where it says that the muslim countries don't follow the viewpoint the radicals had in that book but rather are baffled at the us american reactions to something that one of their own wants to build considering that the us melting pot is something everyone tells you that the us folk are pround of that would have gone down the drain that way maybe 2 5 stars instead of two but i can't give half stars","269":" an excellent book i am so impressed with the author's insight into being an american muslim she is clearly a great writer and smart reporter if readers want to learn about the american muslim experience this is a great book for it beyond that the story is woven well with engaging characters it covers all sides of the tragic 9 11 attacks through the device of a jury choosing a memorial i loved learning about the american muslim architect and also especially the nyc insider chair of the jury paul rubin one of those all powerful ny insider types reading about his humanity gave me insight into that type of person too i didn't give this book the 5th star because i wanted a different ending that's not a fair criticism but there were hardly any happy endings i wanted things to work out for two characters in particular and they didn't i also found the main protagonist claire the 9 11 widow to be quite cleverly written but she did annoy me at times which was probably the intent i highly recommend this book","270":"fantastic book very compelling and thought provoking","271":"wanted it to be a better story","272":"this book is about a submission to build a 9 11 memorial and how it results in conflict stirred up by the media and the consequences that result it is well written and poses much to think about as a result of the conflict and the issues that are raised as a result","273":" this book is an example of the books i am not burning to read that turns out to be better than the gotta read it now buzz books i had heard of this book several years ago and noted that it sounded vaguely interesting a few weeks ago i found it on sale and decided to try it i was impressed my first thought while reading the book is that this author knows her cultures as i neared the end of the book i chanced to read the biographical statement and realized that she is an accomplished journalist in south asia of course i live in a muslim community though at times her coverage of muslim community issues wife abuse blaming outsiders for problems etc is glossed over the presentation was fair and accurate albeit unnecessary to include some of these smaller issues as minor plot filler there is a clash of communities here but waldman has a pretty good grasp of the flavor of each community it is occasionally apparent that this is a debut novel there are flashes of brilliance and flashes of what the one scene where the secular muslim winner of the competition to design a 9 11 memorial decides to shave off his beard before the memorial committee hearing had me asking myself if this was indeed written by a first time author because the scene encompassed so much the physical description of his skin being laid bare and exposed and the symbolic resonance of him giving in to convention and losing himself however the ending employed all too convenient devices that screamed a major effort at pulling off an emotional ending the novel rather unraveled for me at the end on the other hand there are a lot of themes brought up in the novel identity fighting for your principles what is an american what is a muslim should a muslim have to explain himself","274":"i would not have chosen to read this book but it was given to me i loved it and feel slightly sad to have finished it it is beautifully written with a cleverr plot and it was a real eye opener of the views of both the american and muslim points of view all the characters were sympathetically created yet not without flaws","275":" 4 5 after 4 months of reading books that were average at best i was thrilled to find that amy waldman's the submission captured me immediately the structure characterizations and plot caused me to continually reconsider my previous assumptions and isn't that the point of great storytelling reading this in 2016 rather than when it was published caused me to compare the story set against today's climate of fear and media sensationalism needless to say it was thought provoking and somewhat frightening i was continually reminded of the reluctant fundamentalist that i read years ago i look forward to a very interesting book club discussion","276":"when an anonymous architect's design of a 9 11 memorial is announced by the selecting jury and the winner is identified as a muslim american his selection stirs up bitter controversy across a traumatized grieving nation defending mohammad khan's design a memorial garden is claire burwell a widow whose husband was killed in the world trade center and who represents the families on the jury however tensions run high and while some see the garden with its walls containing the names of the dead as a symbol of peace and tolerance others question why a muslim's design has been selected in this wonderfully provocative debut novel amy waldman gives us a glimpse of the firestorm that ensues in exposing intolerance prejudice and a story hounding press we see how out of control and paranoid the public becomes when stereotypical thinking prevails powerful novel","277":" three and a half stars the novel begins with a promising concept an arts jury selecting the design for a 9 11 like memorial discovers that the architect is a muslim american with the stage set waldman opens a window into the minds of several characters as they react to the news the concept is certainly timely closely mirroring the recent furor over building an islamic center near ground zero however waldman's characters fail to surprise or come to life a young journalist for the post is needy desperate heartless the governor is cold and calculating most characters are painted so broadly that its hard to invest in their journeys or the novel in general the one character that does surprise is mohammad khan the architect and lightning rod of the story khan is passionate ambitious and principled but at the same time he is grappling with those ambitions his identity and his faith his struggle not only makes him compelling it frames him as american above all else","278":"very intellectual and well written novel sure i will be thinking about it for awhile","279":"the aftermath of picking a winner for a wtc memorial in an anonymous competition the winner is an american muslim non practicing media frenzy pressure on jurors how opinions shift all too real","280":" five stars is not enough to express just how much i enjoyed the submission hard to imagine that this is any waldman's first novel thought provoking novel regarding the selection of a memorial for the twin towers the political process was both fascinating and sickening part of the draw of the book over and over what i was sure was going to happen did not and i love that also the conclusion was superb books don't often make me cry but i closed this one with an enormous lump in my throat and tears in my eyes absolutely superb","281":" i'm a little confused as to who this book is aimed for it paints a very divided america and i don't think people on one side will find new here and i don't think the other side will be convinced i see a lot of reviews criticizing the character depictions which is maybe a little unfair they're sketches not portraits but i found them fairly compelling sketches unfortunately towards the end the novel tries to throw some twists in which don't seem justified by what we know about the people this books presents to us and feels very contrived there are occasional nuggets of insight and some lovely turns of phrase but its a lot to get through for the small pieces i really valued","282":"a little slow but the last 100 pages were good i liked the story concept","283":"a wonderful novel of post 9 11 ny and all the conflicts for that all of us have about those events","284":"not having a good run of books this should have been better based on the premise that a muslim wins the competition for the 9 11 memorial it showed the controversy from 10 15 characters' perspectives but every character was portrayed as self serving set in their ways and convinced their way was the right way the ending was creative and satisfying but tough to get through the book","285":" true story last summer artists in a small downtown neighborhood decided to turn a wall in one of the city's oldest parks into the canvas for a community mural the idea was that neighborhood children would paint images and then a collection of established artists would fill in the gaps and unify the piece the artists got permission from the city and a couple dozen children dropped in to paint suns and turtles and squiggles this rankled some of the neighbors who didn't know of the project in advance suddenly the view from the kitchen window included a hodge podge of children's art a few went to the city and complained about the artistic merit of the wall and the project was stalled while officials figured out what to do there were a range of opinions on this like the idea hate the art hate the idea hate the art love the idea and the art and then there was the \"this would never happen in a non inner city neighborhood \" the project was given to a public arts commission to manage the group that oversees statues and murals and selects winning entries for other public art projects now had to make the final call on a community mural by dozens of children and seven ish local artists this entire process the paperwork the public meetings the debates lasted the entire summer and sometimes bordered on satire in the end the artists were allowed to go ahead with the mural although much of the work by the children was painted over the point is want a bloodletting of diverse opinions just mention public art this is nothing compared to the heap of a mess amy waldman makes in \"the submission \" a novel that takes the concept of public art to an especially divisive place a memorial for victims of 9 11 in the wake of the attack a jury is assembled to blindly select a suitable memorial to be placed at the site where the world trade center buildings stood the submissions are anonymous and the group which includes both the art savvy and a world trade center widow selects an enclosed garden all systems are a go until the name of the winning designer is revealed muhommed khan khan is an american born non practicing muslim and an architect though the jury holds off on revealing the winner his name is leaked to a skeevy tabloid journalist who not only runs with the story but also continues to repeatedly douse the story in lighter fluid the country though mostly just new york city is torn between people who think selecting a muslim is a symbol of peace and those who think it is a sign of weakness waldman considers the perspectives of the widow on the jury who is first on khan's side this alienates her from the family members she represents who find a new voice in a racist hot head whose fireman brother died the governor is against the garden a widow who is in the country illegally and lost her husband in the attacks is for the garden a shock jock radio host spews vitriol on the radio the journalist pens columns with lines like \"the problem with islam is islam\" and a group of muslims arranges press conferences in support of khan this sets off a nasty chain of events angry citizens have taken to yanking the headscarves off muslim women and vandalizing mosques in the wake of charges that khan has shaped the garden as an islamic paradise he remains less willing to talk about his design and its inspirations this book is super well considered waldman's round of the what ifskies has a good mix of characters and points of view and sets off a believable chain reaction","286":"very interesting book beautifully woven together it's all about a submission for a memorial for 9 11 victims which somehow goes awry because of the muslim background of the designer that's not revealing anything because it's a given from the start we receive the perspective of the designer members of the jury family members of 9 11 victims the governor the chairman of the committee set up to select the appropriate memorial the official muslim group in nyc etc tempers are high in this emotionally charged novel waldman does a wonderful job","287":"ugh i was hoping for so much more from this book pretty disappointing","288":" i am going to try to do this book justice although my ability to write a compelling book review is sadly lacking especially considering my current profession it is very rare for me to have such visceral reactions while reading books this book led to moments of deep anger complete sadness and some despair occasionally so deep that i felt the emotions in the pit of my stomach waldman's writing is wonderful and the storyline is compelling and very realistic at first the title seems straightforward it refers to the plan submitted to the jury for what is assumed to be a 9 11 memorial a plan that after a blind process wins the contest and then is found to be designed by a muslim however it is much more clever than that it also refers to people's submission to fear to anger to self righteousness to group dynamics to appearances to pride in other words a much more psychological and less concrete submission i thought waldman's handling of the subject was even handed regardless of which side of the debate you would fall on she did well in creating an environment where both sides although not necessarily all people on each side evoke empathy this is one of the best books i've read this year and also one of the most though provoking in terms of what has become known as the 9 11 novel this one is as the ny times said a great memorial","289":"wow this was a wonderful book not only did the story engross and move me but the writing is exquisite i love the way waldman beautifully captures a moment with just a few adjectives","290":"the book's correct title is the submission how is this rectified on goodreads","291":"this book reminded me of jk rowling's a casual vacancy in that it made me think outside of my comfort zone but i didn't actually like any of the characters fascinating read i recommend it if you'd like to push yourself to think about new ideas","292":"emotions are high when families rescuers artists critics muslims and community groups debate an appropriate memorial to 9 11 victims like any grief pain dulls life goes on we evolve highly recommended","293":" the premise of this book is that in a contest for a design of the memorial to be built on the sire of the twin towers two years after 911 a muslim architect wins the competition the novel is set 2 years after the carnage but was published in 2011 so the feelings had longer to incubate with the author i don't believe the novel got much acclaim but i thought the author's style was very easy to read and the characters expressed a good range of reactions there were family members muslims politicians radical haters and supporters and interestingly an undocumented bangladeshi whose spouse was killed in the attack the novel winds it's way through their personal feelings and actions as well as their interactions with each other the story made me reflect on some of my personal opinions i liked the way that waldman ended it there are no happy endings where bigotry distrust and hate complicated by religion exists good read","294":" it's 2003 and the 9 11 memorial committee discovers that the designer of their winning choice is a muslim american suddenly all of new york is taking sides about whether this particular memorial should be built or not the author focuses in on some key players mohammed khan the architect who designed the submission clare who represents the families who lost loved ones in the twin towers attack and alyssa stern the cut throat journalist who stirs the pot other characters come and go but these three are at the apexes of the triangle this was an interesting look at post 9 11 america the hysteria and fear and persecution around muslims at the time and how selfish interests often get in the way of the greater good","295":"with the 10 year anniversary of 9 11 i wanted to read something related to that topic every summer magazine i picked up mentioned this book i found it a very interesting read it made me rethink my own feelings on our country's religious cultural ideological diversity the novel is well written and can't help but make the reader do a little personal soul searching","296":"i feel totally unsettled but i think that was the author's intent i'm still not sure how i feel about the ending but it was definitely a book that made me think maybe a little too much some of the chapters were so intense and horrifying that i actually had to take a break before returning","297":"it is 2 years after the attacks on the world trade center and a jury selected by the governor of new york is tasked with deciding on the design of the memorial to be built there the jury is made up of various representatives from the art world a wealthy retired banker who is chair person of the jury and a widow of one of the victims after months sorting through thousands of anonymous designs the jury has narrowed it down to just 2 entries after making a passionate plea to the jury of behalf of the victims claire convinces the jury to select a design known as the garden when paul the chairman opens the envelope and reads the name mohammed khan all hell breaks loose not only are certain jurors outraged at their own pick but numerous factions in america are as well waldman does and interesting job presenting so many sides of the story mo as khan prefers to be called doesn't want to be labeled as muslim but finds himself drifting that way as america becomes more divided over his selection claire the wealthy liberal widow calls into question her values as she is confronted with anger from the families she represents on the jury we also get the story of the conservative right led by sean whose brother was killed in the attack and feels he should have been on the jury and by debbie who believes that all muslims are evil the thing about this book is that it is so real you find yourself thinking no that wouldn't happen in america when she presents a more extreme reaction and then you question that having seen the reaction in the news to the recent bombing in boston her extremes presented in the book are not that far fetched sadly the only reason i didn't give this book 5 stars is because the author tends to ramble on at times in her descriptions of things she uses 5 different flowery words to describe something that could be said in one word other than that i highly recommend this book","298":"i was intrigued by this book's premise of tolerance but it seemed in trying to send the message of defeating stereotypes it only served to reinforce the stereotypes in its main characters by the end i could not have cared less about what happened to his memorial or to anyone involved unfortunately after starting out so promisingly","299":"a couple of years after 9 11 a competition is held for the design of a memorial to the victims all entries are anonymous the winner turns our to be an american architect who happens to be muslim passions are inflamed the media circus ramps up politicians and others try to use the controversy amid all of this is the real grief of the families and the deep search for comfort and understanding at the end the love of a son for his father survives all memorable well written","300":"wow this is an extremely powerful book one that calls up raw emotions and challenges beliefs it demonstrates how fear anger and ignorance can cause the pendulum to swing dramatically it's not an easy book to read you can get very emotional reading it don't recommend reading it right before bed because it's hard to turn off the feelings the book generates and you may find yourself tossing an turning i found myself shifting from one position to the other knowing in my heart what would be the right thing to do but aware of the consequences of doing the right thing the characters are complex and fascinating it brought back a lot of painful memories as i lived in d c during 9 11 and watched the smoke billowing out of the pentagon at times i wanted to reach into the book and take the shoulders of one of the characters and just shake him her waldman shows the outcomes of rigidity in thought and behavior excellent book","301":"i thought this was an excellent political social thriller one of my favorite books of the year a great read for book clubs","302":"this was an incredibly perceptive profound book about humanity the premise is provocative a blind competition is held to create a 9 11 memorial the jury makes its selection and the winner is muslim the ensuing controversy is examined from all angles and i had empathy for all of them a truly thought provoking book that was a pleasure to read","303":"i thought the author did a good job of raising the issues successfully but i'm not sure if she couldn't have been more nuanced about the different national origins of muslim americans and accomplished the same task i also wasn't sure what to make of the ending","304":"i was looking forward to reading this and was disappointed actually skipped the last 100 pages and read the very end which was good","305":"despite the glowing reviews i probably wouldn't have chosen to read amy waldman's the submission if it were not my book group's may selection i feel as if i've read and watched enough stories exploring the trauma of the 9 11 attacks that all possible emotional and psychological territory has been covered ms waldman hasn't found a new planet in the 9 11 universe but her fictional story of the chaos following the selection of a memorial design to honor the victims is a thoughtful portrayal of the complex relations muslim americans faced during the years following the attacks the novel opens with a jury of 13 choosing between two final designs for a memorial to be built on the site of the destroyed towers a rule of the competition is that the designers remain anonymous until the winner is announced the jury chooses the garden and the chairman opens the envelope to read the name of the winning designer mohammed khan so begins a saga that will upend the lives of the enigmatic mr khan some members of the jury families of the victims and assorted other characters the story is told primarily from the perspectives of the ambitious architect mo khan and the wealthy claire burwell a 9 11 widow who has championed his design on the jury these two seem to have more in common with each other than with anyone else in their lives and the reader has the feeling that if they could just sit down for dinner together they would form an impregnable alliance but a conversation doesn't happen until too late after events have forced both into entrenched positions if the novel asks a central question it is probably how can we learn to trust each other that's a crucial debate for any society","306":" in this ripped from the headlines novel ex ny times reporter amy waldman takes on an ambitious theme - the self interest of everyone who enters the controversy over a muslim architect winning a competition for a 9 11 memorial call it an exploration of the impossibility of objectivity but her strong narrative idea is undermined by her weak execution as a novelist waldman simply lacks chops as a writer of fiction she doesn't take the time to create convincing characters from inside also there are problems in point of view she's made a decision to use the third person indirect style to tell the story at different points from the perspectives of maybe a dozen different characters and they all think and sound pretty much alike this is a journalist's novel then - very credible on the level of plot and the playing out of a public controversy - but weak in terms of credible characters that the reader cares about other weaknesses too many names of characters are too on the money - e g \"lou sarge\" as a limbaugh like radio talk charlatan and \"ariana montagu\" as a fierce art world guru on the selection panel and waldman's reliance on a reporter's shorthand descriptive technique results in many passages of weak prose along lines of \"the wind roughed facets into the dark river its foreboding look coloring claire's thoughts \" or \"reporters scattered throughout the crowd refuse on a deltaic river \" \"deltaic\" come on","307":"absolutely amazing one of the best novels i've read lately i can't get over how great it was","308":"the idea of this book is interesting but it was tough to get through i like books that make you think but an entire book of what would you do type of scenarios was too much for me the characters didn't stick with you so there was never a real connection to the book it wasn't a long book but could have been even shorter","309":" this novel set two years after the 9 11 attack centers around the selection of memorial for the victims picked in a blind contest that turns out to have been designed by an american muslim this fictional tale reflects many of the words and actions surrounding the ground zero mosque from several years ago and the various characters make interesting stand ins for several different points of view and personality types what i enjoyed most about this novel the way this story brought up questions and made you think who are the victims and do some count for more than others what does it mean to be a muslim what factors do we rely on when creating public art and memorials","310":"for such a provocative plot a memorial contest for 9 11 is won by a muslim this book was unsatisfying i didn't care for any of the characters and the first half was especially plodding","311":"book review selection sumaar dragged quite a bit in the middle and then all of a sudden jumped to many years later in the last few chapters good premise but not a great book","312":"controversy surrounds the choice of a muslim to design the 9 11 memorial","313":"i would give this 3 5 stars a good book for a book group due to the subject matter with ample morale ethical pc area to discuss that said i thought the characters were flat and not well developed","314":" this is a fictional story about the selection of a 9 11 memorial the jury of prominent new yorkers had enough difficulty choosing the design but that was nothing compared to fire storm that erupted when the chosen designer turned out to be named mohammad khan the book delves into the lives of the members of the jury particularly a 9 11 widow the brother of a victim who practically makes a career of opposing the memorial the designer and the widow of an illegal immigrant very compelling but i did find it a little tedious at times","315":" this is one of the best books i've read in awhile the premise is that there's an anonymous design contest for the 9 11 memorial in 2003 and a muslim man wins the story follows the sole 9 11 widow claire burwell the architect contest winner mohammed khan and there's also an undocumented bangladeshi 9 11 widow named asma as a non religious american muslim born in the us and raised in virginia just like the khan character i feel that waldman captured well the ambivalence and confusion of suddenly being forced to confront representing a religion that doesn't feel like your own","316":"a brilliantly realized fictionalized treatment of 9 11 told through the story of a submission to a contest to design the 9 11 memorial that's won by a muslim the book to read if you want to remember gain perspective and appreciate the sadness messiness and overall challenges of the few years after the tragic events","317":" beautifully written with excellent character development everyone was so real the dilemma was thought provoking with no easy answers the title fits not just the actual submission of work for the memorial but individual's and the public's submission to the press our elected officials their cronies and those other influencers around us it also reflects very clearly mo's experience that is recounted towards the end of the story this experience also answers some questions about the submission design that the story revolves around this would be a good book club read recommend","318":"certainly an interesting premise and much of the book can be highly praised my only problem was the character development of many appearing in the book they seemed either one dimensional or completely without heart the final chapter was a disappointment","319":"i picked this book because it was part of the one book one lincoln candidates expected more from it not something that really stays with you but a good book","320":"this started out fascinating and finished fascinating and in the middle it got a little bit slow but overall a great read","321":"this is one of the best novels i have read all year ironically i traveled across the country and back on a plane and didn't crack it once i returned i read it with pleasure it would have made a terrific airplane book in that it was well paced and once you begin reading it was hard to put down ms waldman is a talented writer and her sensitivity in presenting this difficult story about race in america in the shadow of 9 11 is brilliantly presented the story revolves around a jury competition for the design of a 9 11 memorial and what happens as the committee concludes their work and the story is leaked before they had hoped it is the behind the scene story that fiction can tell so well to tell more would certainly give too much away so suffice it to say this is a terrific read and would make a terrific book club book","322":"once again i seem to be saying this a lot these days a book i would probably never have chosen to read but we have book discussion monday may 14th so i read it and really enjoyed it i loved the premise and the incredible debate that resulted i think i ended up feeling sad for just about everyone in the story for one reason or another impressive","323":"similar to the mosque controversy sort of falls apart at the end","324":"interesting idea for a book kind of boring at times yet thought provoking glad i read it though","325":"really excellent book i was afraid this might be a book condemning america as racist against muslims instead each and every angle was explored through characters who were deep and complex this was an amazing feat by the author","326":" i really enjoyed this even though i think it has some obvious limitations and especially since it's part of a whole sub genre of literature these days where ensemble casts interact somewhat soap operatically around a social issue of the day which lately seems to be 9 11 but in spite of that i really liked it part of my appreciation might be the timing that i'm reading this book as its still in the news cycle and not well after it like i usually do but there are other factors too and i do think some of the characters are fresher and more challenging than they are in books striving for such mass appeal i'd start with the character of mohammad khan who i think is a real character instead of a mouthpiece or a signifier i liked his ambition and his arrogance the very everydayness of his concerns i think there's a bit of a cheat in the ending but in good ways he reminded me of lenny from super sad true love story as someone who honored and transcended his cultural matrix the character of sean came close and i also really liked asma for similar reasons i didn't like claire as much and her hot momness felt more forced on me than genuine like there was a demographic reach in her character and her internal struggle never really made sense to me but such is life this is a really interesting arguably layered exploration of some difficult material and i think people should read it but do it now in six months it might not have the same impact at all","327":"great read read it right around 9 11 so it was especially appropriate","328":"wonderfully written look at america in the years since 9 11 encompassed in a fictional account of the design of the 9 11 memorial","329":"very readable and enjoyable book not great literature but worth reading","330":"a blind competition is held to select the design of a 9 11 memorial and when the winning entry is discovered to have been designed by an american muslim a political and emotional firestorm ensues this is an amazing story of the politicalization of grief and sensationalism masquerading as journalism as well as the personal agendas of all those caught in between a very well done story","331":"so many things to consider in this book i found myself taking sides with almost all of the characters i think there's a lot more to the book than i was able to grasp by myself a great book for a book group","332":"2 5 starsi think i may have made a tactical blunder in reading mark helprin's dazzling strange and surreal homage to new york city winter's tale immediately before tackling the submission i thought that aligning those two books back to back would provide each of them an interesting counterpoint alas amy waldman's post 9 11 tale is a moribund contrived hand wringing glop fest that never really lives up to its critical acclaim the idea sounded great a jury comprised primarily of cognoscenti of the artistic world and other influential people are tasked to cull through thousands of anonymous submissions for designing a 9 11 memorial near ground zero the panel was able to come to near consensus decision on one of the finalists only to find out that the winner was of muslim descent which causes predictably a firestorm of protest from the conservative right that's about it as far as the story goes however the p o v shifts from one of the jury members a wealthy left leaning woman who was the only one on the jury to lose a loved one in 9 11 to the memorial design winner mohammed mo khan a secular non practicing muslim architect born and raised in the united states the first two thirds of the book are really pretty dull with the focus on the jury's process and subsequent outcry npr critic maureen corrigan who named the submission in her top ten novels of 2011 and whose opinion i often concur with mentioned specifically ms waldman's facility with the english language her poetics and polemics her startling use of verbs and metaphors i could not disagree more with this assessment i had trouble finding anything poignant or poetic in her leaden unfocused prose especially during the selection phase when the jurors were at loggerheads trying to curry favor with the governor of ny the mayor of nyc and the subsection of the populace whose xenophobia was fueled by the cartoonish rhetoric by pundits at fox news and a rush limbaugh esque radio buffoon this overly long chunk of the book could've and perhaps should've benefitted from effective verbiage but ms waldman's barrage throughout this section was about as scattershot ineffectual and annoying as dodging bird droppings from above couple that with the 1d cardboard cutout protagonists' mewling or in the case of the memorial designer seeming outward indifference to the outcry and you're left with a novel that uses arguably the single largest significant event in modern american times as its backdrop that can't rise above the status of shrill drama only the books' denouement i e the last 30 pages or so is its saving grace that part did indeed evince the colorful poetic prose the critic ms corrigan alluded to by the time i got there though ms waldman all but lost me","333":"tight writing and a well thought out complex scenario with clear cut characters decisions in the face of a dilemma not a quick clip story but gives you much to think about good for book groups makes sense that it's the 2012 seattle one reads selection","334":"this book was really well written and had great character development a very interesting topic made me want to learn more about the designer of the 9 11 ground zero memorial important issues were covered in a readable way","335":"this book really surprised me i picked it up because i had seen so many positive reviews of it on book lists but when i first started reading it felt forced and artificial to me i wasn't sure if i was going to finish it i'm glad i did the further i got in the book the more deeply entwined i became the characters went from being 2 d snapshots to fully dimensional and complex humans the title the submission wove its way through with all its varied meanings and pushed me to constantly question myself my assumptions and my perceptions about people about art about architecture about public opinion and what shapes it about how we present ourselves and what dictates how much of ourselves we reveal and for what purpose lots of great food for thought i think this book is highly relevant given the times and reminds us that how we use our imagination not just having it but really how we use it can tell us a lot about ourselves","336":"a thoughtful look at a hard time in our country's history the time is just a few years after the 9 11 events a memorial is planned to be built on the twin towers land the government appointed committee has come to its decision a beautiful walled garden filled with trees water benches and the names of those killed in the attack all is well until the architect's identity is revealed mohammed khan the american born son of muslim immigrants this book poses many hard questions without always having the answers to those questions many points of views are given from muslim americans to the victims' families to politicians the press to just plain rabble rousers while it has its flaws it will certainly make you think about our american way of life","337":"a book with no heros except for asma the bengali woman whose husband died in the terrorist atttack a juri set up to select the memorial to remember those who died in the terrorist attack chooses a beautiful and peaceful garden to everyone's shock the author of this submission turns out to be mohamed a muslim the havoc that follows was almost to be expected the book is almost too predictable","338":"i know a lot of readers and critics love this book however i found it frustrating after a very strong start the book floundered in aimless dialog superficial characters and awkward writing nothing is resolved and the ending is too pat i don't feel that waldman was able to reach into and explore the feelings and the motivations of the various individuals groups involved it could have been so much more","339":"it was a well written book just incredibly frustrating i could've done without this what if and its implications also it was way too dragged out","340":" this book is a fine read although i was expecting something spectacular from all the press it starts out strong but i found the entirety fairly monotonous the premise is one that seems totally familiar a blind jury selects an muslim american as the winner of a 9 11 memorial contest and chaos ensues the expected players are here the obdurate architect in question the stoically liberal minded and affluent widow whose husband died in the towers the mayor's savvy political adviser the moronically ambitious governor the unscrupulous journalist the list could go on and on as the shifting narrative focuses on the different cast of characters throughout there's even a stand in for horrid ann coulter who takes in a grieving brother who inadvertently sets of a tidal wave of violent headscarf pulling across the nation initially this all plays as expected it's a pathetic portrait of our own realities in america the emotionally charged assumptions and the commercialization of division the setting is in some sort of alternate universe two years post 9 11 where rudy giuliani isn't the mayor george pataki isn't the governor and the president only referred to once as the man who had once owned a baseball team 207 plays a minimal role in the rhetoric with this touch of speculative fantasy i began to wonder about the validity of the dream especially since it did not in fact play out this way in history and also because waldman's story so closely resembles the actual events surrounding maya lin's selection as the architect for the vietnam memorial in dc an event also mentioned just once when one characters questions whether maya lin wanted that statue of the soldiers near her memorial 138 the final chapter however does provide some narrative brilliance that can only be achieved by a novel at least until the revelation of a character's identity turns maudlin it probably sounds like i mind all these issues much more than i did while reading the book it was certainly a quick read for me and it raises some excellent points about the disunity that still exists in our still healing nation these just aren't necessarily points that i think are anything new more than ten years after the fact","341":"i'm not too sure what to write about this it's an interesting book and i think i enjoyed reading it but having said that it took me almost a fortnight to read that's a long time for me two of the words on front of this book from reviews i presume are exhilerating and exciting and to me this book was neither i wasn't gripped with the just one more page feeling in fact i could easily put this book down for 24 hrs at a time which is pretty unusual for me i think that the submission deals with a difficult topic and it is well handled it's not that the editing isn't tight enough but there was is just something about this book that made it easy for me to not read it rather than being mainly interested in the main characters i found myself much more interested in the side character of asma and i'm sorry that there wasn't more of her in fact as i write this i think that she was the only character that i actually cared about i'm not sure that i cared what happened to anybody else in the story having this i still think that this is a 4 star book it's well written it's dealing with an out of the ordinary storyline and it's well handled on the downside it's not a page turner and i'm not talking just easy read thrillers i couldn't put wolf hall down when i was reading that and i just didn't care about any of the characters in any way","342":"it's not a spoiler to tell the premise of this book an american muslim enters a design contest for a world trade center 9 11 memorial and wins of all the premises of 9 11 literature mostly about people losing loved ones this stands out as unusual and compelling the story line is believable the characters are well rounded and nicely drawn the pace of the book is noteworthy it starts slowly and picks up becomes more frenetic in fact as the plot develops the ending is the only ending really possible and it's not a surprise except in the way the author renders it i liked this book very much and find myself thinking about it","343":"i definitely think this a book that should be read it raises a number of good points about discrimination in america and presents a rather unflattering picture of our culture makes you think however i do think it has some weak points in the writing and i hated the ending although most of my book group loved it i really didn't care about some of the characters there were so many that at times i lost the focus","344":"not something i would normally read but it gave me a lot of valuable perspective for my full review http sunlitpages blogspot com 2013","345":"there were so many things to love about this book the history of post 9 11 sentiment the complicated feelings of prejudice and the amazing development of characters possessing so many different emotions i am so glad i read this wonderful book","346":" the submission opens with the deliberations of a judging panel made up mainly of luminaries of the art world as they decide which design should be selected as the memorial to be built on the site of the twin towers the entries have all been submitted anonymously and the panel have no idea who the architects are but one member claire who is there to represent the bereaved families finally convinces the others to choose a memorial garden when the panel learn that the architect they have chosen is a muslim they fear a media backlash they consider hushing up the result and choosing an alternative but it's too late word leaks out and all hell breaks loose the bereaved families feel betrayed the right wing extremists cause uproar and the liberals rush to the defence of the architect the man at the centre of this media circus mohammed khan or mo as he prefers to be called is a secular muslim born and bred in america and is dismayed to find himself in the eye of the storm the story focuses on a few key characters claire mo paul the president of the panel sean a right winger whose brother was killed in the world trade centre and asma an illegal immigrant who lost her husband in the disaster the accusations towards mo pile up becoming ever more ridiculous and the reader's moral compass gets some serious exercise though of course mo has every right to see his design built when the focus switches from the people who were killed and the garden becomes all about the architect and the controversy is it right that it should still go ahead i found myself swinging from one view to another though the eventual resolution that the author comes up with is excellent and i thought the ending was the best part of the novel i'm sorry to say i wasn't hugely fond of this book the premise was great and an interesting idea but i just didn't think it was enough to sustain a full length novel it would have made a cracking short story though perhaps in a kind of twelve angry men style the tale is told quite dispassionately and i found it a trifle cold so i wasn't at all surprised when i saw at the back of the book that the author's main trade is as a journalist where the currency is hard facts rather than emotion mo in particular is not a very likeable character he absolutely refuses to compromise or explain himself or his ideas to try and put people's minds at rest about him while of course that's his prerogative and he shouldn't be obliged to defend himself he does come across as inflexible and proud claire is better but again i just didn't feel any warmth from her the only character i could really get behind was asma and the climax of her story was the one part of the novel that i connected with emotionally i have seen a lot of fantastic reviews of this book so i'm obviously in the minority i can't deny the the novel is well written well plotted and an interesting moral excercise however i want a book that makes me feel something i want to see through the eyes of the characters and think their thoughts along with them and that just didn't happen for me here i'll give it three stars for the quality of the writing but i'm afraid this one wasn't really my cup of tea","347":"characters are caricatures of every aspect of 9 11 plot is predictable and full of stereotypes","348":"the 911 memorial is at the heart of this story with a controversial designer winning the competition for its design a symbolic garden life death growth decay upkeep world definition all intertwine with characters causing love conflict and prejudice making for an interesting sometimes disturbing read","349":" not only a wonderful book but a book lauded with some outstanding reviews five of which i list here i won't be doing a review as such it has all been said and so much better than i can say it jeanette netterooski http www goodreads com review show teresa lukeyhttp www goodreads com review show michael leccesehttp www goodreads com review show ed zhttp www

originally came from bangladeshi she lives in brooklyn in a part known as 'little dhaka' geraldine bitman - ny governor pulls strings behind the scenes alyssa spier - gutter journalist doing guttery things throughout the novel i liked waldman's writing herewith some snips 'they wandered up third avenue the empire state building a lantern held aloft to light their way ''she entered and warmed the room like a small sun and in her absence both he and the furniture seemed to be waiting to be brought to life ''mrs mahmoud slurped her tea and belched politely she had twenty years forty pounds and several hundred gray hairs on asma her talk was a solid object that filled the room confining asma to a tiny space ''like a junkie's her addiction had progressed from reading the news to reporting it to breaking it then - the crack cocaine of her business - to shaping it what i liked most about the book the complexity of it - of the situation the plot the characters it was fantastically real i also felt i learnt about a lot more about cheap journalism new words waldman used that i couldn't find in my old chambers dictionary or at least not in the context she used them ursine manorexic contrarian bloviate dhimmitude retread","350":" this is a hard book to discuss without giving away some of the painful disharmony that makes the submission such a well written book how do you feel about a mosque being built near the site of the former world trade center so then take that feeling and apply it to the crux of the submission a blind design contest is held for a memorial to september 11 and it's won by a muslim obviously a firestorm ensues giving rich and fertile fodder for any writer amy waldman chooses her battles carefully and leads us through the twisted connections that lie within but i never felt lost i really couldn't wait to find out what was going to happen the submission made me fairly uncomfortable i am kind of intolerant to intolerance and some of the characters really pissed me off is it possible to read this book and not be upset hopefully i'll never know i was going to give it 4 stars because of how mad i got reading the submission but i went to five because it made me mad good book","351":"an interesting premise suffers from a plodding narrative that gets bogged down in a surfeit of characters the book does a fine job of conveying the tension of the near post 9 11 era in the u s but the story doesn't really go anywhere also some characters experience major swings in viewpoint that i just didn't buy overall i was left feeling that the concept over promised and under delivered","352":"didn't love this as much as i wanted to i didn't really care about any of them i think i will read it again to give it another go","353":"the submission made my ten best books for 2011 it is an extremely thought provoking read that i would recommend to anyone especially those who may be scared or ignorant of the muslim religion this story takes place in 2003 nyc they city has assembled a group of judges who accept and wade through submissions for a memorial at the site of the twin towers the group decides they do not want to know who the designer is until they have made a final decision as to which design they want to use after the judges make there decision the name of the architect is unveiled unleashing a torrent of emotion the winner is mohammad khan and american born non practicing muslim then ensues the debate not just among st the judges but among st the public after the information is leaked what follows is the authors methodical and thorough display what arises we see the turmoil between the jurors and the riot of emotion from the public especially people who lost a family member on 9 11 the author does an excellent job of showing you both sides of the picture from mohammad khan's exasperation about the controversy to the public outcry of the muslim's building their paradise at ground zero in celebration of their achievement we also get a glimpse in to the media and how they spin it the novels conclusion is several years in to the future and is sure to give you goosebumps i know i have not done the book justice with this review and i'm not sure i have what it takes to get across the immense importance of this piece of literature but i will say this is a book i could see reading a second time not only is it that good but there is much to be learned from ms waldman's presentation of this story","354":"i liked the idea of this book and i liked the story but i have to agree with my friend jessamyn that the characters were not well drawn enough they sort of seemed like cardboard representations in some respects which is too bad because this could have been a really lovely and moving book i have yet to read a 9 11 book that really does that","355":"i loved this book an interesting look at american values being put to the test on a variety of fronts we say many things but when challenged some waiver even though it is fiction so much felt real in today's world","356":"a story that challenges the way we think about events that can be very real and which we keep on living right now to an extent it is about how the perception of many citizens changed after 9 11 on muslims and how a rift between us and them has been created the author challenges the reader by giving different nuances of how different people perceive the same fact a very realistic story which is easy to read and keeps a good pace without divulging too much i found the fate of the bangladeshi woman to be lost and couldn't understand why it ended the way it did similarly the ending or rather the epilogue gave me as a reader a weird feeling i am not sure if i would have given the story that ending having said that it is a very good read","357":"i found myself looking forward to time with this book the author examines so many different aspects of this fictitious set of circumstances it felt real to me and i found myself wondering how the actaul 9 11 memorial was decided upon more importantly the humanity she brings to the surface of every character was beautiful i would and have already recommend this highly","358":"amazing i mean made me want to tear my hair out and throw the book across the room several times i don't really know what to say about it waldman goes around and around looking at all sides read it seriously i can't recommend it enough one of my favorite lines emotions are not legal rights","359":"engrossing very realistic picture of group dynamics in the face of hot button issues sad commentary on the role of media and i thought the characters were interesting","360":" while visiting new york city recently i visited the 9 11 memorial i was moved by its simplicity and symbolism i thought that whoever had created it had done a magnificent job of memorializing those who had died and stirring the passions of those of us who remember the day so well but not once did i think of the process of selecting a design author amy waldman however did - and created a terrific story about what might have taken place during the decision making process the novel set in 2003 begins with a meeting of those tasked with deciding the memorial's design on the committee are politicians artists and a family member of one who lost his life in the tragedy from hundreds of submissions the choice has been narrowed to two finally after much debate and strongly expressed feelings by the wife of the victim a decision is made when the designer is revealed controversy ensues all of this happens in the first forty or so pages from this point waldman whipsaws the reader back and forth between deeply held feelings and biased opinions - some of which the reader may agree with and others not so much it is the strength of this book though that the author can allow you to see the validity of the arguments on both sides - to sympathize with nearly all of the characters to a greater or lesser degree she encourages the reader to evaluate his her own feelings and to do an examination of conscience about those feelings this is a thoughtful novel and one that will stir your thoughts as well highly recommended grade a","361":"i feel this book may actually deserve more than 3 stars 3 1 2 i'd say while i thought much of it was a bit obvious and not that insightful hey wow americans are a bunch of racist idiots i thought the end was quite well done having the characters look back on the memorial process from a distance of many years i thought that was actually interesting and emotional","362":"i wanted to like this more than i did it has a fascinating premise and the writer seems very strong but oh my god each of the three main characters is so confused and they are each such depressing over thinkers i couldn't figure out why the plot didn't move along faster i truly didn't see why the author thought it was a good idea to dwell on each characters' confusion over thinking and subsequent depression","363":"thought provoking look into human nature and character","364":"this is an entertaining well written ripped from the headlines novel it connects a collection of people all of whom are more or less centrally involved in the development of a 9 11 memorial at ground zero in new york all hell breaks loose when the jury picks in a blind process the plan of an american muslim","365":"thought provoking interesting and unique book it is a work of fiction but it spoke eloquently of the 9 11 tragedy and its aftermath","366":" a jury of artists historians architects and a family member of a victim judge the anonymous submissions of designs for a 9 11 memorial at the site of the wtc they unknowingly select the design submitted by a muslim american and all hell breaks loose this book had a very new york y rhythm and vibe that hooked me immediately i guess it's like riding a bike like bonfire of the vanities and the wannabe visits from the goon squad a large and disparate group of people react and interact around the main plot point and like any large and disparate group of people some characters were admirable others sleazy others thoroughly unlikable others break your heart courageous etc waldman's writing style was deceptively simple she straightforwardly tells her story and sits back and lets the reader take the emotional and intellectual journey on their own that was the perfect choice for this challenging and thought provoking tale it felt good to search my soul and engage my brain i began and ended the book with the same set of opinions on this controversial topic but i still needed to exercise my muscles a bit to defend my views","367":"9 11 book that deals with islamaphobia in such a heavy handed manner that i felt lectured the whole time","368":"great plot line but this story just dragged on","369":" a conflict laden premise that a muslim american wins the blind competition for a 9 11 memorial drives this novel forward like a mystery novel the characters are well drawn and their actions are believable from the egotistical governor to the bigoted talk show host to the brave bangladeshi illegal immigrant each character finds his or her idealistic views of american freedoms tested waldman writes beautifully and manages to write convincingly the points of view of architects and artists if i have a criticism it is mostly that all the characters are equally remote there is no protagonist i found it an extremely compelling book","370":" this book challenges the reader's assumptions about america and about prejudice in a blind competition to design a memorial for the world trade center victims the winning entry turns out to be designed by mohammed kahn an architect from india the fury and controversy over the selection of a muslim architect overwhelms the jury particular claire burwell the representative of the families prejudice misunderstandings and the refusal of the architect to contextualize his design create a challenging read","371":"this review has been hidden because it contains spoilers to view it click here wow one of the most compelling books i've read in a while had me curious until the end read the last few pages through tears","372":" amy waldman's drama of manners novel the submission takes a promising premise in 2003 new york city an anonymous competition to design the 9 11 memorial is won by a muslim architect hysteria and hand wringing ensue and delivers a tight smart well paced emotionally honest portrait of a time and a place and the people therein and she pulls off the multi perspective trick too there are probably six major characters and waldman jumps around into each of their heads and the story is pretty epic and the book is short and she keeps it all very clear believable and even a bit suspenseful it's very new york very now and very well done","373":"for some reason the review i wrote didn't save and i hate recreating the wheel so in brief i don't think that this book is realistic or at least i hope it is not as i found nearly all of the characters to be self righteous narrowminded and often hateful i know i'm often horrified by some responses fox news etc to similar issues to the one addressed here like the mosque controversy but it is not as extreme or universal as shown here but i did find it to be a quick read and interesting in ways","374":"i really enjoyed this book and was sad that i could not convince my book club to read it","375":"this book took me a long time to read i just couldn't get into it it would have been better served as a novella","376":"i felt like i should have liked it more than i did maybe it is dated because it deals with 9 11 and limiting because of all the new york references the ending was great but the middle just dragged on and on for me bravery she thought as she walked wasn't about strength alone it required opportunity she resented them as much for having each other as for hating each other for having each other to hate she had been shaped was being shaped not only by those she met on her journey but also by how she lost them ' i know buildings are your religion salman had answered with something like bemusement but they shouldn't keep you from god and they can't bring you to him '' so great art requires a morally pure artist cal asked you look at the creation not the creator ' here he was playing another game with his country imposing another test he couldn't help himself the real act of will was not in the creating of a garden but in the sustaining the continuous stand against wildness","377":" i read this book for book club and would not have chosen it myself i was amazed that in this day and age a book on this subject can be presented as a genuine conundrum what would you do would you support the design despite the architect's muslim background for me the answer is so obvius that the reason i read on was to see how the author deals with her own assumptions of people's attitudes and emotions about islam i did not believe in the characters very much e g claire's dilemma as to what the garden means to the architect but i did like the storytelling and the strong thought provocation about the role of the press in shaping attitudes and the role of religion in our society","378":"a page turner and thought provoking explores how people develop hold onto and sometimes let go of strongly held convictions often without really understanding how they arrived at them","379":"i really enjoyed this book i hope i get enough people tonight at the first wednesday book discussion i think it is quite discussable","380":"this fictional story revolves around a competition to choose a design for a 9 11 memorial on the site of the world trade center when it is revealed that the winning entry was designed by an architect named mohammad khan a muslim all hell breaks loose this novel does a great job of exploring the complex issues and feelings from many different perspectives and i liked how various characters' perspectives changed along the way","381":"i enjoyed reading this book that explores what happens when an anonymous submission for the 09 11 site in nyc is chosen and it is revealed that the architect is muslim i would highly recommend this book to others","382":" despite some good jolts near the end for me this book was a let down it felt more like a long editorial on islam islamophobia where the various characters spout off whatever point of view the author wishes to portray the story centers on submissions for architectural designs for a memorial to the victims of 9 11 after the jury has made a decision on the winner they discover that the architect is named mohammed and is a muslim after which all hell breaks lose the book never veers away from this topic and it becomes like a repetitive sledge hammer i found the characters if you can call them that one dimensional they were mouthpieces claire i found to be simply irritating there are also some dangling threads view spoiler our main protagonist mohammed has an interview with a fatuous news anchor sarge but there is no follow up to this and who killed asma and why was this the author's way of creating sympathy or action i also feel that poor asma would have been severely exploited within her community after receiving the one million dollar compensation as widow of a 9 11 victim hide spoiler the premise of the book is definitely an eye catching subject matter - unfortunately it became rather predictable it lacked character and nuance","383":" it's fiction but entirely plausible until the end where it loses traction and vapors off into random flights of fancy but back to the plausible i suppose i fell victim to the fact that i don't know my 9 11 history very well i'm all the way in socal as far from the disaster as i can be and had absolutely no ties to any of the victims or families of victims or friends of families of victims i am the perfect demographic to read this novel because i fell for the premise and began promoting it like it had actually happened but i did in fact visit the memorial recently and kept putting 2 and 2 together though there are no 2's waldman is brilliant in showing every facet of every side of every opinion in every character you think you understand and then you can see the other side has a point and then characters lose their moral centers and everybody switches sides and jumps over their own lines drawn in the sand by it's finale you've lost your own bearings and you understand how everyone lost theirs the only problem is the murderous twist which seemed to pull the novel into melodrama i didn't think it was necessary but who am i just a socal girl readily available for flights of fancy","384":"i liked almost everything about this book the subject the characters even the deplorable ones the unpredictability of what was unfolding the author's unwillingness to settle for easy answers everyone in it is multi faceted everything discussed is thought provoking and paradoxes abound the language is particularly good waldman is skilled at using simile and metaphor to describe emotion and evoke mood here are a few of the phrases i especially admired her dread built crows landing one by one in a field this he insisted was the cause of his weightlessness the balloon just released by a child he felt when he thought of her irina was a shadow that wouldn't vanish even at night a mistake with an afterlife jealousy clings to love's underside like bats to a bridge epilogues are a calculated risk and many oh so many fail to strengthen a book this one is a rare exception i found that it contained new information that both surprised me and strengthened the story and it was ultimately the most moving section an incredibly impressive first novel","385":"along with the zero the best 9 11 novel i have read this feels like a pitch perfect rendition of the ugly process of reaching consensus over national mourning and memory waldman brings her journalistic acumen to bear on the narrative without neglecting a very finely tuned ear for character and drama one of the best novels i've read in a long time on any subject but on this subject one of the best i've ever read","386":"a timely read in the face of the looming syrian crisis this addresses what it means to be an american conflict erupts when we call into question how religion and ethnicity impact the notion of being an american and the level of trust among us when outside forces pit groups of people against one another it's also a window into the stark reality of how political ambitions and the media shape our reality i highly recommend it i loved the book","387":"i was looking forward to reading this book because the plot seemed interesting and with many outcomes an anonymous contest to choose who would design a memorial for the victims of the 9 11 terrorist attack but my excitement was short lived i think the author had a great theme but didn't know how to develop it very disappointing","388":"interesting concept but the characters are flat and stereotyped the author clearly tried to have nuanced representations however emotionally this book just didn't grab me it was a drag if i wasn't reading it for book club i would likely have stopped pretty early on","389":"i discovered this book when it was excerpted in the atlantic sometime last year and while that piece followed just a single character i was pleasantly surprised to find that the novel was much broader than that it's a really well paced thoughtful infuriating and sad reflection on post 9 11 new york that embraces the complexity of our fears and emotions and manages an impressive balance between empathy and moral clarity and like the real history it mostly just makes you wish we were better than we are","390":" the premise of this novel centers around the selection of a design u0026amp architect to create a 9 11 memorial the selection committee reviews the designs without knowing who the architect of each is when they select the winning design controversy erupts because the winning architect is a muslim the book jumped around to multiple characters throughout and explored issues such as racism and judging others based on their religion it was an interesting read but it didn't hold my attention quite as much as i would've liked","391":" review of the submission as published by amazon comthe submission by amy waldman had a great plot and was extremely well written the plot is that a group of elite judges are asked to judge the submittals for a 9 11 memorial two years after the attack after the political haggling over the blind submissions no names of the architects were attached to the designs the panel picks a winner when they open the envelope to see who the winner is they realize that the winner is a muslim the rest of the book then goes into the actions and the reactions from the victims' families the mayor the winner the winner's family the winner's place of employment the journalist the fox news caster and a surprise a widow of an illegal alien who was in the towers cleaning at the time but the author managed to write each of the people's responses credibly so that you are going back and forth yourself as you see each side from all the various angles you get to understand how some little thing done innocently gets taken out of context and blown out of proportion when people act from their emotions rather than from their reason there are no heroes and no villians just real people interacting and her writing style was extremely captivating she used so many magical metaphors and included so many shards of wisdom in her text that you wanted to continue reading although this was her first novel you could tell that she had written a great deal as a reporter for the new york times and the atlantic after becoming intoxicated by her style it was hard for me to appreciate the next book i picked up afterward david kimball","392":" unsure if i should upgrade my rating to 4 stars sometimes it's irritating to read this book but that is what makes it a good book i think the book raises interesting questions about trauma the media ideologies etc it gives you a view into a media obsessed society which is to me unnerving you as a reader are dragged along into a complexity which only gets more and more entangled along the way it's irritating everything is complicated no choice is good but making no choice is also wrong what to do also not sure about the ending a shift was necessary to uplift al this complexity but i did not really grasp how to read it tip for reading take into consideration all the different meaning contained in submission then ask who submits to whom","393":"incredible story this book has to be discussed on its literary level before it is discussed on an emotional level","394":" 1 31 12 the submission wants to make you uncomfortable as i read i wanted to squirm in my seat to turn away in imagining what might have happened had the winning design for the 9 11 memorial submitted anonymously been discovered to be by an american muslim waldman creates an impossible awful situation then sees it and all of its ramifications through to the end sorry no spoilers here the jury's unwitting choice leaks to the press the press sensationalizes the news the public seizes on it as a rallying cry for and against muslims and it all goes viral as the conflict expands the author layers complexity upon complexity conflict upon conflict until her characters are no longer able to think their way rationally out of the situation from an array of victims' family members to the members of the jury who chose the design to the architect himself each character is faced with choosing sides and in the process understanding him or herself in new and uncomfortable ways waldman's writing is sturdy sometimes venturing into poetic though a bit tentatively which makes her effort a bit too noticeable still an extraordinary first novel clearly waldman is an experienced writer even if she's not yet the most graceful but her plot construction her explication of the growing muddle and her resolution of the constellation of conflicts even though i didn't like them are consistent thoughtful and fascinating and she's great at dialogue the title has as many layers i think as the plot of course it refers to the design submitted to the jury but it refers to many other meanings of the word as well as it echoes through the book submission is considered the woman's role in islam and this is key to the characters and fates of a number of female characters whether muslim or not submission also points to the problem of polarization if a conflict is set up with two opposing sides and no chance of compromise then only one side can win and the other must submit these are only the most obvious ways it is used i think there are many others as well","395":"this review has been hidden because it contains spoilers to view it click here firstly in response to this work about prejudice and assumptions i must confront my own i almost set this book down without giving it a chance why i bought it cheap and in a hurry i saw something on the back cover and from that and the title i assumed it was a work of non fiction dealing with islam sold when i picked it up months later to read i rolled my eyes when i realized that the author was like me an american woman how could that possibly make it less worthwhile well firstly in response to this work about prejudice and assumptions i must confront my own i almost set this book down without giving it a chance why i bought it cheap and in a hurry i saw something on the back cover and from that and the title i assumed it was a work of non fiction dealing with islam sold when i picked it up months later to read i rolled my eyes when i realized that the author was like me an american woman how could that possibly make it less worthwhile well in my biased eyes it did this is not easy to admit and then when i saw that it was a novel and dealt with a fictional aftermath of september 11 2001 a time when i myself was in graduate school in new york i shook my head and almost discarded it i'm unhappy with myself yes my tastes tend to run more toward authors with names like binyavanga wainaina and qurratulain hyder and saramago not that those names have anything in common other than being blissfully foreign to me but it was amy waldman who forced me to confront my motivations my drive to work tirelessly to speak new languages with no accent my choice to leave the u s in 2005 though i hadn't and haven't been involved with an american since 1998 needless to say given the 5 stars i was very quickly pulled into the story waldman's message is powerful and powerfully conveyed the kaleidoscope of perspectives is often and surely this is her intent dizzying but as is so easy to achieve when you're reading and not living i never wavered in my opinion about the controversy on which the book focused the controversy itself especially given waldman's background as a journalist is surely not entirely or even primarily fictional some of the characters were terrifically appealing khan laila asma some made me feel dirty particularly spier but also bitman dawson and maybe roi some disappointed me gradually or unexpectedly claire paul and a few developing characters redeemed themselves in my eyes sean nasruddin i was starting to think about the possibilities of an imagined sequel focusing on abdul anwar when i had a measly 20 pages left and had no idea what would happen at the end however the epilogue was very fitting and tied up loose ends in a way that would have been false had the book ended in any other way i would have liked to know who murdered asma and whether the news cameras focused on her had caught something i know though that it wasn't the point and that the fact of not knowing intensified my perception of the distrust between the warring factions many facets many loyalties real and imagined many possible interpretations for instance the meeting between claire and mohammad khan in which the question is posed it's a matter of faith isn't it this beauty can only be understood in context and there are many other layered moments of uncertainty ambivalence hidden motives etc within i think that khan was a little bit obnoxious and ambitious not necessarily a fault but if you ask me his religion was really architecture or put more broadly style his strict principles part of that unyielding style reminded me of my own including how much trouble they've caused me at times and i would have dealt with the rude questions posed to him in just the same way and i didn't waver in my support for him when he moved away or when he made the garden with writings from the quran on the walls now i just need to apply those haughty principles to respecting the possibility of greatness in any book even if the front cover reveals 1 novel 2 american 3 woman 4 9 11 or as in this case all of the above shame on me for supposing otherwise and thanks to ms waldman for a thought provoking and beautiful read more","396":"this is a highly intelligent book the first novel of the co chief of the southeast asia bureau of the newyork time the story of reactions when a muslin wins the prize for designing a memorial for 9 11 everybody's prejudices come out in full force a well balanced book thoughtful as well as entertaining i recommend it","397":"mentally exhausting but worth the read","398":"a very thought provoking novel i really enjoyed the last third of the story","399":"i found this book to be very interesting not a fast read or all likeable characters but fascinating premise and perspectives i keep coming back to it in my mind","400":"i found it interesting but it should have ended without the last chapter","401":"riveting ingeniously crafted very funny in parts accreting to something profound having read an advance copy i'm now impatient as hell for the publication date so i can talk about it with other people","402":"this book deals with principles vs beliefs adherence to both vs ambition all in the context of a contest for the design of a memorial to the victims of 9 11 a panel chooses a memorial design from among many anonymous designers only to discover the winner is an american muslim who must pit his own ambition and beliefs against the uproar post 9 11 the book examines the motives and actions of the jury panel and all the ancillary players in this engrossing drama my one drawback was a delay in finishing the book due to many long interruptions good thing i created a character list i could refer back to as i picked up the book after delays i really enjoyed the book and thought it was an infinitely sad yet accurate portrayal of the post 9 11 era","403":"really good book looking at the issues of stereotypes and prejudices in a conflicted way ambiguity throughout which i usually don't like but in the case of the submission serves to underline the difficulty of some of the emotions and feelings the character are grappling with","404":"it was a good read not amazing but interesting to see an interpretation of what might happen if that situation really happened","405":" i'm going to have to abandon this halfway through only one thing has happened and it's giving me a minor stroke like reading mother jones while watching fox news the book's premise is that a bunch of elite rich manhattanites on a committee to choose the 9 11 memorial from blind entries accidentally select a design by an equally elite rich manhattanite muslim who conveniently is so non religious that he actually questions whether islam is evil then the anti muslim rallies begin my real issue is that although waldman seems to be attempting to show both sides of this issue and some other reviewers here say they see both sides she comes off as not having enough empathy or understanding of the anti muslim movement to help me empathize or understand them nearly all of the characters in the book are fairly unattractive so far despite rounds and rounds of the committee trying to control the situation and the anti muslim groups trying to disrupt it i've seen no personal growth on either side which might help me relate to the plight of those i currently don't agree with i get that having a memorial built by a muslim might not be what's best of the country but that's only because of the uproar it would cause from people who incorrectly consider islam the enemy not because of any valid reason other than the unfortunate backlash the book seems uncomfortably realistic but in real life i can't understand people who equate islam especially american muslims with the terrorist attacks and this book didn't help at all which i think is one of the higher goals of fiction if anyone who's finished this book wants to message me to tell me how it ends i would very much appreciate it","406":"this book covers the selection and the building of the memorial to the 9 11 victims though this book grabbed me at first i did not enjoy reading it the story seemed a bit dry while dealing with a very emotional topic i found it very educational and thought provoking i also wonder if i didn't enjoy it because if was very through provoking but i was unsure of how i would feel in the situation not a book i would recommend but it did cause me to think","407":"this was a solid read it raised some interesting and important questions that you can't ignore i felt the mohammad character definitely lived up to his american name by being an insensitive selfish jerk the only thing that kind of bothered me was for this bk to be so smart and with it i felt that mo was unbelievably naive by thinking that his name would not cause a stir that didn't match his character or sit well w me but i would read another by this author","408":" i really enjoyed reading this book though it is a fictional book it really makes you think in context of the world we live in and the lack of judgement we all have a chance of holding once in a while the submission makes you think of the small thoughts that may or may not pass through your mind and thus further causes you to reanalyze the feelings opinions generated in everyday life yes the book is addressing a very controversial topic and there are going to be strong proponents and opponents to the book but you will not be able to read this book with out formulating a position and taking a strong stance this book will make you think in a whole new perspective and has the opportunity to make the world open up generating a different light shed upon your whole world","409":"great book makes you think about who you are and what you stand for and all of this changes as you read the book highly recommended","410":"loved this the author's journalism background came through in her even keeled writing which allows the issues to take center stage based on the premise you think you know exactly what you would do but this book lays bare just how complicated religious prejudice can be","411":"a very good book it was incredibly frustrating to read what with all the bigotry and hatred and ridiculousness the saddest thing is that i think waldman absolutely nailed what would happen if this scenario was real","412":" i read this for book club so i'm not sure i would have picked it up otherwise as other reviewers stated i found the characters to be flat i didn't connect on an emotional level with any of them another reviewer mentioned that the author is a journalist so it makes sense that the book reads more like nonfiction on a positive note it is so well written that i kept reading i think that the premise was interesting but it's not enough to carry the book for me there are some books that are terribly written but an amazing plot saves them in the case of this book i just wanted to feel more about the characters","413":"i had a love hate with this book well written great characters and an intriguing plot but painful that was because no one wins much like that time around 9 11 however waldman shows great promise","414":" ms waldman did a fantastic job of getting the post 9 11 sentiment correct and she weaved a nice little story but i didn't really like any of the characters and since she was writing directly about nyc and the wtc memorial i couldn't buy the fact that she fictionalized the governor and mayor that really irked me yes i know it was fiction and the governor's character was central to the plot but it was annoying there were comparisons to this book and the bonfire of the vanities and maybe i am just old and jaded now but in no way did this novel thrill me like that one","415":"couldn't put it down and didn't want it to end a masterful work thought provoking and not easy highly recommend","416":" i thought this book was more of a philosophical discussion with characters added to voice the different opinions most of the characters were pretty thinly sketched and seemed to stand in as points of view rather than actual people with depth i did feel that waldman did an excellent job of drawing out the argument s itself themselves in the novel however she did not shy away from the lack of resolution that occurs when conflicts of economy religion politics and emotions collide even though a more settled ending may have been more satisfactory to the reader as someone whose field is politics i also thought the way she described the political actions that were being taken behind the scenes was dead on this gave our group a lot to talk about which in and of itself always leads me to recommend a book i also wanted to keep in mind that this was waldman's first novel perhaps her skill at character development will be more honed in her next book","417":"very thought provoking i loved how waldman showed all sides without leading you to a certain conclusion a very good read","418":"normally when an author intentionally pushes all my issue buttons i resent feeling manipulated but waldman does it so well and so effortlessly that i fell in love with this book it's most definitely a 9 11 story filled with that gut punch and sorrow and even fear but it's even more an american story dealing with what it means to be free when a muslim man wins a blind competition to design the 9 11 memorial everyone's beliefs and assumptions are questioned there are no easy bad or good guys there are no black and white answers waldman created complex flawed and insecure characters on all sides of the debate and allows us to really get to know them so that it's harder to sit in judgement no matter what our personal beliefs are she doesn't attempt to wrap up summarize or excuse she lays the submission out in front of the reader and asks us to do the examining what a success","419":"couldn't even get into it put it down after a few pages","420":"great view on diversity and it's inherent mix of perception","421":"a lot of the professional reviews of this book start with something like based on the description you would expect this to feel contrived but it doesn't i disagree it does feel too contrived i like my political and social analysis approached more from the side in literature otherwise i would read non fiction","422":"really liked this overall it felt realistic in the way it unfolded it was well plotted and maintained its tension throughout and several of the characters were really well drawn i particularly liked the passages that went into mo's thoughts and feelings as he reacted to the backlash against him i thought waldman was remarkably insightful and realistic in the way she drew his inner life asma and her bangladeshi community were very vivid too as was the commitete leader paul there were a few flaws claire burwell the other main character besides mo was not as well drawn i thought she was kind of a cipher and her emotional journey was just not really accessible or believable sean the right winger seemed a bit like a caricature as did the horrible reporter women alyssa i think on the whole though i found this both enjoyable and insightful definitely worth reading","423":"this is an intelligent complex political book waldman has orchestrated a multi voiced tale with nuance and complexity i love the peacefulness of the garden at its centre and in stark contrast i love the way she shows us how difficult it is to do the right thing in certain situations recommended","424":"this is an excellent debut novel the novel explores many concepts around rights art expression religion family and memory all of the characters whether or not you like agree with them are strongly written the way the novel moves you and with whom you agree will tell you a great deal about yourself whether or not you like what is reflected at you","425":" what would happen if a design to create a ground zero memorial to the victims of 9 11 open to anonymous submissions and decided by a carefully selected jury is won by an american of muslim heritage that is the question explored in this novel the story unfolds from the points of view of the winning architect the jurors several families of the victims politicians a news reporter a talk show host and the american public well developed characters get caught up in the suspicion and anger of misunderstandings the tension builds to a tragic climax as the nation's tolerance of religious difference is severely tested","426":"interesting read for anyone even moreso for designers as a way to gain perspective","427":" the scariest movie i've ever seen is the blair witch project the day when they walk north for hours and end it right back when they started is the most terrifying moment of real life horror i have ever had the pleasure of watching but for those of you who haven't seen the film lots of crazy stuff happens like little piles of rocks appearing as gravestones outside of the tent at night lots of freaking out and running around the woods while an unseen force torments and traps them in the forest at the end of the submission view spoiler when the son is at the muslim garden filming the memorial and him and the girl is it the daughter it's been a couple of years since i read the book i apologize for not remembering details as i didn't like the book enough to read it again start freaking out at the memorial and leave that pile of rocks to represent his dad hide spoiler all i could think was the striking resemblance it had with the blair witch project very strange considering the fact that this book is not a horror book or even a mystery but alas i can't help the thoughts that occur in my mind i read this book as a school 'requirement' see my review for ready player one in the few weeks before i began my freshman year at ohio state i knew it wasn't really required and apparently most students weren't planning to read it but i thought what the heck why not i knew it'd be done in a few days and even thought i picked up the book for free at orientation i knew i was paying for it probably several times over with all of the fees and tuition this university sucks out of me so i gave it a go not knowing what to expect from a book that was clearly meant to make us think what would i think this is not the kind of book i normally read should it be called historical fiction it is a fictionalized story from a real historical event but to call 9 11 'history' feels so strange to me i lived it i remember it i remember the effects of it we are all still living in the post 9 11 world with those effects it makes this book difficult for me to understand it was an easy read the plot progressed well as i remember and i didn't think it was too ridiculous as many of my classmates felt the characters were extremely difficult for me to understand i completely apologize for not bothering to look up the names in advance the main character whose husband was killed in the wtc is a rich entitled woman i understand her confusion about how to feel regarding a muslim architect for the memorial design in the aftermath of her husband's murder but it doesn't seem like she actually has any grief she seemed emotionless if i remember correctly maybe that's accurate i've never lost someone close to me in a horrendous way thank god speaking of the architect he is muslim at least at the beginning of the book in name only he does not practice i don't think he even believes so i struggled to understand the response to him and his reponse to others' response the outrage at his design being selected seems so blown out of proportion unrealistic but maybe it isn't maybe in the immediate months and years following 9 11 that's exactly how america would have reacted is this the kind of thinking i'm meant to be doing good move osu what was interesting was seeing the battle over the memorial design over a period of months the characters certainly developed even if i still didn't understand them there is some gratuitous sexual content that i felt was a little awkward and random but it was not too graphic i'd recommend this book to anyone who thinks they might be interested i guess 18 it's hard for me to give this odd book a home if you are interested in alternate possibilities historical fiction maybe you want to see what some of the immediate cultural issues were in the aftermath of 9 11 this could be a good book i gave it 3 stars for 'i liked it' i think i liked it i didn't particularly like it but it was interesting but hey if you are interested in reading the book find one of the 10 000 ohio state class of 2017 students who got it for free and probably never read it i'm sure they'd give it to you free of charge","428":"the story takes place in nyc two years after the 9 11 attacks a contest is held to determine the design for a memorial the winning submission is by a muslim american architect mo kahn the committee the city and various communities involved are thrown into turmoil as everyone brings their own personal feelings and prejudices to the decision making a few of the characters were too stereotypical the reporter who is irresponsible and marginally unethical in reporting the story the governor who is making political hay with the situation the stoic wasp widow representing the families the dead beat younger brother of a nyc firefighter who cannot seem to do anything right this is a well written book with an interesting premise that lends itself to conversations on religious ethnic identity patriotism and love of country freedom of artistic expression","429":"there were times i found all the drama and personalities tiresome but overall i need up liking this book","430":"this novel could so easily have been a polemic on 9 11 and though unabashedly political waldman succeeds in creating a truly unforgettable 9 11 story that brilliantly underscores the contradictions at the heart of the american experience i could not put this one down it definitely tops my list of stories that explore 9 11","431":" a more accurate rating would be 2 5 stars i wanted to like this more and while there are aspects that i enjoyed overall it left much to be desired there are several plotlines and i can just imagine this being turned into a movie eventually the main plotline involving mohammad khan and his design was the more fleshed out and through of them all it was also the only one that kept me engaged and it bothers me that female characters who are single or widowed or divorced need to find that third act romance or fling to complete their character it's unnecessary 90% of the time and it was definitely unnecessary here the things i did like however is the use of media in fanning the flames of racial and religious intolerance the immigrant experience in america is explored nicely and with care especially after september 11","432":"i found this thoughtful and readable the style is popular and journalistic and the author is a journalist it is pacy but also thought provoking a powerful demonstration of the fault lines that 9 11 caused in american society a good read","433":"did not hold my interest","434":"this is a well written character driven book that lends itself to great discussions the characters feel very dimensional and real waldman takes on several big themes in this well crafted novel it was a page turner i will recommend","435":"wonderful book the following review is from amazon but summarizes it better than i can ten years after 9 11 a dazzling kaleidoscopic novel reimagines its aftermatha jury gathers in manhattan to select a memorial for the victims of a devastating terrorist attack their fraught deliberations complete the jurors open the envelope containing the anonymous winner's name--and discover he is an american muslim instantly they are cast into roiling debate about the claims of grief the ambiguities of art and the meaning of islam their conflicted response is only a preamble to the country's the memorial's designer is an enigmatic ambitious architect named mohammad khan his fiercest defender on the jury is its sole widow the self possessed and mediagenic claire burwell but when the news of his selection leaks to the press she finds herself under pressure from outraged family members and in collision with hungry journalists wary activists opportunistic politicians fellow jurors and khan himself--as unknowable as he is gifted in the fight for both advantage and their ideals all will bring the emotional weight of their own histories to bear on the urgent question of how to remember and understand a national tragedy in this deeply humane novel the breadth of amy waldman's cast of characters is matched by her startling ability to conjure their perspectives a striking portrait of a fractured city striving to make itself whole the submission is a piercing and resonant novel by an important new talent","436":"after 9 11 a contest was held to select a memorial design to commemorate the attacks the jury selected the winner from anonymous entries only to find that the architect was muslim the book chronicles the subsequent aftermath of naming a muslim as designer of a memorial to remember attacks by muslim terrorists all sides of the fictional issue were addressed victims' families the press government officials a really thought provoking book that would be great for a book club to discuss","437":" i found this a very powerful novel dealing with a controversial topic i felt it was an impressive debut for amy waldman and am at a loss as to why this novel was not short listed for the 2012 orange prize as it was well written and tackled head on the subject of xenophobia and religious cultural prejudice in the wake of 9 11 maybe a little too controversial glad that a member of our orange shadowing reading group raised this issue of its non inclusion and brought it to my attention again a review i will update once had a chance to reflect more","438":"through the entire book i was not buying the motivations behind the characters they were such sharp stereotypes then at times would react completely opposite of your expectation those actions seemed so forced and authorly then came the epilogue and i cried for the last four paragraphs those few sentences at least for me rescued the book from failure","439":"this is an amazing what if book that will make you think i felt for the characters even if i didn't agree with them or their actions","440":"very good read the characters were well drawn and made me feel so much there were times when i found the events of this book so difficult to separate from the reality of life in america post 9 11 i found it terrifying and maddening and compelling","441":"this book has the feeling of an important read a book that would lend itself to a great book club discussion or even better the start of a larger cultural discussion about the treatment of islam in a post 9 11 world it's a complicated and uncomfortable conversation this book pushes you toward but it's one i wish more of us could have in a respectful and sensitive way i started reading this book in the midst of the school year and so its progress was extremely slow i'm so glad i stuck with it and ended up finishing it in the wake of the orlando shooting some of the comments made by a certain 'politician' and those like him were reminiscent of some of the more ignorant characters in this novel it became a sort of sad study for me of how far we haven't come from those heavily emotional months after the attack to the present day","442":"eh this just felt predictable and largely reductive if not trite to me","443":"well written and thought provoking really gets you thinking about what you might do in a similar situation and to question who you are in a crisis when it is time to take a stand do you and if you do what would you really fight for and what are your motivations this book could've been cliche and fallen into easy stereotypes but it doesn't highly recommend this book","444":"i read this my senior year of high school for a post 9 11 literature english class and i really enjoyed it i think it provides an accurate representation of the challenges created by the intersection of different cultures after the tragedy of 9 11 and how people coped with these differences","445":"a page turner but annoyingly heavy handed","446":"i can't decide how i feel about this book it's excellently written with fully realized and conflicted characters and waldman certainly captures the rawness of the country's emotions at that time but maybe that's the problem she so clearly depicts all of the things i hate about this country the prejudices that bring out the worst in us that i kept wanting to pitch the book acros the room because i was so angry at the characters 3 1 2 stars","447":"found the submission both engaging and troubling though not surprisingly so given the subject matter i am curious about the significance of the cover symbolism in case anyone's figured it out i'm thinking it might represent the facade of the world trade center the garden design for the memorial or something really obvious that i am missing","448":" while reading i thought the author strident but in the ending i find her quite perceptive she created and showed the complexities of the two main characters the vast and great pressures on both of them and their valiant attempts to resist those pressures to remain true to themselves and she shows the complexity of regret years later--understanding why and how one thought the way one did acted the way one did while also looking with the perspective of time and seeing how or why the act decision was wrong i'm much more affected and impressed by this novel than i expected to be the epilogue really made the piece powerful and reflective and it doesn't end with simple easy answers so the reader is left to think that hopefully america will end in the right eventually but the issues and way we get there will never be simple or easy and perhaps the complexity and process is just as important as the end result","449":" i would have given this a 3 5 it was really well written but at times it felt like waldman was stretching it a bit at being literary it could have been shorter and better had she focused on fewer main characters since she devoted a lot of time at the beginning to character development which was unnecessary for a number of characters there also were times where it felt a bit like being beaten over the head with morality lessons but i did like that she explored a variety of ideas about race religion etc including some that i would never admit to feeling but that are thoughts i have had nevertheless","450":"fascinating idea for a story in a contest for a memorial to the victims of 9 11 in new york city the anonymous designer chosen is muslim the conflicts that ensue are enlightening and fascinating the book is intelligent and thought provoking with a cast of characters that spans a variety of races and ethnicities in new york following the 9 11 attacks this novel is a well written thought provoking look at the tensions and sensibilities of the city at that time i appreciated how the author managed to incorporate so many different personalities shifting viewpoints and a multitude of issues that added a wonderful level of complexity this book really made me think about many of the issues we face today relative to our prejudices in fact the muslim architectural designer is somewhat obstinate a very likely character trait that makes him more real","451":"delillo's falling man was better and i never thought i'd say that of delillo ha","452":"this is a very good novel it unfurls by following the consequences of a single event in this case the discovery by the imagined jury reviewing anonymously submitted designs for a 9 11 memorial that their selection is the work of a muslim american architect interestingly the book was written before the real life proposal to build an islamic center in lower manhattan came to public attention with the attendant outrage in some quarters so it turns out to be a lovely example of life imitating art","453":"outstanding i had a deeply emotional response to this book on many levels which i'm still processing","454":"this novel does an excellent job of illustrating the multiple perspectives on a thorny issue a muslim architect wins a blind competition for designing the memorial to honor the victims of the 9 11 attack he is a u s citizen but is soon enveloped in a firestorm of competing interests and opinions the author shows all sides of each issue with a balanced approach this book makes you think and possibly reconsider your biases whatever they may be","455":" the submission of a design for a 9 11 memorial to god to public opinion all of these are issues in a very thoughtful novel when the design of an indian american who happens to be a secular muslim is selected by a jury in a blind competition for a memorial at ground zero in new york city the members of the jury the families of the dead muslims around the world politicians the press and the designer's parents all become caught up in a firestorm of controversy regarding the appropriateness of both the design and the designer i could hardly put the book down and though i'd hoped for a different ending i think ms waldman's choice was the right one for the story and perhaps the only realistic one in 2003 this book was chosen for our city's on the same page reading program for everyone to read and discuss i highly recommend it","456":"the concept of this book was what made it worthwhile unfortunately only one chatacter was at all sympathetic and most were downright annoying and unlikeable and what does the author have against journalists given the alternative i'll take freedom of the press anytime so why was the only journalist from the tabloids and she was quite unlikeable","457":" i was intrigued by the subject of this book but terribly disappointed by it i agree with those who say the characters were underdeveloped though i might say they were undeveloped there is no explanation as to why the characters were compelled to act as they did you never really get to know any of them from the ivy league educated woman who can't seem to think for herself to the non practicing muslim mo who flips back and forth over whether or not his religion affected his design most of the remaining characters are glaring stereotypes i had to force myself to finish this book","458":"it was an interesting subject to explore and think about sort of dragged i could only read about half of it and then skipped to the end it was difficult to like the main character and i so wanted to root for him","459":"the book covered very sensitive subject matter well written the depth of emotion displayed in the characters was very memorable","460":"quite enjoyable as an audiobook i e good for listening to while driving therefore probably a bit thin for actually sitting down and reading","461":" full review available herethis will be one of my favorite reads of the year i adore waldman's prose and this is a beautiful thoughtful thought provoking in a good way amazing novel i wish we could bring such intelligence and insight to all discourse in our country be it political religious cultural or all of the above it would be easier for a writer to play favorites among her characters and their views but aside from alyssa the journalist waldman evokes empathy and sympathy if not agreement for each of her characters and their positions somewhere along the way we lost that ability to understand without agreeing asking us to do so again is one of the many reasons i was so moved by the submission the submission of the title is the garden but i also thought of submission in relation to mo the architect it is not his nature to submit he's not a religious muslim he does not submit to god but he also does not submit to others his attitude reminded me of joan allen in the contender as a nominee for vice president she won't respond to certain allegations because if she were a man the questions would not be asked if mo were not a muslim the questions would not be asked this could be read as arrogance but as another character muses \"maybe arrogance is necessary for greatness\" 272 i don't know if waldman is arrogant i suspect not since her writing is brilliant yet also subtle but she is certainly great and the submission is a work of greatness","462":"interesting premise an architect submits a blueprint for the 9 11 memorial and wins but faces trouble when the public finds out his muslim however the way it was written is boring very much like reportage rather than a story i couldn't relate to any of the characters they were objectively written and there were plenty of verbose which are unnecessary in this book but the message is clear","463":"the architect whose design was chosen for the 9 11 memorial turns out to be an american muslim how does this settle with new york and the rest of the country this is a sharp intelligent and thought provoking novel","464":"this novel made me look at a life defining event 9 11 that i had read extensively about in a new way the book offers an incidental 360 degree view from the top of the towers as we are forced to identify with the entire range of people affected and walk a few steps in their shoes","465":"i was bored by this book i wanted to like it i thought the premise was interesting but there is a gap between idea and execution the book lacked nuance and subtlety and i just was not in the mood for the blatant politics of the commission perhaps it was too realistic considering the current political environment so for me it was a lot of blah blah blah with the emphasis on blah","466":" if i were in a book club this would be a book i would bring to the group the premise is compelling a jury chosen to select a design for the 9 11 memorial makes its selection then finds out it was created by a muslim american second thoughts and political theater ensue the book drew me in quickly and the issues of the role of public art the meaning of art and criticism and the treatment of muslims in america after 9 11 are ripe for discussion the book's faults are a poor delineation of time it was often disorienting to be unsure about how much time has passed between our stop ins with any single character answer not much you eventually figure out it all takes place within a couple of months and few particularly elegant passages but waldman is very effective at conveying a wide variety of perspectives quickly it made sense when i read she was a journalist and this is her first novel very thought provoking and engaging when the novel starts to turn from the meaning of submission that's about the entry in the design competition to its meaning that refers to how much the different characters are expected and willing to submit themselves to the viewpoints of others you get to a nice consideration of what our competing obligations are as citizens in a free country","467":"stunning novel beautifully written could this be the 9 11 novel","468":" was absolutely hooked on reading this while on a flight read it front to back the different perspective and how each had a cause and effect to each other was gripping all of the story lines felt ripped from the headlines circa the early '00 and they smartly came together i did feel the author sided too much with the architect in being in the right with not having to give reasons to submit his design for the memorial especially after building how selfish he actually was still quick read that left a lot to consider","469":"this has been on my to read list for a while and i was excited to finally get to it i loved the premise is the novel that an american muslim was selected through a blind competition to design the 9 11 memorial unfortunately the reality did not live up to its promise although well written the characters became caricatures perpetuating the stereotypes of muslims narrow minded xenophobic americans and 9 11 widows mo khan is introduced to us as a non practicing muslim who quickly and inexplicably morphs into and angry persecuted man when one interview could assuage many of the concerns presented by the general public claire burwell an educated open minded thoughtful woman who lost her husband during the attacks develops a fixation on khan's refusal to explain his influences despite the fact that she was his first and only supporter once his identity became known the author portrays the families who lost loved ones during the attacks on september 11th with a homogeneity that does not exist forgetting that each family is different each person within each family had their own individual reaction to their incredible loss the ending is soap operatic overall this was a disappointing read","470":" i read this book in two tranches having abandoned it halfway through and picked it up again after a couple of months the central premise is seemingly straightforward a select committee is charged with the task of building a memorial to the victims of 9 11 at ground zero the job is put out to secret tender and the winner is to be selected before his identity is known lo and behold he turns out to be an american born secular muslim an architect whose garden design may or may not have islamic influences and so begins an admittedly erudite treatise on the various rights and wrongs of the case those who champion it include a bereaved wife whose husband died when the twin towers fell other relatives of the deceased strongly oppose it believing their noses will be rubbed in the ashes of the towers if it goes ahead the immigrant muslim community are equally up in arms meanwhile the architect remains almost mute about his influences or motivation preferring the garden to speak for itself as an apt memorial ms waldman's grasp of subtlety and nuance is to be admired every argument has a counter every counter another counter the issues are never black and white the problem is that it reads more like a thesis than a novel the characters are never more than one dimensional there simply to vocalise the many shades of opinion we never get to know anyone politicians are portrayed as cardboard cut out cliches the architect himself is interestingly conflicted yet hopelessly colourless the professional and personal relationships merely hinted at rather than developed the book was certainly more enjoyable as it reached its slightly unsatisfactory conclusion but continued to suffer from aridity a failure to engage as a piece of fiction fascinating beautifully argued learned and informative but ultimately unsatisfying","471":"i was completely drawn into this very timely book it was thought provoking on every page it showed how complex people really are with so many competing and contradictory loyalties and ideas i liked how some of the characters faded in and out of importance at different times the ending chapter provided a very satisfactory look back at the earlier events it was great","472":"interesting concept good start bored me in middle enjoyed last chapter","473":" here's the deal it's going to sound like i didn't like this book but i did it was uncomfortable to read because it was so unfortunately realistic i wish it wasn't so easy to picture the bigotry and discrimination occurring in real life but i know it does but it wasn't difficult to read because the author wrote such accessible flawed human characters although it is almost exclusively about emotions everyone agrees on the facts yet their reactions are so different it wasn't an overly emotional book it gave me room to think by not feeling emotionally manipulated or steered toward one side over the other i was able to read it like an observational study on human behavior i would say i almost felt detached but that sounds negative i found it very interesting and read quickly to find out what the resolution would be i give a lot of credit to the author for remaining true to the characters throughout the entire book the ending didn't feel forced there was no unrealistic kumbaya moment where everyone discovered we're not so different after all but it wasn't all bleak either just like life find all my reviews at http readingatrandom blogspot com 2","474":"a more intriguing premise then great novel the issue of islam and the tragedy of 9 11 provokes a lot of thought but the characters are cardboard cutouts who never seemed real to me it had the maknigs of a very special hbo movie i guess glad i read it but happy to move on","475":"this had an interesting premise a musilm architect wins the public competition for design of the 9 11 memorial in new york city and all the fears and anti muslim sentiments of the time rise to the surface some of poltics got too heavy handed in the middle of the book and the conclusion was unsatisfying to my way of thinking but it provides food for thought and is timely","476":"timely and thought provoking i felt like the author got a little lazy with the ending though felt like she got tired of writing it and then just decided to tie a bow and be done","477":" this book was a perfect example of why i frequently don't read modern fiction with a point it smacked you in the face with the point it was trying to make and meandered too long to get to the rising action i read this for work since its this year's buckeye book community book and actually reminds me of another book that i read for my british culture class white teeth both seem to be trying to make points about race and how we view culture but seem to be preaching rather than allowing the reader to draw our own conclusions i leave feeling like modern writers don't understand subtlety we tell people what we want them to think instead of expecting them to do it on their own i gave this 3 stars because i can't find fault technically with the book it's well written and the characters are real which is more than i can say for most books but i felt like between all the preaching i didn't get to really see the characters develop","478":"the issue explored in the book made this a very worthwhile book but i didn't think it was extremely well written and some of the sub plots meant i presume to add intrigue were rather ridiculous but exploring the prejudices values etc of americans both muslims and non muslims following 9 11 was well done and provides and opportunity for good discussion and thought","479":"great plot but not great characters","480":" the premise behind this book is what initially pulled me to it not any glowing reviews or author name recognition the plot is simple enough a contest is held to design the memorial for the 9 11 attacks what happens over the course of the book will make you think and question your values and morals and those of our country the driving force of this book is that a man named mohammad has won the contest to design the memorial for the world trade center attacks a man whose family is muslim you can imagine how this plays out in the book and don't worry i won't give anything away the author gives you different viewpoints throughout the story so that you aren't subject to just one character's opinion there are a host of characters and narrators throughout the book the architect who designed the memorial the widow who was on the jury to decide which design would be chosen an illegal immigrant whose husband was killed in the attacks a man who lost his firefighter brother amy waldman jumps between these characters and a few others providing you a well rounded story with the ability to understand each and every viewpoint you see why the man who lost his brother wouldn't want something like this built you see the widow who represents the families who lost loved ones and learn the pressure that she is under in this situation you see the architect who created a beautiful concept being ripped to shreds simply because of his religion that's the greatest strength of this book is the the author's ability to jump around and show you how people are handling this news and trying to move on from the attacks while there are so many characters i think the greatest weakness of this book is the lack of character development there are so many chances for waldman to just push a little farther so that we could see the change in a character but she takes her foot off the gas before it happens i feel like this happens with every major character in this book except for asma the illiegal immigrant she is the only person who i feel like we see development and growth when we were first introduced to the character i didn't really like her but as the story progressed i found myself looking forward to her passages i wish that waldman had taken the time to do this with the other main characters because the payoff would have been huge overall this is a great book there were so many times that i had to put the book down and think for awhile it really did cause me to think about my own views and those that we share as a nation she pushes the reader to question how they would handle themselves if this were a real world scenario and provides us with a cast of characters we are bound to see ourselves in one of them but it's up to us to decide who we would be","481":"this review has been hidden because it contains spoilers to view it click here book takes place mostly during time of jury deliberating over their selection of mo's design the garden which they don't realize was designed by a sort of muslim when this leaks to the press the book goes into all the various reactions by many different groups affected by this decision i thought the book was very interesting in stressing the domino effect of how this one thing could affect so many different people in so many different ways from the protesters who are against the design book takes place mostly during time of jury deliberating over their selection of mo's design the garden which they don't realize was designed by a sort of muslim when this leaks to the press the book goes into all the various reactions by many different groups affected by this decision i thought the book was very interesting in stressing the domino effect of how this one thing could affect so many different people in so many different ways from the protesters who are against the design to the people defending mo's right to be the winner sometimes i think it dragged a bit when it got too repetitive ending was very touching when william as cameraman left the cairn i did get a little confused about all the various religious groups and factions and protesters and also who was in favor of mo and who wasn't and how some people seemed to keep switching sides i could certainly personally feel the indecisiveness of this dilemma i don't know how i would have voted on that committee there seemed to be pros and cons on both sides what with all the trouble and violence that resulted because of mo yet he still should have been allowed to be the winner and build the garden read on wikipedia what actually is on the site now skyscrapers in progress one completed plus memorial and museum more","482":"i'm struggling with this book but being that it's highly rated and listed as one of the top best books in 2011 i'll do my best to stick it out","483":"i thought the vocabulary in this book was very gratuitous i love vocabulary and i love that people are creative with using more of the english language but after awhile this was just exhausting to read i found it very implausible that many of these conversations were happening in realy life that being said the subject topic characters were good the writing dragged it down for me","484":"an interesting book dealing with very sensitive issues i was gifted 30 copies of this book for a future class and had not read it before i received the books while i think that this story has multiple entry points i'm not sure that listing it as required reading on a syllabus is necessarily something i'm comfortable with","485":" this book is s a great premise because there is an issue that polarises divides an entire nation of people america discovers that the winning submission for the memorial to the victims of 9 11 is designed by a man called mohammad khan this is played out of course on a national scale and is a good exploration of the whole notion of tolerance and how elastic that can be one of the things that came up is that being a tolerant society means also having to tolerate the intolerant and irrational and it doesn't quite work characters change views in this book from being against to then for and visa versa you got to see both sides of the story especially how the american muslims have been affected throughout the whole tragedy this book is intriguing and is a great read i just would have liked it to be a bit more concise because in the bulk of the story there was too much of the deciding of whether or not to go ahead with the garden another flaw of the book is the character of the journalist which was ridiculously over the top and had no substance i loved the double meaning of the title submission there's the submission of a design for consideration and then the issue of which side will submit first to the emotional forces that emerged as a result","486":"i love this stuff cultural identity and collective memory and the politics of art and memorialisation it's what gets me thinking and feeling and really quite exercised in a very good way how does a person and a people balance rational thought and emotional unease is discrimination based on race or religion anything other than racism and bigotry should art transcend personal grievance my sympathies barely wavered as i read because i know where i stand on these things but it was interesting nonetheless to see characters articulate and doubt their positions it is about a competition held to build a memorial on the site of the world trade centers and most of the book is based 2 years after the towers were toppled the design itself is contested and championed by people who change their minds throughout the process it raises important questions about cultural assumptions and loyalty national and personal identity brill","487":"a jury is charged with choosing a suitable memorial for the site of the 9 11 terrorist attacks the entries are anonymous and the winner just happens to be a muslim american the conflicted feelings of the jury members is mirrored in the feelings of the public waldman does a great job in presenting the many sides of the conflict and the character of those involved","488":"a real homage to the emotions of americans in wake of the terrorist attack on 9 11 2001 and it's aftermath in light of pastor jones koran burning and the building of an islamic center downtown nyc in the last few years this book reminds us of all the lingering questions of morality tolerance vigilance understanding patriotism and more","489":"this was a good book well written and dealt with some very timely issues american attitudes towards muslims however it was repetitive and dragged quite a bit so i gave it only three stars","490":"a must read thought provoking and intense hard to get into but once you do allison you will love this book","491":"this may be my favorite book club selection we have read yet i agree with dorsey that the characters' behavior is very uncomfortable at times but i think that is because it rings very true some of the writing is just exquisite i highlighted at least twelve selections","492":"a blind juried competition for a plan for a 9 11 memorial at ground zero and the winner is named muhamad kahn waldman is a good story teller and what ensues in the book is gripping and very believable","493":"not bad a story about what would happen if a muslim architect were chosen to plan the memorial for the victims of 9 11 explores american prejudices does anyone outside the country doubt that americans can be full of them it was mildly interesting but not riveting nothing new really","494":"loved this book compelling story made my eye water at the end","495":"really thought provoking and engaging lots of different characters but the shifting perspectives didn't muddle the narrative an interesting look at how the press and one person's impulsive action can cause a media frenzy and how events can be blown out of proportion","496":"a design for a 9 11 memorial submitted by a secular muslim two years after the event is the magnet drawing together a chappaqua widow another widow an illegal from bangledesh the brother of a fallen firefighter a journalist on the make and a widening circle of family politicos and citizens this exploration of our current culture divided by tolerance as well as loyalties is fascinating reading","497":"thought provoking portrait of the hate and ugliness in post 9 11 amercia","498":"so fucking brilliant","499":" as a former journalist and also the mother of an architect i found the author's views of both journalism and architecture interesting and from my frame of reference fairly accurate for most of the book however i thought the characters were pretty flimsy and stereotypical and i kept wondering what's the point this reads like the latest trumped up controversy blown way out of proportion accurate but depressing and then i came to the end read while eating lunch at dairy queen and i found myself in tears chance encounters can change us and our prejudices can keep us from understanding what is before our eyes and sometimes we may spend the rest of our lives searching for what is just beyond our grasp","500":"this novel started out as a strong read but fell apart for me as the story went on there were too many unbelievable twists to the characters and it weakened the plot the ending felt rushed","501":"excellent she captured the perspectives of so many players although i listened to this book i wish i had read it because i wanted to highlight and dialogue with the characters i'd recommend this for a book group","502":"after the terrorist bombings of sept 11 2001 an committee was formed to create a memorial to those lost included on the panel was maya lin the architect who was responsible for the vietnam memorial created when she was 21 the irony of course is that ms lin is asian this book deals with what happens when an islamic submission is picked to commemorate 9 11 what does it mean to be an american some good one liners title deals with submission to crowd mentality submission to the will of allah submission to the arts panel","503":" waldman's debut is a confident hard hitting contribution to the fund of post 9 11 new york stories the submission imagines what would have happened had new yorkers chosen a 9 11 memorial design as soon as 2003 and - crucially - had the anonymous selection turned out to be by a muslim architect named mohammad khan khan's plan is considered placid and innocuous at least prior to the revelation of his identity his memorial garden is rich in possible meanings and influences with intersecting canals lending a pleasing geometric symmetry and cypress trees and metal tree sculptures playfully blurring the boundaries between the natural and the artificial when a member of the memorial selection jury leaks the information about the designer's name to the press however all hell breaks loose and perfectly nice reasonable people start to display some ugly bigotry as the clever double meaning of the title suggests waldman has educated herself about islam's doctrines and historical tenets she includes an impressive range of characters and opinions with good psychological explorations however mohammad and claire are not strong or deep enough to justify their place as central characters mohammad's 'conversion' experience in the garden in kabul doesn't ring true and i find it hard to buy the trajectory of claire's feelings about the design there is also to this reader's disappointment a slight sense of typecasting this is the compassionate family member this is the obstreperous family member this one's the politically correct liberal and so on the most memorable character is asma the bangladeshi illegal immigrant and unacknowledged 9 11 widow who steals the show at the hearing and later becomes a 'martyr' though not in the way islamophobes denigrate asma reminded me of the main character in monica ali's brick lane also a muslim housewife from bangladesh who begins to question her rights i don't much like the epilogue in which the filming of a new documentary provides a retrospective twenty years after the memorial - it doesn't seem a very sophisticated way of tidying up the loose ends a deus ex machina approach somewhat spoils what has heretofore been an excellent book keeping us in suspense about whether khan will withdraw his memorial entry is a good tactic but a two decade gap seems a bit extreme we are also meant to believe that mohammad and claire's differences are so intractable that they could only understand each other twenty years later through the interference of claire's son william the documentary's photographer apart from this inexpert handling of the memorial's legacy i think waldman's novel is a cracking debut she includes an impressive range of characters and opinions and makes canny psychological explorations only occasionally resorting to typecasting and stereotypes overall the novel employs a sensitive approach to the inflammatory issues of religion and tolerance in post 9 11 america her after the fact prescience if that's not an oxymoron works surprisingly well and like jennifer egan does at the end of a visit from the goon squad she has produced what seems an entirely plausible version of new york in the near future i look forward to whatever waldman comes out with next part of this review was included in my article on 9 11 reflections for bookkaholic","504":" in this fictional work a committee has been chosen to select the 9 11 memorial to be erected on ground zero in new york city when the committee reaches consensus on the design to be chosen everyone is stunned to discover that the artist responsible for the design is a muslim an american and also a muslim what follows is outrage hurt feelings betrayals and fighting to determine if they are to go forward with a design by a muslim or a different design it was a good book very topical and written before the controvery with the mosque being built near ground zero i did not like how it ended and was disappointed in how the author wrapped up the story i won't tell you the ending you'll have to read that for yourself","505":"this was a great book that really gets you thinking on how you would react in that situation the book is about a post 9 11 memorial the submissions are anonymous but as soon as the artist is revealed it all goes downhill i liked and felt very strong feelings towards the characters highly loved some and hated others overall this was a great read","506":"so spot on it could have been nonfiction author demonstrates a keen understanding of human behavior avoids making caricatures of her characters which would have been easy to do","507":"the submission starts with a jury selecting a memorial for the victims of 9 11 two years after the attacks all the designs are anonymous and after fierce deliberations they decide that a garden would be the best memorial the designer's name learnt mohammad khan mo to his friends this opens debate into islam what art is and grief the story focuses on the aftermath of mohammad khan's win and tells the story in 3rd person focusing on different characters the 3 main characters are claire a widow who was the biggest supporter of the garden design until it starts to throw up opposition from other people who lost loved ones in the attack and is hounded by journalists asma a bangladeshi illegal immigrant who is also a widow but also the mother of a child born on american soil lastly mo the winner who is isolated and caught up in the debate despite no strong feelings towards islam and being a born and bred american i found these three characters the best developed the raw emotions of both widows was very well captured and i really felt for mo the other characters whose stories we learn just do not feel so well developed and feel quite flat at times but they all had important parts to play in the story and i suppose waldman felt she could not write the story without giving us their backgrounds thoughts and fears i liked the book it was thought provoking well written and very easy to get into waldman captured a tragedy bringing america together but also bringing out the best and worst in people it is written quite well and the subject area handled with care","508":" the title and plot description suggest a balanced approach to the position and treatment of muslims and perception of islam in america after 9 11 yet the story is centered on the american view of islam and the islamic community in america shallowly circling the affair of the 'memorial' and largely neglecting the wrongful conflict and misrepresentation of islam as a sponsor for terrorism which can't be more wrong as it is shockingly all muslims in the book were portrayed as muslims only by name birth and none of them even the lead character is a practicing muslim so how can you present islam to the non muslim reader using such characters the book never touched the true concepts of islam a very shallow story not well researched and i can't see the point behind the plot what is it trying to say that after 9 11 americans were mostly united in their view of islam as a synonym to terror a fact well known maybe another book looking into what brought the attacks and american foreign policies would enlighten common people to the true reasons behind 9 11 rather than generalizing and falsely claiming the islam is a religion of terrormim","509":"3 5 stars to be more exact","510":"read for lj book club interesting idea that dragged on a bit the ending was a little too put together but it made me cry anyway","511":"it is a good book which contributes to the debate about how muslims in america are publicly presented i love asmaa the most because she was able to articulate her views even though she never went to elite schools like mo's case","512":"good book for a book club","513":"book that was picked by the one book one lincoln it is about the 9 11 memorial and what would have happened if a muslin had been selected as the winning designer the ending kind of ties things together but i didn't think it was very well written plus it jumped between different characters and i wish there had been more of an emphasis on just one","514":" i finished reading this book a couple of days ago but wanted to take some time to think about it if you assign ratings to books based on the emotions it elicits then this book should definitely be assigned 5 stars the story takes place in manhattan a couple of years after the terrorist attacks on 9 11 2001 a panel is charged with choosing a memorial from the plans which had been submitted this process was a blind process no names or backgrounds were given to the jury beforehand the memorial which was chosen was that of a beautiful garden all hell breaks loose when it is discovered that the architect who designed the memorial garden is an american muslim if you have any knowledge of american history or even of human nature i don't need to recap the rest of this story things unfold just as you probably imagine they would this book beautifully constructed by amy waldman evoked very strong emotions in me anger sadness frustration compassion and dispiritedness but mostly anger this story epitomized a couple of things to me when terrible events tragedies occur we can use them as a tool for learning to increase our acceptance and even tolerance of other human beings instead what often happens is that we are unable to resist that human need to put people in a box to categorize them this categorizing does not allow us to see beyond our prejudices and bigotry i am a white woman of european ancestry born in pennsylvania a mother wife daughter friend college educated i could continue on labeling myself but at the end all of these labels tell you very little about who i am and what kind of person i am and what is in my heart reading this story the submission encouraged me to think really think about the times i try to label others without really knowing who they are the submission also left me thinking about an old adage which tends to get overused 'time heals all wounds' i believe this story clearly demonstrates that time actually heals nothing and fundamentally changes nothing sure tempers and emotions cool and passions wane but it was clear in ms waldman's story that because no one ever seemed to have the courage to get underneath the fear hatred and bigotry the country just put aside those feelings for another day and until another tragedy this book told a story which seemed like it could have actually happened it didn't but it was clear that ms waldman possesses a deep understanding of human nature and our seeming incomprehensible need to repeat history over and over again i can't say i loved reading this book it actually left me emotionally depleted but with just a sliver of hope in all its uncomfortableness it really was a story worth reading","515":" the premise is so intriguing what would happen if a nation wide contest to design the 9 11 memorial was held and the blind judging panel picked a muslim winner spoilers ahoy ahoyamy waldman's story unravels realistically the media churns out drivel and instigates more controversy the panel collapse into themselves with over thinking and uber pc dialogue the winner broods and employs lawyers to get a fair shake at the prestige of honoring those that were killed the racists rally the liberals worry it's a very complicated affair so you'd think the book would be more interesting to me right i wonder if i would have thought differently had i skipped the author's biography she's a well seasoned reporter but for me the writing was as flat as a newscast the characters were mostly stereotypes we maintained a comfortable surface level with them her brow was furrowed like rain on glass he stewed in his kitchen in a red robe that sort of thing and i just wanted to get into the brains of some of the key characters and talk about the complex feelings they experienced instead of what shoes they chose to wear i should disclose here that i was in the minority of our book group most of us liked it praised it got behind the characters and seriously connected to one side or other of the causes i did not i felt like the pov should have focused on three characters claire the winner and the edit bangladeshi immigrant that way the repercussions of the events would have hit home harder i feel like whoever gave the author the advice 'writing is reporting with adjectives' because that's very much how i felt it was written should have expounded a little further amy waldman has talent for writing don't let what i wrote here make you think otherwise i'm just going to give her a few books before i try her again","516":"i enjoyed this book the story and most of the characters were a bit stereotypical but it has several interesting themes within it most notably the role of art in society artistic inspiration and muslim dissimilation assimiliation and identity in the us i seemed like perhaps it could have stayed longer in the oven and been a little bit tastier","517":"a book that deserves the label powerful this complex tale will definitely make you think set in 2003 with memories of 9 11 still fresh the author asks what if the anonymous competition to design the memorial was won by a muslim architect with that premise she sets in motion a series of events that shine a light on what it means to be american to be muslim weaving a tale of tolerance and xenophobia class tension and the nature of grief the author writes from many points of view but the 2 main narrators are that of the winning architect mohammed mo khan an indian american who was born and raised in the u s and claire burwell a 9 11 widow who is representing the families on the memorial jury she starts out as khan's champion loving his design of a walled garden but comes to doubt him and is unable to trust him the uproar over the blind choice of a muslim architect sets off an avalanche of protest which seems very realistic we remember the uproar over just building a mosque near the site and we meet actors on both sides surviving family members who cannot accept that a muslim would design their memorial and those that preach tolerance practically every character has multiple layers to peel back and each one is fascinating in his her complexity the only who seemed to one dimensional was the unethical anti islam journalist which is interesting considering that was waldman's former profession highly recommended","518":"loved this book about what happens when the winner of an anonymous competition to design a memorial for 9 11 turns out to be muslim highly recommend","519":"a part of me couldn't wait to be done with this book an upsetting topic and none of the characters are likable enough you start to like one of the characters but then they do something that turns you away except for asma and things don't end well for her it really documents how awful people can be i wouldn't recommend this book but i think it will be a great discussion at our bookclub","520":"a compelling idea agree with other reviewers too much back and forth and lack of focus i was looking for more and honestly couldn't finish it after three attempts","521":" the theme of submission is important in this book every character is unlikable except maybe asma because of their pride and lack of willingness to submit to anyone's ideals but their own asma begins in a position of submission and then moves into a place of pride though her pride as opposed to most of the others' seems deserved and appropriate random sexualization appears in the book and seems to have no real reason to move the plot forward one might argue that the author was including the idea of making the subject of sexual objectification another part of the overall submission theme but i don't give the author that much credit every time the journalist appears in the story it seems non sequitur it would appear that the author a journalist could not bear to use journalism as a medium to advance the plot without also including a journalist it was unfortunate overall i was engaged enough to read the book to the end but it isn't one that i would highly recommend to others","522":"this book will test you","523":"very interesting premise although i really liked this novel i found it didn't hold my attention as much toward the end lots of great discussion topics but not a 5 star novel to me","524":"what if the 9 11 memorial had been designed by a muslim what would the repercussions be mo hammed kahn finds out when he enters his design into the anonymous contest","525":"i'm really glad i read this it was both thought provoking and conversation relevant","526":"i first read an excerpt from this book in the atlantic and am glad i decided to read the whole novel this story of how a muslim american wins an anonymous contest to design the 911 memorial in manhattan addresses a lot of the post 911 politics prejudices and cultural conflicts that are still an issue today","527":"this review has been hidden because it contains spoilers to view it click here so i was really excited to read this book because osu had it as the read for their freshman last year my nonreader leila never read it and hey i would love to go back to school and get a library degree and tmi anyway the book it was good a solid good but seemed to ramble around page 200 and not pick back up until the last two chapters i felt it was real life and the group would not have picked a muslim after 9 11 so that was real but it raised a lot of other issues regarding what it is so i was really excited to read this book because osu had it as the read for their freshman last year my nonreader leila never read it and hey i would love to go back to school and get a library degree and tmi anyway the book it was good a solid good but seemed to ramble around page 200 and not pick back up until the last two chapters i felt it was real life and the group would not have picked a muslim after 9 11 so that was real but it raised a lot of other issues regarding what it is to be an american and how much it means to some and in different ways would make a great book club read more","528":"very interesting story about what happens when a muslim architect's design is chosen in an anonymous competition for a 9 11 memorial the beginning and ending of the book were very good but the middle dragged a bit","529":"i read the synopsis and i assumed the controversy this story would cause and there was plenty of that it wasn't earth moving but a well developed story line i was surprised at the outcome","530":"this is a book for our times in articulte and engaging language it skillfully examines our biases both societal and individual and those we are aware of as well as our unconscious biases in a time of polarization it feels good to read a book with nuances and no clear answers this is a page turner that makes you think","531":"i enjoyed this thought provoking book very very much a very believable cast of characters who were unafraid to show us their darkest and most unflattering sides this would make a fabulous read for a bookclub or other discussion group","532":"this book would be a decent beach read anonymous contest to design a 9 11 memorial results in a very secular muslim winning the nation goes bananas gimmicky plot but entertaining enough to finish predictable caricatures all around writing is pretty bad","533":"i read this book two years ago and it stays with me it poses the question what if the designer of the ground zero memorial were a muslim how would america handle that every character from a diverse range of communities is authentic compelling and sympathetic i kept wondering how waldman could pull off all these points of view if i were developing a reading list for a junior or senior american lit class this would be a must read it feels like it should be part of the canon","534":"incredibly well written and very thought provoking tough subject matter","535":"this book was such a letdown the only reason it got two stars was because of the ending everything leading up to the ending was just boring and wishy washy","536":"this book was extremely thought provoking and more interesting than i'd expected i recommend it","537":"4 0 good stuff brilliant premise a muslim wins a blind competition for 9 11 memorial largely due to widow's supporti give her so much credit for coming up with the premise i just thought it was brilliant and when i heard just that much about this novel i knew i had to read it even though it was reviewed by maureen corrigan who i really have trouble listening to let alone taking book advice from i enjoy her characters and the struggles they go through though i think claire vacillated a bit too frequently and widely to be believed it served the plot well i recommend reading it i thought the plot stagnated for a bit and we turned in small circles after all of the initial fallout public protests violence threats etc has occurred we're just kind of waiting for something to actually happen someone to make a decision or declaration in the mean time we just keep visiting each of the principal characters and check in on them while the memorial competition is in limbo this was probably deliberate as it was frustrating to read the characters certainly felt a similar frustration i just wonder if there could've been a slightly more enjoyable to read way to convey this the only other real criticism was the way she chose to close the novel view spoiler i've taken the let's fast forward 30 years and learn how it all turns out approach in my writing before and it felt a bit of a cop out but as my wife points out it's kind of like the end of a movie where we get a 3 sentence update on the main characters' lives in front of snapshots of them in their foolish youth but we agree that seems to work better in movies than writing for some reason hide spoiler i didn't have a problem with the actual outcome just the way we learn of the final decision i think the only typo ish errors i found here were probably specific to the ebook edition lots of double spaces between words for some reason seem to see that a lot in some books i wonder if it has anything to do with hyphenated line breaks in the original text","538":"fantastic very stimulating and written beautifully","539":"excellently written on the nose and important for our time however i didn't really enjoy the book that's probably more a statement on my remaining feelings about 9 11 and how america has reacted to it than the book itself","540":" the premise of this book is a good one it's two years after 9 11 and a jury has been tasked with picking a memorial from a public competition the jury unknowingly picks a submission from a muslim and chaos ensues the book has a lot of good insights and thoughts about america's poor treatment of that culture after the attack our arrogance afterward the attack made everyone afraid of appearing unpatriotic of questioning government leaders fear has justified war torture secrecy all kinds of violations of rights and liberties and america is still paying that price however the book itself failed to deliver anything but annoyance the characters even the ones you should've been rooting for were all so unlikeable and those are the ones you remembered the character development was just awful in general which made the book no fun to read i do not recommend","541":" this novel was one of npr's ten best novels of 2011 the plot centers around the competition for a 9 11 memorial in new york with a jury that selects in a blind process the work of an american muslim i was lukewarm throughout my reading of this novel and my take on it did not improve after our mbg discussion the author is a journalist and i suspect that she may be a better journalist than a novelist the opening premise a jury is in the process of making its pick is promising but ultimately the characters all feel very two dimensional this novel had potential especially in its portrayal of the architect who was selected this character struggled with his identity and the theme of creating one's identity could have been better explored i just did not care about any of the characters and there was little humor throughout basically this was a good idea for a plot but didn't pull it off type of novel","542":"it gives the same window into contemporary manhattan that 'bonfire of the vanities' did she's not quite wolfe","543":"fascinating very compelling exploration of some fairly uncomfortable issues for america the writing is occasionally overblown but generally works well the characters are mostly flawed but in ways that make them human and as compelling as they are frustrating easy to read hard to put away","544":" so many thoughts about this one on one hand it's a great book i was invested in what happened but at the same time the topic is almost too current and too raw waldman did a wonderful job of presenting many different perspectives and opinions believably there were a few that seemed as if they were caricatures just too over the top but at the same time it's possible i just hope people like that don't exist my copy is filled with notes and underlined passages a fantastic book for discussion","545":"so well done each character's motivations are so well developed each of them is right and wrong at the same time the double meaning of the title is not lost","546":"i will be honest this book set me thinking what would i do if i were in the panel when the designer's name was chosen honestly there is no correct or wrong thing to do sometimes i think the book dragged on it brought to life different people who call new york home the mix that makes it a true melting pot i liked the book and an interesting read","547":"lots to chew on should make for some good discussion","548":" this was a hard book to get through for some reason not easy reading like lighter minded writings i was not disappointed in the ending as i thought i would be but it was a little while before i realized what had happened and how the conflict had been resolved i think what i like best about this book is the title i started reading this book as an homage to the victims of the original 911 the attacks and murders of our navy seals and ambassador this 9 11 12 made me even more determined however i think i will remember this book more because of its symbolism in all of our lives and the concessions we make for the greater good these decisions aren't always appreciated by those for whom the sacrifices have been made nor are they even necessarily the best resolution to our own conflicts they are just the best we know to do and often we spend the rest of our lives wondering if it was the right thing i'm glad i read it","549":" this book probably deserves a 3 5 star rating but i just couldn't give it 4 stars it is an interesting premise a competition to design a memorial for the 9 11 victims is won by a muslim architect and the book delves into a lot of interesting and difficult emotions regarding patriotism religion u0026amp grief unfortunately for me the book was a bit less effective due to the lack of sympathy i felt for most of the characters given the emotional topics of the book you would think the characters would inspire deep emotions but they all seemed strangely cold and distant to this reader the only character i had a strong emotional reaction to was the reporter i found her to be despicable and loathsome on a more positive note as someone who works in an architecture firm most of the info about architects architectural firms and design competitions seemed to be right on","550":" this is a book that will stay with me as i mature i feel often like the character claire a little confused about my convictions less and less black and white and more and more gray areas the book had a confusing ending and not quite what i expected the author at times wrote very well and then had some very extreme characters both left and right they were 2 dimensional and had very few salvageable character traits it made me very uncomfortable when there were disrespectful items about the families they were made to seem so shallow at times the main character of the submission was so hard to like like i said the book bought about a multitude of feelings in me and it will saty with me for a long while","551":"brilliantly thought provoking this novel plays with the concept of religion race identity and nationality","552":" the submission is an expertly written fictional look into the political animosities ripe in the u s during the first decade of the 21st century written but not published before the 45 park place community center was proposed in a location close to ground zero it predicts such an event and some of its consequences an architect born and raised in the midwest wins a blind design competition for a garden to be built at the world trade center site the garden in the design is beautiful luscious and unique with space for mourners and visitors to wander and meditate the only difficulty the designer's first name happens to be mohammed as the selection board defers failing to officially announce the winner the public gets up to speed due to a rather sensational media leak the country is soon divided between those supporting the building of the garden for aesthetic and moral reasons and those who claim it is inappropriate distasteful or even wrong the dialogue is sharp detailed very american and all too familiar the novel is by turns touching and chilling with twists that pull at the soul and consciousness of the reader this essential work by amy waldman could largely stand as an accurate fictional testament of post 9 11 public discourse what i like about waldman is her ability to play up the moral and ethical edges within her own work kahn the winning architect is not portrayed as a noble victim of a fearful and prejudiced nation he is single flawed unreligious but unwilling to play down his thin muslim roots in a public charade of good will nor is the public painted with the faceless bipolarity with which the media often treats it she draws a solid cast of characters from wearily impartial board members to talk show hosts from the wife of a 9 11 victim in support of kahn's garden to a young conservative idealist who rips the burka from a stranger's head claiming to liberate her by doing so behind the narrative seems to flow a somber critique of both the country's bipolarity and the growing inability of u s citizenry via the media or its own wits to assess public realities on valid terms","553":" wow two years after 9 11 a jury holds an anonymous contest to choose a design for a memorial at ground zero and the winner of the anonymous contest is muslim american that's when all hell breaks loose i didn't expect to like this book as much as i did the author is a journalist and she writes fiction just like every journalist turned novelist writes it slightly too clinical in her descriptions too involved in her characterizations without necessarily exposing the emotional meat of the characters and on top of that i have a pretty low threshold for how much september 11th iraq war fiction i can consume without simultaneously wanting to puke cry and punch someone in the face but all that said i think this is one of the rare exceptions to the over exposed opportunistic and ideology pushing genre of 9 11 fiction waldman does a really really good job of giving equal stage time to a surprisingly wide spectrum of viewpoints that's what's the best thing about this book depending on the chapter i found myself sometimes commiserating with one viewpoint or another i won't spoil anything but i was sometimes surprised at how much i was able to sympathize with viewpoints that i would've found abhorrent going into the book there are of course rampant examples of bigotry and insensitivity in the book xenophobia islamophobia sexism and general pig headedness galore you've been warned this is the kind of book that is written to win awards but almost obnoxiously it still manages to be relatively devoid of pretension overall this is a good book if you're prepared for a thought piece that will make you feel at times like you are looking at an unflattering portrait of yourself","554":"enjoyed this","555":" the premise is intriguing what would happen if the anonymous designer of a 9 11 memorial turned out to be islamic bitter debate and violence ensue i was hoping for more than the usual viewpoints angry right wingers pushover lefties and a few ambivalents caught in the middle although i'm not sure who else the author could have thought up maybe i just wasn't all that enchanted by any of the characters and i didn't find the writing style to be particularly special i learned a little about islamic and pre islamic architecture and i did find the ending to be enjoyable and satisfying","556":"i thoroughly enjoyed this novel and couldn't wait to see how it ended","557":"what if the winner of the contest to redesign the new world trade center had been a muslim this book brings up some interesting ideas about 9 11 and what it did to our collective psyche the plot follows the contest from several characters standpoints the widow who sits on the committee and pushed for the anonymous winning design the brother of a firefigher who died the illegal immigrant muslim wife of an illegal immigrant worker who died and the winning architect an interesting premise","558":"interesting premise but some of the attempts at being literary fiction often fall flat on their face","559":"liked it i wouldn't have imagined the outcome the same way but once the author started the characters down their respective paths it was interesting to see where she took them","560":" although i was once a new yorker and had family members on the scene of 9 11 in ny and dc all thankfully safe i am not a 9 11 obsessive or fanatic both my former hometowns were terrorized and i all i got was two wars the patriot act and this lousy t shirt like a low key take on bonfire of the vanities heavy on compassion and easy on the sarcasm waldman's wonderful what if tale what if a muslim won the 9 11 memorial competition successfully explicates a kaleidiscope of viewpoints try saying that fast three times the upper crust wasp widow of a humanistic cantor fitzgerald like financial trader the lowlife brother of a dead firefighter who straightens up and becomes a muslim baiting archie bunker like spokesman the bloviating governor the inscrutable assimilated architect mohammed mo khan in his heart about as muslim as i am and my favorite character the wounded but also wounding tabloid reporter a fading blonde whose interview questions are like waterboarding for her even more fragile subjects i picked up the book because i heard it was an accurate description of the world of architects and in particular design competitions areas i have covered as a journalist waldman spot on captures this mileau her evocative description of the fantasy memorial the book is indeed pure fiction and the real memorial has since been built provides an excellent example of writing about landscape design waldman skillfully handles her ensemble cast in a way that recalls the wire or hill street blues or perhaps an altman film like the player or nashville her writing is is slick and cinematic fast paced and pulpy but not trashy if that's possible in pacing and description and pithy dialogue she's got a wonderful eye for small telling detail i would not be surprised to see the submission optioned for big screen or hbo addendum i visited the 9 11 memorial on august 12 2012 i guess i was not reading the reviews close enough but was disappointed to learn this is a private ticketed space not only do you have to cough up $15 but wait in an endless line in the broiling sun and then irony of ironies go through airport security to ensure you are not a terrorist out to implode a huge granite memorial to take nothing away from the heroism displayed on 9 11 i am not comfortable with the canonization of new york's finest and the resulting sanctioned police state that said it was worth it the monumental memorial is extremely moving i particularly enjoyed the ambiguity of the statement the peaceful feeling elicited by the massive downward fountain draining into the infinity of the earth it works for families it works for new york and memorialization and it also works for mild 9 11 skeptics like myself who see the efforts of the past 11 years as vast resources and perhaps the last of our personal freedoms going down the drain or perhaps it is the remnants of our economy being drained by triumphant wall street still ascendant all around on the other hand the freedom tower is just another banal glassy high rise and the financial district with the occupy ers vanquished from zuccotti park to a thin sidewalk outside trinity church as soul less as ever a good friend lost his brother in 9 11 he worked for a financial company high in the wtc i never met him and was pleased to be able to look him up and visit his inscribed name again this is a memorial that works on numerous levels","561":"the submission weaves together the unique perspectives of several people who are all involved or affected by the selection process of a 9 11 memorial things get especially complicated when the winner is selected and the committee learns that the designer is an american muslim i thought the author was quite skilled at presenting the viewpoints of completely different types of people the book also had a few twists that i was not expecting and i enjoyed the ending getting to see how some of the characters ended up many years in the future would recommend to others","562":"great thought provoking book i liked waldman's writing style as it suited the subject matter post 9 11 competition for ny site","563":" this was such an interesting premise that was surprisingly well constructed the characters were thoughtful and interesting and the prose was actually quite beautiful and evocative i hadn't expected this from a first time novelist and former journalist anyway many sides of the situation to look at which causes the reader to examine his or her own prejudices just how deep does your openness and understanding go i found myself changing my mind about these characters often and the book did not end exactly as i thought it would but it made perfect sense to me","564":"i really liked this book and the depth of each character there were so many perspectives in this book people with their own ideas each valid in their own way but all so very different sometimes it doesn't matter how hard you try to bring people together you cannot get all of their pieces to fit life is complicated and there are no simple answers definitely a book worth reading","565":"beautifully written incredibly engaging","566":"though the book is very heavy and the writing dense i did enjoy reading it the ending is particularly creative for fiction","567":" i thought this was very well written and explores a very important topic the 9 11 attacks on new york city and our country's subsequent response to islam we were not all that pro on the subject before the attacks but the venom has ramped up considerably since then and this book's story line works through someoof those prejudices the books centers on the planned memorial for the world trade center sight a committee has been formed it has representation from the artistic community and there is a family survivor of the 9 11 attacks when it is discovered that an american muslim of indian background is the architect of the chosen design intense controversy ensues it is well written well played out and depressingly real not to mention that it allows one to explore your personal reaction in the privacy of your own reading world","568":" although it never calls out the world trade center bombings by name the story takes place in new york city following a terrorist attack on buildings in which many died the title refers to an entry in a contest for architects to design a memorial for the grounds where the buildings had stood when the committee - made up of prominent citizens artists and a representative of \"the families\" who had lost someone in the attacks - votes on the winner the garden is chosen but when the winner's name is revealed the contest entries were submitted anonymously for the purposes of the contest the architect mohammad khan - a muslim is found to be the author of the winning design what ensues is chaos for the architect for the contest's jury for the families of the dead for muslims in america for the city of new york and in many ways for the country this is the author's first novel but there is nothing shaky or immature about her writing and she does a beautiful job of weaving the stories to create a tapestry of the confusing conflicting and painful issues america faces in the aftermath of the 9 11 attacks i was slightly disappointed by one point of the conclusion which i'll keep to myself lest i be a spoiler but overall this is a very good book dealing with an important and overwhelming issue what does it mean to be an american","569":" very intelligent and thought provoking debut novel makes you question what are or should be the limits of tolerance and democracy how far would you fight for a principle without faltering the characters start a bit flat and typical to better set the confrontations but as the book progresses no one stays the same all characters reveal something not so nice all of them reveal things about themselves that they may not like as the reader does as well i liked that it doesn't give a neat resolution and found the detail at the end incredibly touching definitely recommended","570":"it was an interesting read but i felt like a dead horse was beaten a few too many times","571":"i would prefer to give this a 3 5 stars what i liked most about this story is the empathy and the repugnance i felt towards the different characters perhaps it is because i am old enough to remember the day the towers fell and remember the temperment of the country in the following years i was really hoping for a happy ending and i didn't feel like it was it almost felt like a settlement where no one really ended up happy but only found a bittersweet peace among themselves is that so unlike how life ended up for a lot people relating to 9 11 only they can answer that question","572":"sometimes the writing wasn't stellar but all in all this was a thought provoking and well done book challenging our beliefs about ourselves and others","573":" this book was messy and not in the artsy literary way that wraps everything chaotic into a compact box and tied with an authorial bow the novel grabbed a controversial and emotionally raw subject as its topic but sputtered in its presentation and organization of ideas and plot however i 3 star liked this novel despite my initial wariness before i even picked up this book i knew that i would be angry reading it and i was right i was angry but for a slightly different reason that was actually surprisingly refreshing what i enjoyed most about this novel were its characters it wasn't because they had a lot of depth which they didn't and it wasn't because they represented something profound which they also didn't as a reader i love a novel's characters the most i love to read the characters really read them and from there construct my reading of the rest of the novel around them the characters in the submission were hard to read because they were downright frustrating and after a while i stopped trying to read them but then about halfway through the novel i realized that the beauty in the characters was precisely in the very messy way in which they were displayed the story is told from a pretty omniscient third person perspective and the novel has a wide range of characters that all have their turns in the spotlight waldman allows readers to peer into all of the characters' frustrating thoughts emotions and motives however despite this pretty omniscient third person perspective i was left feeling pretty confused about the characters' thoughts emotions and motives anyway i struggled with this for a while but then i realized 1 the frustrating characters lend the rest of the novel its aggravating arrangement but the whole point of the novel is that the entire situation that drives the plot is exactly that maddening this makes other characters hard to read and understand and this happens in real life 2 the characters are hard to understand because they don't even understand themselves this was the icing on the cake for me while reading i don't know if waldman did it on purpose but i thought it was a stroke of genius how all of the characters without fail baffled me to no end even though i was afforded the most intimate look into everyone's thoughts at the same time that they were frustrating the characters were also strangely familiar in them readers are given the chance to recognize the totally human irrationality that sometimes overcomes everyone that part was great what i disliked most about the novel was the ending when the footage of the garden was being shown it seemed that waldman was trying to collapse a lot of meaning into the last 5 10 pages and it also felt like she was trying to wrap up a lot of points and themes but it was horrendously messy in large part because those points and themes were never very strong throughout the rest of the novel before the ending this resulted in a conclusion that felt very forced and superficial kind of like how in college writing classes the professors always insist that the thesis should be strong and present throughout every part of your essay and the conclusion should always be the summation of what you've already built in your writing waldman's ending kind of punched me in the face it was that unexpected because what ran through my mind was ohhh that was what she was trying to get at but why didn't she say so before overall it was a fast read i admittedly was very curious to know what would happen next and so kept flipping the pages at a lightning fast speed though having the large print version probably had something to do with that i wouldn't recommend it to others but i did get some pleasure out of it","574":"bonfire of the vanities with heart extraordinary feel for the politics and emotions in nyc after 9 11","575":"interesting book on a fictional contest to build the memorial to 9 11 reads in a similar fashion to one of my all time favorite books bonfire of the vanities different points of view of a post 9 11 new york city the ending takes an emotional turn i wasn't quite prepared for the wallop","576":"while ms waldman still needs to work on writing dialogue it seems stilted at times i really appreciated this book it is hard to say i enjoyed it because there are few uplifting moments but her premise is a compelling one what if in a blind competition to choose a 9 11 memorial a muslim american won prejudices of all kinds are interwoven throughout this powerful story of ambition and compassion fairness and sensitivity many of the characters live down to my expectations of them sadly and i do not think the author is too far off the mark with most of her characterizations the underlying discussion of public memorials aesthetics artistic influences and audience is a fascinating one that kept me going through the novel","577":"ok after being encouraged by a book club member i persevered to the end after i accepted that i didn't like the characters and this was not going to be a feel good book i appreciated the varied and discordant voices in the story and the last chapter is powerful i think it will make for a great discussion","578":"in a blind competition a muslim wins the contest for designing a permanent memorial for those who died in a 9 11 type terror attack although the winner of the competition is entirely secular and american there is a public outcry against him and his design definitely a good read and entirely believable but not a wow for me","579":"it seems people either really love or really hate this book regardless of the rating people give this book waldman raises so many questions that require self reflection and empathy that reading it would not be a waste of time for anyone i loved it and am slightly disturbed by how torn i am over so many of the issues presented","580":" the submission has an interesting premise but i felt it was underdeveloped and the characters under examined i wish the characters had become more than mere caricatures the author is a journalist and it shows i think this book works well as a jumping off point for discussion it is the 2013 selection for the kalamazoo public library's reading together program the kpl has several events planned in the next few months and book clubs all over town are reading and discussing for this i think the submission is perfect my book club held its discussion today and the discussion was wonderful just wish the book deserved it","581":"a rather insightful story depicting a hypothetical nationwide contest to design a memorial to commemorate loved ones lost on 9 11 and its aftermath the final submission selected belongs to none other than mo khan a muslim of course after discovering that a muslim man has designed the winning selection the selecting jury comes across difficulties revealing the design to the public for fear of gaining enough funds avid supporter of the garden khan's design claire who lost her husband and is the sole representative of the hundreds of families who lost family on the jury a majority of the plot progresses with her internal conflicts as she tries to find an appropriate outcome beneficial to not just her own fatherless children but to all the other families who lost loved ones ms waldman does a superb job plotting out the scenario via perspectives of different people involved with the memorial those on the jury commissioned to select the winning design a vehement journalist desiring fame in the world of publications an illegal alien whose husband died in the tragedy and the controversial architect himself by switching back and forth among each individual's story and how they relate to the overall situation the different spindles eventually weave together in the end this helped to keep the story interesting to keep the reader informed of what was going on at different points of the process i feel that the submission was very appropriately named as it serves multiple purposes throughout the book as i continued to read one can take the literal meaning khan's design submission or the more conflicting underlying meanings should the public submit to their own fears and allow the building of the garden should khan submit to the public and withdraw his submission from the contest the islamic element should also be considered the submission to their god allah and among other possible intentions waldman may have had with naming her novel so the submission was indeed a great read and opens up people to considering those who a majority may or may not consider one of themselves it gives perspective to defining what an american is and what makes something american after the attacks the nation went through a bout of islamophobia and this book certainly portrays such this book gets 4 stars from me because i enjoyed the ironic situation of a muslim winner for a memorial to help relieve victims after a muslim extremist attack somewhat like maya lin designing the vietnam veterans memorial which was referenced in the book yay and as always books with multiple conflicting cultural identities usually lure me in easily","582":" i loved this book because it really delved into an issue that is difficult and close to my heart i thought it was sesitive to the wide range of feelings associated with the 9 11 tragedy i loved the style of writing in some places almost poetic while dealing with such strong opinions it challenged me by making me ask myself some tough questions and looking beyond my normal surface reactions to people of faith and the ideas of patriotism i love when a book makes me really think and this one will have me doing so for a long time","583":"waldman did a wonderful job with this novel and the story is told from all sides i think the title has two meanings read it and see for yourself","584":"best thing i've read in awhile maybe a 4 1 2 or 4 3 4s but i felt like rounding up the characters are so believable and multi faceted","585":" what happens when the 9 11 memorial is created by a muslim that's the premise of the submission all sides are represented the rich families the poor families the first responder families the muslim the christian the artisit judge the lawyer the crazy anti islamist and best of all each character has validity i would have considered this story over the top this would never happen in the most cosmopolitan city in the world except i remember the screaming accusations over the mosque at ground zero last summer well worth the read","586":"a decent read agree with other reviews that character development is lacking","587":"really 41 2 stars","588":"will be an interesting bookclub discussion loved the ending","589":"i had to struggle through to the end found the presentations of arguments repetitive","590":"waldman does a good job of making the characters multifaceted and presenting multiple points of view","591":"i really liked the theme of this book it would make a terrific read for a book club","592":"thought provoking book started kind of slow but picked up too many loose ends for my taste in the end but definitely gave food for thought","593":"this review has been hidden because it contains spoilers to view it click here i liked this book but i really loved the idea of it and feel awkward giving it a 3 star review when i think it was really a 5 star idea i think it is an important book with important albeit redundant messages i wanted to get to know the characters better especially claire and mo i was frustrated by claire's change of heart as well as mo opting to clam up on principle i wish these two things in particular would have been explored further there were other unanswered questions for me as wel i liked this book but i really loved the idea of it and feel awkward giving it a 3 star review when i think it was really a 5 star idea i think it is an important book with important albeit redundant messages i wanted to get to know the characters better especially claire and mo i was frustrated by claire's change of heart as well as mo opting to clam up on principle i wish these two things in particular would have been explored further there were other unanswered questions for me as well and the timing of this book hitting stores was not lost on me but again i think it was an important story to be told and i truly appreciated the many perspectives and viewpoints of the different characters a challenging topic and ambitious book spoiler below i did like the fact that the garden was constructed at the end and i expected it to be in mo's backyard more","594":"really enjoyed this book and its look at how we as america deal with sensitive issues of race immigration and religion it pointed out flaws in liberal and conservative approaches while showing that we are all human and struggle with these thoughts","595":"fantastic book beautifully written and thought provoking","596":"this book was thought provoking and beautifully written the ending brought the story full circle this book would be good for a book club discussion","597":"i am in the middle of the submission right now it is very compelling and evokes a very dark time in new york city it is almost as if a little over a decade has not gone by this book explores anti muslim sentiment at a time when those feelings were rampant and mired with patriotism and how the two were almost mutually exclusive the book is not a quick read but nonetheless it is very compelling","598":"even in the business world racism hinders the best man for the job smh","599":" i read this book because it was on npr i was dissapointed overall i'm not a political news watching person but i thought the situation in the book sounded interesting i loved her writing i believe she is a very talented writer it was completely beautiful but the use if the f word completely turned it ugly i know that's how people talk in real life and i know that the situation warrented it but it made the writing ugly next i didn't like the ending why can't somebody take a stand and stay with it especially in a setting like this through the whole book i couldn't decide what character i wanted to root for but nobody deserved it claire couldn't make up her mind after the media practically changed her mind for her and mo wasn't that great of a guy in the first place characters with a smaller part did a better job then these two this book did portray the media in a true form though since when is it okay to let the media newspapers in this case tell us who we are and what we should stand for claire certainly let the media change who she was","600":"thought provoking sitting there in my brain still","601":"good characters but the plot became too extreme for me it's hard to make fiction from such a sensitive historical and major event as 9 11 even focusing as the author did only on the memorial the book does evoke questions however do non muslims still see muslims even american muslims as the other","602":" this novel is immediately engrossing and the different perspectives thoughtful the mo laila plot is a little contrived but i think that's because laila is a broadly drawn character which made her hard to know i kept getting sidelined by the changes walderman makes from actual events this is nyc in the aftermath of 9 11 and everything is recognizable except for the memorial and the politicians the governor is someone named bittman instead of guiliani nyc has a nameless and liberal mayor the president is never named and barely referenced i could get behind a parallel universe story or even one outside of politics but a book about cultural changes that sidesteps the actual politicians who dictated them seems a bit cowardly 9 11 is already dramatic making slight changes doesn't create drama it distracts from it maybe it's because i finished it today but i don't know what it adds to the discussion","603":"the submission takes the reader back to the time following the terrorist attacks on september 11 and imagines the events that might unfold if the anonymously submitted design of a muslim was selected in a juried competition for a memorial to the victims of that attack in so doing the author is able to present in a kind of greek chorus fashion the kaleidoscope of perspectives emotions and agendas that colored that time i thought the author was able to convey the core of many characters with just a few deft sentences or images the previously rudderless survivor given new purpose in the immediate wake of the attacks angry when the intensity of that time fades the parents who lose a son but not the one they are disappointed in the suddenly single mother trying to assuage her children's pain when she has little left to give the opportunistic politicians and ruthless journalists the muslim community in america and so on the book moves quickly it reminded me that it can sometimes be difficult to stand firm in one's beliefs when challenged by a tragedy of the magnitude of the 9 11 terrorist attacks for a reason as unique and still universal as you've lost a son a daughter a mother a father a husband a wife a friend how hard it can be to figure out what the right and true thing to do is when you have been so wronged and robbed i thought the ending of the book beautifully exploded this idea after deftly laying the foundation for it throughout the narrative with quick and steady work","604":"the blurb on the back cover of my book says frighteningly plausible and i couldn't agree more the plausibility of the novel made me uncomfortable and ashamed it's rare that a book can cause such a visceral reaction in me the tension between principle and emotion in this country was exposed in the starkest terms and yet in a way that created sympathy and enmity for all the voices represented this is a book is one that i won't be able to shake for a long time and for that i am grateful","605":"bookclub september 2012","606":"thoughtful look at religion and race in america frighteningly realistic fiction told from many points of view found it a rather hard read given the tenor of current events just more depressing stuff","607":"i like the story line and it's an easy read the characters are a bit one sided each reflecting a view on the events but not otherwise really deeply drawn","608":" this is an ensemble novel we read about the perspective of claire and mohammad or \"mo\" as he prefers to be called we also experience the events through the eyes of the panel chairman paul sean the brother of a fallen firefighter who sparks a media firestorm when he pulls off the headscarf of a muslim woman alyssa spier a journalist who is determined to stay on top of this story and asma anwar the widow of a bangladeshi man who was a janitor in the twin towers each character struggles with their new identity in the wake of the tragedy - are they defined by who they think they are or by the way they are perceived this is an excellent book a few pages in my thought was that ms waldman is a wordsmith every sentence is precise in meaning and flavor this is a taut highly nuanced topic and this writer rises to the occasion with grace and precision more thoughts at literarylindsey blogspot com","609":"important relevant well written at times dry at times quite removed from the characters most of whom come across as quite two dimensional but the thought provoking and charged subject matter just about make up for that worth a read particularly for anyone affected by the events of september 11 2001","610":"a jury gathers at gracie mansion in manhattan to consider blind submissions for a memorial to those who died on 9 11 two finalists are considered in these opening pages and the jury makes their selection relieved to be finished with the discussions and deliberations the jury anxiously awaits the big reveal to learn the identity of the architect behind the winning submission however the jurors soon learn the ordeal is far from over when the envelope is opened to reveal an american muslim as the winning architect the submission considers what happens next racism and fear are of course pervasive the winning submission a garden is labelled by many including members of the intellectual elite as a muslim garden and it is viewed by many as a further slap in the face to all americans everyone has a personal stake in the decision of whether this memorial will ever be built as someone who lived in manhattan on 9 11 i have spent a good deal of energy avoiding literature movies retrospectives and conversations regarding that tragic event this was a leap out of my comfort zone when i opened the first page surprisingly i didn't find the book difficult from a historic perspective but i think the book did make me feel slightly uncomfortable in other respects as i'm sure was the author's intent how would i have felt at the time my snap answer is i wouldn't care i'm no racist i'm open minded and a thinker someone who scoffed at those on tv who cried out bomb them in the days after 9 11 without having any idea of who them was but would it have mattered at all if the new york times and not usa today speculated that the memorial was some sort of celebration of muslim culture would that have mattered i think ultimately the answer is no but the author amy waldman gets bonus points in my book for engaging me in such an internal dialogue and forcing me to acknowledge that i'm not always as open minded as i like to believe i like a novel that forces its reader to reflect or perhaps face uncomfortable truths for these reasons i appreciated the novel however there were times when i found myself frustrated with the characters or thinking that the story wasn't progressing quite fluidly or quickly enough the novel follows many different characters some much more compelling and likable than others my favorite was a young illegal immigrant who loses her husband when the towers collapse however i think waldman tried to do too much and many of the characters fail to truly flourish ultimately the idea of the novel is much more compelling than the novel itself","611":"what a fantastic book the submission takes place two years after 9 11 a jury has been appointed to select a memorial design from a pool of anonymous design submissions the jury chooses a garden memorial but when they find out who designed the memorial they are taken aback the architect of the memorial they chose is a muslim the rest of the story is told through the eyes of six people claire the widow who lost her husband in 9 11 and who pushed for the garden memorial in the first place paul chairman of the jury who only wants the architect to withdraw mohammad the secular american born muslim architect of the garden memorial alyssa a journalist trying to make a name for herself by any means possible asma an illegal immigrant from bangladesh whose janitor husband died when we he went to work in the twin towers on 9 11 and sean a troubled adult whose firefighter brother died on 9 11 and who hates the idea of a muslim designed memorial many people don't want the garden memorial because they don't like the idea of a muslim designing it many people don't like it because they think the design is based on the islamic paradise that the terrorists thought they were dying for many people don't like it because they fear the muslim world will target it but many people do support it because they know if the architect was any other religion the garden design wouldn't be a problem the book focuses on intolerance constitutional rights and the fears americans had after 9 11 the website thesubmissionnovel com gives source information about other memorial designs architects and historical events that inspired the author to write this book i like the website almost as much as i like this book","612":"i finished about 20% of the book and i still wasn't that drawn in to the story so i decided to set this one aside i've got a long to read list to get to","613":"i enjoyed it very much because it had me look at a situation from another perspective it could have been a bit better i thought some of the characters were rather shallow but that may have been because i had to put the book down ofter hard to read while moving from one state to another","614":"excellent entertaining and timely beautifully drawn characters and a compelling narrative","615":"wonderful read amy waldman shows true talent for her 1st book a must read","616":" i don't think this book is poorly written or weakly characterized or crazily implausible but i'm inclined not to rate it very highly simply because the entire concept behind its writing left me baffled it is entirely possible that all the fault here lies with me not the author but take the premise there is a terrorist attack on new york and a memorial is planned when it is revealed that the winning entry for the memorial competition has been submitted by a muslim american all of the expected responses are heard a group representing victims' family members are furious while the out of touch art elite in new york fervently supports the winner and the politicians match their responses to the overall climate as i read this novel i kept wondering what i was reading and why why write a novel about a real event but very loosely fictionalize that event then imagine a certain possible result of that event and then list out the absolutely expected responses to that result i thought all of the characters responded exactly as i felt they would exactly how these people would have reacted post 9 11 if a muslim american had won the memorial competition at least in my opinion so again there is nothing actually technically wrong with this book except that i can't quite figure out what it is doing or what the author is trying to convey here although granted the book left me unsettled and i'm still thinking about it weeks later so there must be something to it","617":" two years after 9 11 there is a competition to decide which architect will get to build a memorial the submissions are anonymous but once the winner is announced and the name revealed it turns out that he is a muslim the choice throws the jury and then the city into turmoil the plot follows a number of people who are affected by the controversy or who simply profit from it it is all too very believable and reminiscent of the fuss about the muslim community center that was to have bee built near the site of the twin towers very rich and thought provoking","618":"i liked the idea of this book even most of it but i became bogged down with the last few sections took too long to get there and i was frustrated with the lack of movement in the characters i don't require happy endings but i do need a closure where i don't feel i've wasted my time perhaps that is the lesson though","619":"the submission is about an entry in a competition and is also about submission in many meanings the plot is simple there is a competition to pick a design for a memorial for the unthinkable assault on manhattan the committee {the book calls them a jury was picked to be a representation of the peoples that would want a memorial the winning submission is from an american architect who is muslim but never practiced that faith he calls himself mo but his given name is mohammad the submission is a novel in which every character submits to something to heroism to cowardice to self interest to self promotion to class to grief to innocence to prejudice to pride to art to religion the novel shows us the media rush to the submission of the real story of news and the race to get the story to the public the book attempts to bring all characters to their feelings about their decisions and actions a very thought provoking book","620":"this book includes some beautifully written and insightful passages some of the characters are well drawn and there are snippets from life in post 9 11 america that ring very true that said there are a few places where i strained to believe the characters maybe that is because there is an element of allegory to this book and the characters are meant to answer questions like what does it mean to live a pluralistic society is it better to hold onto ideals or to be flexible and compromise how do we balance demands of the majority with fairness to a minority for this reason it would be a great book to teach in a course on america after 9 11","621":"the premise of this book was very intriguing but the story line dragged a little hence my 3 stars i enjoyed the book and found myself questioning what i would have done or how i would have responded to the scenario at hand good read","622":"lots to talk about in this book good pick for a book club frankly i just didn't enjoy reading very few redeeming characters just to disappointing to read about them","623":"beautifully written most characters were full and compelling but what i loved most was that the ending was so perfectly appropriate for the novel truly a must read for 2011","624":"my book group read this and we gave it a 3 4 out of 5 stars","625":"it was great the language was sophisticated by unobtrusive and the characters were subtle and imperfect the plot was an intelligent look at issues surrounding fear of islam and muslims following the 9 11 attacks through the lens of a novel that follows the contest for the memorial design fiction","626":"the thing i liked about this book was the multiple points of view the author did a good job of depicting the experiences of the 9 11 victims american muslims immigrant muslims and the arts public world and the politics that accompany them all she set herself an interesting problem to solve in her plot i think she resolved it the only way she could or at least the only way today's world would accept i enjoyed the book","627":"what an interesting book the author managed to write in such a way that one could see all sides of the issues i had a little trouble getting into it but after a few pages it grabbed me","628":"exquisite so beautifully imagined so plausible it made me embarrassed to be american i can't believe this was a first novel","629":"nicely written and thought provoking story about a contest to design a memorial commemorating 9 11 i would only say i wish the characters were a bit more developed but well worth reading and lots to think about","630":"the submission is the fictional story of the anonymous competition to build the 9 11 memorial in nyc claire who lost her husband in the attacks represents the victims' families on a judging panel consisting of artists historians and other nyc elites when the winning design is chosen the architect is revealed to be named mohammad khan a muslim from there we follow claire mo bangladeshi immigrant asma and several others as they attempt to decide the fate of the memorial and negotiate the increasingly hostile climate between new yorkers and muslims as mo refuses to stand down explain himself or change his design and the opposition becomes virulent the ethics of having a muslim build a memorial to those who lost their lives to extremists become increasingly muddled even for claire mo's greatest supporter waldman has the incredible ability to make her characters if not entirely sympathetic understandable and realistic the temptation to make mo perfect must have been high yet the story was much more interesting when mo is arrogant and stubborn and conflicted about his actual relationship with islam liberal claire wobbles and becomes increasingly filled with doubt over what was originally her favorite design if you had told me the submission would have me feeling pity for a man who in the midst of an anti islamic anti garden rally rips off a woman's headscarf i never would have believed it but that character sean is not painted as only a racist bigot he's simultaneously grieving for the loss of his brother and living ever deeper in that same brother's shadow he's trying to win his hard mother's respect and love he's dealing with his own feelings of incompleteness and that's just one character waldman turns a compassionate eye to every player in this tale and that lent to its compulsive readability read the rest of my review at bookwanderer","631":"fascinating novel about a contest of submissions of designs for a 9 11 memorial the winner is a muslim and the indecision fear and doubt plunge this story into our current hearts and minds our prejudices and fears and make us question everything","632":"given that i'm planning to completely avoid 9 11 retrospectives over the next week i don't know what made me pick up this book i was surprised i downloaded the sample then i was surprised that i bought the book then i was extremely surprised that i read the whole thing couldn't put it down and gasp enjoyed it wait can that be right that can't be the right way to describe it no yes i enjoyed it huh which is not to say it isn't sad it definitely is mostly because i got to the end feeling like people can change but they tend not to or do but not quite the way you hope they will because they're people","633":"this is a very thought provoking book about a contest to create a memorial for the 9 11 wtc a jury chooses an entry that has been anonymous and it is discovered that an muslim is the architect word leaks out and all of a sudden it causes a major debate all over the world the out of control actions remind me of the ground zero mosque recent debate in the news i understand both sides of the arguments and the author was very neutral in both ways of thinking when telling the story great book","634":"i got very impatient with this book the story was not believable i didn't like the characters the ending wasn't satisfying not worth the time","635":" i picked this as a book club selection be cause i had wanted to read it after hearing about it i can't wait to hear what other members have to say we are all very close and live in or near to new york city we all have our own feelings about that day in september 2001 and while i enjoyed this a lot i felt that it was a little bit off while i was not directly touched by the attacks i always listen for 4 names during the roll call of victims i wanted to like this book more but i had a problem with claire and a couple of other characters i felt that they were how the author thought they were instead of how people actually were which is a small quibble on my part i have read several of the post september 11 novels and i am still waiting for an author to get it this one has come the closest","636":" the book opens on a jury making a blind selection for the 911 memorial to be built in nyc the jury can see the submission designs but do not know who submitted them a great plan to ensure a fair equal chance for all until the submission the pick is that of a muslim american - someone that they did not want to have an equal chance overall i liked it the first half drove me a little batty with all the drama and debate around the submission however i liked how waldman crafted the idea and created characters through which we watched the blowup unfold the second half was much more enjoyable for me once i knew and felt invested in the characters and what would come of them","637":"a jury sets about to choose a memorial for a terrorist site thinly guised 9 11 and discover that their choice was designed by a muslim the intervention of the press felt ugly and real but i got frustrated by the architect's unwillingness to talk about his design never met a designer who didn't want to explain it no one bends no one recalls why they chose the design didn't love it","638":"the premise is intriguing a contest is held to select a design for a 9 11 memorial where the two towers stood the winner a design for a garden is chosen anonymously but once it has been selected they realize the designer is muslim and there is an immediate outcry from the public the cast of characters is diverse there's paul a jewish lawyer who is in charge of the jury that selects the design for the memorial then we have mohammad khan the architect whose design is chosen he was born in virginia and is an american asma is the widow of a man who was killed in the two towers on 9 11 she is living in america illegally but her son was born in the usa claire is also a 9 11 widow and is a member of the jury that selects the memorial design and is the garden's earliest advocate alyssa is a reporter who continually weasels her way into each breaking story throwing gas on the fire sean lost his brother on 9 11 but the tragedy has finally given him some focus in life he now lends his time and energy to 9 11 causes the book's greatest strength is that it shows the issue from such wonderfully different perspectives allowing the readers to see it from so many angles fleshing out the controversy and gives it real weight we meet a wide variety of people from diverse walks of life seeing it through their eyes opens our own writing it this way is essential to make the story work it becomes a stepping stone to open discussions instead of preaching one view point at us there is no hero or villain just people struggling with an impossible situation where emotions are raw with grief and everyone is tense the controversy isn't really about his design it's about his religion as one reporter thinks \"no one cared about the design didn't her get that \" i was really glad that mo wasn't turned into a saint that's simply caught in the cross hairs i thinks it's important he feels like a real person flawed like anyone else with selfish thoughts and a flaring temper he's a normal guy with ambitions the only subplot i wasn't a fan of was sean's i felt like his whole story was weak and uninteresting spoilersfor me it was crucial that the book end the way it did if it had ended in the midst of the pressure and stress of the situation i don't think it would have meant so much to me i needed to know what the characters felt about the situation once they had some distance from it and they weren't caught up in the fury of the events i wanted to know what happened to asma's son and what he thought about what happened ending it 20 years later gave me closure and felt just right spoilers overthe book makes you wonder what you would do in this situation it's not black and white and there's no clear right and wrong because there are so many feelings involved one new yorker in the book talks about his mind thinking one thing and his heart feeling another he's ashamed to feel suspicious but he can't help it what is america if not a melting pot that defies labels when you mix such incredibly different cultures together you're bound to have underlying prejudices based on centuries of feuds the plot also makes you look at what your own assumptions about people are and it makes you question how easily you are swayed by sensational news coverage i think this is a wonderful book one of my favorites so far this year i don't think this is a book that everyone will enjoy it's tense and political i think you could also say it manipulates your emotions but for me it was excellent \"'it's falling down it's falling down 'the nursery rhyme words then the mobile network went dead 'hello hello honey ' all around then a silence of pompeian density \"\"jealousy clings to love's underside like bats to a bridge \"\"... which had seemed so monumental at the time had turned out to be only a small fragment of the mosaic of his life \"\"perhaps this was the secret to being at peace want nothing but what is given to you \"","639":"better than i thought esp after hearing the premise good character weaving","640":"surf rd book club october 2012 read","641":"a thought provoking story of how stereotypes racial profiling fear unknown motives grief and misunderstandings of other cultures can color perceptions and personal interactions although the story was a little slow for me in the middle i am glad i read to the end","642":" a very pertinent and relevant book for our divisive times the author amy waldman has the credentials and expertise to speak from authority about how the media in all today's various forms has the ability to take controversy and fan the flames of hysteria and fear to contrive conflict to the point of creating a divided public then stand back and seemingly be oblivious to any responsibility or accountability when the public turns on itself a beautifully rendered story that has taken the subject of post 9 11 and the desire for a memorial and seemingly imagined a new conflict yet she doesn't need to look far to find inspiration as this very instance has happened within the progressive and liberal city of new york when the subject of a memorial or even the building a mosque was discussed within blocks of ground zero some years ago i actually was all on board giving this book 5 stars i was getting emotional and even pissed off while reading it even putting it down for a couple weeks to read something lighter all good works of art should do that however i found myself disappointed at the end and the afterward i will not give anything away but to say that it seemed that the author simply didn't want to leave it all on a bleak note and wanted to hope for a more optimistic future otherwise read it for this it is a reflection of us and our need for conflict and political controversy then claiming to be disgusted with what the media and press attempt to provide that","643":"i'm only about 70 pages in but so far this is the most beautifully written book that i have read in a long time every single sentence is so well crafted and placed i find myself delighted to read slowly so that i can absorb every idea waldman puts forth she is also coming to the sun valley writers conference this year so this is part of my summer mission to read a book by each attendee","644":"incredible the story deals with very real issues sadly but presents compelling characters and believeable reasons to stand on either side of the story","645":"i hated the ending but worth a read","646":" this is a remarkable interweaving of dynamics that are part of the secondary and tertiary responses to 9 11 it is an amazing read the characters are so real that i could see and hear them plus the issues intertwine intricately as in real life only more crystalline political class race grief outrage righteousness moral indignation and healing national response international ramifications a gritty true feeling of the worlds that reside side by side in nyc and were all hurting after the horrible event i must reread with less interruption as that was a disservice to the reading of the book now on hold recommended by a friend 'the emperors children by clare messud also dealing with the time frame around 9 11","647":"as we or most of us make a good faith effort to navigate the social perils of a post 9 11 world post iraq and let it be hoped a post afghanistan worlds we confront innumerable prejudices judgments memories world views amy waldman hits damn near every one of them but in such an engaging entertaining way that the angst we might expect from so many conflicting emotions becomes instead a pleasurable study in human nature she walked a thin line between exposition and lecture but walked it flawlessly i was sure i knew how it would end and i love being wrong as i was here great read","648":"a good read the author has us enter a time and space directly after the 9 11 disaster the reader finds themselves in a contest for the new memorial and a dilemna develops between the committee when the contest winner is a muslim american that's when the real discovery begins several on the panel want to honor the rules of the contest others want a new contest when the artist architect discovers the plot to undermind his selection the real political and social dynamics begin a real good look into the human condition and are conscience and unconscience prejudices","649":"read this for book club i was worried it was going to be slow and hard to get into but i was pulled into the story right away and intrigued by the characters and their beliefs about the submission","650":"it makes you wonder how strongly we are biased this book creates a lot of introspection into the way i think about interactions with people who seem different than i am i really liked this book","651":" what if the winner of the anonymous contest to design a memorial at the world trade center site turned out to be muslim the submission imagines the answer to that question and it's not pretty basically it's the post 9 11 version of the bonfire of the vanities but without the snark waldman does a competent job of orchestrating her nightmare scenario which is chillingly plausible but this story trades exclusively in stereotypes unscrupulous reporters the governor with higher political aspirations waffling liberals radio shock jocks emotionally volatile survivors opportunistic peddlers of identity politics idealistic crusaders for truth and the american way and the requisite sacrifical lamb so it was hard to care about most of the characters in particular despite waldman's best efforts the character of claire burwell remains murky and unconvincing but i give credit to waldman for not messing up the ending this is the kind of book that one imagines as being ideal fodder for book groups but maybe not it was a little too calculated for my liking i recommend it nonetheless","652":"i feel like i was supposed to like this book but i really did not care for it that much i had to renew it the maximum five times from the library to finish it other books just seemed so much better so it kept going to the bottom of the stack i did finish it though after putting it aside many times the premise was interesting but i feel like it emphasized some of the less desirable characteristics of the characters there was really only one character in the book that i really liked and although her actions were important to the plot she was essentially a minor character","653":"an interesting suposition but overall this is more about the politics of the 9 11 than the writing itself","654":"complex characters well drawn","655":"this book is a novel but the quintessential 9 11 book to read the story could have happened and reads as very authentic highly recommend","656":"the submission the submission an agonizing wonderfully constructed riveting imagining so real it feels inexorable must we devolve in this way see what you feel and think","657":"this novel about a proposed design for the 9 11 memorial makes for a wonderful book club discussion the key characters have complex motives and both sympathetic and nonsympathetic sides the memorial itself sets up a dilemma that could be debated for a long time the book is very well written i admit i was reluctant even to start reading knowing the topic but i am glad i did","658":" you should probably read the submission as soon as you can i borrowed it from the library one day when i was in a certain mood i wanted to read something important once i got it home though i resisted picking it up i was sure it would make me helplessly angry and i didn't think i wanted to put myself through that the premise suggests helpless anger and the book delivers it but also has much more to offer the titular submission is the garden an architect's proposed design for a public 9 11 memorial on the first page amy waldman drops us inside the confidential debate among the jury which has been charged by the governor of new york to choose a winner from among the anonymous proposals we read the scene from the point of view of juror claire who represents the families her husband having died in the world trade center attack claire influences the jury to select the garden upon which it is revealed that its designer is named mohammed khan on this foundation waldman builds a nearly perfect novel the resulting controversy features a broad variety of characters who are fully human realistic and recognizable with various comprehensible motivations there are a few unalloyed villains a politician a radio host a print reporter but waldman gives priority to the characters who are conflicted doubtful and sympathetic especially claire and mohammed and so the helpless anger i feared was eased i couldn't sink into comfortable hatred of the villains' obvious prejudice and stupidity because i was spending most of my time with ordinary decent humane people who still couldn't figure out what to do about the prospect of a muslim designing a 9 11 memorial i didn't finish the submission in a single sitting and when near the end of the book i put it down i found myself reflecting on c s lewis in the great divorce and elsewhere lewis wrote beautifully and engagingly about hell as defined by the absence of love in the submission characters have families colleagues and friends they have sex they collaborate they argue still they are so uniformly unable to give or receive love that waldman must have stripped them of the capacity on purpose view spoiler even claire who is among the most admirable characters in the book ends by betraying her certain knowledge of what her late husband would have wanted her to do hide spoiler even while we anticipate an intellectual victory a dramatic rejection of prejudice and an unassailable defense of inclusive democratic principles we become emotionally thirsty for a character who can show generosity or compassion amid political conflict tragically every single character is unable to do so they are handicapped by ambition ideology racism fear or pain lewis would surely recognize the terrifying spectacle these souls refuse paradise to cling to some familiar beloved sin view spoiler ok maybe sean shows some nascent compassion and this lifts my heart but isn't he somewhat less than fully emotionally satisfying and then i admit that asma and claire love their sons but in the end claire's love is rather cold and asma is dead hide spoiler again whenever i set the book aside i had to wonder how it would end so many wonderful books are marred by inadequate conclusions when a book begins particularly well i feel the tension starting to mount in this case it seemed an impossible problem if the garden is finally built it undermines the power of the conflict on the other hand it would simply be too discouraging to see the design rejected in my judgment waldman navigates the challenge brilliantly and rises to new heights ultimately forcing us to question whether any public memorial can truly satisfy the claims of the bereaved finally i should add that the physical design of the hardcover edition is exceptional it is obvious that the cover is beautiful and this seems important in a book that's so concerned with design and beauty i have to add though that this is absolutely the only book i've ever read in which the artistic design of the last chapter heading took my breath away i know this sounds ridiculous form your own opinion even if you don't see it the way i did you'll have read the book and you won't be sorry","659":"3 5 stars a tough subject handled smartly and with the efficiency of diction that denotes a masterful writer whether the plot of omission was a stylistic choice or not it made for wonderful discussion of this book and the themes that surround it the topic of submission alone is an interesting one filled with conflict and unresolved angst and more profanity than i care for i wasn't drawn to its pages but am probably better for the perspective that came from reading it","660":"the premise a carefully selected jury is appointed to choose a design for a monument to be erected at the site of the world trade center submissions judged before the designer's name is revealed it turns out the winning design was submitted by a virginia born american named mohammed khan the resulting uproar gives the author a canvas on which to paint varieties of prejudice in all their subtlety and brutality very well written but something of a downer","661":"the submission is a submission to a contest for a memorial on the site of the twin towers a closely guarded submission process narrows the choices to two when the final memorial garden is chosen it is revealed that the architect is a muslim the panel does not know where to go with this the choice is revealed and turmoil follows a good book for discussion interesting and well written","662":" this really was quite brilliant and should i teach a class on public memory again i will most definitely assign it to y students which given arizona's less than stellar reputation when it comes to racial politics should be quite interesting to say the least the trick of the book comes down to recognizing that the titular noun submission works on several levels not only is it about the actual submission to the design competition but it also involves the submission the individual memory is forced to make when faced with that of the collective beyond being interesting from a philosophical perspective it's also a damn good story highly recommended","663":"this book was upsetting and disturbing it asks the question do you have to like the artist to like his work does it matter what the artist believes his art says or what what his art says to you it also showed how how the media can blow a story up and distort things and even cause death","664":"after the world trade center is blown up in new your the city commissions a jury to select the anonymous designer of a memorial it turns out the designer is a non practicing muslim and thus begins amy waldman's novel about prejudice suspicion fear mongering and events spiraling out of control the book starts slowly and struggles to find its way as it introduces a plethora of characters and for a book that tries to show the dangers of prejudice it has an amazing number of stereotypes and beyond wealthy characters for instance the family member on the jury the character whom the book revolves around is described as being set for life after marrying a wealthy man who leaves her everything after he dies in the terrorist act the novel is chock a block with investment bankers and other scions of industry but other characters the irish catholic family with a fireman son who died a cold hearted mother and a second son who has you guessed it a drinking problem the tabloid reporter who cares about nothing but getting a sensationalist story and the governor whose political ambitions weigh above all else never come to life indeed the most well drawn character a bengladeshi widow becomes relevant only near the end of the book but still the tale is well written even as it rushes toward its obvious climax","665":"you know i liked it i would recommend it as a light read the story moved well and the characters fairly well developed a couple of scenes were a little bit of a streach","666":"this was an amazingly well written book it invoked so many emotions","667":"i really liked the first part of this book but then it just went on and on about all the journalists i may come back and finish it at another time but not now","668":"this book really was amazing the writing is good the characters fully realized i liked too that the author didn't disappoint with the ending the storyline felt very plausible and thought provoking a great read all around","669":"like a modern day bonfire of the vanities a book waldman mentions early in this one although it sometimes felt a little too much like bonfire and i'm not sure i was convinced with the ending it did a good job at reflecting some of the more difficult and controversial dilemmas in us post 9 11 the found myself groaning at times nut because of the way the book was written but because of what it said correctly i think about the society we have been over the past 10 years","670":"loved this book i am glad that the author wrote it 10 years after 9 11 so that we have had some time to heal and now reflect on what our world was like in those first few years after 9 11 this book does an excellent job of reminding us of the muslim fearing patriotism or else world we lived in during that time the book is about a fictional memorial that is going to be built at the 9 11 site an art jury is put together to judge an anonymous competition what happens when the jury makes their selection opens up the artist's information and finds out that the artist is a muslim it all goes downhill from there the book had me wondering what would happen if 10 years after 9 11 the same thing happened would we react the same as much as i would like to say no i think we would just last year the mosque debate near the world trade center site showed us that yes america still has not healed the book is told through different perspectives i think the character i had the most trouble with was the artist h was stubborn but i guess it could also be construed as uncompromising of his principles in short loved the book the only complaints i had were at the end didn't realize the book was going to jump 20 years ahead so i had to go back a few pages to re read and realize oh yes we are in a different time period threw me for a loop but i thought it was a good way to end it at least we got an idea of where the characters ended up","671":"when i read the premise of this novel i couldn't imagine how smart and original the plotting would be waldman does a terrific job of marrying a compelling story with some great thought provoking issues","672":"great review on npr","673":"it was slow but good sad thoughful i liked it","674":"the premise of this book is really great the subject and the context are fascinating however the execution could have been a lot better it's worth reading for sure just don't expect to be blown away it really is just an ok book","675":"positively outstanding the story is rich in the complex realities of looking at multiple points of view the characters are plausible and multidimensional this book should be required reading for all people everywhere who are stuck in their own traditions and beliefs unfortunately it is the narrow minded person who needs to understand multiple viewpoints that won't pick this up this book","676":" what if a muslim architect submitted the winning design for the 9 11 memorial what would the resulting public discussion look like i had been saving this until after i had seen the real 9 11 memorial and finished the book right before 9 11 which also gave my reading a certain poignancy i'd like to think that things might not have unfolded in the way they do in the novel but yet there was nothing that i would call unrealistic either i think i would have given this three stars right after reading it but because of the interesting discussions i've had when i tell people about what i've been reading it got elevated by the time i got around to rating it","677":"i can't say enough about this book i love books with no heroes and no villains just a bunch of flawed human beings trying to do the right thing once they figure out what that is","678":" p17 her name was violet and she was a compulsive pessimist always looking for the soft brown spot in the fruit pressing so hard she created it p38 the manorexic p49 there were in life rarely if ever 'right' decisions never perfect ones only the best to be made under the circumstances p107 petey the eldest the five year old especially revered mo who still remembered the first time petey had called him by name that feeling of being known by a child as a thing apart from every other thing in his world and thus valued p191 he had always promised to soften the blow of her fortieth birthday his plans had grown epically comically more elaborate until cal settled on a round the world trip that would have taken claire all the way to her forty first birthday thus making her nostalgic for her fortieth","679":"i am amazed by the impact of this book and highly recommend it the author masterfully winds her story through tricky and emotional paths and in the end finishes it without a conclusion leaving it up to the reader to discern their own opinion but still summing up her character's lives i also reccommend visiting the book's website and reading the gridded revelations about the author's research very moving","680":" i didn't mean to be reading a book about 9 11 actually on 9 11 and weirdly i didn't make the connection until just now which i like just a few years ago reading a different novel that ends on 9 11 left me in a thoughtful and tearful funk for a week that that didn't happen makes me think i we might be on the mend from this tragedy but this book was lovely no spoilers here it's almost just a collection of character studies but the thoughts ideas problems the characters are dealing with are so complex that it rises above that i've never read a novel that better showed how personal the political is and vice versa and in the innermost place of all of us that religion and politics are privately defined and negotiated things it was beautiful careful writing about an impossible situation at an impossible time","681":"i liked the way every angle of every point of view was explored but didn't feel the character development ran parallel to those opinions i e characters seemed more like a parcel of opinions than real people","682":"thought provoking and well written","683":"the submission was an interesting book to read especially on the anniversary of 9 11 i didn't think the book was well written but it did bring back all of the emotions i had when 9 11 happened it also was a good examination of human nature and how we treat each other the only character i felt was sympathetic was asma i could feel her pain and her fear but i didn't like the main characters claire and mo claire seemed to talk the talk but when it came time to do the walk she crumpled and let people get in her head mo could have been successful in his quest to get his designed built but he let his pride get in the way i found that a bit unrealistic this is a good book for a book group there are so many things to discuss you could probably have 2 discussions on it","684":"just finished the submission well written thought provoking book","685":"this was a beautiful thought provoking novel that offered a kaleidoscope of perspectives on 9 11 and its impact aftermath one of my favorite reads of 2012 thus far","686":"most of this book i very much enjoyed the premise could have been gimmicky but the author did a masterful job of looking at all of the nuances and viewpoints of the issue it was the ending that lost the final star for me there was no real resolution and the characters who were so important throughout the narrative just vanished in the end","687":"just go read this book already","688":"this is another of my library's reader's choice books it tells a story about a 9 11 memorial whose designer turns out to an american muslim and all the ensuing uproar the characters are very well rounded and you get a feeling for their anguish about the mostly media driven false insinuations as well as the characters who are feeding this a journalist for a tabloid and a blogger who also leads marches but who mainly just wants money to support her children excellent book","689":" i'm not sure how i heard about this book but it had good reviews and i thought i'd try it i didn't think it would really be my thing 9 11 america but it was my thing because my thing is awesome books i found it provocative and thought provoking and surprising i loved the ending because it allowed for the retrospection of the characters although it takes place in 2003 the book was only written a few years ago so i really was caught up in the memories of then but with the benefit of knowing how things are now a really fantastic story","690":"i thought this was going to be amazing and it did keep my attention but i thought it could have been written more concisely and i absolutely hated the ending i think the concept of a muslim designing the memorial for 9 11 evokes so much debate and discussion there were so many points of view it's a great story and made a great book club discussion","691":"struggling to review this but it certainly makes you think deeply and at length certainly one of the best books of the last few years and a brilliant achievement for a debut novel","692":"i did not particularly enjoy the submission i read it for my book club i thought that waldman's characters were mostly two dimensional and generally uninteresting there was not enough backstory to detail why mo the indian architect whose anonymous design for the 9 11 not called that in the book memorial was selected and then became very controversial because mohammed is a muslim waldman is a trained journalist and that may be a partial explanation of why i did not care for this story her writing felt stilted and awkward to me the undocumented pakistani woman whose husband is killed in the tragedy is perhaps the most interesting character","693":"ultimately i found this book really unsatisfying i found the characters cliched and unlikeable and the ending was disappointing the best thing i can say about it is that some of the dialogue was good and utterly believable maybe i'm just jaded with the whole 9 11 muslims terrorism thing","694":"when the jury charged with selecting a memorial for victims of the 9 11 terrorist attack realizes that the architect of the winning design is an american muslim chaos ensues the resulting controversy exposes america's complex feelings regarding muslims both here and abroad waldman intelligently presents all sides of the often political arguments through her conflicted characters' words actions and alliances for some reason i had a very hard time getting emotionally involved with this novel and its characters note this novel has received excellent critical reviews and was recently chosen as seattle public library's seattle reads title for 2012","695":"this book addresses the emotions and prejudices that surround the selection of an appropriate memorial for the victims of september 11 2001 the characters must each examine his her own motives for the decisions they make this book forces the reader to consider his her own position as the story unfolds and for a long while afterward the hallmark of an excellent book","696":"great book on tolerance and understanding perceptions about our most feared notions of religion","697":"this book started a little slow for me the first 50 pages were really hard to get into but by the end i was intrigued this is a good book club choice since the book is all about controversy the book is post 9 11 where a group of people are given the responsibility of choosing a memorial for the world trade center site the choose a garden and when the architect of the design is revealed the jurors have to grapple with the winner being mo short for mohammad a non practicing muslim the book examines prejudice fear and religion i noticed some reviewers complained that the characters were not likable or too flat i personally didn't feel connected to anyone in the book which oddly i kind of liked it allowed me to be objective and just think about the issues the book presented i really enjoyed this read","698":"started out very strong but i thought the ending fizzled still was a decent read","699":"i wavered between 3 and 4 for this one i thought it was compelling and thought provoking but somehow i was left a bit unsatisfied","700":"library for book clubexcellent book fiction but compelling story about choosing a 9 11 memorial","701":"this is one of those books that i thought about when i wasn't reading it and that made me ask myself lots of questions that weren't easily answered the premise is that a muslim architect wins an anonymous competition to design a ground zero memorial as you can imagine all heck breaks loose it's a lucid clear eyed examination of how 9 11 affected our perceptions of ourselves as a nation and of what it means to be american","702":"this book was really good at the beginning and then kind of stalled then had a good ending important issues addressed by the story","703":"i think the premise and the thematic possibilities of this novel wrote a check that the plotting and characterization couldn't cash it was an interesting read but it could have been so much more for a first novel though pretty impressive","704":"you ever start reading a book and want to give it a chance so you read 50 pages or so and then you figure you might as well keep reading it to see if it gets any better but it really doesn't this was one of those i give it a meh as my review","705":"this was a great book with greatly nuanced characters and wonderful social observations","706":"the story line is delivered in such a manner that these events could have been were real the middle of the plot e g the meetings citizen reaction press conferences etc over the winning design dragged a bit the ending was a little predictable but had a good guy wins feel","707":"i guess i was hoping for a happy ending with this book extremely interesting premise and strangely prophetic considering recent news about the controversy with the museum that opened at ground zero the book was hard to read at times with the extreme racism although very accurate in those first years after 9 11 easy to forget overall interesting but perhaps a narrow look a long book considering it's focus on a garden","708":"this review has been hidden because it contains spoilers to view it click here i found the characters interesting enough but there was a lot of back and forth over the issue without a satisfying resolution in my opinion","709":"very thought provoking excellent book it was difficult to read at times several times i had to put it down and come back to it not something i normally do when reading a book 9 11 is such a personal time for me and for many other this book expanded on that date and how americans handled it then and continue to handle it even today it made me stop and think hard about what i would do if i had to be part of the submission","710":"brilliantly topical it deals with a muslim architect who wins the design competition for the 9 11 memorial tower and it disqualified for being islamist i read this at the same time as the fight in ny to place a mosque near the site of the twin towers in nyc i thoroughly enjoyed the writing and the subject","711":"what if a 911 memorial for nyc was selected from a huge pool of submissions only to discover that the architect was muslim this is amy waldman's first book which only makes the submission more remarkable in her ability to capture a nation's response to this disconcerting situation truly compelling to the last page","712":"excellent book lovely prose intellectually stimulating and emotionally gripping","713":"amy waldman did a wonderful job capturing the different perspectives and motives of all of the characters involved with this fictitious piece of american history the premise is intriguing and the ending left me satisfied yet full of questions","714":" this is one of those rare books that gets five stars even though i didn't absolutely fall in love with it it's not a subject matter one can fawn over i'm giving it five stars because it's worth it it's an important book taking a very close look at american's reaction to 9 11 to muslims after 9 11 and to the politics intertwined in our efforts to memorialize heal from and transcend the tragedy waldman manages to give voice to several important characters giving us conflicting perspectives shifting philosophies and then leaving us with unanswerable questions","715":"i alternated between being really into this story and being bored i thought the ending was wrapped up a little too quickly","716":"interesting idea badly done i quickly grew tired of the hysterical objections to a muslim american architect winning the blind competition","717":"terrific writing throughout my complaint is that the plot which starts with a good conflict filled premise seems to run out of gas at the 3 4 mark and coast the rest of the way to the end stronger finish next time please and you'll have a breakout novel with writing this good","718":"really closer to a 4 i need a 3 5 rating option interesting treatment of what would happen if a memorial to the 9 11 tragedy was designed by a muslim not too cliched","719":"couldn't finish it","720":"what an important book well written and very powerful","721":"when the anonymous winner of the memorial design for the twin towers turns out to be a muslim the best and the worst of human nature comes to the fore very thought provoking and interesting premise","722":"a jury choosing the design for the 9 11 memorial from 5000 anonymous submissions picks a muslim designer i liked it but i felt like some of the characters weren't exactly linear in thought or action they often did things that made me think where did that come from it would make for a stimulating discussion and i think there's probably a lot of truth to the undercurrents it didn't end badly but i still felt like weeping when i finished","723":"i really enjoyed this novel a lot i liked the setting the characters and the complexity of the issue at play it managed to be thought provoking while still moving briskly and never felt preachy","724":"lacking in character development a predictable characterization in general of human beings their beliefs and prejudices","725":"i'm of two minds about this one the controversy at the center of the plot is realistic in its nuance and its bureaucracy but there were stylistic and maybe ideological choices the novel makes that i'm not sure i was entirely on board with","726":" this debut novel unfolds as a work of non fiction american born non practicing muslim architect mohammad khan entered a 9 11 memorial competition and his design is picked by the blind jury comprised of artists historians critics and a socialite representing the families of the victims of the horrible wtc attack upon the reveal of mo's muslim name the jury the families the architect the city the press the politicians and the nation finds themselves embroiled in passionate debate told through many characters this novel made me angry sad and disillusioned with the political fever vitriol and righteousness exhibited by participants on all sides of this debate so little desire to find or make common ground a captivating read although i found that the crucial mid point of the novel began to drag while i found myself waiting for another event to occur only so much discussion of differing points of view can be tolerated in a situation where the lines are so firmly drawn with no waver tolerated","727":"in this what if novel a jury is convened to decide on the design for a fictional memorial for the site of the twin towers after 9 11 as the anonymous submission is chosen it is revealed that he is an american muslim when the result is made public all sides weigh in on what becomes a national controversy this is a fascinating look at american culture in the time after the attack when all muslims became suspect and the true nature of bigotry and religious division in the us is revealed","728":"the varying points of view in this novel illuminated the almost impossibility of reconciling extreme positions on race religion and nationality a novel of ideas","729":"i liked this book alot very thought provoking","730":"fabulous book for a book club there is much to be discussed highly recommend","731":"this has to be one of the most interesting exceptional emotional thought provoking moving and just down right well written books i have ever had the privilege to read","732":"i found myself thinking about this book well after i finished it a sign if a well written story","733":" so amy waldman says to herself that she wants to write a novel and wonders what she should write about hey i know something easy like the aftermath of the 9 11 attacks that's not a controversial topic i doubt that was her thought process but i admire her boldness and also the deft handling of the tragic impossible frightening absurd and maddening events stances shrill voices and general craziness of the time the title tells all submission to power to memory to authorities to convention to love to ideology to self interest to caricature and to the refusal to submit highly recommended 4 5 stars","734":"very interesting a little preachy","735":"it made me think can't wait to discuss in a book club","736":"this author demonstrates an incredible ability to present multiple sides of issues i recommend this book to all of my friends","737":"readable an intriguing and interesting plot but at the foundations not believable really would it be anonymous i enjoyed the character development though and would recommend","738":"fictional scenario in which submissions are requested for a garden design to be put on the ground zero location in ny the designs are judged anonymously and the winner happens to be a muslim this causes all kinds of great consternation and that is what this book is about","739":"beautiful depiction of how post 9 11 we all lose this lack of reconciliation continues to play out in current politics","740":" interesting premise with lots of different viewpoints but the characters are bit contrived and don't have great depth this novel about a non practicing muslim american winning the architectural competition for the 9 11 memorial reads like a fictionalized long form newspaper article maybe that's because the writer is a journalist maybe it has nothing to do with that don't know but after the first few chapters it chugged along the rated g intimate bedroom scenes and the love stories fell spectacularly flat and while you felt anger happiness pride or incredulity for some of the words and actions of the characters you never felt for them as human beings","741":"good pace thought provoking","742":"fantastic waldman manages the describe all her characters across cultures with clarity and sympathy i just wish mohammed khan hadn't remained single","743":" liked that the characters whichever side of the issue they fell on were portrayed with some depth their motivations were not just ideological ones they were as much driven by their personal attributes and failings as they were by what side they were on i also think that the book created a level of discomfort for the reader because the discourse was so divided and often ugly and what seems right one moment can suddenly shift mo was by far my favorite character because he was not made into a villain or a victim he behaved precisely the way some intelligent handsome talented charismatic men act like a dbag","744":"picked up by accident thought the author was ayelet waldman really enjoyed this believable characters","745":"a very intense read the premise was thought provoking and created a believable what if scenario following the loss of the twin towers and the rebuilding process","746":"i appreciated the dynamic the author was working with but some of the story telling was laborious and took away from the larger picture","747":"i read this for my book group and while i didn't love the book i certainly think it has value for the issues it raises i think the author successfully portrayed people's changeability not at their core necessarily but how their actions and point of view can be altered by the influence of others and events around them i appreciated that waldman did not have good and bad characters but allowed main characters to act in ways that were both appealing and unappealing to the reader","748":"really thought provoking and interesting premise how we view other religions whether the u s truly has freedom of religion and thought how the press angles how we will approach and understand a story whether we really want freedom of thought etc the characters however were not fleshed out enough and that made the novel less emotionally powerful still it gave me lots of food for thought","749":" very good book a great selection for a book club there is so much to talk about a muslim architect ends up winning a blind contest to build the 9 11 memorial in nyc and all the furor that ensues all the hatred and questioning of his motives does mohammed khan really have to explain what he believes and what his design means or should people just take it at face value a beautiful garden to remember u0026amp contemplate those who were lost you get the story and perspective from all angles the architect the bereaved widow the angry grieving brother of a dead firefighter the leaders of the selection panel the widow of the janitor who is in the country illegally the ending is unforeseen i didn't expect the architect to end up where he did but his enormous talent was enough to take him through the terrible situation and take him to a place of relative peace","750":"request this from your library now because it is going to be one of the next big books and deservedly so heartbreaking and compelling i picked it up from the library after work and just closed it a minute ago i want everyone to read it","751":"give this a 4 it is very thought provoking 2 years after 9 11 a committee has chosen the design for a memorial on the twin towers site the 5000 entries are all anonymous until selection is made to ensure fairness the architect is an american born muslim named mohammed all hell breaks out for and against mo the crazies the families of the killed politicians etc decent people trying to deal with their own bias and mo himself angered by the criticism i am still thinking about this story","752":" it is too soon after the 9 11 tragedy for objectivity the resulting war is at its peak and emotions are still running high the massive hole in the ground in the center of manhattan must be filled but with what a committee is formed to choose a memorial design architects and designers are invited to submit designs for consideration anyone may enter anyone waldman draws the characters well enough to inspire us to dislike some and like others and even as in real life to feel unsure about some and change our minds more than once about others we come to see how first impressions only give us one dimension of a character and as the story unfolds we come to understand and feel compassion for those we may not have liked at first we still may not like them but we understand and empathize nonetheless the author's use and sometimes dual definition of the title word submission is interesting the architects submit their entries to the competition must they submit to all of the procedural rules if the judges' decision seems unjust or inappropriate must they and all the rest of the world submit to the mood of a demographic majority pressure from political authorities persuasion from families grieving the loss of their loved ones minorities being unjustly persecuted","753":" i liked this book because it is thought provoking i think it would be very powerful to do with a book club or to have a discussion afterward it was sometimes hard to get into because many of the characters seem to be figureheads for the vast opinions surrounding islam and america and terrorism and 9 11 and the relationship between these elements and stereotypes in our society i am not sure i loved this book and had difficulty rating it but i am really glad that i read it because it challenged me in a good way","754":"very worthy and well written and clever and all that but a book with an opening scene in a committee meeting has a lot of work to do to keep the reader entertained","755":"i wanted to be able to give this book a four one reason being that it has some lovely passages and turns of phrase that resonated with me another reason being that it is the book that all incoming first year students at ohio state are being asked to read and i want to be able to show support for that however for each beautiful snippet there was a phrase that seemed like the author was trying too hard and i simply can't get over the fact that there didn't seem to be any character besides the children who i could get behind i would imagine that was part of the point of the book but i feel like it should have been possible to make the point that the issue is complex without making the characters distasteful there is one part where the sole family member on the panel claire finally admits to herself that she simply doesn't know and that was probably the most meaningful part to me definitely not a bad read and the story does pull you in but just not as deeply as i wanted to be","756":" the submission will challenge your convictions about how you think people should be treated about what it means to be loyal to your family and friends about what it means to be a good leader and about a host of other issues author amy waldman does an excellent job creating moral dilemmas for all her characters in a shifting landscape of circumstances that causes the obvious choices between right and wrong to shift too any reader will be able to find himself or herself among waldman's diverse cast of characters who for the most part are just a group of people trying to do what's right the challenge facing the characters begins when a jury selects a design to create a memorial for the victims of a terrorist attack on new york all of the submissions to the jury are anonymous so only after the winner has been selected do the jurors learn that the man who created the design is an american muslim should they build his design anyway would building a memorial designed by a muslim hurt more than help the victims' families and the american people as well does the winner have a right to have his design built regardless of his religion the questions keep piling up and the considerations become more and more complex the answers might be clearer if they could be made in a vacuum but human beings don't live in vacuums waldman shows us we're all embroiled in personal ambitions fears doubts and desires that color our decisions whether we want them to or not i liked this book because it made me question what my decision would be while also providing an engrossing tale of believable characters caught in a disturbing situation","757":"a well written book about a competition for a 9 11 memorial that is won by a muslim the controversy that ensues is the crux of the book i really enjoyed it","758":"didn't finish too much political overtones","759":"story set 2 years after 9 11 a jury gathers to select a memorial for the victims of the terrorist attack the entries are anonymous and the winner is muslim","760":" fiction in which many characters are introduced and you are kept guessing as to how they are related are usually difficult for me to stay with but after chapter one i saw that this was not the author's intent she does spend a lot of time drawing out characters detailing background stories getting into the nitty gritty of motivation and behavior normally i don't like this much but in this book it worked for me not just about religion there's exploration of race class and genderin ways that made me ask myself what would i do it's clearthat the characters are often in no win or limited win situations ironically this entire post 9 11 novel takes place in these shades of grey suggesting a new view of the all american novel as one in whicheveryone has a little bit of a hero and a little hint of a dark side totally appeals to me","761":"this was our campus wide book this year it's the first time we've read a novel and even so provided lots of opportunity for discussion of history and values i found some parts oversimplified and toward the end a bit unbelievable but overall it was an ambitious what if tale that made me think","762":" this book about the political and social pandemonium that ensues after a muslim architect mohammad khan wins an anonymous contest to design a 9 11 memorial on ground zero is set in 2003 which initially to me seemed fitting after all 2003 was the bush era when the rhetoric about islam coming from the white house was nearly indistinguishable from that coming from the fox news talking heads and protestors portrayed in this book as i read on though the distance between the political climate in the submission and the present narrowed despite my best efforts to tune out the current primary season because surely trump was going to go the way of herman cain and surely americans would settle on the boring establishment candidate who is more subtly reprehensible it looks like i have to start paying attention the submission with its portrayal of a near dystopia that includes rampant hate crimes such as pulling down muslim women's hijabs has jolted me to attention more than any of the recent poll numbers in the last few weeks the submission is certainly not a perfect book it focuses more on character development and world building than plot and as such drags but i think it's worth a read for putting human stories to the themes that we are all too familiar with the tension between security and freedom the tendency of fear to morph into hatred and will clearly still be grappling with for years to come","763":"fantastic well written great characters draws on real life events and recent issues to create a speculative but engrossing story about principle tolerance and the limits and boundaries around each as they clash highly highly recommended","764":"greenwood library book club may 2012seattle reads 2012lots of interesting points of view heard the author speak and a lovely theatrical reading","765":"for me this is one of those best of the year books i recommend it to anyone reading this review waldman does an excellent job revealing the layers and layers of emotion that happened post 9 11 around muslims around those who lost loved ones on 9 11 both wealthy and undocumented the hysteria just read it","766":" the book opens with a committee's choosing the design for a memorial to those killed on 9 11 after making their selection they learn that the designer is mohammed khan an american muslim the rest of the book addresses the chaos and conflict that arise can we remember the dead with a memorial designed by a muslim the book had great potential and indeed generated excellent discussion in our group still i found the writing to be sub standard and the storyline contrived so for me at least it was not a memorable read","767":" a fictional story about a memorial to be built after a terrorist attack very similar to 9 11 and the controversy that erupts when the chosen submission is found out to have been designed by a muslim american the idea was very interesting and the author was very good at encompassing many points of view it was very plot driven and the story jumped often to show the perspective of different characters the writing was more informative than literary the author used to be a reporter and the characters were exaggerated and not well developed also i had to wade through a lot of bad language but kept with it because the book was recommended by a relative and i felt an obligation","768":"complex moving thought provoking and completely believable as something that could have happened in our post 9 11 world","769":"this story will remain with me for a very very long time","770":" i saw this book on many end of the year lists in 2011 so i thought i'd check it out it's always tricky to write a 9 11 book with readers knowing so much already bringing so much to the book themselves it's hard to really fictionalize anything or so stay away from \"9 11 porn\" i heard that used with regards to the incredibly loud movie shocked after absolutely loving the book and how it handled these issues and the treatment of post 9 11 politics with regards to the clash of cultures policies and interpretations are always messy well this book deals with all of that by being about all that what i liked most about this was the way that it incorporated many of the different perspectives from the 9 11 fallout - the family members media personalities politicians minorities legal and illegal - with each character in his her own plotline trying to find their way honestly to some moral understanding or to manipulate those morals and or others to their gain characters are fictionalized but recognizable enough a fireman's brother an illegal trade center janitor's wife and my personal favorite a conservative blowhard radio host named sarge not rush in no way could he possibly be a thinly disguised rush the only thing better would be a fictional tv pundit who cries on camera every time someone remotely suggests that maybe america isn't infallible in any and every way shape and form though the plot was fictional it was a nice way of combining all of these real world conflicts not the least of which is the clash of religions and beliefs pitting the backlash against islam with the various reactions of americans the hypocrites the honest soul searchers the muslim americans and so on the story bounces around from character to character showing the reader different windows into the thoughts and feelings of a sample of american personalities mostly very fair and honest not quite so much with sarge i think the thing that holds me up from giving this a full five star review is the fact that there wasn't as much characterization with each of these rotating players as i would have liked there's not really one main character that we follow or root for which may be the point but i just found each storyline to be focused solely on moving the plot forward rather than really expanding each character into a fully living breathing neighbor that i could recognize so much of the plot jumped around from \"will the memorial get built\" to \"won't it\" to \"he's against it\" to \"he's for it \" i almost wonder if the book would benefit by expanding from a crammed in 300 pages to a more expansive 500 pages doubling the scenes and revelations the reader would gleam from further depth on character rather than moving one step along the memorial decision process every 5 pages i can compare this to white teeth where we see multiple characters all converge into a climax where all are involved all with different views but each character was so developed that i could honestly understand where each and every one of them was coming from here i rather felt like certain characters were falling back on type the misunderstood foreigner the angry relative the tricky politician the racist protester overall working with touchy subject material i give the benefit of the doubt here and round up a shaky 3 5 to a 4 star review crediting waldman with honestly capturing the zeitgeist of the post 9 11 fallout relatively accurately portraying the various voices of america showing how we all processed this terrible event publicly and privately it's really not that far fetched thinking back to such controversies as the 9 11 mosque and realizing that twelve years later we are still dealing with politicians who think they need to pass a law outlawing sharia or expand the nsa's ability further to check all of our emails and see if we are writing to anyone named abdul last year one of my 8th grade students said aloud in class that \"all muslims are terrorists \" granted he's just repeating what he hears at home but i think this that the little epilogue waldman tacks on showing us a \"20 years later\" window into the major players' resolution is a bit too kind writing that \"the country had moved on self corrected as it always did that feverish time mostly forgotten... american muslims were now if not embraced accepted trusted their rights unquestioned \" we are currently 12 years later not 20 but i don't know if we will be to this point in only another 8 perhaps she's being hopeful encouraging or just generous perhaps it's because i live in the heartland where the acceptance of what martin luther king worked so hard for 50 years ago this week is still challenged privately if not vocally at least books like this are out there as a way for people to have this discussion and contemplation on such controversies reactions thoughts feelings - if people are open enough to read and speak of such things and even though i still personally have to correct people who think obama is a secret muslim and like mo so what if he is","771":"excellent fiction that deals with the complexities of 9 11 in an interesting way","772":"boy was i nervous to read this i was terrified that it was going to be a 300 page excoriation of republicans i didn't want to read that book i wanted it to be a realistic portrayal of what would happen if a muslim happened to win a blind contest to design the 9 11 memorial and you know what i think this is exactly what would have happened i loved the character portrayal everyone from the designer to the jury members to the bangladeshi wife of a victim though i thought her portrayal was the weakest i thought that to fast forward 20 or so years was a very effective way to end the book however i thought that the book faltered a bit when the secondary violence occurred it felt forced procedural i compare it to the very effective violence in the house of sand and fog you knew it was building in that direction but when it did happen your heart ripped from your chest here not so much it was more meh but i loved the book would recommend it over and over again","773":"hesitated between 3 or 4 stars can't quite work out why i didn't like this more than i did perhaps something about the characters just not coming fully to life however i think it's a worthy book in that it does raise loads of important issues about how people react in quite visceral but illogical ways to events very often and how prejudices are very hard to overcome definitely worth reading and lots to think about in it","774":" this first novel by a former co chief of the south asian bureau of the new york times is a stunner it's been reviewed as the 'best' novel to come out of september 11 2001 and i would be hard pressed to disagree with an innate understanding how we struggle with of our better and worse angels of paranoia xenophobia and self doubt of international affairs of the sanctity of process about tehe intersection of politics and honesty of mob anger of questions about the respect for the integrity of an artistic idea of immigration issues of 'otherness' and of aspiration amy waldman is wise lucid and spot on","775":" i seem to like and not like this book at the same time it was very thought provoking how would america react if a muslim american was commissioned or in this case won the competition to create the 9 11 memorial are we tolerate as we want how much influence does the tabloid 24 hour news networks have in creating our opinions these are all the questions that waldman submits and to a certain extent she gives her answers that said i found some the characters flat at times i found the book working so hard to be serious that it was aloof and distant i also felt the ending was much to predictable and much to tidy","776":"very interesting completely believable","777":"best book of the year post 911 genre strong social themes","778":" i usually don't write much to review what i have read but in this case i am compelled to make a notable exception this is possibly the best book i have read in the past few years beautifully written with sentences that cut so deep you have to stop and re read i consider this the definitive book on post 9 11 america while books i have read in the past extremely loud and incredibly close comes to mind explore what it feels like to search for something that has been lost amy waldman has the courage to contemplate what it might be like to never find what you are looking for this book leaves no stone unturned no matter how uncomfortable and doesn't hesitate to examine motives and interests that have heretofore been left out of mainstream conversations sometimes there are no winners just parties that all feel aggrieved the optimistic realism that waldman creates on the page is the perfect time capsule for the years immediately following 9 11 however this is not a book about 9 11 or terrorism or islam but a book about what is means to be an american in a post attach world it forces you to explain even to yourself where you might fit in in that world and the answer may surprise you","779":"i really liked this story of the aftermath of selecting a muslim american architect to design the world trade center memorial the story is perfectly crafted it's well paced and actually concludes in a satisfying but not overly hollywood fashion walkman writes nuanced portraits of people culture and the press it's a very american and modern story complete with bombastic talk show hosts viral videos and ambitious political figures","780":"an intense read with so many moral dilemmas and questions shot america tolerance acceptance and kindness i liked feeling part of the debate but was taken aback at how much the media twisted the public and influenced reactions i'm not sure i'm really satisfied with the ending i think i need to sit with it a little longer","781":"kind of surprised that this was picked as one of the nyt notable books of 2011 it was serviceable and some of the prose was quite nice but the characters just felt a little flat to me especially that of mohammad khan the architect i think the author a former nyt bureau chief did a pitch perfect job of capturing the ensuing political chaos and emotion surrounding such a debacle but there wasn't enough change or reaction reflected in the characters","782":"a thought provoking look at personal belief and biases following 9 11 loving this so far picked it up and read u0026gt 100 pages before i could first put it down","783":" the submission plays on your concience surrounding the 9 11 tragedy you want so bad to like the book so you don't feel un american however the characters are written like cardboard cutouts and the plot itself is thin at best there is no explanation for why each person digs themselves into their position for the battle and how they became the way they are i felt as if the author just flipped through a magazine found a few blurbs about those affected by the 9 11 tragedy and said okay those are my characters and you never get more than the brief paragraph of insight into what makes them tick i am sure there will be plenty of people who like the book just because of it's subject matter but i was not one of them","784":"3 5 stars i thought it was a very realistic book presenting a tough moral dilemma what happens if there's a contest to build a 9 11 memorial and the winner is a muslim i feel like all sides of the issue were explored basically all opinions were heard in one form or another it was thought provoking but not an incredible story","785":"i could not put this novel down given the abysmal level of public discourse in our country right now this absolutely seems like something that could happen walkman does an amazing job of humanizing the characters and showing how their pain and fear direct their behavior except for debbie dawson geraldine bitman and alyssa spier these three are pretty much just pond scum an important story well told","786":"this book fell down for me i very badly wanted to like it but it had too many problems if i were to re title it it would be well everyone was racist after 9 11 even liberals the characters couldn't hold up the emotions that were ascribed to them and so they were largely unlikeable and seemed like caricatures","787":"my grade b book club grades b b b b b b b c","788":" one of the worst movies i've ever seen is crash in the same vein and by the same writers of traffic it's a movie that takes a certain idea or concept maps it out in ridiculously black and white terms and then takes a two hour cluebat to your psyche in crash everyone's a little bit racist except for those who are not and are thus nothing more than pure victims in traffic drugs may be bad but the drug war is worse it's a knowing nod to those who are considered informed by the creators as long as you agree with what the creators are peddling the submission is effectively the literary version of this artistic illustration of such confirmation bias in the submission we land in the story right when a design for a 11 september memorial is about to be chosen the committee has done so via a blind selection process and it turns out that the winning design is created by a muslim man the story follows the main people involved in the process including the designer whether you're sympathetic or hostile to the ideas pushed forward in the book is of little consequence to the end result which is a straightforward narrative where anyone who is not on the correct side of the issue is a caricature of actual human beings and ends up reading more like an npr junkie's idea of what certain groups act like it's a book begging to be handsold in an independent bookstore in which like minded people can nod at each other because like in the films spoken above they get it and everyone else does not while it's obviously insulting to those that it's supposed to insult it's also insulting to thinking people who may be otherwise sympathetic to a lot of what is described in the book as i am one can make a narrative with a message without condescending upon those it seeks to lampoon it's not satire but it might have worked better with its tongue firmly in cheek there's good writing here for sure but it's weighed down by the message sending and attitude it's unfortunate","789":"i liked the premise much better than the actuality","790":"wow i just finished this book very powerful but brought forth many conflicting emotions i can't wait to participate in our book club discussion and hear other's thoughts i felt this book portrayed well the variety of issues which would have resulted from such an event if you are not familiar with the premise of the book there is an anonymous competition to choose a memorial for 9 11 in nyc when the envelope is opened the winner has a muslim name it really became a no win situation i kept wondering how the book would end how all could be resolved i think the author accomplished a realistic ending i have to admit that i prefer novels that and they all lived happily ever after but this is a book that will stay with me for a long time similar to my thoughts about little bee by chris cleave","791":"very interesting moral dilemma not sure there is really a narative for an entire book no real plot to speak of and felt like the characters were all developed from stereotypes oh well","792":"interesting look at 'what if' a muslim artist had been chosen as the designer of the memorial for september 11 how would i have felt if i had been on the jury if i lived in nyc if one of my loved ones had died in the towers i liked thinking about the different sides groups that each character represents i'm curious what someone from the east coast thinks about this book living in the west definitely makes me more removed from events","793":"more like 3 5 nearly 13 years after the sept 11 terrorist attacks it's hard even for those of us who lived through it to fully appreciate the visceral anger fits of sensitivity and irrational emotions that came in the aftermath america lost her bearings and for a what we can now say was a good long while many of her citizens just kind of lost their shit there was a deep palpable sense of grief and a desire to mourn and it often manifested itself in a uniquely american freneticism we all wanted to do something anything do is what americans do so people queued up to donate blood for victims who didn't need it and then they sent money or volunteered at crash sites or it went on the desire to do thoroughly eclipsing any objective need for activity a near universal desire to find a way to fix something no matter that what was smashed couldn't really be fixed at all this is all to say that the world amy waldman builds in the submission isn't just a plausible landscape it very much is the post sept 11 landscape we lived through if we felt like we were on the brink then this artful novel grafts on another seemingly more quotidian trauma a team selecting the site for a memorial from a pile of anonymous contest submissions has selected a muslim architect as its winner mohamed or mo as he prefers created a garden whose lush and thoughtful design won over a team of high society judges but will quickly find virtually everything about him and his design picked apart the country and the city torn asunder by the questions a muslim designed memorial raises the first thing to say is that such a furor at first feels emotionally implausible we do not like to think that our ideals or our morals were compromised by a terrorists punishing and wanton blow most of us would like to think that america is a land where anyone can succeed and that emotions and biases won't change the rules of the game but waldman's recreation of the sort of stupefied but still very angry new york city of 2003 just a couple of years removed from the attacks immediately feels real the events that unfold are sad and almost come to feel inevitable it is looking into a mirror with recognition at a wrecked visage familiar but not at all comfortable which plays into the one flaw with this book the characters are not strictly speaking sympathetic they are all wronged all tortured and consumed by events all with a few exceptions disappointing with their actions this is real life but it is not strictly speaking fun it can be hard to feel sympathy for many of the characters a vast constellation that includes includes an emboldened but conflicted family representative an illegal immigrant mother whose husband died in the attacks a scoop desperate tabloid reporter mohamed the architect a governor's fixer and claire a juror on the selection panel who lost her husband in the attacks they are rendered in full all very real but not really very likeable in particular mohamed devolves from a likable and understandable guy into a sullen bitter and spiteful shadow of himself it is not so much his inability to understand the emotions his selection have created as his stubborn refusal to even try to understand them that is his undoing claire's arch is more understandable but no less infuriating a tragic benglai immigrant who became a single mother after the attacks kill her husband is an exception she remains sympathetic throughout her story and her motives clarion some lesser characters where less emotion is invested are more amusing a right wing idealogue who poses in a bikini underneath a see thru burka and makes her living shading truths about muslisms and stirring passions is amusingly and convincingly created as is a conservative talk show host who rails against mohamed's design a dissembling governor who wears a velour tracksuit as she uses the elliptical and bases nearly all of her decisions on the memorial on a finger in the wind intuition about how to land her next job is less funny perhaps but no less brutally portrayed published as it was around the same time as a loud heated fight over the building of a muslim community center near ground zero this is a novel that like the very best says something truthful about real life what it says doesn't seem especially hopeful we are a nation that has bandaged but not healed the unwilling protagonists of of this horrific event and its aftermath are still struggling with how to cope why that is the case is a provocative question and one this novel bravely tries to address as for optimism a book that can feel quite bleak ends on an optimistic even beautiful note an epilogue set many years in the future offers an age old suggestion for healing time","794":"this is an excellent lesson in humility it is impossible to sit and read it smugly at least for me as abhorrent as many of the views and reactions of the characters were i realized that it was difficult not to find myself rationalizing their pettiness reading the submission was uncomfortable with characters all too familiar and human this is a superb read","795":"what a great book this is waldman manages shifting narrative viewpoints beautifully managing to look through the eyes of a diverse group of new yorkers and really make the reader empathize with each as disparate as they are in many ways her writing style is clear thoughtful deliberate never overstating an emotional scene or overloading on adjectives but with some really simple and well crafted sentences that made me pause and consider how she achieved such a deep impact in so few words one of the characters was widowed in the 9 11 attacks and when her son panics at the idea that his father's spirit cannot find its way home she leads her two children in building small cairns along a path from ground zero to their house it's one of many small but lovely and emotional scenes that waldman could really have overdone but her restraint and care leaves it a scene that brought tears to my eyes without making me feel manipulated this is a skill especially important when writing about such a painful event in our country's history especially considering the complications of race immigration ethnicity and religion she also navigates so deftly","796":"looking forward to more discussion on this book","797":"starts well and a range of characters with conficting interests are introduced perhaps tries too hard to cover all the opinions which gives it something of an artificial feel sags in the middle and the ending is diaappointing","798":" this is a story about a muslim man winning the design contest for the 9 11 memorial the world is turned upside down with rage when families of the dead and the rest of the world get a hold of this knowledge because clearly this man born in america has bad intentions the best part of this book is how the author goes between the key players in the story the muslim mo a women who lost her husband and is a member of the jury a bangladesh women whose husband dies an anti muslim extremest brother of a firefighter and newspaper columnist it is a quick read and evokes memories and emotions of 9 11 even though this is a work of fiction i believe the misconceptions that americans have about islam rings true in real life people of the world have been fighting over differences in religion forever it pains me that we still fight and that people can not open their minds to accept all people","799":"one of the best pieces of fiction that i have read in quite some time my sympathies kept changing as the book moved u0026amp i'm unsettled by the ending u0026amp i think that's the point read it","800":"this was touted as a book for our time i agree with that statement however it just didn't grab me i read into the second section and appreciate that it was very well written it just wasn't for me perhaps i'll try again","801":"this was an excellent book i don't understand why it's not getting the press of other books out there it is an outstanding tribute to the conflicting feelings of many americans in the post 9 11 era this is book is not about 9 11 it's a story about a competition to create a memorial on the site of the attacks and the aftermath when the anonymous winner is unveiled and his name turns out to be mohammad i think this book to a hard look at many different perspectives and showed you the logical and illogical thoughts that people have about each other i thought the dialogue was cutting and real regardless of your political cultural or religious feelings there is a character in this book championing your ideas my hope is that you can read it and maybe understand some of the other perspectives and eventually realize that we are all flawed and all human in many ways these characters were too flawed to understand each other even the powerful climaxing statement on pg 271 was completely misunderstood and led to a change in belief because of stubbornness that is part of the beauty of the novel even when we think we're doing everything we can to understand another person's views our own cloud our ability to see i totally recommend this book to anyone who is willing to look at the multifaceted sides of a story i especially hope that friends with different backgrounds read it so i can learn their thoughts on the book","802":" 3 5 stars didn't end as promisingly as it started but a very interesting multi faceted take on america post 9 11 set in 2003 an anonymous competition for the design of the 9 11 memorial ends when the jury of artists critics and family members selects a design submitted by an american muslim i appreciated how well waldman interweaves the stories and perspectives of so many characters who are invested in this memorial and the very real internal and external conflicts that result as a former bureau chief for the new york times in south asia waldman certainly displays knowledge and nuance regarding islam memory and ultimately what the making of a memorial really means she asks big questions that are never really answered but which are worthwhile to ask ourselves as the wars in iraq and afghanistan finally come to a close what is the purpose of a memorial is it for us in the present who grieve or is it for the generations to come what kind of memorial would be most appropriate for our current wars that was a question she asked during her talk at literary women u0026amp it stuck with me as i read this i don't have an answer but i find the question intriguing","803":"wow just finished and all i have to say is wow can't wait to discuss this book with my book group highly recommened","804":"too much foul language and prejudice","805":"not as good as i thought it would be but i was expecting alot good plot very plausible","806":" i loved this book it took a fascinating look at a situation in which politics stereotype and fear all bump up against each other the premise is that a muslim american architect wins the juried competition to design the memorial at the world trade center in new york city the fallout from all sides members of the jury the families of the victims politicians angling to make the most of the situation and the architect himself drives the decision making and an ensuing media frenzy waldman a former journalist handles the subject matter brilliantly mixing narrative points of view and going back and forth in time to tell multiple stories it's a masterwork of craft and invention i adored this book","807":"this review has been hidden because it contains spoilers to view it click here utterly brilliant novel insightful humane complex intricately plotted phenomenally good","808":"thought provoking and well written","809":"thought provoking","810":"well written believable characters haunting","811":" actually i'd give this book a 3 5 not a 3 the topic was very interesting the story dealt with building a memorial in nyc after 9 11 when the jury finally chose a gardern design the architect happened to be mohammed khan a non practicing muslim so the response was huge because the public didn't like the architect they didn't want the design other characters were involved all with their own ambitions and problems so it really gave me something to think about it would be a good book club discussion","812":"amy waldman takes on the country's post 9 11 pain and prejudice in this ambitious novel the book begins with the fictional selection of a design and designer for the 9 11 memorial at ground zero the anonymous competition goes to a young and ambitious american architect who happens to be muslim and waldman follows numerous characters who symbolize a variety of constituencies the architect the wealthy educated protestant white widow on the selection jury the chair of the jury the surviving irish catholic brother of a ny firefighter the young bangladeshi mother whose husband a custodian in the towers and illegal alien died the conservative radio host and on and on and on waldman with spare but beautiful language treats them all with well researched respect so that the reader feels that they are reading emotional truth","813":"in a post 9 11 world a muslim american wins a blind contest to build the memorial a really intriguing book but not always compelling these are not heroic characters the best are often spineless and the worst are filled with misplaced venom i would dearly love to think that in the america i love we're not so stupid as to denounce a man for an act he had absolutely nothing to do with simply because he shares a religion and skin tone with the perpetrators and that more moderate views would rule the day but we are precisely that stupid and moderate voices get shouted down only hatred and righteous i use that term loosely anger are loud enough to cut through","814":"what would happen if the 9 11 memorial was designed by a muslim that is the starting point of this turn pager small personal stories melt into a story of national interest about religion architecture culture trust and the question if this memorial is really about the death or those struggling with surviving","815":"excellent book about a blind contest to create a 9 11 memorial a muslim wins having the best design and the books moves pretty quickly into the fallout after it leaks to the press that the winner was muslim really good book that presents all sides and very realistically detailed characters","816":"this is a book based on a what if what if the desginer of the 9 11 memorial in nyc was a muslim it is no page turner entirely introspective and reflective challenging the reader to be so as well the author's exploration of differences in culture race religion and basic personality what drives each of us collide in this story it was not entertaining but demanding and often sad","817":"3 5 really conceptually i loved the book and waldman's and her astute and perceptive writing but i felt the individual protagonists in the story lacked real character development","818":" this was one of those what would you do in their shoes question a jury has met after 9 11 to decide on a memorial to the victims there are a wide variety of people on the panel including claire burwell a widow of 9 11 when they get down to the final 2 submissions claire convinces the rest of the members to go with the design she has been championing through the process they agree and when the time comes to find out who has be selected as the architect mohammed kahn's name comes out of the envelope a muslim an american citizen but a muslim just the same the ensuing controversy involves emotion violence and changing hearts as well as minds including claires if you remember clearly the time after 9 11 it may be an interesting take on that time then again who knows it was thought provoking","819":" i was really impressed by this novel which has a fascinating premise and fantastic execution at the beginning of the book a committee selects the winning design for a september 11th memorial the submission process for the contest was anonymous and the jurors are surprised when they discover that their chosen designer is an architect named mohammad khan an american born muslim when this unexpected result is leaked to the press it sparks emotional reactions from many sides the story's events quickly spiral out of control but the writing remains tight and focused throughout what struck me most about this book is how carefully and swiftly the story unfolds the term tightly plotted is used a lot in reviews and this novel made clear to me what it means on just about every page a new complication appears each new obstacle is a natural believable development but rarely could i predict what would happen next perhaps most importantly everything that happens in the novel is connected and no scenes feel extraneous not bad for a story that follows half a dozen different characters the characters themselves are well developed complex personalities waldman didn't choose any easy portrayals the muslim architect who designed the winning memorial is as patriotic as any grieving new yorker but he's also arrogant and self centered one of the prominent opposers of the design the brother of a dead firefighter gets branded a bigot but is really far more conflicted and confused by his own actions in front of the media i hope to someday produce a novel as intricate and well executed as the submission and i'll be turning to this book again as an example of how it's done","820":" certain events when they happened we all remember where we were what we were doing for the rest of our lives it is not an exaggeration to say that 9 11 is one of those events i was at a class break we were all checking our emails and one of my classmates said that a small plane crashed into a building then people said that america lost its innocence it is sort of fitting that on the eve of the 13th anniversary of 9 11 i started listening to amy waldman's the submission at the beginning of the book a group of jury is having a heated discussion about which of the two finalists selected from more than 5 000 anonymously submitted designs should be chosen as the final 9 11 memorial we heard passionate supports from claire whose husband died in the tower that the garden design was the one for the memorial while the artist who was backing the other finalist thought the garden was too beautiful may not be suitable for such a tragic event but in the end the beautiful garden design prevailed until the selection jury found out the architect who designed the winning memorial plan is named mohammad khan a muslim you will need to read the book to know about the ensuing battles surrounding this revelation is america the proud self proclaimed freedom fighter ready to choose a muslim to express their sorrow anger and desires to heal strong enough to choose one of them no matter how unfair this separation has been to memorialize the painful event etched in so many people's conscious minds living in america for more than 20 years my love to this country has been growing its beautiful coastlines magnificent mountain ranges its comforts and its orders too many to count and most of all its gregarious warm hearted people but i also know there are small minded people here just as everywhere else in the world and there are dark valleys that filth proliferates what always gives me hope and warmth is the belief that most americans are not afraid to face their ugliness their timidity their ignorance and those strengths make this country strong and hopeful","821":" this would make a good book club book for the issues it raises about freedom where one person's ends and another's begins an artistic jury is convened by the governor of new york to choose a memorial for 9 11 the submissions are anonymous and everyone is surprised when the envelope reveals an american who's muslim his motives are called into question as is the appropriateness of his entering the contest there are protests people get death threats blogs and talk radio and public hearings are mean waldman's imagined scenario of islamaphobia and politicking seems pretty realistic so much so that i wonder how she can portray characters like a millionaire with bad hair without being sued by trump enterprises the book drags at the end and the whole thing gets longwinded and depressing and there are too many characters some of whom are not that important i got very tired of hearing about claire burwell's ambivalence for example the book could have been shorter and tighter but it's still thought provoking","822":"very thought provoking one of those books you want to talk to others about hard to believe it's waldman's first novel well done","823":"i had really wanted to read this based on the description and am glad i finally have i really liked this books and liked the creative way amy waldman describes things such as 'like a frenetic wing beat her index finger delicately compulsively tapped the screen as if to blot the words away ' beautiful similes dot the story and i was more than a happy camper reading them it was a scarily realistic imagining of what could have happened that i find myself thinking about similar issues all the time if there was any one fault which really it was a great book and this was my own opinion it was that it was a wee bit repetitive at a couple of points in the story i just wanted to say 'make a decision already' or 'stand up for yourself man' but it was all tied up pretty neatly at the end and i didn't think it would be so i'm grateful for that all in all definitely worth a read excellent","824":" initially i was excited to read this for book club i was very interested in the premise of this book i was interested in the authors take of how the media can affect a story and the lives of those involved i was even interested in the multiple stories that were developed i began to lose interest though when none of them developed thoroughly the author missed a great opportunity to truly develop characters that were all affected by the same tragedy i felt like only a small snapshot of many of the characters was presented leaving me to want more of almost all of them i admit there were some i could have done without entirely overall a great opportunity was missed here","825":"this is definitely a book that made me think it is a fascinating subject and an enormous ethical challenge i found myself going one way and then another and back again just like the characters in the book it certainly takes the reader along for the ride the character of the architect is not particularly likeable which adds to the dilemma i did think it dragged a little in the middle but the very last words ended it perfectly hard work and extremely thought provoking but well worth a read","826":"loved this book it coalesces many of the arguments about religious freedom fear of islam and the meaning of art in a seamless and thought provoking novel","827":" good read a jury is selected to determine the design for the 9 11 memorial the twist the submission process is anonymous so that less well known architects have as much of a shot as those with names and reputations the jury representative representing 9 11 families goes to bat for a garden design and the reigning art critic on the jury selects another more imposing design the garden wins out but when it is revealed that the architect is an american born muslim debate ensues inside the jury and among other motivated parties","828":"very compelling more for the story than the characters though i think i usually prefer fiction that doesn't get me completely preoccupied with our country's totally screwed up political system","829":"thought provoking fascinating characters disturbingly realistic","830":"terrific book really enjoyed this exploration of the modern social human experience gone are the days of jfk and martin luther king when a leader espoused a set of values and over time the community considered and explored the substance behind the message in today's world of fast paced messaging and complexity for every great idea there are twenty people lining up with a sound bite to knock it down before you've even had a chance to digest it's meaning loved the premise of this story a muslim wins the anonymous contest to design a memorial to those lost in the 9 11 incident and the way the story unfolds i particularly enjoyed the way the author took the reader on the emotional journey of some of the central characters and on more than one occasion i was reminded of robert cialdini and his 6 principles of persuasion http www mindtools com pages articl in particular the principle of commitment once you state your intention or commitment to an idea or principle or value or whatever you are more likely to follow through with action amy waldman takes this concept a step further what happens when your commitment is challenged and you have a change of heart how do you back down especially when the back down is public i note that some reviewers have described her characters as stereotyped well maybe but how true is is it that these days for every public issue there are numerous passionate activists driving and pushing their agenda and modern communications provides such a perfect vehicle and learned theory means that just about anyone can get maximum exposure for their personal agenda and how transient the attention how quickly we move on how shallow we have become very clever book loved it","831":"should americans accept a design for the 9 11 memorial from a muslim this novel wrestles with what it means to be american and what it means to be muslim story perks along so the intellectual questions aren't dry best book i've read in a while","832":"http sessastories tumblr com post 2","833":"i waffled between three and four stars on this one but ultimately because i didn't like the end nearly as much as i liked the beginning and i thought that the author had somewhat of an agenda that she wanted to promote i gave it three although if half stars were an option i would definitely give it an extra half great plot super writing it is the kind of book that if i saw someone in an airport reading it i would say ooooohhhh what do you think","834":"what an awesome story i really enjoyed this story very meaningful for the ongoing cultural struggles this nation perpetually faces","835":"the subject matter of this book is intense but amy waldman did an amazing job showing the many view of loss two years post 9 11 and attempts at healing not sure if i love the ending still thinking about that just finished last night but loved the ideas of voice view and submission submitting the author evokes","836":" waldman's interesting premise relies on real history authentic and believable prejudices and the complications of a nation still reeling from 9 11 a jury selects an architect's design of a 9 11 memorial then discovers the designer is named mohammed khan never mind that khan is american born and indifferent to islam...is the united states ready and able to accept him the novel used multiple viewpoints to tell the story khan whose own ambitions and sense of right and wrong make him prickly and unlikeable a 9 11 widow and other members of the jury a bengali woman whose husband died while cleaning in the world trade center the brother of a firefighter who died heroically on that fateful day waldman creates each character with few brushstrokes and i didn't feel close to any of them but did find this novel's concept and execution thought provoking","837":"the university i work for selected this as our common read i'm curious to see how they try to spin this one into a sound decision when the book was so miserably bad by the end of the novel i hated every character and felt like i had wasted hours of good reading time by investing in a book that left me feeling decidedly misanthropic i would not recommend this book to anyone unless they too would like to feel a general disgust for all of mankind","838":"it made me uncomfortable to read at times but in the way that it reveals the worst about ourselves as humans that being said i really enjoyed it","839":" as an arrow hits the bullseye so does amy waldman target the essence of the usa today this fictional replay of upperclass moneyed people prescribing what should or should not be done under the cover of democracy exposes our folly the biased ramblings u0026amp physical brutality of the ignorant uninformed further disrupt true democracy unfortunately this novel reveals an all to probable future for our nation inwhich assumptions bigotry and emotions rule i applaud amy for pointing our our errors and pray that our majority will comprehend this lesson to prevent a real life replay in our current presidential election we must employ reason facts compassion and compromise to survive as a nation","840":"superbly written a large but fully realized set of characters waldman does an excellent job of describing the complex motivations of her characters and the consequences personal and political when it's discovered that the winning design for a 9 11 memorial was submitted by an american of muslim origin","841":"beautiful book that breaks your heart","842":"a thorough exploration of the aftermath of 911 when the winner of the memorial for the twin towers is discovered to have muslim connections while appreciating the way waldman packs this book with all the elements i found myself at times more focused on the feat than on the content","843":"very well done i wasn't sure i wanted to read a novel about post 9 11 mentalities especially ten years after the fact but once i picked it up i couldn't put it down","844":" the submission is a novel populated with well drawn complicated characters focusing on an emotionally charged subject and i enjoyed it overall however i found it somewhat slow reading and found it easier to read a few sections at a time rather than being absorbed by the book the point of view switched frequently from character to character without providing enough text for me to fully connect with the narrative though maybe it was the holiday rush or the cold medicine i took that was more to blame for my occasional lack of absorption in this moving tale","845":"great thought provoking read about a new york art committee assigned to chose plans for the memorial at ground zero after they pick the design they find out that the architect is a second generation american who is muslim which has the group and everyone else in new york a buzz this story reads very true to life the architect himself has to look inside a question who he is and what is his resonsibility to lessen the fears and misunderstandings of the committee and families of those that were killed on 911 i am looking forward to the book discussion on this book","846":"ugh i had really high hopes for this book i was excited to read it when my book club selected it but honestly i just thought it was way too long and rambly boring and hard to understand at times if you read this book read up on islam before hand or have a dictionary handy i hated all of the characters and i probably never would have finished this book at all if i hadn't slogged through the first 70% trying to finish in time for book club which i didn't by then i figured it was too late to turn back","847":"i devoured this book staying up late to finish it in one day it is a darkly cynical and at times funny description of the political landscape of our ignorent racist stupid and manipulated polity it is also sad and touching as we are occasionally reminded that for all the political bullshit real people were lost on 9 11 and even more innocents needlessly murdered by criminally ambitious people angling to benefit from the tragedy","848":"it was ok it's a book discussion book so i had to read it and while it was interesting and raised many good talking points i just didn't feel a sense of urgency to keep reading it but still characters and compelling and flawed and premise is great so would recommend","849":"loved it for making me think so hard had a slightly difficult time w claire's final decision and how she presented it but loved everything leading up to it and after it especially the ending","850":" it's the fictional story of the controversy springing from a muslim american winning a design competition to build the 9 11 memorial the characters are complex flawed hypocritical heroic despicable and noble a picture of humanity under pressure and it takes you on quite the emotional and moral journey i finished the book not really knowing how i felt about what decisions i would have made and not had doubts because of their consequences it was an engrossing read for me despite that fact that i knew beforehand that it paralleled the ground zero mosque controversy and my opinion in that case as well as my assumption as to the author's point of view my two most likely predictions for the ending thankfully did not come to pass this one was far more interesting like any good story if left me wanting more without making my feel cheated","851":"my emotions were out of control reading this book it demonstrates how narrow minded people can be and how the media blows things out of porportion it made me think how it must have been when japanese americans were rounded up and moved to internment camps during ww2 i think this is a must read for all americans","852":"the best book of the summer timely since this book focuses on the aftermath of 9 11 as a jury chooses a fictional 9 11 memorial when the design is decided the envelope is opened revealing the name of the architect mohammed khan a muslim will design the 9 11 memorial all elements of this story charterization plot setting and voice are strong waldman has written a beautiful story about loss family personal relationships and what it means to be an american","853":"this is a very disturbing look at what would have happened if an american muslim had submitted the winning design for the world trade center memorial shows the complex reactions of many different groups","854":" i really benefited from reading this novel with the actual opening of the wtc memorial having recently occurred when i started this book it was especially interesting to read at this time i also appreciated discovering an article about the architect michael arad who designed the real memorial thanks to goodreads' member mckensie the complex personalities involved in this story made it seem very authentic i can visualize a committee of people arguing about choosing a winner in the competition to design this project and the conversations of neighbors on the streets after the winner was announced the conflict of americans not wanting a muslim to be selected was all too real i wish the blurbs about this book had not given that away what a shock it would have been to the reader to be in on the opening of that envelope and what a whole different story had his name been written just \"mo \"i experienced many feelings while reading this book angry and ashamed about people misunderstanding various cultures and judging others before knowing anything about them furious about the newspaper woman's approach to her gathering \"facts\" just for an exclusive i then felt i was not reading a novel and sad all over again for the 9 11 victims and their families the favorite part of this book for me was the epilogue i never suspected the importance of the photographer and the descriptions in this chapter gave me a peaceful hopeful feeling","855":"this is a very thought provoking book dealing with stereotypes and different perspectives regarding 9 11 interesting how all different perspectives weave together in this fictional novel concerning the decision about a memorial for 9 11","856":" i really wanted to like this book it's clearly being deemed an important book by critics i got two thirds of the way through it and then realized i didn't know any of the characters i didn't like any of the characters and most crucially i didn't feel anything for the characters if it's such a damned important book shouldn't i feel something i will admit to some 9 11 fatigue but this premise of a muslim winning the anonymous 9 11 memorial contest should have been compelling and the overall pacing is quite good but the characterizations are just flat and i think in her attempt to show the range of everyday new yorkers from manhattan socialites to joe the contractor out in brooklyn to the morally bankrupt reporter the author worked at the new york times i'd expect a more nuanced picture to be honest waldman overreached in addition while this book shows the effect on muslims it ignores the larger issue of being from the region middle east south asia no matter what the religion where is the marionite or coptic or zoroastrian or chaldean or hindu or sikh mistaken for a muslim it's as if only half the story is here and for a book that ostensibly was about muslims there was very little that had to do with the religion other than headscarves and treatment of women the architect is i guess supposed to be tortured about his secularism but religion in the part of the book i read never is anything he thinks too hard about he spends far more time describing his lover's curves boring and he really just comes off as an ass not because he's muslim because he's a real dick of a guy in general and that's the problem with this book there is practically no one i'd want to share a subway seat with much less spend a whole book with so their sweeping saga left me cold because in the end i just didn't give a damn","857":"an enjoyable read with a lively mix of ideas and current events the main character a muslim architect wins a blind competition for the twin towers memorial and conflict flies","858":" very interesting subject matter tried my best but reading this book was like taking an advanced english lit class that required a great deal of vocabulary work there seemed to be entirely too many lives to get to know for a subject matter to be so strong it was presented to me in a very flat and uninteresting way sadly i lost all desire in finishing this i like to enjoy my books i don't want to work at reading and piecing things together nor having to interpret all these elaborate descriptions of simple things in life oh well","859":"i was captivated with this book i loved how amy waldman wrote this book using multiple voices i found myself changing my point of view between claire and mo constantly i won't say anymore just read this book","860":"based on reviews i had hoped for more for the most part the characters were unlikable which was intentional but for me it made the story less powerful and or provocative","861":"stimulating insightful well written topical and easy to read what's not to like about this book an extremely good possibly even great book","862":" is \"research novel\" a genre it shouldn't be the term sounds disparaging as if the author has used some sort of trick to goose sales and written something that would apply to a subset of fiction readers it should be a compliment to writers who've done a prodigious amount of background work without letting the hours of interviewing reading and note taking make them lazy about the quality of their prose one novel to put in this category is david guterson's snow falling on cedars another is amy waldman's 2011 \"the submission \"the plot sounds like no fun two years after the 9 11 attacks an american born muslim architect wins a bind contest to design a ground zero memorial the action begins with a jury of new york city elites selecting the winner then seeing the name of the winner mohammed khan \"jesus fucking christ it's a goddamn muslim \" a juror says enter the rest of the novel and waldman's mountain of research when former reporters--waldman was one at the new york times for eight years and covered the attacks and their aftermath--write fiction it often reads like made up reportage not true here waldman's used her reporter's training to present fully alive character's from every angle of the 9 11 attacks but one and it's one that is best left out that of the victims' to try to convey that would be presumptuous at best impolite at worst we all have our own sense of the horrors the victims went through that day and the nuances vary with each of us although the submission was published nearly four years ago it's become if anything more relevant in the few years since much of it is about the place of islam in our time and the feelings toward muslims in america waldman's research is seamlessly woven into the story it is not however a didactic slog reading it is a pleasure waldman has the gift of phrasing karen russell and her dark wit and wry social observations compare favorably with tom wolfe's she also has a phenomenal ability for description as in this brief passage in which little seems to happen but much does between a mother and her grown son he wandered downstairs his mother was alone in the living room working a needlepoint in the white light of the sole lamp the frozen set of her features made her look more marble than flesh \"sit with me a bit \" she said and he did he heard the clock's listless tick the rattle of ice being born in the kitchen freezer his mother's concentrating breath he would remember it","863":"while i found this novel very thought provoking and an interesting twist on 9 11 scenarios in the end it left me a little flat i could not empathize with the characters who opposed the memorial and i thought the characterizations could be a bit stereotypical at times","864":"i liked this book more than i thought i would while i felt a few of the characters were simply caricatures the book did raise some interesting points and thoughts about life after 9 11","865":"dragged a little in the middle but overall a thought provoking well written book","866":" a fascinating and timely book about the selection of a memorial on the site of america's most hallowed ground ground zero while i thought the book was well written and the characters fully realized i had a little difficulty with the book the problem i had though is inherent to the whole concept of writing a book about a disputatious issue that is how do you write a book about disputing viewpoints without it feeling like a book about disputing viewpoints again i loved many of the characters and i think waldman's writing is crisp and intelligent i also felt however that i was reading a books about polemics the entire time i was reading a book about well polemics","867":"the story line was great and generated good discussion around issues of tolerance bias prejudice fear media influences trust but it grew monotonous in the middle though there was some drama towards the end it was almost anti climactic i was disappointed in the ending","868":"second half moved slow but an interesting book","869":"i all too well see this hatred and prejudice play out in my life and the lives of other minorities it makes me sad that this author seems to accept that it is that hatred and ignorance that triumphs i do not accept this","870":"i fully agree that the submission is one of the 100 notable books of 2011 as published by the new york times although the story of the selection of a 9 11 memorial in nyc is set almost ten years in the past and the conclusion is set about ten years in the future the controversy and the dialog diatribe is very much on everyone's mind today why did we not build a nyc memorial until the tenth anniversary of the attack why is the new memorial so negative like two black holes in space with the city of new york draining into that void in my opinion the submission channels some of the emotional fury that surrounded the selection of real memorial instead of using that selection however the author imagines a fictional design selected two years after the attack submitted anonymously by a talented american born architect who turns out to be a muslim in name and lineage the author amy waldman does a marvelous job of exploring every aspect of the explosion that choice at that time might have created the story has a somewhat predictable progression as all of the people involved react as 9 11 survivors americans xenophobes artists and human beings the conclusion of the tale set 10 years in the future on the other hand is quite ingenious and even cathartic i am not usually fond of an ending that would summarize what happened to all of the main characters in the nearly 20 years between the decision about the memorial and that distant date but in this case the device works well the author is at all times perceptive honest and forthright about her view of the american society its politics and its press corp even at the end therefore it is difficult to say what was right and what was wrong about the decision about the memorial in the end we must face our own ambivalence","871":"wow i was so impressed with the development of the characters and how each was relatable and real so thought provoking really good book","872":"portrayal of how muslims in the u s were treated and regarded by politicians and culture at large in the immediate aftermath of 9 11 difficult to read because it's probably true excellent character development","873":"so disappointing a great premise but disappointingly executed","874":"well written intelligent and thought provoking surprisingly unemotional the characters were interesting and well developed i would have liked to have gotten more into the architect's head although i enjoyed it very much it felt a bit unfocused it covers every possible angle leaving no stone unturned the author is a former reporter and it has that feel 3 4 stars","875":" the submission by amy waldmanthe inconceivable happened - a terrorist attack on u s soil and two years later it is compounded in amy waldman's debut novel the submission a muslim american architect is anonymously selected to design the world trade center memorial evoking moral and ethical dilemmas portrayed clearly and vividly by waldman a jury comprised of artists government officials philanthropists and claire burwell the only member representing the families of the dead have rigorously reviewed 5 000 applications for the tribute at ground zero each jury member is defined and positioned within the story through dialogue and spare but revealing description during intense deliberations escalating after the winner is selected based on his proposal and renderings \"it's absolutely unconscionable to say he should be denied if he won \" says a juror 19 of mohammad khan whose appropriateness for the commission is challenged a non practicing muslim khan was born in virginia and emphasizes this when he is detained without cause at the airport waiting to be released he reviews his minor sins - ignoring the speed limit over deducting on his taxes and shoplifting a candy bar as a child \"his effort to avoid being seen as a criminal was making him act like one feel like one \" 27 waldman a journalist former co chief south asia bureau of the new york times illuminates the potent influence the media have on how people perceive and react to news the unlikable blowhard chairman his quirks and weakness render him the weak link in the novel of the jury has mandated a press embargo until a decision as to khan's suitability for the job is reached the story is leaked and dormant bigotry long secreted under the banner of tolerance unleashes and drives the story forward the submission is beautifully written paralleling reality so closely and credibly that the reader forgets this is fiction and surrenders to emotions that are deservedly triggered without ploys or gimmicks the tragedy of 9 11 has been chronicled and fictionalized by acclaimed authors including jonathan safran foer and colum mccann and waldman's novel deserves its place - and widespread readership alongside her award winning colleagues dindy yokel january 2012","876":" i liked the premise of this book it stirred up some of the dormant rage at the whole nyc mosque incident which basically offended me on a personal level to an extent that most political bullshit doesn't that said the premise is the best and most ambitious part of this book the main characters start off promising but end up disappointing there was character development but no character growth the main characters basically regressed into worthless human beings i'm sorry but if i wanted to subject myself to that shit i'd watch the nightly news i think the most infuriating thing about it is that there didn't seem to be a point to luring the characters into the identity crises and downward spirals of self loathing that they suffered through i mean unless ms waldman's intent was to actually write a depressing character study to illustrate the extreme levels of stubbornness humans will evidence in order to affirm their position of higher ground morality the writing was fairly solid but overall i don't think it made up for the author's clear effort to avoid exploring anything in any sort of depth this is basically a lead the reader to a concept and hope they'll think story just seeing more of any single aspect probably would have bumped this up to at least a 4 but as it stands it's just wholly mediocre in my opinion","877":"i waffled between a 3 or 4 star review i liked a lot about the book but ended up not that emotionally drawn to any of the characters therefore i went with 3 stars","878":"the idea was good and the story was interesting i really enjoyed it but man the author's love of commas drove me up a wall no you do not need a comma after every single word sometimes her sentences were written in a purposely complicated style just to require additional commas i wanted to take a red pen to the book and fix it i didn't because it was a library book but i was sorely tempted also i don't know if i'd consider this a great tome on islamo american relations after 9 11 the characters seemed rather flat for me","879":"i loved this book there were so many different facets to the issue and none of them were right or wrong it made me think through and identify with all the sides it showed how personal every choice is and how much everything is influenced i gave it four stars because i felt the ending was a little flat and not satisfying enough","880":"we all know muslim terrorists blew up the world trade center in nyc a dedication art piece is commissioned through a contest and thousands enter a muslims submission is chosen but the board is torn because they feel it will disgrace the dedication and offend the victims and their families and just about every american it started out promising but then it became a feel good politically correct vanilla story interesting concept what would you do in this position","881":"i think it's super hard to create a book with multiple points of view where you aren't sure who's actually in the right this book pulls it off and the ending is chilling and perfect","882":"thought provoking but admit it whitney it kind of dragged at the end","883":" what if the winner of the contest to design the 9 11 memorial was a muslim that is the premise of this alternative history although the actual tragedy of 9 11 is never mentioned it's a terrorist attack by islamic extremists in new york city that has a devastating effect on nyc and the rest of the country a jury selects the design without knowing the architect that submitted it and when it is announced and his name is muhammad khan mo to his friends the very worst of both liberal and conservative politics comes out fascinating premise makes one look at all sides of the issue","884":"picked up book from library book club 1 14 2013 after 100 pages i just couldn't get into the book and with a deadline of reading within one month it would not have been pleasant reading so i stopped","885":" i think this book was hard to read mostly the last 75 pages were really good but it took that long to grab me at the end i was glad i read it i have to say though that if it were not a bookclub book i probably would put it down half way through about the novel i found myself sympathizing with most of the characters and understanding why each of them felt as strongly as they did with that said there were a few that i couldn't understand at all this novel was afterall thought provoking","886":"very well written i really enjoyed reading this book what a great debut novel","887":"i'm not usually attracted to books that are as topical as this one but i really liked it it's a very thoughtful novel the characters are all sharply defined and individual there is not much of a plot more a situation that the author has imagined it allows her to explore many sides of the issue of cross cultural prejudice and the importance of societal trust unlike many issues oriented novels it is only occasionally talky most of the time the author very artfully gets her point across through the actions of and interactions between her characters one aspect of the novel that i particularly enjoyed was the interplay between the characters' public personas and their private lives i found it all entirely believable and thought provoking a terrific choice for a book club discussion","888":"submissiona noun1 the action or fact of accepting or yielding to a superior force or to the will or authority of another person they were forced into submission 2 the action of presenting a proposal application or other document for consideration or judgment reports should be prepared for submission at partners' meetings ms waldman has taken a hot button topic in today's reality and blown it up for examination not only is this about a submission or entry into a contest it is also about how each character submits to someone or something else stronger than themselves what they submit to they do not completely understand this book is about the powers and forces that work against us and our better judgements such a poignant story oh and by the way the prose is absolutely beautiful","889":"i know some critics found it predictable but i found this narrative of a muslim architect and his submission for the 9 11 memorial to be well written and beautifully observed","890":"very thought provoking the story moves along very well and has some wonderful prose i highly recommend it","891":" again one of the many books that has been sitting patiently on my to read shelf simply because of the amount of attention it has received as of late however i'm sad to say that in my opinion it wasn't really worth the crazy hype don't get me wrong it was a very interesting book and i will give credit where credit is due in saying that waldman is an excellent writer who has also thankfully been blessed with the talent or intelligence to marry her excellent writing with excellent research skills as i've mentioned before i have many friends and family members who have devoted themselves to islam or who are born muslim and therefore the subject is very close to my heart that being said i immensely appreciated that waldman could not only weave islamic terminology into her novel so effortlessly but that she also seemed to be able to capture daily life and behaviour of bengali american citizens with the wisdom of being one herself i also thought that the story was a very interesting one and both sides of the controversial argument that plagued the characters were well thought out and justified however i didn't enjoy this novel as much as i thought i would simply because i felt that there wasn't much passion behind it as if it was written for the sake of being written so that we the readers as free thinking individuals could question our morals and sense of justice in a fictional playing field or if it wasn't written for that reason alone maybe this novel had to exist for the sake of pointing out a personal opinion or observation of the author and her surroundings but for whatever reason i still think this was a fairly good book worth reading if recent events are interesting enough to you to be explored in a work of fiction","892":"intriguing idea for a book but the characters are not well developed u0026amp the plot is not that interesting there could have been more detail about the islamic elements of architecture overall a little disappointing still worth a read","893":"interesting","894":" i'd really rate this 1 5 stars but one star is too harsh for me this novel didn't deliver on its superb concept i didn't get emotionally involved at all the writing style seemed very flat and superficial to me lots of straight dialogue fulfilling stereotypes or blatantly working to dispel stereotypes with cringeworthy awkwardness and most irritating of all was the representation of nations and nationalities outside of the us it drove me mad in the novel's defence i'm not the target reader i hope it is a cathartic and thought provoking read for people personally affected by the events of 9 11 not that i wish to imply that i was unaffected by those events but the effect on me was very much as a foreigner the submission was far from unreadable but it came nowhere close to touching me","895":"this review has been hidden because it contains spoilers to view it click here this book has made me wonder if i'm ethically morally inflexible to me khan was very clearly in the right 100% and in any of the characters' shoes i never would've for a moment considered backing down no matter what is that a good thing at the end i really did admire the committee members who came off so pretentiously in the beginning","896":"i can't count the times that i have been disappointed by a book with a terrific premise and a lousy execution many writers have excellent imaginations but lack the skills to do justice to their great ideas luckily that is not the case for amy waldman in the submission from the first time i heard about the book i wanted to find out how the author would deal with the complex concept behind the plot i have to admit i was skeptical that waldman or any writer for that matter would be able to wrestle with the topic in a way that would satisfy me i was pleasantly surprised while i will not give away the ending i was happy to see waldman take readers more than twenty years after the events of the book and leave us with a plausible and fulfilling ending throughout the book waldman moves among various perspectives including mohammad khan the gifted architect claire burwell the conflicted widow and asma anwar the single mother and illegal immigrant however the attention is spread so thin that there were times i craved some intimacy at one point claire looks at sets of nesting dolls representing her family and sees a claire fit within a claire etc \"each time she thought she had reached the last claire the true and solid one she was proved wrong she couldn't find her own core \" one of the novel's flaws is that like claire we are unable to get at the core of any of the characters waldman relies on the extraordinary events to carry the book but at times that is not enough one of the more unnerving elements is the realistic depiction of the political divide in the united sates this plays out in waves after the memorial design is chosen at first i was disturbed by the portrayal of the opposition i wanted to believe that these protests are exaggerated that no one would make such statements or engage in such offensive actions however to be fair waldman shows excesses and embarrassments on both ends of the political spectrum and claire's words at the end of the book apply to those on both sides \"i felt like little by little i was pushed--by him khan among others--until i found myself on the other side of a line i hadn't wanted to cross \"would i advocate for khan's design absolutely however over the course of the book many other more important and more complex questions arise about art family community and integrity to accomplish this waldman reveals plot twists and bits of information at just the right moments i found myself again and again surprised and drawn in by events i would recommend this to book clubs and to anyone who likes a story that invites controversy and conversation","897":" interesting look and not unrealistic of an anonomous competition to design the 9 11 memorial the characters include the wealthy widow on the committee the fireman's brother the pakistani widow of an illegal alien working as a janitor in the building as well as the expected politicians and political activists the selection committee makes a decision on the meorial design and when the name is revealed it is an american muslim it was worth reading to investigate our stereotypes and the emotions following this tragedy it ranked three stars because it was a bit predictable in this regard the ending eeked it up maybe a half a star at the end of the book worth reading","898":"another great book group read is the submission a debut novel from american journalist amy waldman a jury has gathered in manhattan to choose a memorial for the victims of a terror attack the selection process is anonymous and when the envelope is opened the jurors discover they have chosen an american muslim which immediately causes opposition and debate into whether another architect should be selected instead as news of his selection is leaked the outcry and debate which ensues threatens all who are involved this is a thought provoking read which is tightly plotted showing the views from all sides as we deftly see the action through the eyes of a large cast of characters for a debut novel this reads like a dream it is a subtle read which shows how one's actions and reactions can cause huge ripples within and around our world","899":"i enjoyed reading this although the literary quality wasn't as high as some other recent books i've read some of the characters veered too close to cartoons but the ideas presented were compelling most characters had some nobility in them but all to varying extents were flawed prejudiced and fearful the book sparked a lot of discussion for me and i am grateful to waldman for that","900":"the glib the political the new yorkish the problem of name association outward appearance and art it took me a while to get through sentences like claire's favorite was the chiaroscuro of winter that is not a type of drawing or painting it's a description... you wouldn't say my favorite is the light dark of winter or this sentence from the first page ariana without consultation or it appeared compunction had taken pride of place giving notice of her intent to prevail this is before we know who anyone is at a gathering at gracie mansion compunction sounds contrived although later perhaps the reader understands there will be plenty of uneasiness due to guilt from geometric cladding one proceeds to p 27 where there's a lovely description of how architecture uses space as material to be shaped -- like silence -- and on it goes good food for thought couched in a formulaic thriller i confess i skimmed it and my eye didn't stop to read much twice","901":"interesting story about a muslim who designs the memorial for 9 11 victims and all those involved","902":"one of the best books i've read this year dramatic and smart and very well written very realistic characters jump off the pages in a compelling plot","903":"4 5 stars characters stayed with me between readings","904":"the submission at first struck me as a pastiche of cookie cutter character stereotypes it was only after i began to look at the book as a satire of society that it began to be more enjoyable for me amy waldman does make a character type for every self important self possessed self righteous silly unyeilding uninformed politically correct incorrect opinion out there regarding islam following the 9 11 attacks the only thing missing are the loud mouthed radio talk show hosts most of the characters remain distant shadows of fully realized characters but a few standout mo mohammed the architect who wins the memorial competition for a 9 11 memorial in a supposedly blind jury selection sean a good for nothing younger brother whose older brother patrick dies in the towers no chance for him to ever redeem himself in his parents' eyes and asma an illegal bangaldeshi immigrant whose husband was also killed leaving her in a very precarious position claire is an uppercrust college educated woman also a widow who feels she has been smothered by her husband's wealth and position and now his death and who struggles to come to terms with who she really is mo inexplicably refuses to explain modify or talk about his garden model for the memorial even when accusations are made that it is really a garden for a martyr's paradise the muslim community gets involved anti muslim groups arise tempers flare politics colors elected officials' opinions so what's so new about that and events are set into motion beyond everyone's control it is a thoughtful poke at our pretentions and misconceptions about one another and who we are","905":" in the fisher fine arts library at penn many of the windows are garnished with sage sayings one window displays a quote from sir francis bacon some books are to be tasted others to be swallowed and some few to be chewed and digested this is a book to be chewed and digested--on the merits of its writing alone which is simply a delight to digest but also for its meticulous plumbing of the philosophical political and personal plights of a spectrum of characters who are in a way that inspires a mix of awe respect pity empathy and revulsion human i will be thinking about this book for a long time not just a great 9 11 novel a great american novel","906":"well written debut novel topical with plenty of food for thought","907":" this is the kind of book that doesn't get written much anymore the novel of ideas with a wide cast of diverse characters sharp social commentary and a decidedly realist aesthetic waldman a journalist sets her novel two years after 9 11 where a competition to design a suitable memorial has yielded a winner an architect who it turns out is muslim this incident sets off a series of events in which waldman poses many questions about art prejudice public memory and americanness none of which have easy answers one of the most thought provoking books of the last ten years","908":"waldman reveals what could have happened if a muslim submitted the winning design for the 9 11 memorial she presents an impartial perspective and develops characters on all sides of the issues she brings to surface points of view from various victims her characters challenge the foregone conclusion of who owns the role of victim","909":"the author took a difficult topic and made a very thought provoking story out of it that always ranks high for me and i recommend this to anyone you get the story from many different angles and she did a good job of not taking sides","910":"feb bookclub","911":" an excellent novel a fictional but unfortunately realistic account of post 9 11 america's prejudice against muslims an anonymous contest for the memorial is held and when the name of the winner is pulled out of the envelope his name is mohammed the novel is the account of that and what happens afterwards violence protest hypocrisy discrimination confusion while the story is made up the ideas behind it are very much not they represent the unfair and ridiculous prejudices and hate against muslims that rose out of the fear caused by the attacks","912":"the premise of the book is that the designer of a memorial for sept 11 is a muslim much of the story is told from the point of view of the widow who is on the commission charged with finding an architect the winning submission is of a garden which the widow fights very hard for before discovering that the architect is muslim there is a predictable public outcry and battles over what respects the memory of the victims and whether rejecting his submission is mere prejudice","913":"the premise was great the execution not so much too many characters and over written","914":"i found this book very disturbing because in our country that is so heartbreakingly divided the story is so plausible two years after the september 11 terrorist attacks a jury meets to decide on a design for a memorial to the victims the thirteen men and women take their task very seriously and follow the prescribed procedures to the letter and then the envelope is opened and the designer's name read and it's a muslim name the news that mohammed khan born and raised in virginia a non practicing muslim has won the competition predictably divides this country the book follows khan widow and jury member claire burwell and a host of other characters as they deal with the storm that has been unleashed by the jury's decision the author did an excellent job of bringing both the characters and their worldviews to life in this realistic portrayal of a nation divided","915":"there were good things about this book premise willingness of the author to do not fun but realistic things with the characters current events but it just dragged a little wish i could have discussed with my book club","916":"very interesting perspective great discussion material amy brought up a lot of perspectives i would not have thought about if you think you aren't biased i would challenge you to read this book and then discuss it with someone of a different culture","917":"couldn't finish it while it's well written and probably has interesting points to make i was so depressed by the protagonist's cynicism that i didn't enjoy reading it","918":"not extremely lovable characters but a solid though provoking story","919":" provocative story of a proposed 9 11 memorial whose artist turns out to be muslim and the ensuing controversy that overwhelms the project the characters each have their own agendas ambitions and goals the author is not exactly unbiased but it is well written and very thought provoking as well as a good story the story is all around us today 11 years after 9 11 in our politics and continued violence and misunderstandings towards muslims and people who appear muslim or middle eastern it also shows how hard it is to back down once you have taken a position and how carried away we get with an idea without listening to each other my favorite characters were mo and asma who each stayed true to their ideals and convictions despite the losses they would suffer as a result and maybe william the next generation who may be able to look back and see how to move forward","920":" read for a book club this is a fictional book based on a group reviewing the submissions of what building would replace the trade center in nyc after the terrorist attack of 9 11 because the submissions are shown to the judging committee blind with no names attached it is not known until the final choice is made that an american muslim has won and how that effects the out come of the competition the architect the folks on the committee and the world as it becomes aware of the whole issue compelling harsh and worth reading","921":"it was for book club and generated good discussion on a personal level i am tired of all the self righteous people all bent out of shape if someone is muslim it appears freedom of religion means any denomination of christian nothing else as a nation we are so prejudiced it just annoys me so the book did too","922":"this was okay thought provoking thought it was a little wordy and i kept checking out of it but maybe that's just me","923":"although fiction this book feels like something historical it is the story of a blind contest to design a 9 11 memorial a muslim wins and havoc ensues","924":"i had high hopes for this and was so disappointed i actually gave up on it paper thin stereotypical characters and jumpy narrative made this novel impossible to get into","925":"excellent exploration of collective versus personal grief and the politicization that inevitably follows tragedy characters maddeningly real","926":" i recently saw the movie the help and just finished reading the dry grass of august and was feeling very relieved that the 50's and the kkk were over than i read this book and realized that fear and hatred is never over it just changes focus a jury is picked to vote on anonymous entries for a 9 11 monument a winner is chosen but before it is announced it is discovered that the architect is a muslim this well written book portrays a society that is not willing to let go of the hatred and controversy that having the first name of mohammed entails","927":"i was really looking forward to reading this book but when i began it i just couldn't connect with the characters and i didn't like the writing style not sure why disappointed","928":"this reminded me of a tom perrotta book while it was interesting to see the issue from so many different angles i don't think it really stood on its own as an enjoyable book i chose to finish it but i almost stopped in the middle several times","929":" a very interesting plot that never really connects on an emotional level the two main characters the muslim architect and the grieving widow remain cyphers the reader never really understands the motivation for any of their strange decisions plus the epilogue was a cheap device to catch up on all the players 20 years in the future and finally a nit to pick i hate when authors throw in dictionary words when they're better served with a more everyday term waldman repeatedly uses words like 'oleaginous' when 'oily' would have done just fine","930":" this book got a lot of praise last year and i really expected to love it but i didn't i would have given 4 stars probably if my expectations hadn't been so high the author wants to explore the impact of the 9 11 attacks on various communities and you can almost see her making a checklist i need a widow a politician a journalist a fireman a muslim etc in the end we don't get to know anyone really well it's like the movie crash i will say that it did make me think and i changed my mind about the central question of the book a few times while reading it somehow i liked the last 15 pages of the book best when she flashes forward 20 years into the future","931":"this would make a good book for a book club how would you feel as a family member of someone lost in the twin towers if the memorial was to be built by a muslim","932":"amy waldman takes on an ambitious range of themes then examines them through the lens of a fictional attempt to create a memorial to people who died in the 9 11 twin towers terrorist attacks the book works on a number of levels and is literary fiction in the sense that it provides much food for thought and interpretation the writing style is very engaging i would definitely recommend this as a good read to anyone interested in contemporary fiction","933":"the story is about the jury who is charged with choosing the 9 11 memorial design some members represent the families of those lost others are more political appointments the winning design is submitted by a muslim and the ensuing conflicts reveal much about the members as well as ourselves good discussion","934":"i found the dispassionate narrative stance of this book to be a very effective way to develop a story about such an emotionally charged subject though the voice was almost clinical i still found myself forming an emotional connection with many of the characters and i enjoyed the way the story moved in and out of their various perspectives","935":" i believe this is an important book and i hope it receives more acclaim in the future i think this should be a required read in high schools as it captures the post 9 11 political climate and the complexities of our culturally diverse and politically divided country although outraged by some of the injustices and prejudiced dialogue i have to admit that the question of at what cost challenged my overall beliefs about right and wrong i think americans pride ourselves on ideals such as democracy and religious and cultural tolerance however in this novel they became opposing forces there is a lot to ponder in this book about our country our world and our own beliefs i'll be thinking about this one for awhile","936":"so i wrote a review for this when i read it but accidentally deleted a whole bunch of reviews when i was reorganizing my shelves so i guess i just have to read them all again so i can give accurate reviews d","937":"a very interesting premise however i found the book slow at times and at other times a bit hard to believe","938":" this is our book club selection for september very timely excellent discussion book the author presents a situation that leaves readers to dissect their own feelings on nationality bigotry and american freedoms and at the end of the book still not really sure if there are ever only two sides to every story the first chapter presents the dilemma a memorial is to be constructed to honor the victims of 9 11 an anonymous selection process by jury narrows down the winner when the envelope is opened and the winner's name is displayed his name is mohammed kahn and the story begins","939":"i loved this book many different points of view characters were fairly fleshed out and nobody gets exactly what they want great for a book club since it comes at the reader from so many different angles","940":"i thought this book was very well written and described with great accuracy what might have happened had this scenario a muslim wins a contest to design the september 11 world trade center memorial actually played out but the characters were fairly flat which made it hard to really get into the book still it was an enjoyable read and in case anyone is looking one particularly well suited to book clubs i definitely wouldn't mind having people to discuss this one with","941":"i was hesitant to read amy waldman's \"the submission\" as i usually find post 9 11 themed stories an uncomfortable mixture of patriotism and melodrama i picked it up anyways because npr named it one of the top 10 books of 2011 the story goes that two years after the september 11th attacks a new york city committee appointed to select the world trade center memorial design has made its selection from among hundreds of anonymous submissions to everyone's surprise the winner is mohammed \"mo\" khan an up and coming indian american architect of muslim background this touches off a controversy over its appropriateness drawing a striking parallel to the real life so called \"ground zero mosque\" park51 controversy which plagued media outlets during the 2010 election cycle the story was actually written well before that happened waldman explores the involvement of a range of characters from bangladeshi immigrant asma anwar whose husband perished in the towers claire burwell the grieving widower on the jury who comes out in defense of khan's selection sean gallagher striving to honor his deceased brother by rallying opposition to the 'victory garden'' and a host of other opportunistic reporters politicians and public interest groups the book is an interesting take on how reality and perception are often colored by our individual experiences identities and values art rather than a more predictable topic such as religion is an important metaphor waldman uses to illustrate this for example one of the big questions in the book is whether khan's garden design of the memorial is in any way tainted by an islamic theme that could be seen as a martyr's paradise over the ashes of the wtc by terrorists khan refuses to divulge seemingly more out of principle or perhaps stubbornness than fear which raises the suspicions of even his most ardent supporters the irony of the situation as the reader discovers is that there may surprisingly be a superficial truth to that allegation though how it is interpreted has more to do with the eye of the beholder than khan himself even the perpetrator of the tragic event that unfolds later on in the novel is left mysterious enough for everyone to reinforce their own fears and suspicions the pashto poem at the end coupled with the closing message of \"us ing your imagination\" brought home this overriding theme about how life as with art has difficulty escaping associations that others subjectively project onto it waldman consciously steers clear of any deep exploration of religion or civil liberties post 9 11 instead highlighting how right and wrong principle and pragmatism are often difficult to determine when you look beneath the surface characters seemingly on the same side of the debate are revealed to have significantly different motivations while debbie dawson striking resemblance to pamela geller and governor bitman relish the personal political prominence their opposition to khan generates gallagher's initial head scarf pulling villainy masks a more complicated family life and class consciousness that contributes to his views the most obvious display of this though is khan himself stubborn and sanctimonious the last person one would imagine to be the poster boy of upholding muslim american rights in pushing for his memorial garden khan draws a thin line between personal ambition and principles in stark contrast to asma's wish to honor her husband or attorney laila's passion for civil rights alyssa spier a conniving journalist was the most difficult character to stomach a completely amoral and self serving peddler of gossip and insinuation oblivious to or perhaps willfully ignorant of the consequences of her actions waldman's cynicism about the ulterior motives behind supporting or opposing such symbols seems a bit too convenient at times sure gaining money or political power off of xenophobia plays a factor for many people but there are genuine ideologues who believe in a clash of civilizations as well as reporters with moral bearings her writing style has some well written metaphors and passages \"in life redemption was walking up the down escalator stop to congratulate yourself and back you slid\" though it becomes a bit too much and unnecessarily complicated at time her matryoshka dolls example to explain claire's conflicted feelings comes to mind while i found myself vehemently defending park51's right to build at the time it was announced i can see now in retrospect how the price of such symbols can often detract from strengthening the principles they claim to uphold overall the book was more interesting than i thought it would be perhaps a bit underdeveloped by the end but definitely gave me some things to think about it","942":"it didn't really bore me but this book was definitely going in circles for most of the story waldman is a good writer but the book could have easily been several hundred pages shorter and achieved the same effect","943":" a story about what happens when the winner of a blind competition for the design of the 9 11 memorial turns out to be muslim the furor that ensues engulfs members of the selection committee survivors' family members self interested political groups smarmy journalists a heroic immigrant woman and the pakistani american architect at the center of the story who is not sure if even he can say what everyone demands to know is his beautiful winning design dubbed the garden inspired by and meant to invoke a martyr's paradise i loved this book because it brilliantly described the world i live in a world where things big and little the meaning of momentous events and small personal choices are all refracted and amplified in a media echo chamber getting irrevocably mixed up with disastrous consequences for all of us","944":"it has a twist and good ending of sorts more thoughts but they may be spoilers","945":"highly recommend","946":"i really enjoyed this engrossing book and couldn't imagine how the conflict was going to be resolved even the ending was fascinating a really good read highly recommended","947":"this is one of the best novels i've read in years the book is so well plotted and thoughtful that at times i forgot it was fiction it's set in 2003 when a committee is selecting a design for a 9 11 memorial in new york city the competition was anonymous and a firestorm erupts when it's learned that the winning designer was a muslim american the book follows several different people a newspaper reporter a wealthy 9 11 widow the chairman of the memorial committee the muslim architect an illegal immigrant who is also a 9 11 widow and the brother of a firefighter killed in the tower collapse most of the families of the 9 11 victims do not want a muslim designing their memorial broadcasters and columnists question whether the architect is a terrorist sympathizer the truth is that the architect wanted to create a memorial that would help heal the victims but few would bother to listen to him i think i reacted so strongly to the book because of its portrayal of how divided america has become especially in the polarizing rhetoric of the politicians and the media the book is filled with characters who are trying to do good or what they think is right but from the reader's omniscient perspective the actions and motives are questionable the story is haunting not just because of what happened on 9 11 but because of everything that has happened since","948":"a very interesting plot a committee is charged with selecting the design of a 9 11 memorial and after they select the winner they discover that he is a muslim the ethical and political dilemma that follows is engrossing and complex the characters are interesting and fluid like real people and the plot moves swiftly the story really made me think the dilemma is not as clear cut as you'd initially think especially because the key characters do not fit expectations for example the all american muslim architect is unwilling to denounce the 9 11 attacks and also unwilling to say that his design is not a veiled representation of the muslim paradise so he won it he gets the award is harder to say and especially when the families of the victims and the american public in general are totally against his design so what does one do this book is worth a read and worthy of being discussed with friends not a four or 5 star book for me because it is just straight forward writing no lines to linger over no lines begging to be read outloud 5 star story 3 star writing","949":"i was bored by this book by the last 100 pages i just felt like i was reading the same thing over and over i needed a few more storylines running through the main plot and at times i did find it hard to keep all of the characters straight and the book really didn't touch me it just frustrated me the premise was great but the reality was disappointing i actually would give it 1 5 stars if i could","950":"wonderful premise and the author does a nice job of humanizing all of the different reactions we did have might have had to the right way to build a monument to massive grief and anger i liked some of the characters very much but felt the storyline was too predictable","951":"things i did like about the book the conceit a muslim winning an anonymous design competition for the wtc memorial is met with resistance from the families of the victims as well as others who blame all of islam for the attacks the tension between the architect and just about everyone else the portrayal of american bigotry toward muslims things i did not like the multiple points of view muddle the story a few of the characters feel flat the reporter the brother of the dead fireman the female leader of the bigots the ending an epilogue of sorts feels tacked on as if an editor had told the author that more resolution was needed","952":"i really enjoyed the layering in this story as those who were impacted by the main character's choice as the winning entry in the 9 11 memorial competition there were parts of the story that too closely reflected reality and those parts were the ones that made me feel shameful of some of my fellow americans thought provoking in places parts of the ending were a little disappointing but overall a very good read","953":"this book was very different from what i usually read and at times was a little bit slow but so well written what an interesting idea for a book how would america react if the winner of the competition to design a memorial for the site of 911 turned out to be a muslim excellent commentary on prejudice the press and human nature","954":"the imagery used by the author at the beginning of the book is so powerful you think you are there but the end makes me feel as if the author just got tired of writing","955":"what if stories can offer creative opportunities and also pitfalls for an author intent on reimagining aspects of real life events in fictional form amy waldman has taken up the challenge with her debut novel the submission the author envisions that a few years after the tragic events in an anonymous competition for the memorial design for the 9 11 victims the jury chooses a design that had been submitted by a muslim american architect mohammad khan as soon as the news of the jury choice leaks to the press an emotional storm is unleashed in the public passionate and confrontational a storm that is exposing complex relationships between religions ethnicities and social strata the narrative follows the ensuing debates and conflicts both external and internal to the central characters in great detail taking pains to depict a range of different perspectives from the jury members' dilemmas to the debates among muslim groups themselves at the centre of the story are several representative characters and the narrative moves from one to another's ongoing story the architect mo son of indian immigrants born in the us the jury president paul trying to find acceptable compromise to please all sides claire the victims' families' representative on the jury sean almost claire's alter ego who wasn't chosen for the jury and last but not least asma widow of an illegal immigrant from bangladesh while their actions and reflections carry the story forward they are surrounded by various vocal individuals and interest groups interested in the evolving storm waldman while conveying the inner conflicts of her characters convincingly keeps nonetheless a certain intellectual distance and emotional reserve that can also easily be transferred to the reader the real life processes and debates around the memorial design in the aftermath of 9 11 and the suggested uses of the empty space of the twin towers will be familiar to most readers of waldman's book how much the author can add to these or bring to the fore additional layers of complexities will be up to the individual reader to decide personally i could relate to the novel at the issue based level more than at an emotional one i found claire's character less convincing than it might have been asma the young bangladeshi woman on the other hand appeared to me to be one of the most authentic individuals in the novel finally mo's evolving behaviour and related explanations may be disappointing to some readers his early self definition i am an architect and an american i also happen to be a muslim and his idea that his design would provide a way for the families the nation to mourn and to remember all that was lost on that day and also to heal stands as a continuous challenge throughout the novel w","956":"i loved this book it brought the ugliness of america's racism to the forefront in a way we pretend it doesn't exist thanks for recommending this good read k p","957":"amy waldman's debut novel about a muslim architect whose design is chosen for new york's 9 11 memorial is tailor made for book discussion groups but it's more subtle than a didactic issue novel in brief the blind selection of a muslim's design causes a political and cultural firestorm and while some of the players are predictable others are presented with interesting complexity the politicians and journalists are mostly odious and provide some of the black comic relief the architect mo kahn is secular apolitical ambitious and depending on your view either principled or stubborn his counterpoint is claire burwell a 9 11 widow on the memorial jury whose early defense of kahn and his design falters when the media trumpets an islamist conspiracy theory pretty much out of wholecloth with a good balance of sociological observation and close depiction of characters' emotions it's an involving story with an important theme it's making my best of 2011 list for sure","958":"this was a very good book the submission by amy waldman is about the memorial to the 9 11 victims architecits anonymously submit their designs a winner is selected who happens to be a musulim named mohammad khan waldman proivdes a telling portrait of all the major players exposing their foibles and their mutual manipulations","959":"i enjoyed this book but wasn't as thrilled as i thought i'd be the writer a reporter in real life writes in a very dense somewhat plodding fashion perhaps more suited for nonfiction so it my reading of it went more slowly than when i normally read fiction in my humble opinion still a good read if you feel called to it","960":"the author took a very sensitive subject and tried to give readers the opportunity to consider it from multiple perspectives i think she the author presented the story in both a neutral and emotional tough to do way until the very end this is a fantastic choice for a book club discussion","961":"very interesting","962":" this book portrayed the politics of post 9 11 new york in such a depressingly accurate and true to life way that i really can't say i enjoyed it although the writing was quite good and it rung so true i had to keep reminding myself that it was a fictional story it's about how a jury to pick the ground zero memorial decided on one design from a bunch of anonymous submissions and then discovered that the submission was designed by a secular minded muslim architect of course this was immediately leaked to the press and a huge ugly storm of media frenzy grief stricken families of the 9 11 victims and self serving politicians descends on new york this may be enjoyed by fans of ann patchett's book state of wonder because i found the style and tone of this book similar to hers","963":"a very well written story about having a blind contest to design the 9 11 memorial in ny city the winner chosen just happens to have the name mohammed and the protests start to mount it made you wonder how deep are people's prejudicies when it comes to certain things that affect them its alright for an archtiect to design a building but when it involves you does it matter that he may be muslim","964":"what a superb read i wasn't sure i wanted to start this book but the writing observations finely tuned nuances and characters sucked me in right from the start highly recommended","965":"a thought provoking book that touches on scapegoating stereotypes and issues of self image","966":"not impressed a very unsubtle hypothetical political controversy it was totally realistic but i don't think i've learned anything about humanity or america from this poor mo","967":"very good thought provoking and not predictable","968":"this novel has quite a fascinating premise based upon actual events a family moves to new york city from a comfortably affluent college town the teenage son adjusts fairly well making friends and going to parties at one party he meets a precocious young middle school girl who makes a play for him when this fails she films a sexually explicit video and emails it to him without really thinking he emails it to a friend as you can imagine it is forwarded by the friend and quickly becomes viral on the internet this family struggling to adapt to their new environment are deluged with condemnation and notoriety and are forced to hire a lawyer to protect their son from threats from the school and the public although this is the central premise that drives the novel it is really a much more complex and satisfying exploration of a contemporary upper middle class american family trying to hold together in the midst of a firestorm","969":"i have mixed feelings on this one the plot is definitely well conceived but certain sections seemed a bit forced the different viewpoints towards the garden's creator is well done for the most part and really shows how a person's stance on the topic can waver what kept me from giving this four stars is the ending in a way it is very well done but in another way it lacked the powerful message i was expecting regardless this one is worth a read","970":"thought provoking what if experiment fairly depicted all sides and made me question and evaluate what my own stance would be loved the end","971":"a novel about the architects' submissions for the memorial following the bombing of the twin towers with surprises and revealing of our own biases","972":"too many stereotypes ruined this for me although i really liked the end","973":" i cannot say how thought provoking this book was if you are looking for a great book club read that is ripe with multi themed story lines semi developed characters and an ever evolving plot this is the book for you just when i thought it was over waldman continues sometimes with less effect than i would have liked but she continues none the less and it's worth it to keep going this book will challenge your patriotism for some your faith but more importantly it causes you to rethink fear and memoriam how the events on that terrible day in september will indelibly challenge what we think about design td","974":"the winning submission for the 9 11 memorial was designed by an american citizen who also happens to be a muslim the submission explores this premise and how it affects the lives of the designer members of the jury who choose the winner and the families who lost loved ones during the attack to me the most interesting portions of the novel were those from the perspective of mo mohammed khan the architect whose design is chosen for the memorial and of asma a bangladeshi muslim who is in the us illegally i don't read a lot of realistic fiction especially those based on recent events it was hard for me to get into this book i never had that sense of i have to find out what happens next but i suppose that isn't surprising considering that i was working in manhattan during that time and know many people including my husband who lost a friend or loved one still it was an interesting read and well written","975":"intriguing and provocative i liked the way it showed different positions on the spectrum of opinion rather than just the extremes","976":"well written slow moving depressing","977":"provocative with expertly drawn characters you should read this book","978":"wonderful loved the journalism the true fallible characters","979":"this is a great book i liked it a lot the characters were well written and behaved in ways that i thought were believable the clash of art politics and religion was well set up and the progress of the main characters and their intertwined stories was enjoyable","980":"this book club book will generate interesting conversations the author has us questioning out own beliefs and understandings it is another post 9 11 book but the characters bring a richness that makes this a unique read","981":" another meh seattle reads selection here we go with the non linear story telling trend in fiction and the 'dog's dinner' this author made of the stories she tried to weave together a mess of characters never fully drawn in trying to avoid stereotypes she creates them wife beating muslim anyone and just plain dull wouldn't have finished if it wasn't my book group selection made for a good discussion though but really aren't we all just so tired of all the drama people are still milking from the 9 11 thing i know i am really tired of this kind of structure too two stars only for a few of the more interesting story lines and characters but all in all a giant bust","982":"this novel tells the story of a post 9 11 jury whose job it is to choose the design for new york's memorial the submissions are anonymous and things become complicated when the winning design is by a muslim atchitect the novel shifts in perspective between a range of characters involved in the decision and its aftermath the writing is excellent and i loved the way the author played with the different meanings of the title a thought provoking intense read","983":"amazing novel on how religious identity can colour people's judgement and lead to presumptions arguments justifications and ruin the simplicity of an idea of great beauty","984":" when the characters' inability to state their beliefs clearly starts to annoy you just remember that moral clarity would make for a short crappy novel as it is the submission does not seem to be designed to capture how real people might react to a muslim american's winning the contest to design a memorial at the former world trade center site rather it is an exercise in setting types in motion and watching them interact this is not a bad thing because not all novels are written to make you fall in love with their characters the submission seems to exist to get you to ask yourself what your prejudices are and what would have to happen to test them","985":"this book really makes the reader think about 9 11 and how it changed our perception of different races and religious beliefs mixed reviews from book club members","986":"really absorbing the writing characterization and plotting are fairly straight forward and middle of the road though there are some read out loud bits i particularly liked the line about a disappointing middle aged son pushing unrealized potential before him like a baby carriage i wonder if it will age well given its timeliness and the final chapter which takes place 20 years in the future and which could read badly thirty years hence depending but it's a good read for right now","987":"actually read it for the second time because of book club and had forgotten certain aspects so i'm glad i re read it should make for a good discussion","988":"this review has been hidden because it contains spoilers to view it click here up until the end i thought this book was pretty bad to me the writing seemed simplistic like a michael crichton book the characters were completely one dimensional either they were good or bad and we got little if any insight into their lives beside their political role in the story while the basic premise of the book is terrific the political debate was shallow worse it was completely biased wouldn't it have been more interesting to actually create a compelling conservative argument up until the end i thought this book was pretty bad to me the writing seemed simplistic like a michael crichton book the characters were completely one dimensional either they were good or bad and we got little if any insight into their lives beside their political role in the story while the basic premise of the book is terrific the political debate was shallow worse it was completely biased wouldn't it have been more interesting to actually create a compelling conservative argument instead of the rantings of a series of cartoonish buffoons the author redeemed herself somewhat in the end by not having a nice clean happy ending where the good guys win and the bad guys lose some of the characters even switched sides that was at least somewhat interesting and there were some doubts left in the end about mo's motivations for creating a modified garden more","989":"excellent book very well written would highly recommend","990":"a contest is held for a 9 11 memorial submissions are anonymous the selection committee is composed of artists art critic an aide to the governor a 9 11 family representative and others the submissions are narrowed to two the family representative claire wants the garden the artist wants the other one claire and the artist lobby the other members of the committee claire wins then they find out the architect of the garden is mohammed khan how will the public will respond the mayor is in favor of khan the governor is not the families are not united the press has a field day there are demonstrations on both sides there is pressure imposed on all sides the artist becomes adament that the committee support their initial choice all agree except the governor's aide and claire claire insists she needs to know what influenced khan and what he intended the book tells the story of the resolution through the eyes of khan claire a reporter an illegal immigrant pakistani whose janitor husband was killed on 9 11 paul the head of the committee and sean a leader of the families against the garden designed by khan and a brother of a fireman first responder who died at the twin towers the reactions were predictable the impact and changing views of some of the individuals narrators as the debate rages were not so predictable the response to the fact that the architect was muslim was predictable and in most part shameful that is the reason i did not want to read the book and would not have but for the fact that it was on the list of options for the one book program and i am on the committee that selects the books for the program","991":"it took me some time to get a hold on the various points of view pov and who the main characters were but once that all got sorted out i was hooked as the book delved into cultural and societal issues that rarely are addressed openly if you want a light and fluffy read don't pick this novel but for those who don't mind increasing their literary vocabulary and opening their minds this book has a lot of meat to cover it doesn't neatly tie into a pretty little bow just like life","992":" read the original german version here i got this book as an arc from the german publisher heyne i came across this book by chance read a few pages of the excerpt and knew instantly that i just had to read the whole novel and i haven't been disappointed it is a very fascinating debate about the us after 9 11 and shows successfully the complexity of emotions and that there is not one correct reaction or that the rationally right solution is also feeling right emotionally and i'm not only ttalking about the characters in the novel but also about me as the reader at least as far as i am able to imagine the feelings caused by the attacks as someone with no personal ties to the people directly affected and that the ability to be affected as a reader is one of the great things about this novel it always feels realistic as if everything really could have happened this way if someone with an islamic background and name would ahve won the open competition and such a competition really happened the reactions from the different persons in the novel all feel real and never exaggerated even though most of the characters are reduced to a few characteristics mostly their reaction and opinion towards the memorial but then again in the context of the novel this reduction makes sense at least for me the end of the plot contains a time lapse in the future and that happened a bit to sudden and out of nowhere for me there was a tonal change for me that just did not fit to the rest of the book but i have to admit i can think of another way to end the book without leaving all questions unanswered judging purely by the entertainment value this surely is not the best book i have read this year but it is one i will continue to think about for quite a while after finishing it and by the way i really like mos or rather the authors conceptions for the memorial and i am a tad sad that it is just fiction sound like it would have made a great place","993":"we had a really great discussion about reading into the intention of a muslim architect who hypothetically won the bid to build the 911 memorial in new york great book club book","994":"excellent written book allows one to think on many different levels which way would be correct","995":"an unbelievable book that unlike many dealing with the september 11th attacks had something original to say full of moral ambiguity it was thought provoking and made me question my beliefs don't be deceived by the first few chapters it is well worth the read","996":" thought for the day if we are to achieve a richer culture rich in contrasting values we must recognize the whole gamut of human potentialities and so weave a less arbitrary social fabric one in which each diverse human gift will find a fitting place margaret meadthe above passage came to me as one of a series of daily inspirational messages i receive margaret mead makes the same point waldman makes in her novel we in the us must learn to regard each person as unique not to judge by stereotypes playing on the tragedy of 9 11 waldman creatively shows the dangers of the anti islam sentiment which roared to life in 2001 having lived in missouri in the 1940's and early 50's and witnessed discrimination there i am today dismayed at the game certain local politicians play to generate distrust and fear in prince william county in 2011 thus the book accurately reflects the world i live in we still have a long way to go to achieve the american dream the novel focuses on claire the widow of a 9 11 victim and a member of the committee to select the memorial to the many victims of that attack on our country after committing to support the garden design of mohammed khan she then withdrew that support for a multiplicity of reasons in each of us i imagine a similar multiplicity of motivations runs rampant each day of our lives granted that waldman has given us this realistic look at human psychology i was yet left feeling empty and disappointed in the character claire the illegal immigrant asma takes claire's place as the recipient of this reader's sympathy the novel is sobering not fun to read but one i'm glad to have read","997":"book club book","998":"this novel about the controversy surrounding the selection of a muslim's design for a 911 memorial captures the divides in this country since the event the ending was not what i expected but i liked how waldman tied it up","999":"ok keeps you turning the pages but it falls apart at the end and i didn't like the glib pat characterization never felt like the characters in this book were real people","1000":"the anonymous winning bid to rebuild at the world trade center is won by a muslim a little too much stereotyping of the characters a fast easy read but nowhere in my opinion as great and insightful a read as many critics say","1001":"this drew me right in with it's subject i really enjoyed the story the characters and the subject i felt waldman did an amazing job of making the story realistic while i didnt like most of them they were well developed and had an interesting part to play in the story i was divided when i finished the story well crafted and a great and timely read","1002":"extremely interesting weave of characters and thought provoking situations i doubt i would have chosen this myself but i am grateful someone else chose for me","1003":" i had read a good review of this book somewhere so when i saw the audio book at my library i checked it out add another piece of literature to the post 9 11 genre an interesting premise the winner of the architectural contest to design the 9 11 memorial is an islamic american of course great moral conflicts and tragedy ensue i think this would have been better read than listened to i probably missed a lot of the nuances that the written word would have delivered the sad thing is this series of events could so likely play out today","1004":"who gets to decide on a 9 11 memorial","1005":"well written but i just couldn't get into it","1006":" i think a book dealing with subject matter like this 9 11 islamophobia has the potential to be either really hackneyed or exploitative but waldman does a good job balancing perspectives and nothing feels overwrought the issues the submission deals with are complex and its author treats them as such in the end the book reveals itself to be a really stunning work about the healing process i particularly loved all the architecture metaphors relating to loss grief nostalgia highly recommended","1007":"similes and metaphors like whoa and incredible story with excellent writing","1008":"fiction interesting premise a muslim wins competition to design the 9 11 memorial in nyc all hell breaks loose when it's announced half way through i was overwhelmed by the tension hatred u0026amp angst and didn't continue similar themes with zeitoun dave eggers non fiction about a muslim's treatment in new orleans during hurricane katrina both sad stories","1009":"thought provoking the ending was unsettling in a realistic way very topical issue","1010":" a really fantastic piece of 9 11 related fiction imagining a scenario in which a competition to design the 9 11 memorial is won by an architect named mohammad with plenty of echoes of the so called ground zero mosque controversy it delves deeply into the attitudes assumptions agendas and emotions of a diverse cast of characters of different backgrounds and perspectives the writing is masterful i got chills more than once it was wonderful to be able to read this around the tenth anniversary of sept 11","1011":"a work of fiction that feels all too real a 2003 panel of new yorkers appointed by the governor reviews the anonymous submissions for a memorial to the 9 11 victims only to find the proposal that wins their approval is from an american born muslim the firestorm this revelation unleashes leaves none of them unscathed and the author brilliantly captures the moral dilemmas political calculations and media manipulation the title appears to have multiple meanings representing the proposal at the center of the controversy and meaning \"yielding\" - something that both refers to the heart of muslim faith that requires submission to god and the fact that the winning proposal's creator mo short for mohammed - who is not even a practicing muslim - refuses to yield in any way on principle even when doing so would ease the way for resolution at one point the author uses the imagery of russian nesting dolls to explain the confusing layers of feelings claire feels as she struggles to understand why she can't find her own core - what she truly believes claire is a widow of a 9 11 victim and the one panel member who represents the \"families \" and therefore carries a special burden in the wake of their disapproval of the submission that she found most beautiful and healing the nesting dolls image works well as a metaphor for the novel itself which reveals emotions and consequences in layers - tragedies within tragedies - some of them melodramatic and some more subtle and nuanced but all of them collectively showing that the healing process from such a profound loss is tortuous and complex i particularly liked the way the author made the main characters so believable - often talented brilliant or even well intentioned but still very human and flawed the ending of the book was poignant fast forwarding 20 years to see what happened to the main characters and with a touching human connection at its coda i had just finished reading the non fiction the muslim next door by sumbul ali karamali when i picked up this novel which added significantly to my understanding of the complexities of the clash and confusion between religion and culture this story explores","1012":"such a compelling and yet difficult read i was so agitated through most of it the author really effectively portrayed all of the different perspectives i went back and forth between anger to sympathy toward each of the sides it was really good to look at all sides of the issue i was left with a lot to think about","1013":"4 5 rating","1014":"very realistic feeling and does a wonderful job of exploring human fears and prejudices transitions could have been more clearly organized i sometimes felt like i'd missed something until i figured out it was a different person's pov and or a flash back or forward","1015":"i didn't finish this book i plot idea was very interesting to me a contest to create a memorial for a building destroyed by a terrorist attack the chosen winner is a muslim i just couldn't like any of the characters and while the story idea was very intriguing the author's writing just didn't draw me in it's really unusual for me not to complete a book once i start it but i've come to realize there is always another one waiting for me to try","1016":"too much angst leads to a frustrating read reinforces idea that the media distracts us from the issues at hand","1017":"a muslim wins an anonymous competition for a ground zero 9 11 memorial design and sets off post 9 11 ny style culture wars has a lot going for it especially some good writing but didn't care for it that much maybe because i couldn't find any character or side to root for","1018":"i really liked this book although i kept on wanting more i think i've been spoiled by the epic satisfaction of franzen regardless this book is incredibly topical well written engaging and all that delightful stuff","1019":"a 9 11 novel for someone who has never read a blog","1020":"it's scary because of how close it comes to the reality of what hatred misunderstanding breeds","1021":" like the barbarian nurseries which i also loved this book takes a hot button contemporary issue this time it's the post 9 11 anti muslim prejudice then creates complex characters representing all the nuances of the issue but they aren't just caricatures except for the ones who are supposed to be this book was the ubiquitous page turner i really couldn't stop until i was finished sometimes having so many protagonists is a little dizzying but it accentuates the complexity of the issue without taking away from the story","1022":" an intriguing premise wasn't enough unfortunately to keep me enthralled to the end of this book all of the characters felt cold to me with the exception of the pakistani widow whose plight so interestingly parallels that of claire the official 9 11 widow on the committee waldman could have written a novel just about these two women wealthy white and acknowledged on one hand marginalized brown and unseen on the other instead she fills out an entire cast of people many of them stereotypes i found it hard to care about or to care for","1023":"there are many important ideas in this story but i found the writing style and character development unequal to the task of making those ideas in to a remarkable book this book is a selection for a book group i am in and that is the sole reason i spent my time reading this book through to the end","1024":"i had no idea a book could be this badly written and still get published this book and its characters are so shallow and one dimensional it really grated to plan as in the 'best of all planners' is deliberately mistranslated as 'plot'i suggest the author gets a brain for a much better examination of the same theme read jennifer zobair's 'painted hands' instead read emma clark on gardens and understand things as they should be understood read ahdaf soueif on dysfunctional relationships read rumi on longing read anyone else on real actual grief just don't waste your time reading this book it is unbelievably amateurish overly written extremely vapid a stunning failure on all counts","1025":" my book club selected this novel about the fallout following the discovery that a muslim designed a 9 11 memorial selected by a blind jury i give it high marks for raising and not always answering fascinating questions about tolerance and faith as an actual novel though i thought it dragged in the middle and i felt sometimes that the characters existed solely to espouse certain views now i understand that the nature of claire for example is that she felt ambivalent but i didn't feel that she earned her ambivalence i didn't buy that a single meeting with alyssa spier changed rational steadfast claire to a doubter i'm sure that others will disagree though and i anticipate a spirited book club discussion about this book","1026":"not as good as i'd hoped though it was a sobering way to spend the 9 11 commemorative weekend the characters just seemed to talk more like positions than people","1027":"waldman presented many different perspectives on an interesting base question and i could understand and even relate to many of the expressed views i can also express personal appreciation for the two main twists the death and the cameraman but i would also like to express my wish that the story was shorter or moved faster just saying","1028":"i found this book intriguing it generated a great book club discussion heard author speak at sun valley writers conference discussion on the meaning of memorials was fascinating looking forward to her next book","1029":"4 5 stars this book was wonderful sad exciting and will make you uncomfortable with it's sheer plausibility it really makes you think about our post 9 11 america and about the damage that fear can do she writes in many points of view with many characters and yet they all seem understandable even if their views are starkly different there are no clear heroes or villians here just very human","1030":"this probably would have made a good book club book since it brought up some interesting issues it was exciting and i wanted to know what would happen next but i didn't really like any of the characters","1031":"great premise very thought provoking showing the problem from many points of view brought the characters to life some more than others i felt some characters weren't fleshed out the way i would have liked over all this was well done and it will stay with me for a while","1032":"not sure if this is really a 4 maybe a 3 5 liked the beginning then is waxed and waned for me so i put itdown skimmed through the rest later so maybe my review not wholly justified","1033":" i have a lot of mixed feelings about this book the story is compelling and touches on important issues waldman does a good job of presenting many different viewpoints however in doing so makes each of the characters somewhat of a caricature of the group they each represent the dialogue isn't great and there's really only one character that remains sympathetic and likable throughout the entire book asma though i didn't love the ending i appreciated that it complicated things rather than coming to some cleaner resolution as i'd expected it to","1034":" from the jacket a jury gathers in manhattan to select a memorial for the victims of a devastating terrorist attack their fraught deliberations complete the jurors open the envelope containing the anonymous winner's name and discover he is an american muslim their conflicted response is only a preamble to the country's this book looked at the issues from all angles through each character's perspective it was thoughtful and interesting and made me consider many points of view it was also interesting to think about how each character's action or reaction led to another which either eased a situation or made it more explosive a really good book","1035":"this book is almost like a time machine putting us right back into those painful angry suspicious times of the early years after 9 11 the author does a really fantastic job of bringing all of those feelings and those voices back to life in a story surrounding the imagined reaction if a muslim had been chosen to represent our nation's grief even though this story is fiction so many of the voices and the feelings felt so familiar i was completely sucked in to the debate in the book and at the same time i found myself debating in my head has our real world moved on from that time or could someone light a match that would ignite the same kind of firestorm 10 years later considering the fight over the islamic cultural center in ny over the last year or so it all still feels very real kudos to the author for trying to articulate so many of the difficult and oftentimes very ugly feelings behind our rhetoric and our reactions","1036":"this is a very interesting plot that provides us a mirror into our own prejudices i loved how the characters changed throughout the novel and how people under pressure either succumbed to their prejudices or learned to fight them","1037":"a moving and realistic portrait of america in the aftermath of 9 11 and the confusing turmoil that the unites states was thrust into waldman's cast of characters each lend a unique and compelling voice and every single one makes you wish that they would bend just that tiny fraction in order to understand each other yet they don't and that is the true tragedy of the book no one will submit to anyone else","1038":"ms waldman has an amazing vocabulary thank goodness for the dictionary function on my nook wonderfully written and with amazing characterization i quite enjoyed the submission but i just wasn't blown away by it i can't quite but my finger on what element might have been missing","1039":"not sure how i feel about this one the first hundred pages flew and i was engrossed but the rest didn't i can't say where it went wrong or what i would prefer to have happened making this review useless i know but it just missed a mark for me","1040":"a very interesting read about an interesting premise an american muslim wins the competition to design the 9 11 memorial in manhattan the characters are generally well drawn though i felt that the newspaper reporter was a bit too stereotypical and the plot has unexpected twists and turns the book is well written and thought provoking","1041":"originally read in 2012reread for book group feb 2015","1042":"design competition for the 9 11 memorial won by a muslim american architect and the imagined aftermath","1043":"hard to believe how quotes from today's headlines practically appear in passages from the book","1044":" two years after the 9 11 attack on nyc a competition is held to design a memorial to be built in nyc to honor the 9 11 victims an elite jury comprised of artists politicians and the family member of a 9 11 victim is selected to judge the submittals after months of haggling over the blind submissions the jury was not given the names of the architects who submitted the designs the jury picks a winner when they open the envelope to see the name of winner they discover that it is an american muslim named mohammad kahn the uproar begins immediately the author is brilliantly adept in the complex narration of the reactions and viewpoints of a wide varying group of characters including members of the jury panel various family members of 9 11 victims the governor of new york mohammad kahn and his co workers opposing political action groups the news media particularly one member of the media and the bangladeshi muslim widow of an illegal alien who worked in the towers as a janitor there is no obvious right or wrong answer and no pat ending this excellent novel encourages - almost demands - the reader to think and consider the fact that it is an interesting read is a bonus this novel has been chosen as entertainment weekly's favorite novel of 2011 esquire's 2011 book of the year a new york times notable book for 2011a washington post notable fiction book for 2011one of npr's 10 best novels of 2011","1045":"this book bored me i finished it but never really looked forward to picking it up the characters were irritating and the plot was lackluster just didn't get much from it but probably good for those who prefer brainless beach reads","1046":" stunning writing in a quiet confident way that doesn't call attention to itself unless you're a huge writing snob that notices unnoticeably superb writing sensitive when necessary around such an orchestra of delicate topics but also honest without hesitation or timidity and such a diverse cast of characters with each one fully realized fully alive equally compelling skill i found the epilogue a little disappointing as i felt the book was drawing itself towards an ambiguous ending but as a whole this book earns every bit of the praise that's gathered around it","1047":"i really liked the plot of this book it really makes you think how we treat people in this country my only gripe is that i really didn't connect with any of the characters","1048":"the concept -- a blind jury accidentally picking a muslim to design a 9 11 memorial and the shitshow that followed -- was a good one ultimately though the book needed stronger characters to stand on or perhaps fewer of them it was an enjoyable enough read but i found myself disappointed by the attempts to explain the motivations of the intolerant they just felt really incomplete in comparison to the protagonists which defeated a bit of what intrigued me about the book in the first place it's not really fair to examine america's political soul if you're going to dismiss the foxnews crowd's perspective as unworthy of serious reflection","1049":"underwhelmed by this one the premise seemed interesting but it took me a while to get through","1050":" a very thought provoking book a competition to design a memorial for a wtc type disaster in nyc to be democratic the submissions do not have names attached and the selection will be on design only the jury artists professors politicial appt widow decide on a garden submission then slowly information is leaked by a fox news type press and the architect is revealed to be an american who happens to be muslim with information and mis information spiraling out of control truth and lies everywhere we see so many sides of how this is handled from grieving families extremists the architect the press and politicians should the be garden be built if it hints at a muslim paradise garden who should make such decisions you won't leave this book without a lot of soul searching","1051":"the story is about building a memorial to the victims of 9 11 people were invited to submit their ideas and a jury would choose the winner without knowing who did the submission once the winner is revealed the jury no longer wants that person to represent the memorial this was a very interesting story it gives you a lot to think about however i didn't particularly enjoy this author's writing style i found myself going back and re reading several passages because they were not very clear another person i discussed this with had a similar opinion","1052":"the auther's heart is in the right place but her writing is not too many characters too many twisty conversations but the idea was very good in a competition for a 9 11 memorial a winning design is selected by a jury all entries were annonymous but the winner turned out to be a muslim american from indian descent when the news leaks out it sets into motion an avalanche of trouble to build or not to build becomes a nationwide war","1053":"i thought this was a very engaging book and an interesting look at our prejudices whether we like to admit we have them or not","1054":"very thought provoking good book to help you appreciate both sides of any situation political or otherwise","1055":"this book really makes you take a look and stop and think about

others","1056":"great book very easy to read although the subject matter really makes you think great characterization","1057":"disheartening because all the frustrating situations and unreasonable people it describes are so plausible","1058":"such believable characters that i felt like i was reading a magazine feature perhaps not surprising given waldman's day job as a journalist builds towards a hard to predict climax and an absolutely lovely final image","1059":"what a beautiful piece of work i truly enjoyed reading this despite the difficult premise of the book each of waldman's characters have a presence and a voice and they sugar coat nothing the issues of racism oppression politics gender nationality and so much more truly drove this novel highly recommend this read","1060":"one of the best books i have read this year there is a lot for a book club to discuss in this book fiction strikes very close to reality","1061":"i found the ending to be very beautiful but felt that maybe it would have served a shorter story better long sections of the book were given over to quite dry conversations that didn't vary enough in tone to keep me totally interested","1062":"this might sound like a cop out but i think the less straightforward a novel like this can be the better this book wanders its shifting point of view shows the limits of waldman's prose and it could very easily be claimed that she could have chopped 50 pages from the middle of the book still a thought provoking maddening striking book probably the best 9 11 fiction i've read","1063":"3 5 stars pretty good but not mind blowing i felt like the writing was great in places and i cringed at others but overall a decent story that kept me reading the worst part of the story was the claire character i thought she was so annoying","1064":"the ending almost makes it 5 stars with the layered complexities i just wish it had revealed more of that in the middle where it bogged down some for me so 4 stars challenging and realistic as in real life there are rarely clean endings and perfect resolutions","1065":"a novel that raises more questions than it answers questions about

which we still live i would give this book a 4 1 12 but pushed it to 5 because of the writing and the ending","1067":" claire harwell hasn't settled into grief events haven't let her cool eloquent raising two fatherless children claire has emerged as the most visible of the widows who became a potent political force in the aftermath of the catastrophe she longs for her husband but she has found

need to represent anyone's beliefs except his own when the design and its creator are leaked a media firestorm erupts and claire finds herself trying to balance principles against emotions amid escalating tensions about the place of islam in america a remarkably bold and ambitious debut the submission is peopled with journalists activists mourners and bureaucrats who struggle for advantage and fight for their ideals in this deeply humane novel the breadth of amy waldman's cast of characters is matched by her startling ability to conjure individual lives from their own points of view a striking portrait of a city and a country fractured by old hatreds and new struggles the submission is a major novel by an important new talent","1068":"4 5 maybe 5 stars i was drawn in quickly by the premise of this novel and i was not disappointed the characters were sharply drawn the language was dispassionate yet elegant all serving as mirror a literary allegory to the memorial the questions raised by this book are sure to linger","1069":" i hate to read reviews in which people say they didn't like a novel because they hated the characters it just doesn't make sense to me you should surrender yourself to the story you don't have to like the characters at all to enjoy the story but good god this book had some hateful characters so now i'm finding myself giving the low rating of two stars because of these annoying characters though he was one of the least annoying the architect's motivations seemed contradictory and baffling and yet waldman must have done something right because i continued to turn page after page never once considering not finishing it despite a billion eye rolls everytime a character did or said something irritating the book touches on some interesting questions related to memory work who gets memorialized what is the role of public memorials how should the process unfold who gets a say","1070":"would have been 4 stars had it not been for the ending most of the book describes a complex messy and situation where whatever happens no one can be really happy with the outcome just like real life unfortunately the last chapter tries to wrap it all up neatly and cleanly wish i had stopped reading at that point as this ending made everything a lot less believable or even interesting too bad","1071":"i bought into all the hype with this book interviews with the author glowing reviews one reviewer even said this book will be the definitive novel of september 11 not even close the story started out ok then became more and more preposterous was this a farce or did the author truly think we'd believe this ridiculous story and ridiculous characters is this supposed to be an exaggerated reflection of our society that would allow me to swallow the story a little better but i don't think that's what she intended to be fair the idea was a good and original one and at times there was some excellent writing mixed in with mostly pedestrian writing but the characters ugh they were stereotypical and acted just as i expected them to act there's even some weird name dropping where famous people acted just like you expected them to act at least according to the tabloids i've seen these characters a thousand times before and i didn't like any of them which made it hard for me to invest in the story as events became more and more preposterous i started shaking my head and thinking this is not at all believable by the last third of the book i was shaking my head continually would new yorkers really be so obsessed with this situation that they'd need to see their therapists would busloads of people really drive in from around the country to protest the results of the contest would fatwas really be issued believe me there were situations even more preposterous than the ones i've mentioned but i don't want to be blamed for any spoilers the author made it seem like the majority of the people in this country would be incensed about a muslim winning the 9 11 memorial contest the other side was vastly underrepresented most people would probably give this story a quick glance announce a quick opinion then get on with their breakfast or mowing the lawn or whatever most people would not care maybe i missed the point of this book maybe the author deliberately intended to point out how ridiculous we can be albeit in a very exaggerated manner but if not then waldman who has impressive nonfiction credentials should stick with that","1072":"one of the best books i read in a long time","1073":"an interesting thought experiment but maybe not such a great novel the writing is competent the characters closer to archetypes than people reminded me a bit of jodi picoult although this is better i did like the ending and i suppose the way the book depicts american society in the aftermath of 9 11 will be interesting to future historians but it didn't really work for me","1074":"american prejudice is presented when a muslim architect wins the contest to design the 9 11 memorial","1075":"loved this heartbreaking and beautiful amazing characters","1076":"this was a frustrating read for me because of the content i didn't really enjoy it until the end of the story u0026amp then i didn't want it to end the writing was particularly beautiful at the end","1077":"i was so frustrated by events and characters in this book that i realize that they must have become very real to me the garden sounds lovely much more hopeful than the memorial we have","1078":"in the post 9 11 world judgement has shifted a majority vote based on a blind viewing is thrown into disarray when the heritage of the winner comes to light","1079":"i found this book disturbing disturbing in that even though it is a novel it seemed so true it showed the dark side to our american culture a side that is intolerant easily led and reluctant to trust i could really see this happening in real life and it made me feel ashamed that this is tolerated in america","1080":" i would give this book 4 75 stars if i could it was wonderful the premise is fascinating suppose the winner of a blind juried competition to design a 9 11 memorial turned out to be muslim the characters a wealthy 9 11 widow the blue collar ne'er do well brother of a deceased firefighter the designer a ny post reporter an illegal bangladeshi immigrant are brilliantly portrayed and it's almost painful to read as the situation gets more and more out of hand my only complaint was that it carried on for a bit too long but other than that i loved it","1081":"st paul's umc book club selection audio version read by berndette dunn","1082":"an american muslim architect is selected to build the memorial for the 9 11 victims a really complicated issue and the author does a nice job of unpacking all the arguments so i loved the investigation of the issues but it doesn't work so well as a novel characters are caricatures and the plot is broadly drawn if i could add half star this would be a 2 5","1083":"good not great","1084":"i had a hard time getting through this book interesting storyline but it was a slow read for me","1085":"interesting presentation on the effect of politics on the outcome of a process","1086":"thought provoking and challenging right to the end this book did a great job of showing many sides to this issue it could easily have been real beautiful writing complex characters i only wish they had found a little more happiness in the end","1087":"i reviewed the submission here","1088":"3 5 stars the first 2 chapters were dull yet confusing but then it picked up i enjoyed the chapters that have different characters' voices yet then the end slowed down again almost anticlimactic because really how else could the situation be resolved i did like the 20 years in the future last chapter all in all a clever idea for a novel","1089":"very interesting premise and makes one stop and think highly recommended definitely add to your must read list","1090":"fabulous book kept getting better and better i could not put it down","1091":"when i began this book i was unsure what to expect i found as a read that i did not want to put the story down having a firefighter for a husband 9 11 holds a terrifying possibility for me in so many ways reading this book caused me mixed emotions towards the characters and the ideas in the book even several days after finishing the book i am still unsure of which side i come down on the characters were well drawn and caused me to feel angry sympathy and many more emotions towards them and for them as i read","1092":"this ended up falling very flat for me so much so that i did not even bother to finish i skipped ahead to the very end just to see but still did not entice me to finish reading it i just did not care about any of the characters kind of like how i felt with the imperfectionists i had high hopes for this one but was sorely disappointed","1093":"a book about 9 11 and america while it certainly isn't perfect it more than makes up for its flaws that said some particularly annoying patterns within the work make it impossible for me to give a full five stars perhaps a 4 5 rounded down would be appropriate still highly recommended reading for all if only because it seems to tap into the nastiest darkest tendencies of american society if not because of its touching in depth examination of its characters and their lives","1094":"how could a contest for the 9 11 memorial happen in a more complicated and absurd manner than it actually did that is the premise of waldman's novel that derives much of its dialogue from debates over the clashing views and decision making power of public opinion survivor and family members aesthetic gate keepers and bewildered nervous state officials ripped from the headlines fiction","1095":"i read this novel it could have been real now i understand the process of approval of how personality will prevail how one man may find his way while others lose theirs","1096":"provocative nuanced work of fiction that serves brilliantly as social commentary a swift narrative pace and multiple viewpoints of an emotionally charged complex situation","1097":"this review sums it up quite well \"masterful a scathing dazzlingly crafted indictment of the messes people make when they mistake ideology for morality and bigotry for patriotism waldman an ex new york times bureau chief unspools her story with the truth bound grit of a seasoned journalist and the elegance of a born novelist \" --leah greenblatt entertainment weekly","1098":" there is no denying that waldman has tapped into some of the ugliness and anti muslim rhetoric that followed the attacks on 9 11 she does this with great detail and very well however as someone who experienced the events of that day first hand i found myself disappointed that the goodwill and sense of community fostered by the events of that day were wholly absent to my way of thinking it is this contradiction of coming together and distinguishing some from others that has defined the period since 9 11 and in this way 'the submission' can be seen as truly half of the story","1099":"centennial book club 7 10 12 lynnthis book is certainly provocative i'm still not quite certain exactly what i think feel about it the premise is that a committee for the world trade center memorial using a \"blind\" selection process chooses the design of a nominally muslim american it is worth noting that this book reportedly was drafted before the actual world trade memorial was selected and before all of the hub bub around the park51 mosque impossibly this novel feels simultaneously both real--or perhaps more accurately surreal--and counterfeit both true and false there are no easy answers here--the reader is forced to pick their own side or to struggle with their inability to do so--and that is a testament to waldman's writing to her uncompromising investigation of this topic waldman does a good job of capturing the ideological fervor that has surrounded all things related to the 2001 attacks she illustrates the process by which very complex issues are reduced to simplistic ideology and dogma people become swept up in the moment reacting without pausing for reflection waldman also does a really good job of capturing how the media no longer just reports the \"news\" but out of some omnipresent desire for \"the scoop\" actually manufactures the news thereby contributing to the public's sense of fervor and frenzy she also does a good job of layering the book there is a lot here to consider and on many levels one thing that made this a difficult read for me was the fact that this well at any rate not exactly this never happened it feels like an alternate history for an event that is too fresh too raw for revisioning this made it difficult for me to maintain my suspended disbelief also the characters with perhaps the exception of sean feel so flat that they are merely caricatures however perhaps as one of my co workers pointed out waldman is using this as a device to show that we become caricatures of ourselves when dealing with explosive and emotionally charged events such as this one...at its core the submission captures something palpable and true about us as a society a good discussion book","1100":" 4 5 stars really please goodreads add halves it bugs me to be so inexact heh in this story a group meeting to choose a design for a 9 11 memorial unwittingly the competition is anonymous chooses the design of a man with the name of mohammed khan political pandemonium ensues as i read this book i had two major thoughts one was wow it's amazing how realistic this book feels what a coup by waldman the second was this book is infuriatingly realistic i totally believe our society could be this ridiculous and racist just look at our current political discussion i felt like each of the characters claire a 9 11 widow and the one family representative on the memorial committee mo the architect asma the undocumented 9 11 widow the ny post journalist whose name i can't recall were portrayed realistically and convincingly sympathetic when it made sense and unsympathetic when it didn't the last few pages really mo's ending puzzled me a bit but it's the kind of thing that i think would require rereading and more thinking to piece together all in all this novel deserves its praise and i highly recommend it","1101":"in my opinion great concept but poor execution","1102":"to quote goodreads in this deeply humane novel the breadth of amy waldman's cast of characters is matched by her startling ability to conjure their perspectives i can't wait to discuss this at book club","1103":"so impressive memorial for 9 11 is planned after many submissions a memorial garden is approved then the book starts wow","1104":"the saddest thing about this book is that it seems to be accepted as a serious contribution to the dialogue in this country about post 9 11 xenophobia and the attendant deterioration of civil public discourse instead it's a ripped from the headlines pot boiler complete with stock liberal and conservative characters with all the depth of fox msnbc caricatures instead of anyone who might not conform to the banality of the cablenews playbook very very disappointing especially in light of the glowing reviews","1105":"i was definitely put off initially by the subject matter but what it's really about is the complex interplay of personality and class and politics and it becomes a really interesting read i isn't clear how it will resolve and perhaps one criticism is that the ending seems a little rushed","1106":"what a frustrating book i guess that's sort of the point","1107":" this is a book about a blind submission for a 9 11 memorial that is won by a muslim what follow is the angst amongst the jurors political figures and public about acceptance non acceptance of this fact it was somewhat played out similarly when a mosque was proposed in the 9 11 neighborhood the premise is good and the look into all perspectives was intriguing however i found the jumping between some of the characters not complete and not well rounded within the context of the book in addition i found mo's inability to articulate his position about the memorial infuriating to the point of being unbelievable and spoiling the overall conversation by the end i felt the same arguments were being rehashed and just wanted to get to the conclusion of it it would be a good book group book as i think it would evoke a lot of discussion","1108":"the winner of a contest to design a memorial to the 9 11 victims turns out to be a muslim man does the selection committee bow to popular opinion and rescind the award or do they stand by their decision this book makes the reader consider discrimination and how best to balance the needs of the survivors with the rights of individual artists this novel will be a great choice for book clubs i can foresee many thoughtful discussions based on this book","1109":" i loved this book everyone knows the hook an artsy jury judging anonymous submissions for design of a 9 11 memorial find out that the winner is a secular american muslim amidst the inevitable controversy moving to hysteria the author introduces us to at least a half dozen well crafted characters who move beyond the two dimensions of the inhabitants of for example the bonfire of the vanities to which the submission has been compared their perspectives their interests their emotions shift and splinter and re assemble if the 10th anniversary commemorations of the 9 11 attack have brought to mind the sense of national unity we then had and then the question what happened this book provides some sad answers i withheld a fifth star because one i'm a really hard grader and two the presence of one or two over the top characters and an ending a tad too sentimental for my curmudgeonly taste","1110":"i found the premise of this book intriguing there is a juried contest for building the 9 11 memorial and unbeknownst to the jury the winner is a muslim the fall out from this announcement is small at first but like the circles in water expand and expand what happens echoes what is happening in this country politically excellent writing makes you examine your own views and biases","1111":"this was a tough read due to the subject matter but amy waldman has written a fantastic book that takes a hard look at this country and it's many paradoxes highly recommended reading again july 2012 for fiction book group","1112":" i really liked this book even though a lot of the characters are unlikeable people the exploration of people's prejudices against islam is really interesting and made me so angry but that's a good thing in the case of a book since any time i'm reading something and it makes me really think or feel strongly that means the writing is really good i liked mo and asma the best i really identified with mo's position that he had nothing to explain and that the questions he was being asked wouldn't have even crossed people's minds if he wasn't muslim the ignorance and prejudices of the other characters made me so angry since i see that kind of ridiculous thing in real life asma was brave and spoke up for what was right even though it cost her everything i hated alyssa she's manipulative and selfish and had no redeeming qualities i wish terrible things on her character claire was also irritating i have a huge problem with people who can't make up their own minds who are always wanting something more or someone else to make their decisions for them she was the kind of person that's impossible to please because there's never enough information to get her to a decision i find that personality type extremely annoying because it's so wishy washy and fearful every decision she makes is guided by fear at first she's afraid of disappointing her dead husband if she doesn't back the design she lobbied so hard for even though the architect is muslim then she's afraid of the other families who's bigotry is leading them to reject the garden because the architect is muslim she lets alyssa a woman she doesn't even know manipulate her and sow unsubstantiated seeds of doubt and fear in her she trusts alyssa's word over mo's why because alyssa is a fellow white girl so she's obviously trustworthy her word doesn't deserve to be questioned even though she's a tabloid reporter who is clearly looking to make a story out of nothing to stir up controversy mo on the other hand has done nothing but design a memorial that she adored and felt was the perfect representation of peace and healing until she found out his religion so clearly he's the one that should be mistrusted right view spoiler finally she's angry at and terrified of mo because he points out to her how unfairly he's being treated by her and the rest of the people who doubt him so she takes the coward's way out and stabs him in the back asking him to withdraw in a televised statement she can't deal with the fact that she's just as bigoted as the families and sean so she hides her head in the sand and makes her problem mo's fault for shame claire for shame hide spoiler claire could have solved her own problems by taking the time to investigate and learn about islam for herself but did she bother nope she's so busy being a pampered rich trophy widow that she can't be bothered to think for and educate herself like i said it's up to everyone else to make decisions for claire she's so passive that she can't even bestir herself to do some research even though she was supposedly a lawyer before becoming a trophy wife this book really draws out the things that are wrong with blind patriotism and jingoism especially the kinds of flag waiving usa usa chanting if you're not with us you're with the terrorists attitudes that have become so prevalent in this country since 9 11 hopefully this book makes people question some of their own attitudes and beliefs","1113":"overall this book made me think about our country and prejudice and how things come to be the story is about a jury selected by the people to judge a memorial to september 11th though the selection is secret and unknown after it is chosen it is by a muslim american what happens after is interesting and thought provoking usually i would give this 3 5 stars but i'm marking it up to the 4 stars it was a little slow for me to get through but still good","1114":" this is a beautifully written book set mostly in 2003 the premise is that in the wake of a national tragedy a jury has been appointed to consider the many designs that have been submitted for the memorial for those who perished in the twin towers on 9 11 the process is anonymous of the two finalists the majority decides on a garden then it's leaked the architect who submitted the design is an american muslim the selection sets off outraged reaction among many of the grieving family members and a traumatized community the scope of the book struggles with competing griefs and ideals prejudice suspension of civil liberties undocumented immigrants the drama that unfolds changes the lives of all the characters by the end of the book we see that everyone has submitted to something waldman's debut novel is very timely and relevant it reminded me of the conflict over the proposed construction of park51 a mosque and community center a few blocks from ground zero i wish i had read this with a book club as i'm sure it would generate good discussions i'll want to read it again","1115":"given this book's critical acclaim i was surprised to find the writing to be a bit trite i found the story to be both boring and not quite believable in its details","1116":"compelling narrative literary fiction that manages to stay remarkably even handed and have teeth all at once i really liked this and i'm even more excited to discuss this with the group","1117":" the plot simply stated in a design competition for a 9 11 memorial the winner is a muslim controversy ensues after the first chapter or two i wasn't sure i was going to like this book the characters seemed a little too stock but the complexities grew the author is very good at developing the nuances of each competing side of the controversy that i was forced to wonder what decision would i make if i were on the competition's jury i thought i had my mind made up in the beginning by the end i wasn't so sure the characters can sometimes be exasperating but given the heat of the posited situation i think that's the truth i have to admit that i never fully understood the mind of the designer at the center of the controversy but he was a conflicted character i'm not sure he fully understood himself torn by the various forces around and within him the author also has a way with words some of her passages were sterling","1118":"i read this novel for a book club my first book club it was ok i liked the author's journalistic style of writing although i felt that she developed the characters too far telling the reader what to think which left little to the imagination it was all about a competition after 9 11 to find a design for the memorial at ground zero unbeknownst to the jury selecting the design a muslim american architect won it was only after the selection that the jury including family members of those who died discovered the winner was called mohammed khan the story is about the fall out from that and the public hysteria about a muslim designing the 9 11 memorial i thought it rather over the top and in my naivety thought that americans wouldn't act that badly but interestingly the americans in my book club thought it was very realistic later in the book we discover mohammed took some inspiration from babur's garden in kabul when he visited to design the american embassy for his architectural company this resonated with me because i've been there and find it beautiful an oasis in the chaos of kabul anyway it was a good read but i don't think it brought anything particularly unique to the post 9 11 genre if you can call it that","1119":"one of the most thought provoking books i've ever read started the book with certain clear perceptions in mind finished it feeling slightly confused as to whose side i would have taken if i had been in their place there are literally hundreds of opinions detailed in the book and each of them made sense to me when seen from the pov of its holder the author has a remarkable gift with words very articulate p s would specially recommend this to anybody who likes debating","1120":"this review has been hidden because it contains spoilers to view it click here although this book definitely sucked me in at times i felt let down at the end of it one reason is that for some reason i really disliked the ending which is a flashfoward to what would still be the future the situation the book is about is pretty bullet proof there's no way not to get caught into the train wreck that is this kind of premise committee choosing a design for a 9 11 memorial blindly chooses a muslim american artist chaos ensues as others have mentioned the book is full of t although this book definitely sucked me in at times i felt let down at the end of it one reason is that for some reason i really disliked the ending which is a flashfoward to what would still be the future the situation the book is about is pretty bullet proof there's no way not to get caught into the train wreck that is this kind of premise committee choosing a design for a 9 11 memorial blindly chooses a muslim american artist chaos ensues as others have mentioned the book is full of types who embody povs just by being who they are the rich widow on the jury the bangladeshi illegal immigrant widow the trashy ambitious reporter the screw up irish american brother of a fireman hero the professional racists the muslim representatives you can't help but feel something when everything everyone says gets effortlessly twisted into something else oh and in the center is the architect who seems to cause the most controversy due to his american outlook not a muslim one why shouldn't he get a chance to enter a contest with anything he wants and have his design built the way anyone else's would be there were times when i'd be slightly pulled out by thinking about certain unrealistic things namely that in the aftermath of 9 11 there's no way there would be an anonymous contest period and no way would it take people that long to connect a garden to a martyr's paradise i wasn't actually sure and i don't think this was a bad thing that i was supposed to think kahn's design was very good anyway it sounded from the beginning like a generic sentimental thing that didn't connect to the attack to me at all my favorite moment that i loved so i feel i should mention at one point mo goes to a reception with a lot of other muslim guests where a heated discussion breaks out the author tells us how everyone's talking very fast but as this is taking place during ramadan they're also shoving food into their mouths very fast because they can't eat from dawn til dusk i don't know why this made me laugh so much but i just loved this detail it was the most humanizing moment in the book more","1121":"i thought this was an excellent choice for a lively book club discussion very well written and insightful from the different sides of the controversy that the characters face one of my favorite lines they say when you watch the movies you root for the cowboys but when you red the history you root for the indians","1122":"recommended to me by a librarian the premise sounded interesting the selection of a muslim architect to design the 9 11 memorial in new york city is a terrific starting off point for a novel i read the book in a day the writing is serviceable not difficult but not thought provoking either the characters are all of a type one of each the architect who refuses to explain his design the rich but grieving widow the penniless immigrant the scheming governor the devious journalist etc the characters lack depth so i never became emotionally invested in any of them","1123":" this book disappointed me for two reasons the first isn't the author's fault it's that her story almost came true last summer the novel is about a contest to design a ground zero memorial that is won by a muslim architect with a predictable backlash i didn't feel i need to read about fictional horrible events there's plenty going on real life to angry up the blood the second problem is that the characters are not just unlikeable but actively boring especially the rich widow who is probably meant to stand in for the reader that's why i'm giving this book two stars my rating for something that's competent but consistently makes me check the page count to see how much is left i kept reading until the end expecting a clever resolution but instead it seemed to peter out i think that was intentional meant to fit the theme but it didn't make this a satisfying read","1124":"a high concept novel the submission tells the story of an american muslim architect who wins the september 11th memorial contest the main theme running through the story is islamaphobia if you can stomach that you might appreciate this book however i found the many characters u0026amp sub plots diluted the story some aspects of the story seemed contrived and lacked authenticity sadly the muslim characters were mostly caricatures i really wanted to like this book but i struggled with it","1125":"this is a masterful evocation of the fear ignorance and mistrust that reared its head in america after september 11th ms waldman tells the story by imagining an american muslim architect who puts forth a winning design for the memorial and the resulting public uproar when he is unmasked the story is pitch perfect each emotion and character seems to be standing in for real people and very real and often scary emotions","1126":"i liked this book liked that the character evolved and found the subject interesting there were maybe too many characters so didn't get to develop them fully especially mo","1127":"i have had this on my to read list for a while and picked it up only later realizing the looming anniversary so it was quite fortuitous that i read this now but i confess accidental this was not only interesting but very thought provoking there were times i wanted it to be over times i felt small triumphs and times i was a bit uncomfortable but honestly i think all of that makes it quite a remarkable book","1128":"very readable story of the aftermath of 9 11 and public response to the selection of a muslim's design for a memorial felt believable although i would have liked the artist to feel more real told from the point of view of three victims' families the consequences of the disaster were made personal building a memorial should have been an act of healing but differing points of view made it even more divisive a book club choice","1129":"it is a great story reflecting a great problem of our time clash of different cultures","1130":"the author performed quite a feat in creating a fictional story about such a recent real event i relished her writing and enjoyed meeting all the characters though some of them weren't likeable the jumble of heroes villains bystanders rabble rousers victims was well wrought and though the ending wasn't typical i was satisfied","1131":" this is a superb novel while it focuses specifically on the choice of a muslim architect to build a 9 11 memorial it can be read as an evisceration of the hyperventilating style of american discourse the media and the more vocal elements of the populace consistently foment agitation that makes logical argument almost impossible to be heard see e g teri schiavo birthers ten commandment memorial protesters the latest trial that ended in a not guilty verdict can't remember the name of defendant and the list goes on the author nails the issues flawlessly","1132":"this book is a must read for its premise strong characters including 2 very different well developed muslims and writing style recently waldman said it was being taught in hs very good to know","1133":"a book worth reading an imaginative sketching of the tensions between different factions in this country after 9 11 01 the best part the multivalent title","1134":" wow this book was certainly thought provoking and uncomfortable at times this book is about an anonymous architectural contest to design and build a memorial at the 9 11 site when the winning design is finally selected it is discovered that the architect has a muslim name the book follows several different people 1 the winning architect2 a woman on the voting panel who supports his design3 a man whose brother was killed in 9 11 who is vehemently against a muslim architect4 a muslim illegal immigrant whose husband was killed in 9 11and a couple others the book is very good at expressing the everchanging opinions and emotions of each character it shows that right and wrong is not always black and white","1135":"i liked the premise a lot interesting and timely and it felt like it could be very close to how such events might actually be handled however the novel felt a bit too long some parts were rather laboured which made me think that a bit tighter editing might have earned it an extra star from me","1136":"good if a bit workmanlike she hits all the issues and then some","1137":" i really liked this book what a page turner i found this very hard to put down in a nutshell when there's a competition to design a memorial at ground zero for those who died on 9 11 the jury who chooses the winning entry from the thousands of anonymous submissions picks a geometric garden design created by an american muslim architect all hell breaks loose when news leaks about his background i won't spoil the rest of it for you unfortunately i don't think we've come very far from attitudes like those expressed in this book in the decade since 9 11","1138":"ugh what a terrible excuse for a book i admit my expectations were high longlisted for the orange prize described as 'in this deeply humane novel the breadth of amy waldman's cast of characters is matched by her startling ability to conjure their perspectives a striking portrait of a fractured city striving to make itself whole the submission is a piercing and resonant novel by an important new talent 'bullshit i expected a book that was honest emotional critical something that would highlight the ugliness of manipulation of tragedy for self gain and the real pain that causes people on all sides instead i got a wretched postpostmodern novel that uses words like 'manorexic' and sentences like 'southern california was the white dress at the funeral ill suited to national tragedy its sun and brite smiles still gleamed its deprived bodies and contrived breasts strutted ' so in love with cheap wordplay that that's all there is to the novel no characterization no depth no emotion no nuance shallow glossy the bulk of characters one dimensional parodies there's definitely a breadth of characters but no depth just a parade of cutouts each with their role to play the only one with any depth at all is asma and even the resolution of her story is pure exploitation 'shocking' and flat and ultimately boring because of it the idea was wonderful the story could have been brilliant instead it was cheap just a dull slimy shallow novel without one tenth the depth it's been credited with as pointless and exploitive as the behavior it pretends to condemn i had to force myself through to the end the painful awkward dialogue the cast of deeply stupid one dimensional characters the 'everything for shock value but nothing is shocking' postpostmodern sensibility and gah what a cheap ending heh although i guess that's fitting hahaha can you feel my rage and distaste i can't stop over adjectiving because this book was that disappointing","1139":"two years after the 9 11 terrorist attack a jury meets in new york to decide the winner of a contest for a memorial the contest was anonymous and when the jury opens the envelope to reveal the winner they find out the designer is a muslim the book deals with what happens next very well drawn characters and very thought provoking","1140":" a jury selects a garden to memorialize a terrorist tragedy turns out it was designed by a muslim controvesy and national chaos ensues what is unfortunate is that too much time has passed and a similar event has already taken place and it has stolen the spotlight from the concepts brought forth by this book i have learned to look past my ignorance and life experience has already taught me that one group of fundamentalist muslims does not generalize a whole population i took with me from this book that all of our life experiences including our connection with religion dictate our outlook and perceptions on everything i enjoyed the book but felt a little beaten down for not being so politically correct all the time claire was too flimsy of a character but i truly enjoyed mo and his complexity the ending was fabulous and i cried like a baby on the last page","1141":"a great book with great character development and fantastic story line","1142":"drags on for too long interesting premise poor execution","1143":" read my full review here http mimi cyberlibrarian blogspot c the submission is an alternate history novel about the development of a memorial to the world trade center by journalist amy waldman our city kalamazoo michigan is reading the book for our community read this month and my book club is discussing it this evening it is an excellent choice for a community read because it delves into all the emotional and explosive issues surrounding september 11 2001 we all know where we were and how we felt when the planes flew into the world trade center more than a year after the attacks i was visiting my son in new york he had a dinner party to introduce me to all his friends at dinner it was very important to my new acquaintances that they explain to me their experiences on that day in part it was how they introduced themselves to me it was their new definition of themselves in the submission it is just three years later and feelings are still very raw a committee comprised of artists historians civic and political leaders along with a representative of the families have gathered to choose the winning design in a blind contest one of the two finalist designs is a beautiful walled garden with the names of the deceased etched in the walls after a great deal of debate the garden design is chosen then the group discovers that the winner of the contest is an american muslim named mohammad khan this information is leaked to the media and mayhem ensues as one reviewer says the debate moves from the design's attributes to its attribution a surprisingly intense review in entertainment weekly says that the submission is a scathing dazzlingly crafted indictment of the messes people make when they mistake ideology for morality and bigotry for patriotism the many characters in the novel are involved in vigorous debate much of it recorded by the author some of the characters are exactly what you would expect the rush limbaugh character the blogger the racists the politicians and the haters there is also the dignified and wealthy woman representing her deceased stock broker husband and the other families on the committee there is the itinerant younger brother of one of the dead firefighters seeking justice for his brother and his grieving parents and there is young bangladeshi widow of one of the world trade center's custodians who ultimately provides the moral compass for the novel my favorite character is the de facto leader of the bangladeshi community he is a strong resilient loving man who exhibits that which is best in a city of divided loyalties he remains true to his community and to the young widow he takes under his wing i frankly don't know when i have read a novel so compelling in its moral intensity we are exposed to all sides of the controversy and quite frankly we are pulled in every direction the only direction in which we are not pulled is in the direction of the architect who comes off as a shallow rather incomplete person whose motives seem opportunistic rather than altruistic it is not until the end of the book that we get some real insight into mohammad khan's character this is not a plot driven novel but you keep reading the dialogue and keep trying to figure out what should be the appropriate decision and like almost all such political decisions the compromise is unenlightened and superficial then there is the question about why we need symbolism and why we need to create memorials i am sure for instance that there will be a memorial built to commemorate the children of the sandy hook shooting i kept asking myself if a memorial to the world trade center no matter what is chosen can possibly solve the issue of terrorism in the same way that a memorial to the sandy hook children cannot possibly solve the issue of gun violence in the submission the compromised memorial solves none of the problems nor does it serve as comforter it is not until the epilogue that we learn what the whole experience has meant to the key players and in one small heartfelt gesture the humanity of all the players is brought to a moment of heart stopping clarity it is the most fitting memorial this is amy waldman's first novel she will be speaking in kalamazoo next tuesday evening i will be there and if given a chance i am going to ask her what was your motivation for needing to tie up the loose ends in the epilogue in the case of the world trade center it is likely that the loose ends will never be tied up chris cleve's review in the washington post chris cleve is the author of little bee which i reviewed a couple of years ago http articles

that erupts after the winner of a 9 11 memorial competition is discovered to be a muslim the fact that he is a secular american doesn't sway those inclined to oppose his design solely on the basis of his religion waldman does a thorough job describing the various factions involved although occasionally it feels like she is checking off boxes wealthy widow representing the families on the memorial committee check working class family of a firefighter killed in the attack check widow of undocumented bangladeshi janitor check to the extent that the novel begins to feel as if it is trafficking in the very stereotypes it is trying to examine it's a tough balancing act the novel might have read better when it first came out than it does now after the controversy over the so called ground zero mosque i sometimes felt i was reading the newspaper not a work of fiction","1145":"i'm not sure i bought the premise of the whole story but it did really make me think about how i would react if it were true","1146":"really 4 5 stars i read this during the week of the tenth anniversary of 9 11 and it was a fitting book to get me to think about what effect the event really had on our country this novel takes place two years after the 9 11 attacks a jury has been set up to judge entries submitted for a 9 11 memorial all entries are anonymous and the jury is shocked when they discover that the entry they pick was created by an american named mohammed khan the story is about the fallout the novel includes several story lines that follow various very different characters whose lives all eventually touch each others the architect mohammed khan who submitted the entry a 9 11 widow on the jury the brother of an irish firefighter from an outer borough who was killed in the rescue efforts a muslim illegal immigrant who was widowed in the attacks the retired uppercrust banker who is chair of the jury the author deftly weaves their narratives together to explore the intertwining of politics religion morality u0026amp art","1147":"several years after 9 11 a jury gathers to select a memorial for the site after making their decision the jurors open the envelope containing the anonymous architect winner's name--and discover he is an american muslim their choice provokes outrage and bigotry and grief and hatred and tolerance and discussions into what it means to each of us to be an american i enjoyed this book even though it made me angry throughout much of it and it kept me guessing literally until the last page 4 stars","1148":"birthday book from mom loved mo","1149":"i wish there were half stars yet again because this would be a 4 5 for me amy waldman wove a tale that encapsulated all of the fear mongering hate and need to blame that followed 9 11 the story is a simple one a muslim man won the chance to design a memorial and a bunch of people flipped out about it including him politics culture socioeconomics literature architecture and even feminism were prominent players in this chess game of a book waldman's prose is gorgeous her ability to create characters that evoke the deepest and most raw human emotions is second to none i can only take my privileged white american girl perspective to bat but this book sat with me long after i finished it why is it because i know for a fact that had this story been true i would have supported kahn i would've protested for him protected him fought for his rights i never would have admitted it but would there have been a sliver of discomfort at the fact that he was building the memorial would i have had some deep buried inherent islamophobia i don't know this book explores all of these ideas and more the characters were plush and so well rounded that i began to think of them as actual people who had been through actual trauma it takes a special artist to peer inside people and dig out the entrails for our inspection as amy waldman has done the only reason this isn't 5 stars for me is because i felt the author was a little long winded in certain sections a good final edit would have done wonders for this book if it were 50 pages shorter i'd dare say it would be a masterpiece this is an important book one in which all americans should take seriously it's so easy to point blame and fall into us versus them mentality in 2001 it was muslims today it seems to be people of color and the police we as a society even as the human race crave a scapegoat to the point where we literally kill ourselves in the process of finding one read this think about it you'll come out of it having a different perspective","1150":"good story went on a bit","1151":"excellent one of the best books i read last year","1152":"i normally avoid books about 9 11 and its aftermath but this book was well reviewed by a friend so i tried it i am glad i did it raised some interesting questions about people about art about religion about society some of those questions were not entirely answered but maybe that wasn't the intent of the book anyway this is a good read","1153":"story of juried commission choosing a design for 9 11 memorial first chapter tension between sculptor and widow over final 2 options - one emotional - garden the other not so garden wins - reveal the designer - a muslim","1154":"good book couple interesting twists at the end","1155":"attention book clubs if you are looking for a thought provoking issue driven work of fiction try the submission by amy waldman two years after the deadly terrorist attack on manhattan a jury selects a design for a proposed memorial the submissions have all been anonymous and the group comprised of historians art critics and one representative of the families that lost loved ones on that tragic day are surprised when the name of the designer of the winning plan is revealed as it is clearly the name of a muslim the group itself is unsure of how to proceed and it is the family representative claire burwell that is the strongest supporter of the artist and his design arguing that he cannot be disqualified due to his religion that would be un american when the information is leaked to the press the divided community is further torn apart and even claire begins to question the intent of both the artist and the design the submission is at once a compelling read and a difficult one while waldman does a good job of creating flawed and conflicted characters she also populates the story with many self serving and despicable characters the submission is a provocative and significant book and will generate much needed thought and discussion it should not be missed","1156":"thought provoking","1157":"her name was violet and she was a compulsive pessimist always looking for the soft brown spot in the fruit pressing so hard she created it astonishing even at page 27 i can not recall the last time a book left me speechless extraordinary","1158":" i read somewhere that this was potentially a definitie 9 11 novel so i looked it up at the library following multiple characters involved with the decision about the design for a memorial at the site of the twin towers the author explores america's feelings about itself the characters are well shaded nuanced interesting an accomplishment in what is basically a novel of ideas it's a good thoughtful read i enjoyed it i found myself more often among the cool characters rather than the passionate ones art creates distance as well as windows into other lives","1159":" i recently finished amy waldman's the submission i also am going on record as saying that it is criminal that this book was overlooked for the pulitzer or that awful boring tripe y books like emma donoghue's room get short listed for prizes instead this is one of the smartest books i've read in a long time the book talks about a jury in manhattan charged with selecting the monument that will stand in place of the world trade centre towers a blind competition the entire process is derailed when they submission they select turns out to have been created by a muslim american by the name of mohamed as the jury america the media the architect are thrown into each other's orbit the author makes sage and astute observations about the state of american media about art about artistic intention about islamaphobia about the roots of fundamentalism about lobbyists about politics and politicians about grief and about this moment in time for the america that was changed by the events of 9 11 i know i know when i write it like that you think this is going to be a boring didactic treatise but it's not i swear the characters are so well constructed and each position is so nuanced that you don't feel like you're being lectured instead i found that the story made me think about the intractability of islam focused racism in the united states and how few options there are to move forward with the discussion in light of the shootings at the sikh temple in wisconsin the anniversary of 9 11 that recently passed the subsequent discussions about what constitutes terrorism and how we still consider the default american or canadian to be white this need for this kind of discussion is heightened in my mind this book is a pleasure to read and made me think about the dimensions of the nation","1160":"this is a lot more subtle than i thought it would be","1161":" i prefer novels and stories that deal with 9 11 obliquely like saturday by mcewan deborah eisenberg's twilight of the superheroes maybe netherland by o'neill and especially james hynes's next so for me this was not the 9 11 novel we have been waiting for and which maureen corrigan gushed about as being poetic and polemical i thought waldman's best writing was in the longer descriptive passages there is a scene near the end in which the reader is taken back to the architect's business trip to afghanistan where he finds himself alone in the slums of kabul searching for a restroom and he happens upon the green garden of a mogul emperor a garden the reader realizes that did in fact in a complicated and non religious way inspire his subsequent secular memorial garden design at this alien but familiar place he had forgotten himself and this was the truest submission i appreciated the painful humor of the architect character mohammed khan's answer to his obviously ignorant interrogator's question about what kind of muslim he was a shi'a wahhabist he answers a combination that is transparently ridiculous and causes the other man great embarrassment once it's explained i also liked that a character late in the novel points out the irony of another american man with the name kahn louis kahn having designed the parliament building for the muslim nation of bangladesh i had a problem with the stereotypical characters and situations it seemed like waldman chose her characters based on pre existing stereotypes the society wife with the art degree the apolitical ambitious reporter the aggrieved right winger a bombastic radio talk show host and then she put effort into fleshing them out giving them depth and idiosyncrasies but they never completely got past their stereotypes why not maybe because the plot is idea driven and the dialogue was often stilted and expositional the characters are mouthpieces who make speeches through their dialogue for example a character who appears and then vanishes from the stage at the 2 3 mark gets this soliloquy put in his mouth no one's interested in my point of view like a lot of americans i've felt really helpless the past few years powerless to stop the change in this country's direction and bolstering you is a way to do something look i'm not saying it's easy i know there are all kinds of pressures but this really matters you need to be strong there's no evidence our muslim population is a threat why should we make them one there was too much of this sort of speechifying throughout the story i liked the end of the novel with the jump ahead twenty years and the characters still searching for answers and the image of the parallel garden the architect built after the 9 11 memorial was cancelled the conclusion left a haunting and thoughtful image in my mind","1162":"i put this down one third of the way through although the concept is fascinating the tone of the book is distanced from the vast well of emotions that could have been mined with material as emotion provoking as this i started out very curious then i started to skim and ultimately i put it down there were interesting insights and lots of detail that ultimatly bogged down the flow of the novel and made it a chore to read","1163":"enjoyed it more than i expected to i liked the opposing views and it highlights that nothing is pure or simple in any decision","1164":"this book was hailed as the 9 11 book so i had high expectations i know i'm in the minority but i thought it was deeply flawed the plot was cliched and dated and the characters underdrawn i like my novels nuanced and well written but the submission was neither","1165":"good story got a little drawn out in the middle for me but a good ending made sticking with it worth the wait","1166":"pretty much hated this spoliers in the review even the premise of the book is hokum there's a contest to design a memorial to the 9 11 attacks and submissions are anonymous from the jury a muslim wins essentially if you're the kind of person that thinks it's compatible to have a religious or cultural identity with a national identity this book is going to annoy you the premise that it's controversial for a muslim to bulid a memorial is nonsense if you blame 'islam' for 9 11 then it's not to far of a stretch to blame humans for it also so perhaps memorials should only be built by martians so then we have 300 pages of hand wringing and soul searching essentially over the 'problem of islam' except it's dressed up in such wishy washy language it grates waldman's insistence of presenting 'many sides of the argument' when there isn't really an argument in the book actually leads me to think this book is an insult to both americans and muslims perhaps doubly so for muslim americans the key for me is that nothing actually happens of any interest in this book the characters are amazingly one dimensional neither evoking sympathy nor interest after a couple of pages i got thoroughly sick of the 'islamophobia' presented by the 'anti memorial' camp i got the message after a couple of pages it seems waldman had an interesting idea but not enough material for a book the 'anti islam' brigade consisting of the 'victims families' ultra right wing special interest groups and shock jock media commentators have zero depth there's a bunch of rascist polemics that go on for ever but again no real real exploration of a why america was targeted and b the nature of fundamentalist islam and c the experience of ordinary muslims personally i hate the term 'moderate' you never hear of moderate jews or christians i think 'moderate' equates to 'agreeing with the foreign policy of the west likewise there is nothing 'radical' about the brand of islam that seeks to drag civilization back to the medieval age there is plenty to criticise organised religion and how it subjugates people yet this book comfortably slips into two camps of 'you are all terrorists let's share ramadan' even portraying the winner as a non devout drinking sexually active muslim is a cop out why couldn't mo be a devout muslim in the book's exploration of religion it falls at the first hurdles the idea is 'why can't a muslim be an american' but waldman makes sure he's a 'palatable' muslimi get that there may be a lot of rascist anti islam feeling in america and also that the far right idiots have a voice and also that the far right control the media and pass their ideology as common opinion on their networks however there is a distinct lack of ordinary american voices in this book the families representative on the jury comes from a wealthy background her dreamboat perfect husband who always has a romantic purchasing solution to go along with his liberal opinions died in the towers she's pathetic initially being strong in her support to 'needing answers' the outsider from the families representative is portrayed as an undecisive unemployable right wing rascist violent spouse beater he's portrayed as a weak man barely tolerated by his family the rest of the families representatives fare the same they hate muslims it's almost as though only the wealthy liberals have the intelligence to see past blatant rascism the heart strings are pulled by the bangladeshi illegal immigrant who lost her husband in the attack predictably she's empowered by the debate and cuts a strong yet sympathetic figure the stereotypes and caracitures are exploited to the full however there isn't resolution to her character because in this book ordinary people don't matter only the wealthy power brokers have any real input or voice poor characters who you can't identify with issues explored via polemic and a completely unsatisfactory ending 'we know you're right but america acknowledges it's hang ups does nothing about them but maybe learns waldman manages to write a book about a memorial about a terror attack that leads the reader not to care a jot or have any retrospective on those who lost their lives","1167":"a good look into the lives of many different people with different viewpoints of the 9 11 tragedy i was shocked by the response of some disgusted by the response of others and deeply saddened by the general realization that this event in our history really did tear a country apart","1168":"the submission is a serious and thought provoking novel about issues of racism tolerance and awareness about immigration belief systems and grief's healing processes it's two years after the 9 11 attacks on the twin towers a jury of artists and professionals including one family member of a person who died in that attack have convened to choose the winning architectural entry for the memorial that will be built at ground zero after some conflicts and thorough discussion they decide on a winning entry only when the name of the winning design is announced mohammed khan everyone immediately recoils in fear and astonishment how is it possible that a muslim man's design is the winner of the memorial for the attacks perpetrated by muslim men what follows is the fight over how to handle this situation both by the jurors and then by the american public as the information is leaked to the press some think khan's design shouldn't be allowed to be created while others believe his rights are being violated some believe khan himself would be doing the right thing by withdrawing his submission despite the fact that this memorial would be an extreme milestone in his architectural career then there's the discussions about the difference been a muslim man and an islamic extremist not to mention khan may not even believe in islam no one really knows not even khan at times although the entire book revolves around this exact plot and storyline there were several supplemental themes what about the people who were in america illegally but who also lost family members in the attacks should they not be provided with the same concessions and care that other family members are provided and how is it decided what is the best way for people to heal from extreme grief this novel was so emotionally charged for me as i'm sure it will be for many readers i abhor ignorance especially as it relates to racial issues the submission is told from various viewpoints so the reader is often provided with khan's perspective i think knowing how benign his attitude and reason for entering the contest made it that much more enraging for me the way he was treated there was a quote near the beginning of the book about a woman so pessimistic that in looking so intently for a bruise in an apple eventually caused the bruise herself unfortunately i can't remember the page number that was how i felt about the characters in this book their fear became so exaggerated that they caused new fears they hadn't necessarily had in the first place even the person who was his staunchest advocate started creating fears of her own and questioning her beliefs and it seemed like khan wasn't always sure that the route he had taken for instance not having to answer any questions whatsoever on principle was the right way to go one of the dynamics i found so interesting was those of khan's and how he so questioned his own beliefs while he seemed assured and was rational though there were times when i wished he would concede in just the smallest of ways to help come to a compromise he was often conflicted this is evident as described in this quote about the way he tamed his interactions with others he realized that the difference wasn't in how he was being treated but in how he was behaving customarily brusque on work sites he had become gingerly polite careful to give no cause for alarm or criticism he didn't like this new more cautious avatar whose efforts at accommodation hinted at some feeling of guilt yet he couldn't quite shake him p 25 and this quote describes the way in which his rationality started to give way to paranoia because of some of his experiences the memory of the airport interrogation was unpacked shaken out stuffed full of straw to make it lifelike once again there was no evidence roi hadn't elevated mo because he was a muslim but none against it either if he had been singled out once why not again paranoia no less than plasticine could be molded p 40 unfortunately there isn't a wonderful pretty resolution to everything though i found the book gripping its focus was really on how this situation affected various people in the community from those who lost family members to those who wanted to have a cause to fight for or against to the governor who wanted to twist this for her future presidential campaign this book angered and saddened me but it wasn't overly dark or melancholic either i thought the author did a good job of portraying the complexity of the various perspectives the ending was a little ambiguous but the real meat in this book was the dynamics of the characters and all the thoughts they elicited for me this is one i will not be forgetting for a long time taken from my blog at www takemeawayreading com","1169":"thought provoking and plausible made me look into aspects of 911 aftermath i hadn't thought about from different viewpoints","1170":"i've never been a reader of stories with 9 11 as a theme but this turned out to be interesting with some though provoking chapters","1171":" the premise of the book interested me which is why i bought it i started it right before the tenth anniversary of the attacks thinking it would be an appropriate time to read it the book was good albeit a little flat the author chronicles several lives revolving around the attacks and the memorial i felt like the characters could have been developed more you learned about the backgrounds of each character so you understood their perspective on the memorial but when the author brought the book to its present time i felt like you always wanted a little bit more from each character not that this book was an action novel but i wished it had moved a little faster the author provided great conflicts amongst the characters but i felt they all felt short from fully coming to blows with the conflict with that said i did enjoy reading about the different perspectives of the characters being far removed from the events of the actual day it was interesting reading how it affected people that day and how their lives moved forward a good thought provoking book that would be great borrowed from the library","1172":"easily one of the best books i've ever read i know this is big talk but i wrote a long response as to why http theoncominghope blogspot com 2","1173":" three and a half stars i had mixed feelings about this one amy waldman is a good writer and this is an impressive first novel she deserves kudos for her remarkably on the nose depictions of post 9 11 attitudes and fears what could have been a heavy handed metaphor instead has moments of incredible delicacy but the novel while broad in scope isn't particularly deep it doesn't tell the reader anything new about terrorism fear religion or prejudice i could read news reports and come away with the same level of understanding fiction needs to go or hint at one step beyond reporting it would have perhaps been impossible for waldman to give the story itself much resolution but the lack of personal change or resolution for any of the individual characters seems less like a deliberate choice on the author's part and more like a lack of certainty when waldman left questions about characters' motivations and feelings unanswered even though at other points she lets the reader inside her characters' heads i couldn't help but feel that this was because waldman didn't know her characters well enough to answer them","1174":"really really great book","1175":"it was hard for me to put down this book premised on controversy surrounding design of a memorial honoring 9 11 victims the characters were so realistic i first thought they were based on real people and true events i loved this book because it really made me think about social issues like what a memorial should should signify to families of victims as well as our country and more importantly what it can be like to be an american muslim living here post 9 11","1176":"fascinating read about what happens when the winner of an anonymous contest to design a 9 11 memorial turns out to be an american muslim","1177":" this book was great first of all disclosure i received this copy for free from the picador book club to be honest i probably would never have bought it but i am so glad that i read it i guess i have to open my mind past all the thrillers i like to read anyway no spoilers here the plot is that there is a competition to design a memorial for the site of a terrorist attack in nyc it is a blind competition with the jury making its choice without knowing who the designer is when it is revealed that the winner has a muslim name the novel moves into high gear that's all i'm telling about the plot what is so great is that through great writing and the creation of characters and situations that are so real waldman turns the novel into an examination of what our country stands for and how we operate shining light on the media politicians ethnic loyalties and on and on i spend a lot of my reading time on in depth news magazines but this novel gave me more to think about than a month's worth of those magazines love it or hate it this is probably a novel that any thinking citizen of the usa should read good stuff indeed","1178":"excellent thought provoking book the characters rang true and as a reader it was very difficult at times to decide whose 'side' i was on","1179":"3 5ish this was a very interesting story about a memorial for 9 11 the author makes you think about racism values","1180":" the submission reads like an almost long form journalistic account of a competition to design a 9 11 memorial if at times i became frustrated with the small minded cowardice of some of the characters and really there are no heroes in this book with one possible exception in the form of a woman who holds the least amount of political power i think it's a testament to waldman that she has created a world that very much mirrors the one we live in i would recommend the book to anyone interested in the way politics and personalities play out both on stage and behind the scenes in new york city","1181":"a little flat characters predictable and not terribly interesting","1182":"this book is a bit hard to judge on the one hand it was a quick and engrossing read partly because it's so true to life waldman incorporates the flavor of so many recent controversies linked to 9 11 and muslim identity in the u s and in new york city that her story has something of a ripped from the headlines quality on the other hand the book has the feeling of being relatively superficial there are many characters crowded in together and in many most cases we don't see or understand their depths this is particularly true for claire but applies as well to the the architect mo the most compelling characters to me are those at the top and bottom of the metaphorical socioeconomic heap paul rubin and sean gallagher the story also ends relatively quickly while this may have been a wise choice to avoid a painful denouement once the central conflict is resolved it's perhaps also somewhat abrupt and the final postscript is not helpful in this respect good but not great","1183":"i cannot improve on the book sleeve summary of this novel except that as you read it the story may make you re examine your own ideas and opinions about prejudice profiling and innocence and perhaps reform and re examine them again","1184":"not motivated enough to finish it at least on kindle","1185":"the writing was wonderful and the story absorbing","1186":"great book exploring the role of islam in america post 9 11 should be read ibn conjunction with watching the reluctant fundamentalist","1187":"i would give it five stars for the fact that i could hardly bear to put it down but as much as i live for addictive reading there were too many horrible people to grit my teeth at to truly love experiencing this book also it was a little too scary in its realism invoking memories of my classmate having to walk to school surrounded by her imposing brothers because she dared to wear a hijab and a charismatic asshole very reminiscent of a young salman rushdie i just wanted to know how waldman saw this story playing out in her head hoo doggie","1188":"thought provoking and sometimes the middle drags but the end is perfect","1189":"intriguing diversity of characters who frustratingly change little over the course of the novel the personal and political issues raised by the novel are powerful","1190":" i'll begin by saying that this might be the most timely work of fiction that i've ever read it is just coincidence that i finished it yesterday on the eve the 1oth anniversary and the opening of the memorials in new york and pennsylvania i minored in history in college and always found that reading the literature of the culture and time period that i was studying was essential to understanding the subject matter this novel is the perfect example of that approach waldman has created a masterpiece here set only two years after the attacks while everything was still so raw and visceral the premise of the novel is a the ultimate hypothetical what if the winner of an anonymous contest to design the memorial in nyc was a muslim albeit an american born somewhat prolasped muslim of indian descent what if indeed waldman's beautifully written must read novel challenges your perceptions of what it means to be an american in the aftermath of a tragedy that has changed us as a country there were two lines that i pulled from the text that really spoke to me one was about how a city's skyline is a collaboration not unlike a nation and the other was about america sometimes having to be reminded of what it is not so much a country but a promise to its citizens i also found the title very clever obstensibly it is because the novel is about a submission of a design to a contest but i read much more into that one word do we submit to our worst selves and continue to surrender our freedoms suspect our neighbors accept our floudering economy and fail to hold our leaders accountable or do we like the towers that use to dominate the skyline of the very city that defines the word rise up out of the ashes scarred and changed of course and reclaim our best selves perhaps it was neither the author's or her editor's intention when they selected the title but if it was it was a brilliant move read it people are definitely going to be talking about this one this is a must read and perhaps","1191":"this is a really extraordinary portrait of the state of cross cultural mis understandings today the premise muslim architect wins design contest for 9 11 memorial begs for satire but the genius of this novel is its humane groundedness instead of a parade of easy caricatures waldman presents an earnest array of well rounded characters with knotty motivations conflicting interests and complex loyalties as paradoxical and occasionally opaque as real people it reads like an altman movie on the page only with a more commanding master narrative voice will it resonate as strongly in a different era or be a time capsule of the early 21st century american zeitgeist ask me in 20 years","1192":"i have the arc copy of this novel and i just want to mention that i love that cover so much more than the one that was chosen for the final copy also the texture of it resembles the book greatly a little bit gritty but not too much in that it turns people off but enough about the cover this was certainly a powerful book what if the memorial chosen for those lost during 9 11 was blindly chosen to be created by a muslim architect the book asks the question that i believe many people wonder about themselves just how prejudice are we when it comes down to it are religion and people's names that important to us in the long run how would be react as the public as a family member who lost someone as mohammed himself one complaint that i did have was the number of characters at first i wondered how asma fit into the book and what her point was obviously i found out what that was and was very pleased but the outside characters were too much at times while i found arianna to be so interesting in the beginning she was forgotten about throughout the rest of the novel there is also point where alyssa mentions oscar well halfway through the book i don't remember who that guy is and to be honest nor do i care i think that characters no matter how big or small they are need to have some sort of impact on the tale as whole in waldman's case i found that there were a few too many characters who did not affect the story at all overall i enjoyed the book and would definitely recommend it to others the last 50 pages are pages that i will never forget","1193":" audio version waldman mentions early on the bonfire of the vanities and that is the area she is treading here the big novel capturing the spirit of a decade it's a well plotted 9 11 novel more accessible than delillo's falling man and conventional when compared to extremely loud and incredibly close the characters are a bit cartoonish in parts and the heavy handedness moves into finger wagging territory like movie crash however i enjoyed the book and check out slates audio book club archives for an interesting discussion after you read it","1194":"i'd heard good things about this book that it was one of the better ruminations on 9 11 out there etc i found it easy to start but very very hard to finish i didn't identify with any of the characters and i stopped caring about the outcome i was skimming by the last third and would have abandoned it if i hadn't already made it that far it was too long and too short on plot and character development","1195":"wow what a book proper review to follow if i can muster it","1196":"wow very powerful excellent","1197":"read for boundless readers institute","1198":"first sentence 'the names ' claire said 'what about the names ' p 99 there was

his selection leaks to the press she finds herself under pressure from outraged family members and in collision with hungry journalists wary activists opportunistic politicians fellow jurors and khan himself as unknowable as he is gifted in the fight for both advantage and their ideals all will bring the emotional weight of their own histories to bear on the urgent question of how to remember and understand a national tragedy in this deeply humane novel the breadth of amy waldman's cast of characters is matched by her startling ability to conjure their perspectives a striking portrait of a fractured city striving to make itself whole the submission is a piercing and resonant novel by an important new talent this was the first choice for #twitlit the twitter reading club of the dutch newspaper nrc and because i started hearing some good things about it i ordered it immediately at bookdepository and started reading it the minute it arrived in my mailbox the story itself also appealed to me what would happen when the design of the memorial for the victims of the attacks of 9 11 in new york was the work of a muslim waldman sets down a believable chain of events that is so convincing at times i could have believed it really happened i loved the way she described the feelings and actions of different characters that were involved mo or mohammad the architect claire the widow of one of the victims of the attack a rich and beautiful woman asma also the widow of one of the victims but in totally different circumstances asma and her husband are illegal bangladeshi's immigrants paul the head of the jury that has to decide which design will be chosen for the memorial and so on although the characters are only briefly sketched it is as if you know them it is very easy to understand why they think and act as they do and their reactions are only too human i think this debut novel will appeal to many people both those that love a great story and those that want stories with real life characters other thoughts reviews the guardian http www guardian co uk books 2012 reviews from a serial reader https longingtobe wordpress com 201","1199":"so good one of the best books i have read this year it might be a little cliche but it is so well done you are happy it is cliche","1200":"yes how open are we really deals with prejudice after 9 11 are every one from the same religion one group","1201":"i picked this up because it was long listed for the orange prize in 2012 but it was also on a lot of best of 2011 lists i'm glad it didn't make the short list so i could feel less guilty about not finishing it i guess the scenario just seems like it could come from any newspaper and just didn't really have anything new to offer me i was completely uninterested in the characters or the situation","1202":"a very interesting topic the book opens with the jury for the 9 11 memorial design deciding on the winning entry only to find out that the winning architect is a muslim american i thought the premise of the story was very intriguing and the author did a great job showing the perspectives of all different groups and concerned related parties often differing viewpoints even within the same group i enjoyed it even more after i heard the author speak this week at uma amy waldman is a seasoned journalist with lots of experience in the middle east plus months spent reporting in nyc in the 9 11 aftermath she knows the topic inside and out","1203":"the submission a novel by amy waldman is a clever and stimulating debut novel makes you question what the limits of tolerance and democracy are the characters start a tad dreary and archetypal but as the book progresses no one stays the same all characters disclose something about themselves that the reader and they themselves may not like i found the point that was made at the end unbelievably poignant 5 stars","1204":"thought provoking but too many stereotypical reactions and overreactions the crazy liberal the meek islamic woman the zealous reporter etc","1205":"i liked this book even though it was political i'd recommend to both left wing and right wing friends read it i liked the ending even though of course it wouldn't be happy it seemed to fit well","1206":"excellent book did a group discussion on this book","1207":"intriguing premise and great insight into the psyche of post 9 11 america","1208":" this novel is a great read while it starts out rather slowly it continues to bring you into the story until you cannot put it down for once a novel that makes you think deeply about the issue and what you would do if you were in the shoes of each one of the many diverse characters i was at times empathic angry sad and perplexed at the stand taken by different characters and groups in the book as they dealt with the design of the proposed 9 11 memorial submitted by an american born muslim architect by the end of the book it is clear that the title refers to much more then just the submission of the design great book club choice","1209":" this book was ugly and that's the whole point that it highlights the ugliness of this whole post 9 11 sentiments and fear mongering this novel makes you cringe and the sad part is is that this could almost be a real situation you can see it happening and it doesn't take too much from your imagination to envision the uproar that such a winner and such a competition would cause however you're drawn to sympathise with many in this book you feel for mo he can't win either way he's ostracised by the majority and the minority where exactly can he fit you feel for claire the quintessential grieving widow who is accused of acting unscrupulously in the midst of the fiasco and i love that its the typical misogynistic she's a loose woman type of accusation but directed from a woman herself the lowest of lows there are those you can't side with the journalist who will do anything for a scoop for instance makes you feel sorry for everyone involved in the submission well worth a read if you're ready to cringe with secondhand embarrassment for everyone involved","1210":"except for its being a book club book i would never have chosen this book because of its subject i found it disturbing not because it was about the attack on the world trade center but because of how well the author imagined hatred greed fear and thoughtless ambition among the reporters and victim's families when a muslim wins the memorial competition my rating is not because i enjoyed the story but because i admire the skill od the author","1211":"definitely thought provoking and book discussion material but to me the characters were pretty flat and the ending left much to be desired","1212":"i enjoyed this book it was quite unsettling i'm not trying to take away from the author but i have to say that nothing in this book was surprising had the opening events in this book actually happened i can't see this turning out any other way and that's extremely sad and pathetic","1213":"this book is real page turner it contains so many issues racism patriotism grief to name a few the author does a great job of showing many perspectives the writing is strong as well","1214":" i didn't like this book at all i think the writing style was awful kind of choppy and disjointed there wasn't one character i liked much asma was probably the one i liked best but even she was only ok and i was really fed up with the inherent bigotry of people in general americans in particular this book reminded me of why i am not a patriotic person it makes me crazy when people confuse jingoism for patriotism or ignorance for solidarity i think it will make for some terrific book club discussion though which is what i read this for and i am looking forward to that very much","1215":"a very interesting premise what if a muslim won the competition to design the 9 11 memorial reminded me a lot of the controversy surrounding the mosque being built a few blocks from ground zero the arguments from all sides were very similar here would make a great book to read and discuss with a book club","1216":" an excellent balance of the ridiculous and the sublime waldman captures a realistic chain of events that start with one deceptively ordinary event picking the design for the 9 11 memorial the appointed committee selects a design then discover that the entrant's name is mohammad khan they predict a publicity nightmare and the prediction proves correct when all of new york is swept up in an epidemic of quarreling discriminating finger pointing polarizing capitalizing and catastrophizing insanity the book is told from multiple points of view with the characters confronting their best and worst traits in reaction to this decision","1217":"great book lots to think about regarding our treatment of muslims in america","1218":"i know that the reviews have not been great for this book and justifiably so it is not well written the characters are one dimensional and the cast of characters are very stereotypical however i did find the book's premise very engaging and thought provoking and my opinions did shift as i read a book that can have me reassessing my beliefs is worthy of reading just wish the author had had an editor who had challenged and pushed her harder","1219":"what amazing timing to have found this book with the 9 11 anniversary looming takes you back to that day and all the personal and national and global changes it sparked fascinating examination of bigotry and the ease with which we fall prey to it","1220":"in a nutshell this book is set two years after the 9 11 attacks there was a decision to build a memorial and there was a call for anonymous open submissions a specially selected jury picks a design and it turns out the designer has a muslim name the rest of the book is about everyone's reactions to this situation i loved the idea of this book and i think it raises some interesting questions of course the more the event is in the past and the more we move forward as a country i think looking at the predictions on this book will be interesting too other than the idea of the book i didn't enjoy it very much the writing was not strong and there were huge sections i simply skimmed but still didn't get the sense i missed anything the first few chapters read as if someone wrote an average story then went in with a thesaurus and swapped out every 5 7 words with bigger or fancier versions the flow of writing was thrown off by word choices which seemed inappropriate after the first few chapters this stopped it's almost as if those were the pages she used to get a book deal then once it was secured went back to writing in an average voice which is fine but be consistent my issues with the book overall can best be put this way have you ever talked with someone who never gets to the point everything they say seems all important but looking back you have no idea why the details were important this book is that friend the one who meets their celebrity crush at a cafe and instead of sharing the details of their encounter starts to talk about everything else happening in the cafe and what everyone else was thinking or doing or what they might do if they were in his or her shoes maybe some would argue it's setting a scene but at some point the scene needs to move forward with what was presented as a key plot point","1221":"what if two years after 9 11 they held an anonymous competition to design a memorial and the winner was a muslim sounds either gimmicky or preachy but the submission is a finely nuanced morality play shaded in gray wherever you fall on the political spectrum you'll find food for thought","1222":"this review has been hidden because it contains spoilers to view it click here lest we forget i hope this book lasts waldman does an excellent job of capturing the variety of emotions in and out of nyc after 9 11 on the surface the book explores the varied reactions of america to the destruction of the twin towers the design of a memorial becomes the focus of a multitude of emotions amd opinions the book explores the politics of memorial it's almost like we fight over what we can't settle in real life through these symbols they're our nation's afterlife p 295 lest we forget i hope this book lasts waldman does an excellent job of capturing the variety of emotions in and out of nyc after 9 11 on the surface the book explores the varied reactions of america to the destruction of the twin towers the design of a memorial becomes the focus of a multitude of emotions amd opinions the book explores the politics of memorial it's almost like we fight over what we can't settle in real life through these symbols they're our nation's afterlife p 295 but it would take more than a memorial to unite the nation p 274 my interest waned halfway through the book as we were asked to follow almost too many characters and their reactions to the memorial jumping from person to person culture to culture i was ready to say enough already i get it sticking with it i began to realize there was much more to the story i debated 4 or 5 stars but settled on 5 stars because for me the book was about more than a debate over a 9 11 memorial waldman is really asking whether art can be separated from the artist does it matter what the artist intends or is it more important how it is perceived by the viewer she postulates that we should judge art and the artist separately you look at the creation not the creator there's no inconsistency in loving one and reviling the other p 272 another takeaway for me is that art is most successful when it evokes a unique interpretation for an individual each viewer or listener brings their own experience and imagination to its interpretation like claire we want things to be clear and simple but the individualism of art is part of its beauty more","1223":"in this novel a jury gathers in manhattan to select a memorial for the victims of 9 11 their selection complete they open the envelope containing the anonymous winner's name and discover he is an american muslim to say the s# t hits the fan is an understatement but the rest of the story looks at this hypothetical american situation from every side","1224":"i really enjoyed the reading of this book and found it to be quite a page turner she moved her story along with great pacing and despite jumping between characters and histories it never really faltered my only criticism was that some of her characters were a little too stereotyped the debbie dawson opportunist the weak younger son of a fallen brother representing the victims the overweight sloppy ambitious unprincipled journalist and even the beautiful wealthy entitled widow who was the emotional center of the novel along with mo i was curious throughout thecreading of this book and especially how she might end it jumping ahead 20 years with definite closure is usually a disappointing ploy but it was satisfying in this book a fitting and interesting cover","1225":" a committee has been formed to select a design for the ground zero memorial they make their decision based strictly on the artistic merits of the entries the names of the contestants are not known when the committee decides the winner it is revealed that the contestant's name is mohammad khan a muslim before the committee has a chance to consider the decision mohammad's name is leaked to the press what ensues is an all too painfully real reaction from the country this amazing first novel explores a heartbreaking look into the world of religion media and the world we live in today","1226":"a thought provoking read in light of current xenophobic rhetoric the title refers to multiple meanings as one reaches the conclusion how much do we submit to our principles perceptions and prejudices in light of internal and external pressures","1227":"a very timely book i kept thinking was this written before or after the ground zero mosque incident either way it touched on a lot of issues that remain relevant even 10 years after 9 11","1228":"a contest for a 9 11 memorial results in the blind selection of a design by an american muslim igniting a nationwide debate a broad cross section of groups is represented in the discussion including victims' surviving family members politicians media illegal immigrants religious and community leaders and artists the author addresses issues that remain timely and relevant 14 years after the event at times the story uncomfortably challenges the reader's beliefs but in important ways","1229":"love the concept wish it pushed harder good read","1230":"this book started out with a lot of promise i really liked the premise and all the points of view there were way more than i would have imagined unfortunately the book lost something along the way the characters were interesting the storyline believable and relevant and the events sometimes surprising i just expected more based on the promising beginning overall it was still a good book but i was very disappointed with the end","1231":" the premise of this book is interesting a muslim american wins a competition to design the new memorial to commemorate 9 11 and all hell breaks out around the world but somehow i found the mounting hysteria and chaos contrived and the many characters all a bit pat and stereotypical and here's where i'll get into trouble but i'll say it anyway even as a former newspaper reporter who has entertained the notion of writing some fiction as many of us have sometimes books by former newspaper reporters as this one is tend to read a bit like well a very long fantastical newspaper article the plots are nutty the language is prosaic the characters' thinking way too predicable it's almost as if the reporter oops the writer is concocting her ultimate dream of a real life news story or coming up with a bunch of hopeful b copy in advance of covering real events","1232":" the premise for this book is highly compelling two years after 9 11 a competition opens in order to select the architectural design of a potential memorial to the victims of that terrible day once all the anonymous 'submissions' are in the jury decides in favor of a beautifully envisioned garden symbol of life and death loss and renewal which seems very fitting to commemorate the people who lost their lives to the terrorist attacks but when the jury discovers the identity of the architect who submitted this design all hell breaks loose for he is a muslim and therefore likely to trigger fierce political opposition this is exactly what happens as the victims' relatives launch a campaign aimed at forcing muhammad khan the architect to withdraw his entry so that someone else can take his place but he will do no such thing as he believes he has as much right to design the memorial as any other non muslim american this book is quite successful at exposing the paranoid acute sense of fear misunderstanding and islamophobia that developed in the wake of 9 11 as it stages a conflict between khan's supporters and opponents that seems strangely prescient when one considers the real life controversy that erupted surrounding the potential building of a mosque near ground zero but the problem in this book lies in the execution of that amazingly perceptive premise indeed while the opening pages immediately grip you and make you want to find out more about all the players involved it soon becomes rather redundant as the plot moves round and round in circles and never seems to get to the most interesting point which is whether or not khan will yield to the political and social pressure by withdrawing his design from the competition the same ideas and arguments for and against the idea of a muslim building the 9 11 memorial are repeated over and over which diminishes their potency and effectiveness by the time we get to khan's decision it feels as though the story took way too long to get there and could have been cut by at least 100 pages what also annoyed me throughout the book was the stereotypical portrayal of some of the main characters take the journalist who breaks the news of the winner's identity to the public alyssa spier she is such a cliche of a journalist that i could hardly believe the author didn't think to make her more believable or let's face it likable she is basically described as some kind of attention seeking news junkie who devotes her entire life and energy to finding groundbreaking stories to release regardless of who she might injure in the process like seriously can you make alyssa into a slightly more complex character please most importantly however and annoyingly is the author's decision to make muhammad khan into a non practicing completely westernized muslim i e a drinking borderline atheist having sex with what by muslim standards must be considered lots of women etc surely by having the main muslim character of the book be so americanized the author is actually taking the stance of muhammad khan's opponents by implying that there is automatically something wrong and suspicious about practicing muslims no matter how peaceful and opposed to the whole concept of jihad they may actually be","1233":"my emotions ran the gamut as i read this good book one which i would highly recommend","1234":"3 5 stars i liked the plot of this book but found it hard to follow at times there was a lot of big words being used that i thought took away from the simplicity of the story making it hard to understand at times i also felt that it was boring in some parts that not much was happening until the very end i liked the epilogue and how it explained what had happened to everyone 20 years later","1235":"this is a fascinating book about the uproar that ensues when a committee tasked to select a design for a 9 11 memorial chooses a design by an american muslim the narrative follows several characters including a 9 11 widow another widow in the country illegally the designer the brother of a dead fireman and the chair of the committee the voices of each character are pitch perfect and the problems encountered are genuine the writing is superb at moments brilliant","1236":"a stark look at both sides affected by an unspeakable tragedy completely involving","1237":"i'm still thinking about this book days after i finished it in it a civic jury selects a plan for the 9 11 memorial at ground zero through a blind process the plan turns out to have been created by a muslim american architect the book explores the reactions to that selection from the eyes of multiple characters the issue of stereotypes is interesting here clearly this is a story about confronting stereotypes but the author also relies on stereotypical characters to tell this story i'm still trying to figure out whether this was clever or lazy or a bit of both i'm also still trying to figure out what i think of the ending which surprised me","1238":"this is a fascinating look at what might have happened in the selection of a design for the 9 11 memorial in ny in this scenario the request for submissions is open to all and the various designs are viewed by the committee without knowing anything about the designers that is the submissions are blind when the winning design has been selected the identity of the designer becomes a maelstrom of controversy the book is well written but what i particularly liked was the author's ability to have the points of view of all the factions presented in an understandable if not sympathetic way it prompted one of the liveliest conversations at my book club in years","1239":"i've read quite a few 9 11 novels l 05 some reason i didn't enjoy this very much although it's got raving reviews flat characters","1240":"a remarkable timely book and a great choice for a book club selection im not sure i left liking any of the characters but most were three dimensional and thoughtful and i related to them a recommended read","1241":"interesting plot lots of characters to follow overall it was pretty good","1242":" amy waldman takes on an ambitious task in this post 9 11 novel in which a muslim american mohammad \"mo\" khan wins an anonymous design contest for a memorial of the 2001 attacks on new york city his concept a walled garden with perpendicular waterways and a simple pavilion is selected by a jury and especially supported by a grieving widow on the selection panel when the information gets leaked all hell breaks loose between every possible interest group in a country that breeds interest groups the way the rest of the world breeds political parties the premise is brilliant and waldman sucks you into the turmoil within pages with strong characterizations and authentic moral and legal problems waldman explores the effect of grief on families how suspicion and xenophobia lie beneath the surface of so many communities and how emotional and rational arguments can be very different and yet exist simultaneously but she soon falls into the most common trap known to first time novelists the need to hit the 350 plus page mark and so after an absorbing start readers find themselves bounced from one character to another we get the grieving widow the winning architect an \"illegal\" from bangladesh maybe the novel's most interesting character but we also get a smarmy post reporter a recovering alcoholic with a violent temper and the chairman of the memorial design contest ...and in this attempt to show that this is a multifaceted issue representing many interests waldman lost my interest in addition mainly to make that magical 350 page mark the same \"it's an islamic garden it's not an islamic garden\" fight reappears like an especially destructive forest fire i get that this is a hugely complex issue and i commend waldman for some ingenious touches at a party peopled by hollywood bigwigs one guest approaches mo and asks if he knows shah rukh khan who also played the lead role in the movie \"my name is khan\" another look at the effect on muslims in america ...the names all being a coincidence here but i sometimes got the feeling that waldman considered us all to be the soap opera watching character she writes into her novel thinking that we need a restating of all arguments every few pages finally the epilogue in my mind is a chapter that should best be left out of most novels and this is no exception","1243":"the premise was really interesting but the book just dragged on too long the characters were just not likeable enough to really care about them it could have wrapped up much sooner","1244":"i was expecting to like this book quite a bit more than i actually did i didn't really care about the characters and flew through it just to get to the end and see if it got better for me","1245":"this book took on a difficult and complicated subject matter i thought the writing was excellent and well thought out i liked the book even tho it was a sad and frustrating at times to read it","1246":" the premise of the submission is that an anonymous designer for the memorial of the 9 11 nyc terrorist attack turns out to be an american muslim architect the resulting uproar reveals the underlying prejudices in our society and creates chaos in different characters lives as they grapple with the issue of what to do about the design and the designer no character comes off as a saint especially the designer mohammed khan he is extremely conflicted about his religion which adds to the irony of his situation he is also vain and arrogant about his talent but there is a naivete about him in that he truly expected to be treated just like any other american or did he other characters are very well portrayed ie claire burwell asma anwar paul rubin although some of the minor ones become more like caricature debbie dawson for example their inner conflict about the situation is palpable throughout the novel this is a powerful disturbing difficult book to read but well worth the effort be prepared to examine how you feel about all the issues raised in the book there are no easy answers","1247":"gripping story evolving around the controversy that resulted when americans found out that the winner of the design competition for the 9 11 memorial is a muslim told from multiple perspectives the architect the grieving families other artists muslim americans the press the many twists and turns kept the reader in suspense written in crisp spare prose the story sets us thinking about the implications of actions that were taken or not taken words spoken and unspoken it spoke of regrets the search for redemption missed opportunities and the many ways we can misunderstand each other and ourselves it's a great sad story that brought up many social cultural and political issues in its telling","1248":"the submission is a well written story with an unusual premise the building of the 9 11 memorial the author communicates the pain of losing a loved one on 9 11 but doesn't sink into a grab for pity i enjoyed the plot twists but not always the decisions made by the characters the architect character came across as selfish and narrowly focused and only went deeper into himself in the end the author could have left out hints to her political views the story ends in a less than satisfactory way for this reader but that's the way the world is worth reading","1249":" i found amy waldman's 9 11 novel the submission an enjoyable read but i also found myself wishing that there was just a bit more depth perhaps a bit more verisimilitude to the whole proceeding i have no doubt that waldman has a bright future as a novelist but the submission read more like a good airport novel than a serious treatment of the divisions and contradictions of an america still wounded by something as traumatic as 9 11 perhaps this is the type of straightforward story telling that most readers need and any aspirations towards so called literary merit on the part of the writer a distraction but i felt that a novel dealing with the issues raised by a memorial to 9 11 designed by a muslim should offer a bit more of a challenge to the reader that being said i think waldman is a perceptive writer who manages to tackle her controversial subject matter with sensitivity i do not fully agree with some reviewers who found that the characters were mere mouthpieces to carry the arguments for and against the memorial i think that walden included enough detail to allow us a fairly well developed picture of the main characters especially mohammed khan claire burwell and asma anwar but i agree that the characters were a bit too insubstantial to really matter to the reader in the way the author might have intended i never really came 'feel' mohammed khan by the novels end still i gave it four stars for its readability pace and the fact that despite the book's shortcomings waldman managed to hold my interest to the end","1250":"powerful and incisive a wonderful meditation on the politics liberal and conservative regarding the memorialization of 9 11","1251":"the most striking aspect of this book is the way it highlights the importance of rhetoric and words in constructing and shaping our perceptions of the world each character has an agenda and it's fascinating to see the ways they use language to push it forward i found myself really enjoying the language waldman used to build her story as much as the language her characters use to construct their own images highly recommended","1252":"very interesting what if story set in manhattan ten years after 9 11 a panel has selected a submission from among thousands for a 9 11 memorial and the artist is a muslim what to do what to do","1253":"starved for a good read here it is folks this is the great american novel exposing what's not so great about post 2001 america multi faceted characters you will love and hate and feel ashamed of proud of shocked by betrayed by but never bored by the plot twists and twists to resolve very nicely the last page brought tears to my eyes","1254":"i had read very good reviews of this book and had been meaning to read it for a while now the book takes place about 2 3 years after the september 11th attacks there has been a jury selected to pick a design for a memorial at the world trade center site the submissions were anonymous and the jury votes strictly on the design when the jury decides on a design they learn that the winning designer is a muslim well you can imagine the reaction to that i really like how this book made me think about how i would feel in this situation i would like to think that i would be okay with it and say why does it matter but i can understand the feelings of some of the people in the book who are upset by it each character in the book reacts differently to the idea of a muslim designing the memorial and they each have their reasons the one complaint i had was that some of the characters were so frustrating especially the widow who lost her husband and is on the jury that picks the design just make up your mind there really is only one really redeeming likable character and i don't want to ruin the book by saying who that is i liked it very much and it definitely made me think","1255":"i like waldman's style of writing and i think she's pretty spot on about human nature we often are compelled to embrace pettiness selfishness and bitterness instead of favoring forgiveness tolerance and compromise yeah if you're looking for an uplifting read this ain't it even when we know we're choosing unwisely and want to be different i would have given this more stars if one of the main characters hadn't done a 180 in the middle of the novel i never really understood her motivation so her change of opinion rang very false to me","1256":"i enjoyed the way amy waldman wrote this book it was thought provoking and made me consider my views as an american and family member who lost a loved one 9 11 definitely worth reading","1257":"thought provoking and smart what if a muslim architect has won a blind design competition of the 9 11 memorial","1258":"this book does an excellent job of exploring the perspectives of a wide variety of people on an emotionally difficult matter of great relevance currently the characterization was so powerful because ms waldman drew each of the main characters as complex and imperfect although i have such a clear and sure view of what i think was right i still thought a great deal about my judgement based on what was presented in the book","1259":"hard to put down really had a hard time understanding why mo would not denounce the 9 11 attacks or explain his design he didn't come off as a likable character the attraction claire had for mo and sean had for claire were extraneous","1260":"i went to see this author give a talk when she was in town she is so thoughtful and insightful this book had one of the most satisfying endings i can recall not a tidy bow but apt just the themes she explores are universal told from every perspective that you can actually empathize with of 9 11 which is no easy feat one of my favorite books of all time","1261":"very solid the book does a good job detailing the variety of conflicts of conscience people feel after a tragedy especially one that is politically charged","1262":" this novel is based on a rather simple concept but what a concept a commission formed to review anonymous proposals for a memorial to the victims of the 9 11 world trade towers attack reach a hard won decision only to discover to their dismay and even more to the dismay of the general public when word leaks out that the architect who submitted the winning proposal is named mohammed khan never mind that khan is not religiously a muslim or that none of the commissioners had seen islamic elements in the proposal during their lengthy discussions weighing its merits against the other finalists the revelation nonetheless stirs the predictable controversy after the opening chapter establishing the premise the author introduces us to a diverse cast of characters the chair of the commission the governor and the governor's representative on the commission a commission to defend the rights of muslim americans and especially its chair the brother of a firefighter who died in the towers who leads the opposition an even more radical anti islam activist a fox news commentator and an undocumented bangladeshi immigrant whose husband also died in the towers among others yes all of these characters are to some extent types who are in the story to represent a particular perspective and yes there are too many of them to be fully fleshed out as complex human characters but that is probably an inevitable side effect of the general approach here and the author generally handles the characters well mostly avoiding stereotyping except oddly since the author is by background a reporter for the utterly noxious reporter character more complex than all of these characters are the two at the center of the story the architect himself and the 9 11 widow appointed to the commission to represent the families and who is at first at least the most ardent defender of the winning submission even after the identity of the submitter is revealed it would have been easy to make the architect a heroic figure defending his rights against bigotry and he is that to some extent but he's much more complicated than that and not always admirable in the way he bears himself the widow is somewhat less fully realized but still a nuanced character in all the characters carry the well paced story which cries out to be discussed by readers it reminds me of some of the best issue based novels of richard north patterson particularly the exile it's a page turner with considerable food for thought and discussion about what it means to be an american the moral limitations of democracy and the complexities of memorialization","1263":"fascinating a masterpiece more than a book about 9 11 it's about how our circumstances and how we are takes us to unpredictable places though this novel is easy to read it's addictive the prose is very clean it's not really an easy book it is intense and it will make you question many many things which makes it a very special book indeed","1264":"this book is about the anonymous submissions to a panel who will choose the memorial for the downed world trade towers a thoughtful exploration of discrimination","1265":"i want my family to all read this book so we can have a discussion this book makes you think not only about your preconcieved ideas about other religions but everyone you've had an argument with i would recommend this book for every bookclub i think our bookclub is going to have a really great discussion in 2 weeks","1266":"lots of interesting ideas and nuanced character development interpersonal dynamics but despite wanting to be fair u0026amp panoramic in scope when representing all sides of the controversy it was obvious the author had a harder time stepping into the minds of some of her characters such as the most overtly conservative character she juxtaposes his cringe inducing dialogue lumping in all muslims w terrorists etc with moments of great interior sensitivity and i just didn't think it worked i'm not saying people can't think one way u0026amp act another just that i didn't quite buy it in this book similarly one character's 180 change of attitude was also not quite believable although the exchanges that arise out of that switch are among the most interesting in the book the novel did start dragging for me about 2 3 of the way through but definitely worth finishing for the great conclusion which had a wonderful subtlety u0026amp a perfect unresolved resolution","1267":" a more relevant and timely book today than when it was published a couple of years ago it is about the knee jerk distrust verging on hatred of the islamic world - the very notion of nay the very term islam - in america as a result of the events of 9 11 it is about the inability of groups who think they have a vested personal interest to listen to any sort of argument that negates their gut feelings it is about the ways fear and anger and insecurities about our place in the world can undermine the notions of fair play justice and logic the jury deciding on the winner of an open competition to design a memorial to the dead of the attacks choose an elegant design of a geometric walled garden inscribed with the names of the dead with live trees as well as start steel tree skeletons arranged around slow flowing canals a beautiful idea one that provides solace and quiet and contemplative grief but it is designed by an american architect of muslim indian ancestry though he is as secular as one can be so naturally the families of many of the dead resist a muslim's design branding it a garden for the martyrs who carried out the attack great drama and conflict ensue a very well constructed thoughtful powerful novel filled with interesting characters of all sorts all of whom are given a chance to present their case wobbly as those cases often are a really engrossing read i will remember asma the illegal bangladeshi whose husband was a janitor in the towers whose last phone calls didn't get through because asma's landlady was gossiping on the phone asma makes the stirring speech at the open meeting but then gets deported and stabbed as she is leaving town i will remember how spiky and stubborn - and correct - mo the architect was in his refusal to explain his design or to alter it i will remember the last chapter which jumps ahead in time and very effectively brings the whole story to a satisfying close","1268":"it took me a while to get into this i'm not a fan of 9 11 themed books but this had an interesting ending","1269":"i really wanted to love this book it's just too idea bound for me and not enough getting into the characters' heads a bit like a non fiction report trying to cross over into fiction","1270":" such an ambitious novel and i'm not sure it hit all the marks set in nyc as a jury tries to choose an appropriate 9 11 memorial the book has an interesting premise what if the anonymous designer that the jury chose was an american muslim waldman plays out the action nicely and many of the plot points felt real this group rallies that talk show host says something despicable overall though there were too many characters and moving parts and i would have liked the book better if it had been a little shorter and a little more tightly focused on a few central characters","1271":"2 5 starsthis book was a chore for me to get through i found the characters to be flat and stereotypical and i did not particularly care for any of them there is also a large cast of peripheral characters that needlessly cluttered the already crowded group of players the author was in love with her command of the english language or at least with her command of 100 000 dollar words it just got to be irritating after awhile the concept for the book is solid prejudice and the events that can spark full on mayhem 9 11 is a tender topic to tackle but i didn't sympathize with anyone in this book i appreciated the details of their loss but the characters were so shallowly conceived that i was unable to make the leap to full on compassion if you want to read a novel about 9 11 i recommend extremely loud and incredibly close","1272":"2 5 stars i thought the storyline was interesting a muslim being picked to design the 9 11 memorial however i found the writing style to be boring and the characters were not very well developed this was one of those books i would put down and was not that compelled to pick up again but hate not finishing a book","1273":"watch my tow five wednesday video on authors i'm waiting on another book from that includes the submission https youtu be zfmoehdd3nc","1274":"this is a great read captures the atmosphere of post sept 11th through a variety of well developed perspectives impressive that this is her first novel","1275":"this is the third book i read in my small 9 11 read along and it's definitely the easiest read of the three the other two being don delillo falling man and jonathan safran foer extremely loud and incredibly close still even with being an easy read this has a lot of information about the aftermath of 9 11 a jury has been gathered to decide on a memorial for ground zero this is two years after 9 11 and the jury has been going through a lot of entries and finally narrowed it down to two - they argue back and forth about which one and finally the jury decides on a design - with especially the support of claire burwell who is representing all the families who lost someone in the attack they choose a beautiful garden enclosed by a wall with the names of all the victims on it but when they open the envelope with the name of the architect they get a bit of a surprise the architect turns out to be an american muslim mohammad khan now the question becomes if it matters who the architect is turns out it does when it's leaked to the public that the architect is a muslim all hell breaks loose claire still sticks up for him but faces serious opposition from a lot of the other families the families are torn between what to think about a muslim architect some see it as a way to reconcile - others see it as a slap in the face can a muslim design a memorial for all these people who were killed by other muslims a sidestory to this is the story of the illegal immigrants who also were killed in the attack personified by inam and asma anwar's story they come from bangladesh to get a better life in usa but inam is killed in the attacks and asthma is now on her own with their little boy without understanding much english she has to find out to go on living as a single muslim woman she wants her husband to be mentioned on the memorial she wants a place to go with her son to remember his father her husband when she decides to speak her words have a huge impact there was some events towards the end that i at first thought would put an amazing twist to the story but it didn't really work for me i also quite didn't believe in claire's development i was sure that she was going in one direction and when she went in the complete opposite one i was very surprised - especially since it came right after her remembering a situation with her husband talking about how you can like an artwork without liking the artist or vice versa that liking one and hating the other isn't mutually exclusive what i did like about this book was it's focus on how difficult it was to be a muslim at that point how all muslims were judged by what a few extremists did and how the difference between being a terrorist and a muslim disappeared i liked the focus on how hateful the dialogue became and how you couldn't say anything critical of the government without being called unpatriotic it really put a spotlight on the importance of not judging an entire group of people by what a few representatives from that group do i really liked how claire's children build cairns all the way through new york to guide their daddy home i loved that way of showing how children need something tangibly to work through their grief - it reminded me of how oscar in extremely loud and incredibly close visited all the people named black to solve what he thought was the last riddle left to him by his dad and how the children in falling man sits at the window looking for planes the building of the cairns is a beautiful thing and it becomes clear that it's also an extremely important thing since we later in the novel both have a destruction of a cairn and also a new cairn a very significant cairn these cairns are a way of remembering one way just one way nothing more and that's the thing if you visit a cemetery you will see how many different ways there are of remembering the gravestones differs there are small stone birds and bird baths on some graves constantly fresh flowers on others and so on so with all these people killed on 9 11 how do you make one memorial that will suit all not to mention the rest of the states as well as the fact that this memorial also have to send a signal to the rest of the world what is the right way to remember all this loss of life i think the novel really works in bringing about the way it felt like in those first years how hard it is to follow your head and do what you know is right when your heart is screaming out against it how things don't exist in a vacuum but are depending on so many other facts and circumstances and how our decisions are influenced by all this it might have been taking the easy way out to write the novel from a young muslim woman's viewpoint but to me she was a more interesting than claire but maybe that's more because i don't quite believe in claire's decisions i have a hard time rating this novel i think there's a lot of good in it but maybe it didn't live quite up to my expectations i think maybe that while at the same time the novel's strength is how easy and quickly it is in discussing some very serious topics about racism sorrow anger and a nation trying to heal itself it's also the novel's weakness i felt like it skated a bit over the issues without going completely in depth with any of them but it is a good read it raises some interesting points but i still think extremely loud and incredibly close is the better 9 11 novel of the three i've read now","1276":"i really enjoyed this our freshmen had to read this as their first year experience class it sheds light to diversity appreciation of other cultures and also enlightens those unawares of the tragedy of 9 11 although fictional the story reads so much like fact than of a made up tale","1277":" this book is a fictional story surrounding a proposed memorial for the 9 11 spot i waivered between 3 and 4 stars for this book it is pretty well written and an interesting story but i would only have given it a 3 for those factors what bumped my rating to a 4 was her character development there are multiple stories going on from all different perspectives she makes her characters very real very human i hated things about them and i admired things in them at the same time the other thing that made me give this a 4 was how much it made me think and analyze my own prejudices i really had to think about how i would feel and act in the different situations she presented overall a very thought provoking book it does have some crude language though beware","1278":"i gave up after a few chapters","1279":"i really liked this book a bit simplistic maybe but overall an intricately woven take on some of the post 9 11 muslim ground zero concerns and fears i liked the architecture aspects a lot too remnants of an architecture obsessed ex boyfriend i guess","1280":"boring flat dull characters didn't like","1281":"i struggled at first with the author's writing style it seemed disjointed and didn't flow however because i found the topic and theme intriguing i continued in the end i was rewarded with a very 'good read'","1282":"this book really made me examine my beliefs about the usa and how we conduct ourselves do we truly consider all men created equal how do we react in a crisis can we ever be truly free","1283":"time taken to read 4 daysblurb from goodreadsten years after 9 11 a dazzling kaleidoscopic novel reimagines its aftermath a jury gathers in manhattan to select a memorial for the victims of a devastating terrorist attack their fraught deliberations complete the jurors open the envelope containing the anonymous winner's name and discover he is an american muslim instantly they are cast into roiling debate about the claims of grief the ambiguities of art and the meaning of islam their conflicted response is only a preamble to the country's the memorial's designer is an enigmatic ambitious architect named mohammad khan his fiercest defender on the jury is its sole widow the self possessed and mediagenic claire burwell but when the news of his selection leaks to the press she finds herself under pressure from outraged family members and in collision with hungry journalists wary activists opportunistic politicians fellow jurors and khan himself as unknowable as he is gifted in the fight for both advantage and their ideals all will bring the emotional weight of their own histories to bear on the urgent question of how to remember and understand a national tragedy in this deeply humane novel the breadth of amy waldman's cast of characters is matched by her startling ability to conjure their perspectives a striking portrait of a fractured city striving to make itself whole the submission is a piercing and resonant novel by an important new talentmy reviewa competition to design a memorial for the victims of 9 11 is set and a jury to pick the winner the anonymous design is by an architect called mohammad khan behind closed doors the jurors argue over the impossibility of this man being allowed to design it what follows is a lot of anger distrust hurt hate racism and arguments debates over what is right morally and if the design should be allowed or even announced i loved the start of this book it raised so many questions and an inner debate if i was on that jury would i have a problem with it would i be suspicious or would i be outraged on mohammad's behalf an american being wronged because of his religion and his appearance i didn't like how there wasn't a lot of background on the characters but i suppose it may have taken away from the subject matter but i would have liked to know more about mohammad and what made him the way he was and why he reacted as he did you read a lot of the characters opinions as the book goes on and the debate for and against it and also how mohammad reacts to it all and his perception to be honest nearing the end i started to waver and get a little bored by it the same issues kept going round and then the end seemed to jump a fair bit i would have liked to have had more attention paid to the final outcome of the memorial and how it came about but felt it skimmed on that and started giving us a bit more on the characters when the whole book had been about the memorial and reactions rather than any kind of depth of the characters it is still a very interesting read for the most part and it certainly makes you think i even learned a little about a different religion i think it would make for an excellent book group read as there is much to discuss and debate on 3 5 for me this time and thanks to waterstones book club for sending this my way","1284":"it was a pretty good book it was all about choosing a designer to construct the memorial at the wtc after 9 11 i read this book because it was one of the library's readers choice books since i have a goal to read at least 3 or 4 of them before the time period is over","1285":"excellent usually stay away from books with 9 11 themes but highly recommend this one","1286":"i had a hard time starting this book but once i got going on it i didn't want to put it down the author did a wonderful job of making all of the main characters sympathetic i never knew who i was rooting for because you could see where every one of them was coming from more than that you knew as you read that in the end no matter what happened none of them could ever really win","1287":"it was a sad book but interesting in that it depicted the crowd hysteria that modern technology can start over a cultural bias the pain and power of the 9 11 families was in plain display as well as the crazies that come to the fore with controversies what a waste of talent and idea","1288":"four and a half stars nearly perfect so complex so layered so thought provoking this is a book that begs to be discussed","1289":"while this premise could have led to some interesting social commentary i found the characters to be too stock for there to be any real depth having so many perspectives and each an archetype leads to an oversimplification of a complex topic and i hated the last chapter","1290":"this book was was very thought provoking and engaging it allowed the reader to carefully explore their own prejudices and outlooks and was never preachy i liked it better and better as it progressed and was surprised by the ending i also found certain descriptive sentences to be very original and memorable","1291":" i found the submission evocative thought provoking and extremely well crafted without straying anywhere near manipulative i was fascinated by the character development of mo and claire and enjoyed that i often couldn't pin down their motivations something even both characters expressed difficulty doing throughout the novel amy waldman's treatment of the events emotions and aftermath of a fictional national terrorist attack was ripe with sympathy and what felt to me realistic and understandable reactions this novel wouldn't have worked without a large amount of diversity in the cast of characters and i thought amy waldman was fair in her representation of a very heterogeneous manhattan i always appreciate when an author's characters can recall feelings memories a life before the events of the novel take place and the submission delivered on this level as well the submission is what all contemporary fiction should be a modestly literary interesting story even if somewhat slow moving about realistically drawn characters that avoids calling attention to its own prose or authorial agenda in short i loved it","1292":"this book reimagines the aftermath of 9 11 01 a memorial jury has been chosen to select a design from anonymous submissions the group selects the design for a garden to be created at ground zero only to discover that the designer is an american muslim a public relations war is waged between anti muslim and pro muslim groups as the controversy escalates into violence everyone involved must examine their conscience and rethink their moral standing a very thoughtful novel that should appeal to a wide variety of readers particularly those who enjoy political drama reviewed by allison c","1293":"while the writing is fine the plot is pedantic i kept reading hoping for a surprising plot twist only to be disappointed chapter after chapter in retrospect i should have stopped reading why it was picked as the first year experience book at my university i will never understand","1294":"really good heard reading that was well done at seattle library","1295":"this very thought provoking book is not a fast read but it is a worthwhile one the novel explores a controversial decision made by a fictional committee regarding a september 11th memorial the author is able to convey the disparate views of a variety of interested groups in a remarkably even handed manner any reader will ponder their own reactions it's a story that will stay in your thoughts long after you read the last pages","1296":"the writing is good the characters well drawn and the consequences of the selection all too believeable i thought waldman was not as even handed in ladling out prejudice and ill manners as she could have been and the final section was a bit too much like the wrap up at the end of bonfire of the vanities otherwise a good book","1297":"i enjoyed this book","1298":"thought provoking but i pretty much disliked every single character i felt like i was much more emotionally mature than all of them","1299":"even though this was a frustrating book because the main characters were unable to change and grow to stop a crisis there were some important lessons learned in the long run so i ended up liking it more than i thought i would such sadness come when we are unable to change for the better","1300":"i found the book interesting and well written the furor over the memorial echoes the mosque kerfuffle and rings true as every memorial has warring factions and politics even those for events people farther in the past and less sensational p s as an architect i loved mo's design i think that if the designs were reversed i would have been less sympathetic but the best design had my support would actually love to see something like that as a memorial","1301":"exceptional book about the 9 11 memorial fictional choice takes a realistic look at the media's power the mayhem of personal rights the self serving politicos and the innocents caught up in trying to speak out for their lost loved ones i love a book that challenges my thoughts and expands my vocabulary at the same time for a first novel by this author it is outstanding","1302":"well written great storytelling but i still have trouble with fiction based on 911 tough read for me","1303":"this was a disappointing read the side characters were far more interesting than any of the main characters","1304":" i'd give it 4 5 stars if i could in sight of five but not quite the writing here is very thoughtful the major characters are fully fleshed out and go through changes with the memorial process except one everyone has motives and they're not always seen there are myriad issues here and waldman doesn't shy from them indeed she wades in as far as she can bringing multiple points of view together when possible the ending is well done and appropriate this book is an english teacher's dream with symbolism themes foreshadowing but you're not hit over the head with them highly recommended especially for book groups everyone will have something to talk about with this one","1305":"an interesting concept for a story a committee to choose the memorial design for the victims of 9 11 find out that a muslim american won the blind competition the jury find itself in the middle of strong reactions because there are few truly sympathetic characters this book did not connect with me emotionally as i thought it should but it did make me think always a good thing","1306":"great premise but the plot ends up disappointing plus there's only one truly likable character everyone else is self righteous and overly self conscious","1307":"the premise of this book is so interesting a jury votes on a memorial for the victims of the 9 11 attacks all entries are anonymous and after a winner is selected the world learns that the design was submitted by an american muslim unfortunately what i thought would be such a compelling book didn't really get any more interesting than the book jacket the story raised all the issues one would expect really you could go ahead and have the book club discussion just based on the book jacket alone the characters never came to life for me and the writing reminded me of tom perotta's the abstinence teacher flat and full of caricatures i actually considered abandoning this about a hundred pages in life is short and full of too many wonderful books but it read quickly and isn't a long book so i stuck it out and the second half was actually much better than the first with a fairly good ending but nowhere did it live up to my expectations after reading so many reviews about what a beautifully written novel this is","1308":"i can think of so many people who need to read this book excellent situational drama that addresses some very real fears and misconceptions in today's society","1309":"a book version of the movie crash interesting to get inside the mind and emotions of the various groups of people affected by the 9 11 attack","1310":"excellent book definitely a book that is worth a good discussion book club selection","1311":"this novel contains every meaning of the word submission that could possibly be explored exquisitely written surprising and provocative this book could not have been better","1312":"the story line of this book is very creative but could also very well happen really liked this book although it got a tad long at times","1313":"an interesting story idea i thought some of it was a little far fetched","1314":"excellent thank you kristen masson diedhiou for the recommendation","1315":"read my review at http artlobster blogspot com 2012 0","1316":"this book took me a bit to get into but then i loved it i enjoyed the dynamic among the characters and enjoyed the ending not just another 9 11 book instead it is a story about identity and doubt very enjoyable","1317":"liked it brings up many different perspectives on how to honor victims of a very traumatic event interested to see what the rest of my book club thinks","1318":"this review has been hidden because it contains spoilers to view it click here i found the book to be a little slow at first but am glad i stuck with it its an interesting premise the architect was less stereotypical howard roark than is usually portrayed in books and movies as an architect who happened to have visited bangladesh last year i enjoyed it","1319":"i had to think a bit about this novel i wanted it to give me the answers to bigotry and discrimination prejudice speculation and intolerance the myopic and insular views that i hear read and see around me i think the world has always had these problems but this story is about the attact of 9 11 01 in manhattan it takes place only 2 years after the event when the wounds were still raw no wonder there was so much distrust and confusion and yet everyone wanted to move on and expected that a memorial at the site would start this process perhaps in some way that was impossible to see or appreciate at the time but it did begin the healing this book builds it's characters and yet you can never get to really know them they needed to know themselves i found myself asking how i felt about the memorial and the complications i wanted someone to really explain it have a debate and someone be the winner yet this is exactly what happens in the story submissions for the memorial are made anonymously and when the winner is chosen and he is a muslin american a bomb of disagreement is set off what do you do play by the rules or change them stand by your beliefs your heart or compromise truly your sense of self and your own openess are questioned in this thought provoking novel this was a really good read and one you have to discuss with others","1320":"so much potential in this yet so unrealized thought provoking but when all is said and done it leaves the reader uninvested please refer to nate j's and kathy's reviews below as they adequately convey my disappointment in what could have and should have been an outstanding offering","1321":"worth reading but left a sour taste in my mouth","1322":"was mesmerized by the characters in the book and found the questions she raised well piercing and almost painful","1323":"for months the jury had been reviewing the thousands of anonymous submissions for the september 11th memorial contest finally they were down to two designs the garden claire's favorite was beautiful and a place she could imagine her family and other victim's families visiting the second design the void was just too dark for her although there were artists politicians a retired university president and a historian on the panel claire was the only jury member who had lost a family member claire's husband had been killed in the attack and she represented the families it was time to vote and claire was ecstatic when the garden design was chosen for the memorial the piece of paper containing the winner's name was passed from palm to palm like a fragile folio there were a few gasps and \"hmmms \" an \"interesting \" an \"oh my \" then \"jesus fucking christ it's a goddam muslim what an amazing premise what now should they eliminate the winner just because his name was mohammed could this be a \"healing gesture\" as one juror suggested or was it a disaster just waiting to happen was the beautiful garden memorial actually a islamic garden a martyrs paradise what should they do...what could they do a winner had been selected fair and square mohammed khan or \"mo\" as his friends called him was born in virginia the son of muslim immigrants from india he was a talented ambitious architect we get to know mo and feel for him when he gets pulled out of the security line at the airport just because of his name we are also introduced to sean an angry young man whose brother was killed in the twin tower attack and could not accept a memorial designed by a muslim and then there is asma anmar a pregnant illegal bangladeshi immigrant whose husband was also killed in the attack the submission touches on so many relevant topics how do we feel about american muslims there is still so much fear and confusion when it comes to islam last year as i was driving home i noticed a group of people gathered on the front lawn of the slade mansion in pikesville they were clearly muslim and engaged in some type of ceremony at the time i was unaware that the baltimore congregation of the ahmadiyya movement in islam had bought the property and i have to admit that i was startled and somewhat uncomfortable we all have a lot to learn the submission is a quick read and is definitely food for thought www fridaymorningbookclub com","1324":"this book is important","1325":"just finished this one wonderful premise for a novel and i'm not sure why i didn't like it more while some of the moral and ethical arguments were very well done i thought that it could have done with just a little trimming down the should they shouldn't they arguments just became a little repetitive although the individuals involved were never anything less than fascinating well worth a read but i'd stop short of a highly recommended","1326":"very interesting premise and story line last 3 4 of book a little too much of the same but overall a good read","1327":" predictable and stereotypical about a competition to design a 9 11 memorial and the the prejudices and emotions that emerged after 9 11 ultimately i don't think this novel actually had much to say despite trying hard likewise i tried hard to like it the writing itself was certainly crisp and competent but i found it dull the characters were stereotypes the families of the blue collar were bigots and stupid the media types were slimy and sensationalizers the politicians were driven by polls and perception and the newly wealthy were elitist and aspirational yes there are people like all of these but that's why it doesn't take a lot of creativity or artistry to come up with a stock portrait of them","1328":" i wanted to read this book because it appeared on many best of 2011 lists it's a complex novel about a fictional aftermath of 9 11 where a muslim architect's design is selected for the monument of the attacks the book shifts from many persepectives the architect members of the selection committee a reporter family member's of victims it is a thought provoking piece of work with many complex facets of politics religion and grief being explored i applaud the author for not making the architect a saintly muslim his hubris and flaws make the question of if his design should be built all the more interesting in fact i found all the characters in this novel to be very complex no one is completely right or completely wrong the one character you will whole heartedly love is an illegal immigrant widow her plight made me think about how many real life conter parts there must be to this character and what has become of them the conclusion of the book is inevitable but i found the epilogue truly moving if you are looking for a book with clear cut heroes and villains this probably isn't your cup of tea but if you want a slice of humanity with all it's flaws you could do worse than this book","1329":"i read this book because i thought the premise that a jury selected a model for the wtc 9 11 memorial that turned out to have been created by a muslim was interesting and original and it was but the book could have been so much more than that the characters are stereotypical and one dimensional by the time i got to the end i didn't really care any more what the outcome would be","1330":"well paced thoughtful and thought provoking novel about a competition for the 9 11 memorial site","1331":"i was interested in the premise of this book an anonymous contest to design a memorial for 911 when a muslim won people were forced to examine their ethics and prejudices the deciding jury of judges was polarized and turned on each other then after this plot was set up i got lost in the middle of a myriad of characters and opinions there were too many people in there that just muddied the water and whose views were belabored then it ended in a very satisfying poignant way way too uneven for me","1332":"what would happen if the winner of a blind competition to design the 9 11 memorial at ground zero were named mohammad this account of that fictional scenario raises questions many many of us are not prepared to answer well written and thought provoking","1333":"of the so called 9 11 novels that i have read so far this one captures the tug of war over whose grief was more important this was a microcosm of a nation's grief an already confused state wrapped up in ignorance and prejudice and political ambition that seemed to mark the aftermath of the buildings coming down this is brilliantly written most of the characters are not one dimensional the politicians and the reporters seem to be the cynical bad guys here and along the way showcases the ways that america itself is changing well done","1334":"unique premise really interesting and engaging story three dimensional characters really just a great book","1335":"be careful not to read any spoilers i found the author pulled it all together in the last few pages following a rather tedious section an important book because it confronts the issue of what it means to be an american and the difficulties faced by persons of color immigrants legal and otherwise and by persons from non christian religions","1336":"an intelligent story exploring prejudice and honor this was a seattle public library selection for our what if everyone in seattle read the same book and was an excellent choice this would be a great discussion book for book groups","1337":"i was a tepid reader through the opening chapters but the writing kept me reading and i'm glad i stuck w it satisfying and thought provoking subject matter","1338":"a study of prejudice which is totally baseless and unnecessary","1339":"the story takes place in new york city two years after the 9 11 attack on the nyc world trade towers a panel of community members are given the task of selecting a design for the memorial plans all submitted anonymously from numerous architects when a garden design is selected the panel learns that the architect of the design is an american muslim what would seem to be a cut and dried decision then becomes fractured into a battle of conflicting issues points of view emotions stereotypes ambitions and loyalties although the story is fiction it is so timely published ten years after the actual attack it's an interesting study of human nature and emotional conflict we all harbor it certainly makes the reader question their own feelings and beliefs would be a good choice for serious book group discussion","1340":" while many of these characters seemed to exist to espouse a viewpoint or a postion i really enjoyed this novel i was often angry and irritated which meant i was paying attention i was appalled and then ashamed about various aspects of american life but despite a slim didacticism throughout i thought the plot flowed the characters came alive and the intent the theme was clear but not overwhelming i'm not sure i needed the epilogue i had held a strange and curious hope that two of the characters would get together call it my human nature and knowing that didn't happen and knowing that many of the characters most didn't get what they wanted out of life seemed to cap off this story of a time in an unnecessary and even more depressing way however good read","1341":"it certainly got me thinking if i was one of the survivors or beneficiaries of the 911 attack how would i feel if a muslim was chosen to create the memorial for my loved one even tho mo who was chosen unamiously and was an american it really gets you thinking it was an excellent book","1342":"bernadette dunne's good storytelling couldn't help me to enjoy this book","1343":"well i finally finished it did i enjoy it no usually when i'm not enjoying a book i won't finish but i did want to find out the ending of this one all in all i felt that i couldn't connect with any of the characters none of them where honest they all had an agenda claire i found was the worst poor lady very fragile and i've no idea how she appeared on the jury glad i finished it but didn't like it now onto something a little lighter for a change of pace","1344":"read this book read it today a frighteningly realistic story set in the after math of 9 11 regarding a competition to design a fitting memorial the submissions are sealed the names of the architects unknown when a design created by an american muslim wins the story takes off like a roller coaster wonderful book that looks squarely at our biases our prejudices and our fears just extraordinary","1345":"loved loved loved this couldn't put it down completely and frighteningly plausible the character development was phenomenal and i loved how the author ended it i am sad to have finished it and now have no more to read","1346":"powerful a well thought through story allowing the reader to try on several different points of view regarding a post 9 11 memorial competition","1347":" i had no idea what to expect with this book but ended up being pretty pleased with it while it is well written i tend to tire of books that insist on describing the sexual encounters of the characters i get it but i just don't know that it always added to the character development with that said i found the thought processes extremist tendencies and stereotyping done by the characters to still be relevant today two decades from the 9 11 tragedy the author succeeded in capturing the multiple dimensions in which people can live on that spectrum i'll probably read another book when she writes one","1348":"this novel has all the elements of a great story worthy of book club discussions unfortunately the characters who drive the story are disappointingly enigmatic our last view of the garden includes in your face messages by both claire and mo for claire and mo and should have been a great moment in the novel it wasn't because the claire and mo for whom i cheered at the beginning of the novel disintegrated into unlikeable people that i used to know","1349":" in addition to all the obvious themes of racism and terror and prejudice in the aftermath of 9 11 amy waldman's the submission really made me think about art and its public display about power and ambition about competition it is a book of big ideas but it is simultaneously and just as tellingly about the characters of the story their various layers of motivation of fear and fatigue and ambiguity this is a book in which powerful intellectuals play important roles but it's not a snooty book i loved this book and couldn't put it down for hours at a time the writing is also gorgeous highly recommended","1350":"this is a good book about perception and how it is influenced by the media and our personal experiences it made me think about how our identities are shaped too i also loved the multiple meanings of submission throughout the text although it was emotionally tough to read at times i'm glad i did","1351":"this was an audiobook i liked the format of the book from viewpoints of different characters a little disappointed in the ending but all in all enjoyable","1352":"timely subject matter since it is the 10th anniversary of 9 11 makes this interesting food for thought about how we treat muslims in america families of victims and illegal immigrants would have been a great short story but not enough to fill a full length book","1353":"i enjoyed the book a quick read with a timely topic","1354":"one of the best books i have read this year and the closing sentence is one of the most beautiful endings to a novel i have ever read","1355":" this book was not a quick read it wasn't even an exciting read it was however a thought provoking read which is why i liked it this book delves into a fictional look at what might happen if a muslim architect had won the 9 11 memorial design competition i found it fascinating and the author did an incredible job of putting numerous points of view into this story in the plot the author kept throwing curve balls at the reader so that even i much like the main character claire was constantly changing my mind as to how this should be handled very interesting but not for everyone","1356":" in new york a specially selected panel unanimously selects a memorial for the victims of a terrorist attack when the winning architect is revealed he is an american muslim which splits the panel and the whole of america into violent opposition or support i found reading this novel a bit of a struggle as it is so american and so intimately connected with the events of 9 11 and its aftermath though non americans obviously share the horror of what happened on that terrible day i don't think we have the same visceral connection to it which means that 9 11 novels as a genre don't seem as immediate the novel seemed to me to have been written as an intellectual exercise and a study of how nationalism and fear of other cultures can run riot and as such i felt strangely detached from it though the author is writing about desperate times and the terrible toll of terrorism it never felt like there was much emotion in the book there are flashes of humour one of which made be chuckle out loud but i was never moved by it i found the submission interesting and worth reading but i didn't have any feelings for it or feel that i was altered in any way by reading it","1357":"an amazing read thought provoking and beautifully written despite the time that has elapsed since 9 11 this novel plunged me right back into the tense and fragile world of nyc two years after the attacks the characters are genuine and offer strikingly different povs i can't remember a book of late that triggered so many different emotions frustration sadness anger and humility i'm quite sure this novel will resonate with me for a long time","1358":"an engaging look at post 9 11 america examining how americans deal with muslims in the 21st century different points of view show how new yorkers struggled finding consensus on the design of a 9 11 memorial that was designed by an american architect named mohammad khan part satire and part social commentary with some surprising twists great book group read because of its provocative subject matter","1359":"this is a novel of ideas not language but what ideas no angle on the september 11th attacks goes unexplored which makes reading it uncomfortable disappointed in the prose itself but an impressive undertaking","1360":"ms waldman writes with a very mature understanding of the difficulty of changing our minds or even knowing our own minds when cultural differences and highly charged emotional content are involved i came away from this book feeling like it is a miracle that any of us ever understand each other","1361":"wow what an interesting story after i finished it i noticed the real twin towers memorial was opened in ny alot like how it was described in the book makes you think how would you react some characters you just wanted to smack","1362":"i think that writing about 9 11 is one of the hardest things for modern day novelists to take on and it's easy to fall into trite tails of the terror that nyc residents felt or the sad accounts of the first responder families waldman hit on a particularly interesting idea of having a muslim american win a design contest to build the memorial and focusing on the reaction from the families the politicians the muslim community the media and the citizens while i am quite fond of the originality of the idea unfortunately i think the novel is just so so waldman's prose while clean is only ok and i thought her characters other than a well developed tabloid hack lacked any depth and i found her to be only a mediocre story teller a shame because the critical reviews of this novel were quite good and of all the books i received for the holidays i was perhaps most looking forward to this one unfortunately the submission kind of let me down","1363":"this is a very smart insightful book i loved the development of the characters and the twists and turns of the plot the ending was very well done and unexpected i can't wait to see what the author comes up with next","1364":"while the premise of the book is interesting i was not particularly drawn in by the characters plotting was straightforward and i saw the ending coming from a mile away if you're interested in the premise perhaps you'll enjoy it better than i did","1365":" this one is a good book to read if you want to think waldman does an excellent job of bringing up the various points of view of her characters each of whom have different takes on the whole submission issue i loved the gray areas i found myself having sympathy for each character at different junctures and judging them for their flaws in thinking as well the ending was perfect not just the epilogue which was beautiful in its own way not necessarily how i would have wanted the story to end but a realistic ending nonetheless definitely worth the time","1366":"this was good and reminded me of the fervor when an attempt to build a mosque one mile from ground zero was made","1367":"i really enjoyed this book it was looking at such an interesting problem trying to consider all the sides","1368":" a nation's tragedy brings out the best and the worst in its citizens amy waldman places her story at the center of america's tragedy two years after the devastation a contest for a 9 11 memorial where the world trade center once stood brings to a boil all the simmering hurt and mistrust and fear about the future what is it that causes this firestorm of media distortion and political posturing what revelation leads to threats and accusations and even violence just a name the name of the contest winner mo is as american as can be he's an architect born and raised in virginia his immigrant parents proudly gave him the name of a beloved prophet never would they have imagined that a few decades later that name would become like poison to many americans mo is mohammad khan a muslim name suddenly his design the garden becomes suspect and the selection committee backpedals on its decision this story felt so real that it sometimes made my heart ache for my country my world my species how easily we let ourselves be distracted led away from the harmony we say we want when the media and special interest groups push our buttons they can make us forget why we've come together and what we hoped to accomplish the voices of reason and reconciliation are often the most gentle and the hardest to hear amid the din of controversy it's challenging to give a plausible ending to a novel with real life parallels this book poses more questions than it answers which is as it should be given the complexity of the issues i think waldman found a strong and believable finish our hope for the younger generations is powerful those who are too young to remember september 11 2001 and its aftermath may be our best chance for a balanced perspective and ultimately for healing","1369":"an interesting premise and story but not very subtle or nuanced would be interested in reading something with more depth almost no character development actually no character development such a shame","1370":"pfft read based on a librarian friend's recommendation as well as the release time reviews getting through this book was a real slog the latter third picked up but the character turns at the end left a bitter taste in my mouth","1371":"wasn't that jazzed on reading a 9 11 book but this one was surprisingly compelling a quick read","1372":"this book is the all fairfax reads selection for 2012 it was a powerful book and a great character study i really enjoyed it","1373":"this story had so much potential it could have been so gripping and thought provoking yet i thought something was missing none of the characters really appealed to me and nearing the end of the book i just wanted to finish it which is sad","1374":" i really liked the concept of this book great idea and great plot it raises a lot of serious and thought provoking issues i think it could make for a good book club discussion with emotional opinions and sides taken but i really did not like the author's writing style she tried way too hard with the adjectives and metaphors i felt like i was reading an fcat writes paper a standard writing paper by a secondary school student in florida it drove me crazy and her use of different vocabulary words seemed forced there were words that i had never seen and usually i love using my kindle to learn new words but the author's use of many of these words seemed artificial and at times inappropriate the characters were just okay none stood out as someone i cared about i think that mo was the main character but he was so unlikable i would recommend this book to a book club but not to someone for fun personal reading","1375":"this is a fast paced fictional story of the competition for the design of the 9 11 memorial at the site of the destruction of the world trade center towers the submissions are blind architects' names are hidden and are submitted to a jury for selection the design chosen it turns out was by an american muslim architect while characterization is good the story is as much plot driven as character driven waldman does an outstanding job imagining the situation in all of its complexities of controversies there are no heroes she illuminates for the reader all sides of each issue so that the reader feels in the midst of a web from which there is no clear cut resolution my only criticism is that in places she uses techniques i associate with mass market fiction the book didn't need those and for this reader would have been stronger without them","1376":"couldn't put the book down a jury of 9 11 families select a design for a memorial then learn the architect is of muslim heritage the story was pretty gripping but i was unhappy with the ending and somewhat disappointed in the character development the author gives so much food for thought however that those shortcomings don't prevent it from being a good read","1377":"extremely thought provoking beautifully written","1378":"it started well very thought provoking characters that didn't act like you would expect then i thought it kind of ran out of steam","1379":"heavy but easy book to read excellent characters that unearth the emotions felt after 9 11 a book that would have had less impact on me 2 years ago before i moved to an islamic country if nothing else it highlighted my expanded view of islam since living in indonesia a book i hope more americans and australians read in order to expose their fear of all things islam","1380":"very interesting concept and overall pretty good tended to be a little wordy at times","1381":"pretty good a great premise the blue ribbon committee has a blind process to determine the best design for the new ground zero winner turns out to be a muslim take it from there","1382":" i heard about the book from npr i was fascinated by the possibilities for discussion we chose it as a book club selection most of us do not have direct connections to 9 11 or muslims so our frame of reference is from a distance much of our discussion revolved around the way the author handled the subject amy waldman agreed to speak to us via remote access i cannot think of the technical term it helped clarify her motivation and direction most of our group liked the idea of a garden for healing purposes only one member was adamant about the muslim being the designer his inablility as well as claire's to not submit to anyone else stand was agreed upon by most of us i really took to the idea of the moral dilema","1383":"i enjoyed the submission very much it helped me along the path of understanding of what this country is currently experiencing and my own view of where america currently stands it did open my eyes of how complex the social attitudes have changed and are still changing toward a muslim mentality i most definitely felt the book was worth the read","1384":"this review has been hidden because it contains spoilers to view it click here this is a beautifully written novel that is extremely painful to read i had a hard time putting it down though sometimes had to do so because it was hard to tolerate the realistic but pessimistic depiction of human actions in the wake of tragedy people do some horrible things in this book i thought some of the characters were well developed and others less well developed but i found the main characters to be complex and unique i was particularly impressed by the characterizations of clai this is a beautifully written novel that is extremely painful to read i had a hard time putting it down though sometimes had to do so because it was hard to tolerate the realistic but pessimistic depiction of human actions in the wake of tragedy people do some horrible things in this book i thought some of the characters were well developed and others less well developed but i found the main characters to be complex and unique i was particularly impressed by the characterizations of claire mohammed paul and asma and less so by laila sean and alyssa who seemed either one dimensional or inconsistent i am not sure how the author managed to essentially write a treatise on racism and violence while also weaving together themes of ego ambition pride and grief but i think she successfully did so one of the most interesting moments in the book was when claire and mohammed are confronted by their cycle of mistrust and are not able to get beyond it there are lessons to be learned in this interchange well beyond the scope of a novel and i could see this exchange being used in classrooms to discuss mediation and diplomacy my main complaint about the book was the ending although some individual healing took place at the end in my opinion there was no true healing between people who had been in conflict with each other and this lent a pessimistic feel to the book as a whole i think if the author had allowed mohammend and claire to mature and come to some kind of even tenuous resolution they did have 20 years after all the book would have felt more hopeful i would give this book 4 5 stars if i could more","1385":"so much more could have been done with the content and the characters were very 2 dimensional an okay read for one time","1386":" this must be how waldman would like to do all her journalism from inside the cast's minds and i wish she could too exposed to characters' influences and feelings about islam and politics in this country i was even more excited than usual for the exercises in argument that the events are fictional does not diminish in the least their vital meaning in the us i want that from my fiction finishing the book i'm both glad to have related to disparate voices in the country post 9 11 and frustrated at the mediocrity we're capable of despite that ability to relate","1387":"the characters were not very developed and i had a hard time caring about any of them i kept waiting for the story to go somewhere very fluffy writing","1388":"a slow factual book that despite the subject failed to make me go wow there was a whole gusto missing however enjoyed reading and pondering over the controversy of it all","1389":"a contest of course involving anonymous submissions for a 9 11 memorial that turns out to have been won by a mohammad kahn muslim american architect actually kahn is totally american born in virginia raised in the u s a and totally secular in terms of world view no matter with a name like mohammad you have to assume all hell is going to break loose it certainly does and is well narrated by journalist turned novelist amy waldman for the most part this has all the characteristics of a five star work but i deducted one because of the way the khan character became more contrived as the novel progressed toward its conclusion and the uneven handling of claire the contest juror who was appointed as a representative of the families who lost loved ones on 9 11 the other characters great aren't so much three dimensional as they are devices to reveal the real protagonist which is public opinion rather than a person per se and in molding the ebb and flow of public opinion waldman is biting and masterful","1390":"really liked this one it has been a long time since i read it but what i recall is how effectively the author looked at the controversy from so many different perspectives it felt impactful and also gave me additional perspective on 9 11","1391":" the idea behind this book is riveting it has been two years since the world trade center calamity after a blind contest a design is selected for a memorial the designer is an american and a muslim this story tells what happens thereafter this would make for an amazing discussion or right or wrong religion fairness honor and dignity but it does not make an amazing book or at least not this one this novel is told from far too many points of view the architect an unscrupulous reporter the chair of the committee and three family members one of these members is on the committee and championed the architect's right to have his design built but changes her mind the second is the brother of one the victims who cannot seem to decide which side he is on his volatility kept him off the selection committee the third is the most compelling though is the third a bangladeshi woman in this country illegally whose husband tied in the towers she is the linchpin on which the whole story eventually turns this could have been a great novel but in the end if was only a good one the writing takes away from the compelling subject matter perhaps the fact that the author is a journalist has something to do with her need to tell the story from as many points of view as possible when two or three would have been enough the journalist's character is despicable and completely unnecessary","1392":"probably closer to a 3 5 very interesting nuanced look at contemporary politics w r t race religion terrorism and class","1393":" i found the premise of this book wildly compelling and most of the execution of it thought provoking and interesting i often dislike very much the convention of skipping decades ahead and found it particularly frustrating in this story this is an ideal book club book in my opinion as you could mine themes for hours and the diversity of the characters and their spectrum of perspectives helps you see how rarely if ever is anything simple even with a terribly frustrating ending i am so glad i read this book and i would love to hear from others who have read it about what they felt","1394":"i loved the title of his book it had so many more meanings when a designed was picked for the 9 11 memorial and it was reveled that a muslim was chosen no one knew that it would change the lives of many people","1395":"this was a book club selection and wow is it a good book highly recommend it as the reader gets to see the viewpoint of all the different players and political groups that weigh in something one couldn't get from reading news reports or opinions highly engaging characters development and well written it has much for us to reflect on what it means to be an american maureen corrigan called it poetic and polemical and it is http www npr org 2011 09 06 1399422","1396":" thought provoking picked this up because it showed up on a number of fiction_l reader's lists of best fiction books read in 2011 when a committee selects the winning design for the 9 11 memorial and discover the architect is muslim problems ensue the story unfolds through several overlapping story lines including the wife of a 9 11 victim who serves on the committee the winning architect the brother of a 9 11 victim the illegal alien wife of a muslim victim of 9 11 this was sometimes hard to read listen to because people can just be so stuck in their own views and unkind to those who hold different views","1397":"thought provoking issue filled one dimensional characters it was a little hard to get into the book but i ended up being glad i read it i think many of us would like to believe we are tolerant of other people's views but this helped push me to think about my own intolerances and principles","1398":"i was pretty disappointed in this one i had been excited to read it because the premise was strong ultimately there was a real lack of character development and the author didn't make me care at all about them","1399":" ten years after 9 11 it's still exceptionally difficult to write about the many issues the united states confronted in the aftermath and continues to work through in a way that does not offend one side or the other phrases such as tolerance for all and protect our values are simplistic and intended to be all inclusive but any exploration of those expressions leads to a discovery of undercurrents unrealized that perhaps live only deep within the subconscious or for which we are privately ashamed or unabashedly supportive of what ms waldman has done with her debut novel is probe these undercurrents through a brilliant premise with multi faceted characters who are worth cheering for and worth detesting the premise is thus what if there were a jury assigned to choose a memorial for the 9 11 attacks with the process for choosing the memorial completely anonymous and in the end the jury selected a muslim architect no doubt building on the public's reaction to a mosque being built near the wtc site ms waldman creates an unforgettable cast of characters you have mohammad khan the architect who does not pray but does not make any attempt to disclaim himself as a muslim or explain his selection claire burwell a 9 11 widow and juror who supports and champions khan's design until she finds she can no longer trust him sean gallagher a brother of a deceased 9 11 firefighter who feels compelled to fight against the project but at the same time conflicted over how to do this and that's just for starters at the bottom of this book is a tale about what happens when ambition whether it be the governor's a reporter's or even the architect's collides with a collective conflicted intolerance and our human sense of decency ms waldman makes it perfectly clear how each of these characters feel about their own actions and explains them in a perfectly reasonable way which is quite a feat considering many of them have polar motivations i sympathized strongly with khan who feels under attack but out of principle does not want to go out of his way to deflect these attacks but i also felt for claire burwell who is struggling to find a way to mourn and be true to her dead husband while also withstanding the onslaught of controversy that she finds herself in i even understood the reporter and the governor who were simply trying to make the best of the situation for their own careers these are all people we hear on the news and experience in our lives and each of their perspectives feels organic and true in no other book or any other medium have i felt the issues of 9 11 addressed with such an understanding of each perspective for this i applaud ms waldman and i wonder how she can possibly follow up this excellent first effort","1400":"three stars because i read this as a book club selection and i think this novel offers up some excellent points for discussion i liked the premise the writing was technically good and the book has been on my to read list for some time but did i like it well not that much the characters and events were feasible but predictable and stereotypical in the extreme waldman scratches the surface of some potentially interesting characters without giving them depth and instead dwells upon the political repercussions of events she presents us with a problem which appears to have no middle ground no acceptable solution and in the end no surprise there really isn't a good solution not even in hindsight the author does succeed in compelling the reader to take a hard look at prejudice she doesn't exactly justify prejudice but reveals through her characters that it is present in some form in even the most enlightened individuals perhaps in recognizing our biases and understanding the reasons behind them we can if not conquer our prejudices at least minimize their harmful impact","1401":"it's always odd to read a book about a subject you know a lot about especially when it's a fictionalized version of it normally when i read books that focus on things that i know well like new york city government lower manhattan harvard the upper midwest etc i'm distracted by all the ways in which they're not accurate and that detracts from my enjoyment of the book while the differences between fiction and reality first annoyed me about the submission as i continued to read the book i was more drawn in by the way that the book captured the feeling of the process around the 9 11 memorial and the redevelopment of the wtc site the islamophobia the diverse and often unexpected factions of people both for and against any decision and the coverage of the sensationalist press really hit home waldman is a good writer there were a few gems of phrases including her description of terrorist leaders in high thread count beards but i was disappointed by how she left readers without a single character to like i'm all for having multi dimensional characters but the flaws that she gave the people in her novel with the small exception of asma anwar made each of them a bit too unsympathetic","1402":"appropriate for today's anniversary of 9 11 is a review of the submission in strangely semi fictional fashion walman imagines the process of a group of new yorkers choosing a memorial for 9 11 although she doesn't ever specifically name the world trade center or the exact events it's obvious that's what we're talking about minor spoiler alert a small committee is working to choose a memorial for the site of the attack they are working with anonymous submissions and select the garden as the winner out of thousands then the name of the winner is revealed mohammed and thus we begin a truly fascinating examination of what it means to be american muslim what questions should or should not be asked of an artist what the purpose of a memorial is who owns the memory of a tragedy and so on she explores the inner lives conflicts and motivations of all the parties involved it's a good book serious and not a light read but thought provoking and very masterfully handles many hot button issues","1403":" this book has been chosen for our june discussion at the beaches library bookclub the story begins 2 years after 9 11 a jury has been appointed to select a memorial from thousands of anonymous submissions a memorial the garden is chosen the envelope is opened and it is revealed that an american muslim is the architect and then it begins the garden submission stirs up controversy at first with the jury then it spreads across the country and becomes global the author's ability to present intolerance prejudice sterotypical thinking and paranoia through her various characters is amazing well worth a second read can't wait to hear what the people at our book club have to say","1404":"seattle reads book for 2012 i can't think of a book better titled i loved the character development and the challenges the author threw our way excellent","1405":" i really enjoyed this book because it was nice to see so many different perspectives on the issue of whether or not a 9 11 memorial designed by a muslim man should be allowed to be built that being said i think the undercurrent of the book was less neutral than i was given to believe at least to me this book read very much that mo should be allowed to create the memorial that he suggested regardless of his religion because he rightfully won the competition i will fully admit however that this may be because that is my own opinion and i read the book with my own views in mind should it be true i suspect that this book will receive much less praise from people who believe that he should not have been allowed to create the memorial because of his religion still an interesting read that discusses viewpoints such as mo himself a woman widowed by the 9 11 attacks people in positions of power newspapers and those campaigning against mo based on their belief that it would be offense to allow a muslim man to design the 9 11 memorial","1406":"i reviewed this novel in the washington post http tinyurl com 44rzxuq","1407":"when i first started to read this book my thought was and still is who cares who the architect is it's about the memorial and its being a place where families and survivors can honor the victims and find peace while my opinion has never changed the characters in the book swallow you up into their lives their needs their thoughts and their beliefs it is this seeing something from several points of view that causes you to pause and reflect on your ownself and on your own values","1408":"interesting premise would have liked it better had it focused on one person as opposed to several does create an intriguing scenario what would happen if a muslim entered a contest to build the 9 11 memorial and won but doesn't fully live up to the potential","1409":"3 5 stars this book made me angry so angry it's so realistic and the thought processes that develop are ones that happen every day in the u s rationalism overthrown by emotion the characters were interesting enough but i didn't give it more stars because when i finished it i didn't enjoy it","1410":"i'm sorry to say that i've read this because it is part of the kalamazoo reading together book seems like many better options many in the book group didn't wnat to read it because of the subject matter when the titanic movie came out my dad said that it was too soon after the event it was about 80 years after but he remembered the talk of it too much too close to home that's how this book felt to me now i know what dad meant also it was too short to be that repetative of the feelings each person had finally a few things remained unanswered for me why wasn't the guy who let the secret winner out found out or dealt with who killed asma just not my type of book","1411":"i am about a third of the way through although i was wary of a post 911 novel this one is smart and raises provocative questions about politics religioun and the media teaching it late in the semester in grad level american studies course update i dont regret my pick stroy is moving and complex not too neat an end","1412":"i actually felt like i had a ringside seat to this contest committee i couldn't help saying over and over it was a blind contest mo had the design they liked best period my heart went put most of all to the muslim immigrant i wanted to stay open minded as i read the book i know this decision was hardest for claire who lost her husband in the buildings really tugged at the heart","1413":"the submission is about all kinds of submissions the first is a design submission for a 9 11 memorial the winning submission which turns out to have been submitted by a muslim the second submission is the place of islam which in arabic literally means submission in america and the related debate that the winning memorial designer inadvertently launches the third submission is how characters submit or not to this debate and its repercussions this cast of characters ranges across the political and religious spectrums from grieving 9 11 family members to politicians on the make to ambitious reporters to a bangladeshi widow living illegally in new york with her own secret the book published in 2011 creates an entirely believable scenario and especially echoes the ground zero mosque furor most of the characters' views are realistic and nuanced they muddle through issues of ambition tolerance idealism fear and grief in ways that are human relatable and often tragic i wish i could give this book 4 5 stars i can tell it's a linger er that will stay with me both the characters and the ideas will i think take up permanent space in my brain but the plot was a bit slow moving and i wonder if to someone with different political beliefs would think it unfairly caricaturing i'd love to know from my perspective even the distasteful characters had really wonderful depth and richly painted motives it's not a cheerful book but it is an excellent book well written intelligent and evocative forget scarlet letter this is what kids should be reading in high school","1414":"very interesting what if story","1415":"meh it felt like i was reading a newspaper from eight years ago for 300 pages i liked waldman's approach but ultimately the topic matter just seemed a shade dated","1416":" this was a thought provoking fictional tale that easily could have been nonfiction the way the media helped shape and stir up people's emotions was very realistic i also thought that the author presented all sides fairly however there was a real lack of emotion in all the characters that did not warm you up to them for me to like a book i need to connect to the characters and this book feel flat on that for me the middle of the book got a bit slow and repetitive too i am usually a quick reader but this one dragged for me so although i liked the premise i found it to be a little long winded and emotionless","1417":"a interesting read that makes you think and question not the most beautifully written prose but not offence either interesting enough that i read it quickly","1418":"an interesting albeit not wholly successful novel waldman does a good job bringing in multiple sides of the issues but it's all surface detail we see the anger of the man who lost his older brother when the towers collapsed but we don't feel it or at least i didn't perhaps it's because the dialogue seems largely cobbled from newspaper headlines u0026amp talk show diatribes but we rarely get beyond the talking points u0026amp while things happen to the characters they don't learn or really change in any meaningful way mo the architect stays a self important jerk claire maintains her confused put upon attitude the only one who grows is claire's son u0026amp he has very few lines in the book this will likely do well in bookclubs because it does raise some important issues although i think it does so about 5 years too late placed alongside extremely loud and incredibly close u0026amp falling man this one falls just a little short","1419":"overall i enjoyed this book but it's a tall order to dramatize multiple committee meetings","1420":"i enjoyed the premise of this book the architect whose plan is selected for the 9 11 memorial in new york city turns out to be a muslim some of the scenes were classically set up while others felt more contrived in the end i enjoyed it for the most part but won't find myself rereading it at any time","1421":" i first reviewed this for my blog http 3throughhistory blogspot com where were you when jfk was shot martin luther king bobby kennedy where were you when neil armstrong took \"one small step for man \" when nixon resigned when the soviet union imploded for two generations these essential \"where were you \" questions were eclipsed by

chops of the author that she becomes within these pages as a bureau chief of the south asia office for the new york times she found herself embedded in the conflicting cultures that led the story of the memorial design competition that led up to the tenth year anniversary waldman is enough of a new yorker that she could capture the view through the eyes of demagogues widows and muslims the demagogues live behind pen and microphone the widows have the conscience suit covered deep and the muslims both the winning designer and an unlikely spokeswoman arise from the american muslim community with the twist that this muslim is also a 9 11 widow my own novel 3 through history https www smashwords com books view 239509 deals with some of these events claire burwell holds the lone

attacking the designer or more specifically the religious heritage of the designer at a crucial moment asma an undocumented bangladeshi muslim widow of the attacks risks all she has to speak her truth at an angry gathering of the families of victims ten years and two wars later waldman's novel the submission tells the story of a nation struggling to affirm the principles that extremists love to hate the submission speaks to the morals of a people whose pluralism tolerance and understanding were pushed to the brink of collapse by attackers whose main objective was to make the country whose ideology they hate destroy itself from within","1422":"lots to think about and discuss in this book what happens when the jury selects blindly the world trade center memorial design that was submitted by a non practicing muslim born in the u s the controversy is still relevant to today's issues not sure i liked the ending but it was very interesting","1423":"the submission is set two years after 9 11 where a panel of judges including one widowed by the tragedy are about to choose a winner to construct a memorial for those who died all of the submissions are anonymous and the winner's name is soon revealed to be that of an american muslim thus ensues lots of political and moral debating from both sides of the spectrum with everyone and their gran wanting to comment on the decision it's an interesting concept which brings to light all manner of issues ranging from racism religious rights freedom of speech etc to the surface and forces the reader to have a good old think about where they would stand and how they would conduct themselves in this situation only downside to this book is that i did feel like the characters could have been fleshed out a lot more so that the reader could perhaps relate to them rather than their painfully apparent stereotypes other than that it was pretty good","1424":"i never wanted to read any 9 11 related novels but this is an exception a thought provoking look at how that event has shaped and divided the nation","1425":"bonfire of the vanities without the humor","1426":"a 9 11 story that weaves together several threads the main protagonist was consistently interesting in some respects a treatise or proposal study rather than a fully realized historical novel it did sustain my interest and was thought provoking","1427":" i enjoyed this book however i can't say that it's filled with beautiful passages of poetical prose although it had some minor moments of creativity in some phrases and thoughts while i admire expressive carefully crafted sentences i don't feel that they're required or essential for every novel or for a piece of writing to be worthwhile the main strength of this book is the story itself and how it unfolds as the strong characters in the novel interact it's a great portrayal of public conflict unchecked emotions running high and inability to be civil and compromise it's also a study of morals doing the right fair thing standing up for justice in the face of prejudice and stereotypes conflicted with expediency especially political posturing and letting mob mentality fanned by the media prevail also only toward the end did i realize that what the title was really referring to was not what i had thought earlier","1428":"some characters i wanted to strangle others i wanted to cry for and some inspired both sentiments it's hard to put this book down even if sometimes it's painful to read","1429":"it actually took a little for me to get into it but i think that mostly had to do with mindset rather than the book itself i enjoyed reading about the characters and how each of their lives were affected even though i didn't necessarily like the characters themselves","1430":"this is one of the most thought provoking novels i have read in a long time thankfully it's fiction but unfortunately it could be true i alternately sympathized with and opposed almost every character's point of view great writing great reading","1431":"i thought the author did a marvelous job portraying both all sides of the issue of an american muslim designing a memorial for a nyc terrorist attack i could empathize with both opinions as well as think both sides were whack jobs that's the sign of good writing this will make an excellent discussion at book group while i wouldn't whole heartedly recommend this book to everyone it's not exactly a page turner i'm glad i read it","1432":"a book sure to spark good conversation waldman shows sincere sympathy toward a variety of conflicting and complicated viewpoints the novel also has a bit of a satirical edge without collapsing into spoof","1433":" i definitely liked the style of this book which shows the issue from multiple character's viewpoints where they each have their own lives but aspects of those lives intersect with each other's--like a giant venn diagram i'm starting to realize that this is an element in a few of my favorite books and i think reading it so soon after the art of fielding told in the same fashion made me like this book more than i would have otherwise the story definitely brought up some large issues that need to be discussed and because it's such a hot button issue muslims after 9 11 i didn't agree with most of the characters but i still found some redeeming qualities in most of them my favorite character by far was asma at some points i felt like the book was stretching far too long considering the main plot was actually quite simple but at the same time it felt true to life because even something as simple as choosing a design for a memorial can stretch on for months the time jump at the end however felt very abrupt and sudden listening to the audiobook i was sure i had accidentally skipped tracks or even a whole disc but i understand why the author chose to do this that said i don't agree with her choice to do so i think the novel would have been better to resolve it in the moment rather than to look back on it twenty years later overall i think the writing was very good and i enjoyed it but it wasn't the best novel for me personally i won't hesitate to recommend it to others though","1434":"2012 aw80b u s a new york i think i liked this book it was well written and you could really feel the viewpoints of the various characters i think it accurately reflected the povs of how the players would react if the situation were real however even in works of fiction i get so frustrated with the close minded opinions of real america in this case the anti muslim movement since 9 11 because of how accurately the author portrayed this view point from several characters which made me angry so much of the time that i was reading it's hard for me to say i liked the book i think anyone reading this book will immediately fall on a side of the debate and i don't think the book will change your pov whatever it was it's not an argument really for one side or the other until the end i think the end does conclude with some social commentary in which i interpret the author's intent to kind of scold the hard line anti muslims though it's not completely overt i give it 4 stars because the writing was vivid and i understood the characters even if i didn't agree with them but i'm not sure i would recommend it to anyone because i found it a frustrating read","1435":"what a thought provoking book challenges how you view people and what a profound effect your perceptions have on everyone","1436":"the submission was one the best novels i have read lately the story of a design competition for a wtc loke memorial won by a muslim american architect you can imagine the fury every aspect of the reaction is covered it is emotionally jam packed it was disturbing but an amazing book well worth it","1437":"an interesting premise a good read but nothing really special about the book to warrant more than three stars","1438":"amy waldman's first novel is an interesting and exciting investigation into the psyche of the people of a nation trying to come to terms with the aftermaths of a collective tragedy the writing is fast paced and sequence of events follow each other in a tightly packed narrative tense scenes follow one after the another and to give the credit to the writer these scenes are built up with intriguing personal stories of myriad of characters the novel starts in a boardroom where esteemed members of the society are waiting to announce the name of the architect whose design has won the nation wide competition for the 9 11 memorial as mentioned above the scene becomes tense when the winner of the submissions turns out to be a muslim or rather a person with a muslim name while at one instance it should not be a shock to the citizens of a country which boasts of equal opportunity to men of all race religion creed etc the story escalates into an unsettling but absolutely realistic series of events where the nation of immense diversities is divided into the meaning and interpretation of this outcome the author is successful in exposing the hypocrisy of the so called liberals who find it hard to adjust to this fact for example people who before the name of the person was announced loved the design of a park at the wtc site now become skeptical of it being a symbol of paradise that the terrorists died for questions of faith loyalty national identity american dream and patriotism are explored through characters such as the brother of the fire fighter who died saving lives on the dreadful day the widow of an illegal bangladeshi immigrant who lost her husband working as a janitor in the building the architect and the another widow who presides over the selection of the prize most gripping moments in the novel come during the scarf snatching incidents and the conversation between a muslim woman the person who snatched her scarf as 'he listens to the woman he notices her accent or rather the lack of it it was as american as his' another intense scene develops when the widow of the bangladeshi immigrant decides to speak in the proceedings of the court while she stands there speaking everyone liberal is exposed into accepting that she came to their country with the same hope that their ancestors came with denying her the chance to take a shot at the american dream is to deny the ideals of the country any more spoilers would ruin the novel i would end by saying that i am keen to read amy waldman's work","1439":"very well written very thought provoking interesting premise","1440":"a couple of clunky lines notwithstanding loved this much of it would be almost identical to real life events if such an event was to occur and reasonably evenhanded throughout taking into account several sides of the coin","1441":" so this is a little dark i think whether or not you would give it a good review probably has something to do with your tolerance for a good dark read it's the story of a post 9 11 committee put together by the city of ny to anonymously select the design for a memorial on the site the protagonist is a 9 11 widow who has come to represent the families in general on the committee the winner turns out to be man of muslim descent raised in american who isn't devout but of course that doesn't matter once word gets out there is another 9 11 widow featured the kind we forget because her husband was an undocumented worker in the towers the characters are good the story is original and very good it's quite readable and smooth and it dares to talk about subjects we like to pretend don't exist like i said not for everyone but it's hung with me","1442":"the story in this novel revolves around the moslem american architect who wins the blind competition for his design of the september 11 memorial although i did not think i would want to read a book about september 11and its aftermath i really liked this one waldman portrays the characters in the story in wonderful detail the book reads almost as if the author were a journalist who had interviewed living persons her research was undoubtedly extensive and her ability to thread the characters' stories together is very satisfying she also has great insight into the political social psychological and ethical issues raised by the story all this and she writes well too the submission","1443":"one of the most thought provoking books i have ever read exhausted from all of the thinking forcing myself to look at the reality of what i think of people i see myself in opposition to i wasn't too pleased in the ending but at the same time i think it was an accurate conclusion shwewe i'm tired","1444":" chalk it up to my first completed audiobook this book felt long and at only 300 pages and a captivating story line you would think it would be a 4 or 5 star i thought the writing was dull the characters were bland though it made you think about the whole concept of a memorial and religion and what the us really is i just didn't care for the story however this book will go down in my own personal history as the book that distracted me to the point of getting on the wrong bus that was pretty amusing","1445":"i loved this book it is a novel about what would happen is a muslim american won an anonymous competition to design the 9 11 memorial the characters and the plot felt very real the book really captured the feelings about 9 11 on a personal and nationwide level as the story progresses the angles and characters get more entrenched and have no space for their own confusions and doubts i really appreciated this book and was not surprised that it was written by a new yorker","1446":"despite a very good ending i didn't enjoy this book the premise was very interesting and i wanted to like it which is the reason i continued reading but i didn't like or care about any of the characters their motivations were weak and inconsistant i have more thoughts on this but that's about all i'm willing to do on a mobile device","1447":"very well written i love it when good stories are accompanied by great writing ability the characters were well developed at first i didn't like claire's back and forth thinking on the garden design but i came to see it as important evolution in the story the story is more about the evolution than the ending but i really liked the ending too","1448":"you can't please all of the people all of the time this book was a tense read albeit a good one the many facets of a world trade center memorial selection process provide many thought provoking perspectives","1449":"if it wasn't for the last quarter of the book i probably would've given it 3 stars there were no real surprises for me from the characters throughout most of the book even though i think the author did a good job of making many of the characters three dimensional with one or two obvious exceptions from one incident near the end of the book onwards emotions stirred in me and i was definitely left thinking i'm still not sure exactly what to make of mo but in my opinion that's the point","1450":"we read this for book club most liked it i definitely did not too contrived","1451":"very now very juicy topic not a great fan of her writing style rather too searing panorama from the blurb but some fascinating characters and a compelling demonstration of how prejudice assumption and grief can build onto each other to generate something wildly traumatic and overplayed","1452":"an amazing book quickly added to the short list of the best post 9 11 works of art waldman considers what would have happened if an anonymous contest for the 9 11 memorial design had resulted in a muslim winner how would the various constituencies not to mention the rabid press have reacted it's reminiscent of bonfire of the vanities an early 21st century novel of new york and america","1453":"after finishing amy waldman's \"the submission \" i was confronted with rating the book on the goodreads scale of 1 5 i didn't love nor even really like the book so i couldn't give it \"4\" or a \"5 \" i didn't hate the book so a \"1\" was out of the question so it all came down to a \"2\" versus a \"3 \" while my initial reaction was to give the book a \"2\" because i didn't enjoy it \"the submission\" was just too intelligent to not at least receive a \"3 \" it was well written perhaps to a fault moreover the book had promise the plot immediately drew me in because it was relevant realistic and thought provoking reminiscent of societal attitudes two years ago when talks began of a mosque getting built near ground zero \"the submission\" dealt with a the prejudices of americans after a muslim american architect's design is chosen for the 9 11 memorial as i was reading the first chapter of \"the submission \" i was expecting that the book would be like the movie \"12 angry men \" i thought the reader would get to hear the pros and the cons of having a muslim american architect as a designer through the jury i e the design selection committee the initial jury selection process however only lasted a chapter and the readers were instead offered several characters who had their reasons for either being for against or uncertain of the design while this format could have been evocative and successful i ultimately found the book to be lacking plot aside i found the writer's style and her diction to be rather inaccessible as a result i couldn't get connected to any of the characters and when you don't care about the characters then you don't really care about the story by the halfway point of the book i was just reading to get through the book i did appreciate however that waldman didn't take a clear cut side her book wasn't skewed so that the reader thought they should be for or against the design she presented both sides of the argument to the reader and ultimately it was up to the reader to decide what they thought was right or wrong she also allowed the reader through her characters to feel comfortable with the fact that there may not be a right or a wrong answer the questions she evoked through her prose were provocative even so i cannot recommend \"the submission \" the book was too dense to be enjoyable it was more like reading a reference text than a work of fiction","1454":"i enjoyed this first novel in which amy waldman captures the craziness that swirled around the aftermath of the september 11 2001 attacks her premise is that after much controversy wailing and gnashing of teeth the committee appointed to approve the design for new york's 9 11 memorial finally selects one of the anonymous submissions only to learn that the winning memorial was designed by an american muslim all hell as you might imagine ensues i usually don't read \"9 11 books\" because even after all this time the shock and pain of that day is too easily evoked and i just don't like feeling it again but this story is set two years later when feelings are still raw but life has gone on it takes lots of characters to tell the story and waldman works to make them rounded but there's still a bit of a central casting feel the 9 11 widow the retired businessman who heads the committee the art experts the brother of one of the victims who's made a life out of being the brother of one of the victims the crazy right wing nut job who's abetted by the crazy right wing nut job radio talk show host the shallow and ambitious reporter and on and on but historically all those kinds of people were in evidence in the aftermath of the attacks and waldman allows all sides to get their oars in waldman complicates what could have been a stick figure story by making most of the characters' motives not nearly as straightforward as they seem and by exploring questions of identity that are deeper than the stock character labels virginia born mohammed khan the architect who designed the winning submission has motives for submitting his design that are as complex as those of any of the other characters in fact he only begins to acknowledge his own motives as the story goes on his identity issues cause him to behave in some stubbornly self defeating ways as the controversy over his design ramps up sometimes funny sometimes deadly serious waldman's novel shows us americans at war with ourselves over what it means to be americans","1455":" ok i have yet to be disappointed by a recommendation from maureen corrigan she raved about this book and i as so intrigued i bought a hard cover copy it's another interesting premise i give 2011 credit for attempts at truly creative story lines but this didn't make the mark everyone in the story is so true to their own interests the claim of ownership new york especially the families of those lost who don't step out of self pity for a second to consider anyone outside their narrow world view come across as incessant whiners frankly halfway into the book i could have given a rat's derriere about the memorial at ground zero this book steeped me in enough self righteousness to last a long time","1456":"this would be a very good book for a book discussion group","1457":"a brilliant stirring novel of ideas the writing is delectable precise and luminous i'm in awe of the speculative parallel universe she created and also completely convinced of its plausibility","1458":" i really should stop reading murder mysteries throughout this book i kept expecting someone to start anonymously killing people and then waiting for an astute yet humble person to become the detective and start unraveling the mystery anyway it's true that i often get influenced by the reviews on a book's goodreads page and tend to let some of the opinions seep into how i rate a book but this is one case where i stand by my five star rating particularly because horrors it doesn't seem all that implausible to me so yes the author did start riffing off an ongoing event but maybe my reading it four years later helped tamp some of this criticism even then i could not put this book down and it is a weighty piece of material to read at one sitting one of the things that stood out to me was how much effort the author had put in to researching bangladesh then i find out she was the former south asia correspondent for the nyt which should detract from the research but really doesn't i mean seriously sandwip i think that's the first time sandwip's entered the realm of popular fiction ever and she does paint a pretty negative picture of the country which should set off my patriotic radar but she does a fantastic job of portraying the sense of community that pervades our society the stark contrast between the way asma lives in and despite a community whereas the rest of the characters live a dreary bleak life seeking solitude the truth is the book is full of truth having witnessed personally the fall out of 9 11 including the humiliation of being pulled out of line for a random search while boarding airplanes part of it did ring true but unlike mo the experience did not set me off on a journey towards embracing islam i was quite a fervent non practicing muslim and could only manage a wry smile at the irony of being deemed a potential threat a lot of reviewers struggled to like any of the characters in this book but as my reading history in 2014 will show that is what attracts me to books and garners 5 star ratings it seems i didn't particularly like any of the characters either but i don't think that was the author's objective anyway she brings out the fact that we are all merely complicated animals who let our beliefs guide us in stupid directions because we think that is what is right but then that belief might also be transient shifting in time as we question what we believe and every single character in this book suffers from this with wavering ideals and beliefs of various strengths which change based on the information they receive and the experiences they encounter and isn't that real life the other thing that struck me as quite true to life was the level of belief or rather the courage of conviction which differs from character to character there are some who believe in something but lack the courage to justify it there are others who are willing to waver only one character in the book strived to be brave the rest chose to be varying levels of brave most gravitating towards the coward end of the scale and this mixture of beliefs and strength of belief is so true to life we are ultimately surrounded by people exactly like this and not every one is equal in their belief and strength of belief what a boring world that would be i do not really want to focus on the specific nature of the beliefs these characters held that would give too much away and besides the whole religious issue is not the subject of this review and it shouldn't be but as someone who witnessed the fall out on muslims as well as the splinter groups and viewpoints that fanned out of the tragedy the characterizations or caricatures as some reviewers put it of some was quite accurate these characterizations do help portray the fear of being muslim in 21st century america the book is by no means a perfect piece of work for one thing it seemed the author had absolutely no shortage of adjectives for any situation whatsoever plus there seems to be a strange obsession with naked sleeping bodies that i failed to understand also two things i did not understand perhaps they were made to deepen the characters and their motives but i thought they detracted greatly from the overall quality of the book spoiler alert 1 why did mo refuse to condemn the attacks whether publicly or privately he felt the tragedy deeply after returning to nyc so why not condemn it it wasn't like he was at any point in danger of becoming a radical 2 the ending commits the same mistake that the book accuses characters of making throughout confusing the religion with the culture why would a kuwaiti emir want the names of the dead on the walls of his garden whereas the verses if that's what they are also left ambiguous are more likely to be culturally feasible 3 how does a man condemned of blasphemy and subject to fatwas manage to live a long and productive life living and working in islamic countries for emirs sheikhs and other spiritually inclined leaders all in all definitely worth a read","1459":"highly recommended a look back to the more immediate aftermath of 9 11 when a selected design jury is selecting a design for the memorial i couldn't understand all the motivations of each of the characters but perhaps that makes them more human not lesser characters the novel certainly showed that there are perils in departing from process but how important it is to get your process right the process and the politics around it are almost characters in their own right and while i don't want to say too much about the plot in case i ruin it for everyone it is interesting how people become that which they say they are not and why that transformation happens is it a result of external forces or is it simply accelerated by those forces i was also interested in the concepts of honour that the novel explored as everyone seemed to act according to their own code","1460":"a great read what would happen if a nation wide contest held to choose a design for the 9 11 memorial was won by a muslim the book was thought provoking and beautifully written it do a nice job of showing how loyalties and ideals are flexible in some and rigid to a fault in others beautiful","1461":"i'm giving it 3 stars because i honestly don't know how i feel about the book especially the very end and what happens with the garden the author did a great job of giving opinions from all sis of this impossible debate","1462":" blurbiosity overkillnow if i had picked this one up in a bookstore it would never have carried me to the checkout for why for because when you look into the first few pages of a book these days fair enough you do expect to see not the publication details dedication epigraph and opening page but first to be forced to hack your way through the choking jungle of gush you know the style exciting extraordinary exhilarating exceptional thought provoking an absolute minimum requirement rather than praise i'd have said accomplished - why yes for here it is in my hands oh that doesn't just mean it's finished i did a very quick and statistically insignificant survey of the books lying within easy reach alice munro back cover only none inside christopher clark back cover and one page inside thomas mann can dispense with such vulgarity entirely i suspect there is a direct correlation between how well established and respected a writer already is and how much blurbiness needs to get rolled out two pages new writer we're a little concerned that no one has heard of her three or four pages we're deeply insecure about this one five pages indicates a grave case of the jitters and six is well positively needy the equivalent of the security blanket and a reassuring suck of the thumb but this one is right off the scale we've gone way way past tense and troubled before you even get to to my parents aaaw there are no fewer than eleven pages of praise for the submission let me say that again eleven pages plus quotes on the inside cover plus three more on the back cover eleven pages that isn't persuasion that is harassment that is intimidation that is bludgeoning the audacious blogger into submission you wouldn't dare would you disagree with all the prestigious british broadsheets with salon vogue and marie claire with kirkus review booklist and publisher's weekly with the washington post and deep intake of breath michiko kakatuni in the new york times you a mere amateur could not possibly be so presumptuous as to claim to know better than these august professionals well yes i could is anyone surprised naturally i can only prove a point by finding fault so imagine my initial disappointment when i had to admit that there was really quite a lot right with this novel the writing is sharp and fresh the basic premise is not entirely without interest and ms waldman a journalist herself is unafraid indeed reckless in her eagerness to do the dirty on one of her gild who manipulates and manoeuvres distorts and deceives and betrays with little concern for the collateral damage but i was soon most gratified to find that the story began to drag when you get to chapter 8 and 9 and there are yet more new characters turning up then you begin to wonder quite where this is going to go the trouble is this is a novel of ideas and ambitious too so every single nuance of opinion on both sides of the dividing line has to be represented and i'm afraid that is where the people remained in the debating club representing a point of view they never got legs and ran which of course begs a question had michiko kakatuni been knocked senseless on the day she compared the submission favourably to the bonfire of the vanities no no no although the publishers included every review they could find it goes without saying that they selected their passages very carefully let me insert what they omitted she lacks richard price's pitch perfect ear for dialogue and instinctive sense of pacing or the evolution of claire's thinking about the memorial may not make that much sense to the reader -- this and the cartoony portrait of alyssa are the novel's two big flaws funny that eleven pages but no room for those remarks","1463":"wow what a great story focused on the tragedy of 9 11 i didn't know what to expect and surprised how the story unfolded makes you really think about our country and how our beliefs on a certain group of people can be so off the mark couldn't wait to see how it ended highly recommend","1464":"i made it halfway through but i could not get into it i felt a lot of the characters were stereotypes and i just was not drawn into the controversy as i think i was supposed to be","1465":"thought provoking fiction written by nytimes journalist what if a muslim american had won the 9 11 memorial creating contest","1466":" it has been two years since the terrorist attack on 9 11 a jure debates the merits of two memorials submitted to the contest one of these will be erected to memorialize those lost on 9 11 the jury member who represents the families who lost loved ones in the attack is strident in her defense of a garden memorial she convinces other jurors to vote for the design and when the garden design is determined to be the winning design the name of the submission's architect is revealed mohammad khan can americans new yorkers accept and embrace a 9 11 memorial designed by a man with a muslim name even if he is an american can an american with such a name be treated fairly in post 9 11 america people from all sides of the issue will weigh in on the memorial and its architect obviously there will be controversy this novel received a lot of hype but i'm just not impressed by it i guess the plot could have been interesting if it had not been so obvious the characters are one dimensional and i just could not force myself to care about them","1467":"an excellent read good for book groups","1468":"it's pretty easy to imagine the controversy that would ensue if through an anonymous competition the design plans selected for the ground zero memorial were ones created by a muslim american architect this book's plot revolves around just such a hypothetical scenario it explores the controversy from multiple viewpoints both for and against the design or more accurately the designer and does so from the perspective of multiple individuals who were affected by 9 11 to varying degrees and in varying ways unfortunately i was disappointed by this book for me the source of mediocrity was the central character the architect there are so many ways that the author could have molded him from someone who really did hold a grudge against the u s and wanted the memorial to be a martyr's paradise for the terrorists to someone who fully denounced the terrorist's actions and wanted the memorial to be a show of solidarity between mainstream muslims and non muslims or a million things in between what the author chose was a main character who didn't seem to identify himself with islam and to provide very little else for the reader to understand exactly who this person was as a result it's never made clear what the character's motives were in entering the competition how 9 11 affected him personally etc this was a real missed opportunity to make the character less one dimensional i e a non practicing muslim who happens to be an architect i also found the subplot about the character making a business trip to afghanistan confusing and irrelevant if there was something big revealed here it went right over my head","1469":"this was a very timely book we picked for book club i liked the book i thought it read a little bit like a tv mini series movie you had a whole book full of characters of which none surprised you that they were there and all of their actions and reactions were very predictable","1470":"an interesting perspective on the decision to build a memorial at the 9 11 site","1471":"as i was reading this book it was all too easy to imagine this scenario playing out it was so close to the fight over the so called ground zero mosque really just a community center in lower manhattan and other acts of racism or bigotry directed against muslims and arabs around america on a daily basis great writing with compelling and realistic characters an affecting read","1472":" i can't really get around how gimmicky the whole premise of this novel is and i've come to the point with 9 11 books where they start to blend that said i really like how waldman subverts your feelings about many of the characters particularly mo the architect he's not the vicitm or hero that he might be in a lesser writer's hands instead he just comes off as a more flawed nuanced character but some feel like such easy targets i have mixed feelings about the book but it's a good read","1473":"fascinating piece of fiction about what could have happened if the world trade center memorial contest had been won by a muslim architect","1474":"i feel as if i should find this book more poignant and in tune then i do while i liked waldman's writing style overall the book was just so boring for something that should be a very passionate cause for both sides the novel is flat waldman's concept is beyond comparison a muslim designing the 9 11 memorial truly unique and had such a powerhouse of possibilities yet i never really connected with the book and really slogged through the middle section i just kept feeling like the book was repeating every few pages telling me the same thing over and over 3 stars i wouldn't say this is one of the top reads of 2011 because it's good but rather because it's on trend","1475":" how the reader feels about this book will depend on how passionate how interested they are in the debate documented on its page because that's essentially all this book is one great big long debate a tautology of arguments and not a lot else sure there's a smidgen of drama towards the end and then a rush ending that feels like the author suddenly realised she had to somehow find a way to break the stalemate she had created and spun out for the past 350 pages personally i loved this book as the subject and idea were of real interest to me i could see though how others might get bored of it and sometimes the writing feels a little too polished at times i almost wanted her to use a clunky word or just to describe something as it actually is rather than come up with ten words to describe or a fork or whatever for me then a great book but make sure you know what you're getting into if you pick this up","1476":"what a great first novel if this book doesn't get you thinking about all the crazy dogmatic insanity that gets spewed around as though it's fact that we listen to every day i don't knopw what will great premise great characters super ending","1477":"the submission with characters flawed with hubris ignorance and blind will brilliantly exemplifies a time immortalized by fear of the unknown post 9 11 that fear led to wanton prejudice and injustice towards many u s citizens such discriminations were welcomed and even understood by some of those bearing the brunt of such actions this dichotomy is displayed through the realistic emotions wrought in the book evoking i'm sure differing opinions in each who reads it","1478":"this book probably deserves more stars as it is well written and well structured but it was very hard for me to read it took me weeks i just couldn't warm to any of the characters and was very reluctant to relive remember those days that is a compliment the book captured that time very well i liked the elpilogue set 20 years from now showing the aftermath of the events that take the bulk of the book","1479":"wow will be thinking about the questions this book posed for a long time this is the bonfire of the vanitiies of the 2001 2011 era","1480":" a friend asked me a few days ago to name the book that i most wish i had written little did i know that i would find my answer only four days later in amy waldman's the submission the submission set prior to the design and construction of the freedom tower in new york city centers on the deliberations of a jury comprised of artists historians politicians and others to select a worthy design for a memorial for the ground zero site decimated in the september 11 2001 attack on the world trade center although told from a variety of perspectives the novel's narrative emanates primarily from three characters claire a jury member who lost her husband in the attack mo the muslim architect whose anonymous design of a walled garden is initially selected by the jury and asma a bangladeshi woman who also lost a husband in the september 11 attack the selection of mo's design causes immediate controversy over whether it is fair to the family members who lost loved ones to choose a design created by a muslim and all segments of society weigh in with vociferous opinions what i loved about this book is that although its liberal bent is at all times apparent it never descends into preachiness all of waldman's characters are believable even those motivated by less noble qualities like ambition bigotry or self preservation most of all the ending with its six feet under projection many years into the future was a perfect blend of ambivalence and hope for healing","1481":"ten years after the devastating attack on the world trade centre a jury gets together to judge the submissions for a memorial when the winner is announced it is a muslim architect who has designed a garden in the memory of all who died there is much discussion surrounding this controversial choice an interesting perspective","1482":"when i read the blurb about this book i thought it would be a good read but as i got further into the story i realized that i didn't care for any of the characters they had no depth and i had no interest in any of them attaining their goals it seemed that stereotype after stereotype was offered up for characters and nothing else was offered to connect with the end with the so called wrap up was a nice way to end the book but again the lack of affinity left me wanting","1483":"i'm torn between 4 and 5 stars sometimes the author's journalistic background intrudes on the story but methinks it's timely and important enough to get the 5th star","1484":"very interesting book on what could have happened after september 11th definitely makes you think and understand both sides of the controversy","1485":"very thoughtful and thought provoking book i was somewhat hesitant to read another 9 11 based book feeling it was overdone however the author found a way to make the read interesting and well done there were quite a few characters she had to juggle but she managed to keep all balls in the air","1486":"a thought provoking what if novel about the chaos that ensues when an american muslim wins the anonymous 9 11 memorial design competition even though it's fiction it's not hard to imagine events unfolding as they do in the novel gets a little over the top towards the end but still a fascinating read great for book club discussions","1487":"this is so sad although skillfully written it makes sense that a book set in the aftermath of 9 11 would be sad but i kept waiting for any character to be loyal or noble or exceed expectations and the few times that happens they're far outweighed by the tragedies that result it's fitting i suppose to illustrate that the fruit of violence is hatred and suffering and more violence but it made this book admirable but not enjoyable for me","1488":" the premise is timely what if new york city had held a contest two years after 9 11 to design a memorial to the fallen and what if this blind contest resulted in an american muslim winning such is waldman's set up for her story she holds up a mirror to society represented by a microcosm of members of the selection jury the jury leader and the muslin architect and forces the reader to confront prejudice fear and ethnic stereotyping written from multiple points of view waldman takes us inside the heads of key players asks us to watch them deal with conflict shows us interaction among them and then lets us down with a let's get this wrapped up now epilogue beautifully written throughout although it needed tightening in the middle the epilogue feels rushed as if the writer wants us to know everything that happened without taking us into the events as a reader i was with all the characters up to that point i wish she had taken a bit more time to let the resolution play out organically instead of jumping ahead twenty years still this is a good read one which asks much of the reader and gives much in return","1489":"truly thought provoking and extremely well written","1490":"i have avoided 9 11 lit and movies because i thought it would be too painful but decided to give this one a try since i heard such good things about it i didn't fine it too emotionally painful but i gave up halfway through after feeling like i was just being pounded violently with the point that people are afraid of and hateful toward islam it got in the way of the story shame since the author is quite eloquent and creates realistic characters i cared about all the elements of a great book are here but the pounding was too much she made her point and would have benefitted from a lighter touch","1491":"a very strong start and then the story drags claire is a widow whose husband has died in the 9 11 attacks she sits on a panel to choose the artist for the new memorial and convinces the committee to vote for the garden when the information is made public that a muslim has won the contest the committee has to decide whether to go with this winning entry the novel follows both claire through the years as she raises her children and questions the decision about the memorial and mohammed khan the architect who made the winning design","1492":" a literary ripped from the headlines finely crafted novel about the fictional events surrounding a memorial intended to honor those who died in 9 11 the story opens with a high profile committee debating the merits of various designs that were submitted anonymously the design which is ultimately selected a walled garden with spare geometry is championed by claire burwell a beautiful and wealthy 9 11 widow when the designer is revealed to be a young virginia born and yale educated architect mohammad mo khan one of the committee members blurts out it's a godamn muslim and within hours an ambitious journalist leaks the news to the public special interest groups such as the memorial support committee that is against a muslim memorial or a martyrs' paradise spring up across the nation handscarf pullings and mosque descecrations follow even the governor uses the competition as an opportunity to pursue her quest for a national forum waldman does a masterful job of juggling a diverse cast of characters she seems as comfortable in an apartment of banglasdeshi immigrants as she is in an upper eastside private club waldman gives voice to both islamic zealotry and misguided patriotism resulting in a painful but gripping read","1493":"post 9 11 fiction","1494":" the submission by amy waldman is a 9 11 story set in 2003 two years after the attacks the plot centers around a jury selected to view the design applications for a 9 11 memorial in new york city and the architect of the winning design originally these people come together for aesthetic and professional reasons the judges were selected by the governor and then they chose the winner anonymously all that professionalism is knocked for a loop when after the choice is made by the jury it is discovered that the winner is mohammad khan a muslim it doesn't take long for the design choice to become a nationwide controversy and a media touchstone the public reaction to the choice is swift and varied but it's the negative views that shout the loudest could \"the garden\" as khan's designed is called is be a victory garden for islam first time novelist waldman brings a real world of reaction and rhetoric to an emotional crisis she has culled central casting for her characters including liberal professors the principled artist morally corrupt financiers illegal immigrants a ring wing radio host 911 widows first responders a shady journalist ambitious politicians grieving families etc but then given them all the benefit of her sharp observation and unwillingness to pull punches every character has a point of view or maybe an agenda and if they don't they are subjected to the agendas of others waldman brings it all very entertainingly to light within the context of the event she created the submission is not a collection of character studies or ~~shudder~~ short stories waldman has carefully and successfully plotted out an elaborate and satisfyingly complex 'what if 'kind of novel she covers all the emotions and questions that all of us have experienced in the last ten years no easy answers are offered but in waldman's expert and darkly humorous novel she challenges your loyalties and beliefs the submission is outstanding there are so many of our recently shared experiences and pop culture references in the submission that sometimes the book takes on a slightly documentary feel every once in a while as i was reading the submission i had to wonder how this quality will affect how the book ages will what is so historically and emotionally timely now wear well ten years from now i can't say but there is an epilogue in the submission that takes place in 2023 where waldman offers us her vision of the future","1495":"this is a novel that demands a lot of its readers that's not to say amy waldman's the submission is difficult or dull in fact it's the polar opposite of both what it is though is a novel that makes readers think that asks readers to challenge long held beliefs and ideas no matter how firmly they think those ideas are held notions you may judge to be obvious aren't and ideas that may have seemed odious suddenly may not seem that way either to me it's one of the best kinds novel a novel that feels perfectly in tune with how our society operates for better and mostly worse and that demands that you confront your own feelings and beliefs enough with abstractions here's the deal two years after the attacks of 9 11 a jury convenes to select a design for the memorial to be built at ground zero the jury selects without knowledge of the designer since the submission process was anonymous a design for a beautiful garden with flowing canals and the victims' names written on the walls in the shapes of the twin towers most everyone's happy until envelope please the designer is revealed to be a muslim or at least he's a guy with a muslim name mohammed kahn the public outcry is immediate and furious how could a muslim be allowed to design an islamic paradise to effectively memorialize the jihadist martyrs not the victims right wing conspiracy theorists ask obviously not all muslims are terrorists you bigoted fools say mo's advocates so why shouldn't mo an irreligious american architect be allowed to build his design since the design was judged the winner based on aesthetics not politics or religion but muslims are responsible for 9 11 counters the opposition so it'd be at best insensitive and at worst horribly insulting to allow a muslim designer to memorialize them this culture war is the basis of the novel and the frenzy that follows is examined through the eyes of several new yorkers including mo himself and claire burwell a 9 11 widow who is the leading proponent of mo's design but both of these characters begin seeing themselves through the lens the increasingly polarized public sees them they begin to question and doubt to yield especially in mo's case to others' often stereotypical visions of them a bangledeshi immigrant who lost her husband in the attacks a woman who runs an organization called save america from islam a buffoonish right wing talk show host and a down on his luck blue collar fella named sean who lost his brother round out the cast of characters that give this novel a really complete feel and the media circus another character is a less than ethical journalist and the political wrangling the governor of new york has national ambitions and is constantly waiting to see which way the wind blows and maneuvering politically feel spot on as do the difficult questions the novel raises are moral absolutes really absolute why is bigotry so wrong and idiotic and harmful can art ever really be separated from artist the readers must grapple especially those of the conservative persuasion at whom waldman often takes aim much like the politically charged environment portrayed this novel itself was also divisive it's the only book i've seen wind up on a most overrated novel of the year list as well as several best of the year lists i tend toward the latter perhaps not one of the best books i've read this year but a very very good one nonetheless waldman a former journalist writes lucidly and knows her stuff whether architecture or the ins and outs of a newsroom you trust her even if her characters piss you off this is highly recommended","1496":"interesting exploration of post 9 11 american sentiments does a great job with multiple points of view and the moral ambiguities of the situation ending is a little lackluster but you come to expect early on that this one wouldn't be neat and tidy in the end","1497":"while i really enjoyed the writing the premise and the characters in this book there were parts that seemed a bit too long but she is a beautiful writer and i will look for more from her","1498":"a jury is to select a memorial for the 911 victims after months of deliberations the envelope containing the anonymous winner's name--and discover he is an american muslim instantly they are cast into roiling debate about the claims of grief the ambiguities of art and the meaning of islam very thought provoking","1499":"really powerful book that is a fascinating cultural study on modern post 9 11 politics art the 24 7 media buzz with a series of real life type characters a rush limbaughish an ann coulter and many others focused on the building of a memorial garden to commemorate those who died on 9 11 the select art jury is stunned when the anonymous art committee reveals the winning design to be created by a talented muslim american thus ensues a media and public outcry from both sides","1500":"this was a thought provoking book about a muslim american who enters the competition for a 9 11 memorial i liked the conflict but there was too much talking and not enough action","1501":"what a dynamic novel about what spin can do to reality and how prejudice and media can destroy or heal","1502":"this book was a surprisingly easy read the characterizations of the various people's reactions to the monument made me feel as if i was listening to a conversation between people in my acquaintance their individual voices are clear the events and opinions aren't presented with fanfare or as if they are particularly unique it is just real people being real being a bystander in this story creates an emotional roller coaster while the words flowed whenever i put down the book my thoughts a mess of memories to process and give value to and make decisions about great reading experience","1503":"yeah so wow this is my review as it appeared on bookbrowse com october 5th 2011 first time novelist amy waldman has created a gut punch of a novel in the submission a tale that wonders what would happen if the architectural design competition for the world trade center 9 11 memorial was won by an american muslim the story opens two years after the attacks with a jury deliberating over the two finalists in the memorial design competition the void and the garden the jury after very tense and prolonged deliberations finally selects its winner the garden it is at this point the identity of the designer is revealed an architect named mohammad mo khan chaos of course ensues as khan's identity as an american muslim is leaked to the media and citizens special interest groups and pundits argue for and against the fitness of both the individual and his design claire burwell whose husband died on september 11th is a member of the jury as a representative of the families who lost loved ones in the attacks throughout the blind competition the identities of those who submitted designs were kept secret claire was the most vocal champion for the garden feeling the concept offered the strongest opportunity for healing and reflection while honoring those who died she is then thrust into an awkward and precarious position of balancing her belief in the winning design with the emotional and confrontational outbursts from the families she was supposed to be representing waldman has created something i really love when reading fiction unreliable narrators several main characters claire burwell mo khan and sean gallagher dig their heels in waver reevaluate themselves and others and cause rippling consequences claire has long anchored her identity in liberal social thinking but has never really had to examine her convictions mo is arrogant and unknowable in his aloofness he refuses on the basis of being a free american citizen to answer questions about his intentions with his design this avoidance on principle leaves many confused and paranoid sean lost his firefighter brother patrick in the attacks and also lost himself he felt he was never good enough growing up and had never really known his place in the world until he began speaking out about his brother's death but is that enough to give his own life meaning all of these characters are tested and pushed to reassess their ways of thinking trying to make a difference in the world which all three are striving to do is not something that can be undertaken without fully knowing one's self at its heart the submission is a tale of caution if you think you know yourself please think again readers are taken through a trifecta of large issues grief ambition and prejudice and early in the novel a particular quote slapped me in the face you couldn't call yourself an american if you hadn't in solidarity watched your fellow americans being pulverized yet what kind of america did watching create it is an inescapable question the media allowed for interminable full access nonstop watching and reading at our disposal talking heads from television infiltrated our own minds special interest groups tore at our heartstrings pundits swayed our thinking this way and that throughout there was never any disagreement that 9 11 was a domestic tragedy of global significance a national embrace brought families who lost loved ones to our collective chest in an effort to support them and keep them safe and yet and yet there were so many competing interests fighting and often losing sight of the reason for the heightened passions and positions the people who lost their lives the very title of this novel says a lot each character we meet is asked to submit whether to alter a long held belief upend their moral center or open a door to a stranger the submission also represents the architectural design mohammad submits in hopes of creating an important work within a religious context the word muslim means one who voluntarily submits or surrenders to god's will around one simple word so much turns and as with waldman's novel a world evolves around one simple concept the author a former journalist for the new york times and their south asia bureau co chief for over three years was in manhattan on the the day of the attacks in 2001 and she spent the following six weeks reporting on the aftermath several years ago while talking with a friend about the controversy maya lin endured when in 1981 her vietnam veteran's memorial design was selected through open competition waldman supposed that a muslim american planning the wtc memorial would be a modern equivalent situation and so the submission was born as was her career as a novelist she has stated that in writing a story about 9 11 she was just interested in looking at the variety of experiences and the grief to tell the story from multiple perspectives waldman succeeds in achieving this goal beautifully with her debut novel through her gifted prose and fully realized characters she has created a very powerful reading experience","1504":" literary dynamite i don't want to review this book but feel like i should say something here i want to dig into the text and have a lively debate discussion about all it contains i want to do a close reading i want to apply theory to it i want to write about the impact what it stirs up and explores how it goes about this get into all waldman does in such a pitch perfect manner so much get into but i don't know how to review it without getting into all of that i rarely say this but this is a book everyone should read literary dynamite","1505":"very thought provoking this book gives the reader a lot to think about in regards to how we view treat think about other cultures religions i highly recommend this would be a great book club read","1506":"i enjoyed this much more than i thought i would waldman did a great job exploring the complexities of the conflict in the novel","1507":"terrific if it occasionally swerves into a satire that's a touch more broad and blatant than the rest of the writing who can blame her for the most part i found it thought provoking and elegant and complex captures the grief of certain segments of new york as well as those who aimed to profit from it in one way or another and the ambivalence of people trying to figure out their relationship to islam and to america in the wake of 9 11","1508":"i usually shy away from fiction about contemporary political issues but i thought this was really great waldman is one of those authors who makes you feel like she is in charge in the best way possible i never doubted that she was in command of the material and all of the twists and turns were just expertly plotted she surprises the reader in ways that make it clear how precisely she had planned everything there are no easy answers in this novel and that's what makes it all the better","1509":" okay i could see this trying to go the same way as the bonfire of the vanities with points of view from the rich widow the poor widow the muslim architect the oily journalist the female rush limbaugh etc but it fell short to me mostly because it lacked a sense of place with bonfire i really got a sense of place about nyc but in this book especially with 9 11 as a literally earth shattering event that affected all new yorkers i never really got a sense of nyc as a character in the book which i thought it should have been character wise mo the architect stayed too mysterious and in the shadows for me and claire the rich widow didn't make me care how she felt i think the character i was interested in most was sean the irish guy grappling with sharing the spotlight with his dead hero brother i did like how waldman shows how americans can get really hysterical over politicals and blow small actions and comments totally out of proportion but i don't think is the end all be all book about 9 11","1510":"i'd give it a 4 5 if i could when will you give us half stars goodreads","1511":"the submission kept me interested but i didn't recommend it to any of my friends because it just wasn't that great","1512":"this is a brilliant book it is beautifully written and brilliantly structured as others have said this may turn out to be the post 9 11 book a story of a competition for a memorial to those who died during the course of the novel each character grows and turns so that by the end each has lost something profound and perhaps gained something too a metaphor for how drained our country has become since the attacks","1513":"this is a grave and relevant work of fiction maybe even more important now than when it was written in 2011 all the things we are seeing now in an election year were described in a story that seemed very real when a non practicing muslim's architectural design wins the opportunity to plan the twin towers memorial the committee becomes split in its decision to go forward the public haters start protesting and the press fans the fires there is much to think about here and it questions our so called american values","1514":"very interesting and thought provoking what would have happened if a muslim had won a blind competition for the world trade center memorial","1515":"this was an excellent book that probes levels of trust and racism after 9 11","1516":"i would give this one 4 1 2 stars if i could powerful frustrating read","1517":"great concept great execution a very good book indeed","1518":"i loved the idea of this book and having discussion but the book left our club not loving it the characters left you empty","1519":"a september 11th memorial is chosen in a blind competition and it turns out the architect is muslim of course extreme controversy ensues this is an excellently written well researched book which tells the story from many different perspectives it drew me in immediately this was a selection of my book discussion group and i thought at first it might be too upsetting but i'm so glad i read it","1520":"premise 2 years after 9 11 there is a competition to design the memorial at the wtc site except when the winner is revealed submissions were anonymous it turns out he's a muslim basically new york starts tearing itself apart from all the hand wringing a panoramic novel in the style of wolfe's bonfire of the vanities that touches upon nyc politics tabloids class religion and art waldman deftly examines the fallout from a city and nation still trying to figure out the right way to heal","1521":"can't really put my finger on why but i didn't enjoy this book and had trouble finishing it i think it would make a great book club book lots of issues to discuss but i found it sort of frustrating to read in my own","1522":"i loved the detail of the characters the twists and the detail","1523":"2 5 stars waldman has a nice way with prose and the amount of research that must have gone into this book is impressive i just found it to all be very heavy handed and obvious how would the irish brother of a dead firefighter feel about a 9 11 memorial designed by a muslim how would a wealthy and beautiful aristocrat widow how would a blood sucking tabloid journalist how would an illegal bengali widow the shallowest possible views on race religion grief it's just what you'd expect","1524":"this deserved more than a single star but i didn't like it much an potentially provocative concept was sunk by poor execution too many characters to keep track of and not much depth to any of them i found myself wondering who i was supposed to root for as i didn't care for any of them to any great extent at every point i usually say what the author was trying to do but it seemed contrived most of the time and way too verbose for something trying to address such an important subject slow pace on top of everything i understand that the author wants to point out the gray areas of patriotism and islamaphobia but in the process she has provided a forgettable cast of characters stuck in a depressing mud that offers little hope for redemption within the universe of the story","1525":"only part way through this book but is definitely holding my interest the various groups' reactions to the news that amuslim american's design has been chosen for a 9 11 memorial seem very real i'm about 1 3 of the way through the book and really have no idea how this will be resolved","1526":"an impressive debut it takes major guts to attempt a reimagining of history where a design by an american muslim is chosen for the 9 11 memorial but waldman pulls it off with aplomb and the result is thoughtful powerful and compelling i enjoyed reading the way that the initial conflict over the memorial and its designer unfolded and affected so many people in various ways and appreciated how the book cut to the chase and introduced the decision for the memorial right away in the very first chapter and shaped the characters later throughout the aftermath the story and events felt realistic to me and i liked how so many of the characters were painted in shades of grey and had both good and bad aspects to their points of view","1527":"entertaining quick read read like an expanded short story with snippets of characters instead of full dossiers annoyed with wishy washy claire","1528":" this is seattle's 2012 seattle reads the submission choice first came the invite to a reception by seattle library foundation and then i saw the flyers i got to ask a librarian and he just gave me my own pristine paperback copy to read how would i know whether i wanted to attend the reception i would have to read the book once i started i couldn't stop and that pretty much involved sleeping it's the complexity of the novel that hooked me i write this now having spent an hour this morning in the author's presence as she fielded questions from a full room at ballard library so i could go on about the deliberate ambiguity the parallels between characters about the role of class as the unacknowledged elephant in the room but i'll just say that it's a very thought provoking well written page turning triumph of a first novel from a clearly very experience journalist and author there's very little humor to be found but that's exactly as it should be as the novelist will say without it being a spoiler it's about rue and regret set in a timely politically charged canvas while it mirrors the aftermath of terrorist attacks in new york it could be about any subsequent intersection of grief politics bias and architects fascinating","1529":"fascinating but at times exhausting in chronicling the current divisive state of america some beautiful writing some awkward slippery pronouns missing subjects","1530":"the submission is a timely novel about a 9 11 memorial competition in which the submissions are anonymous the winner turns about to be a muslim american as you can imagine conflict ensues people end up questioning their beliefs people end up asking the winner questions they have in my opinion no right to ask and yet they feel entitled to answers from a fellow american the novel dragged on a little more than necessary but the ending though not predictable was somewhat satisfying","1531":" the submission is a novel about prejudices passions and patriotism two years after 9 11 a juried panel is deciding on the winning submission for a memorial at ground zero to commemorate those whose lives were lost in the terrorist attack the identity of the entrants is hidden the jury deliberates and chooses a winner except when the winner is discovered to be a muslim american architecht although secular all procedure is tossed aside and reason gets trumped by passion and politics i really thought i would love this novel i liked it i can't really put my finger on why i didn't love it but i didn't come running home to pick up where i left off","1532":"i read this book for one of the two book clubs i belong to and it certainly generated a lot of discussion i thought it started very slow but i ended up liking it more and more as i got further along i would recommend this book as a very thought provoking read","1533":"what a great book for discussion everyone who's lived through 9 11 knows the story but this is a different spin on the submission for the memorial with multi faceted perspectives","1534":"wow more than anything this book captures how we are all so very flawed it's the human condition waldman's cast of characters is fearful loving stupid thoughtful angry passionate as my mother would say they're just people beautifully done i highly recommend this one","1535":"heart wrenching and thought provoking the submission takes place two years after 9 11 reminding my stylistically of the bonfire of the vanities the jury selects a design for a memorial from the blind competition only to discover that the architect is muslim the moral and ethical questions are provided in the guise of muslims the wealthy the blue collars the politicians the television news and tabloid reporters immigrants religious and non religious people children mothers fathers the international community those who perished in the twin towers worked there and the first responders so many great questions that still apply today in how we deal with one another who we are as a country and what the 9 11 legacy is and the toll of that legacy","1536":"absolutely stunning novel that reimagines the 9 11 memorial selection process and in so doing lays bare the prejudices politics and pain of the process as seen through the eyes of the winner the jury the press and the families of the dead waldman is a superb writer and meticulous researcher and her former life as a new york times bureau chief both serves her well and is an amusing undercurrent as she mercilessly mocks the new york post's smarmy journalism and weaves a narrative that is powerful thought provoking and ultimately devastating","1537":"this review has been hidden because it contains spoilers to view it click here had it not been for the ending i think i would have given this two or three stars but i really loved the way the ending wrapped everything up and i also liked how it went into the future great idea last i felt the ending finally revealed how some of the characters truly felt i thought the story idea was a great one i liked the character development as there were some i really liked and others i loathed but i felt the writing was a bit dull the best way i can explain it would be to comp had it not been for the ending i think i would have given this two or three stars but i really loved the way the ending wrapped everything up and i also liked how it went into the future great idea last i felt the ending finally revealed how some of the characters truly felt i thought the story idea was a great one i liked the character development as there were some i really liked and others i loathed but i felt the writing was a bit dull the best way i can explain it would be to compare it to listening to someone talk for several hours in a monotonous tone not sure if that makes sense i never felt an urgency as to what would happen next etc and perhaps that was done on purpose overall an interesting read more","1538":"thought provoking clearly depicts faults and frailty of human of human condition","1539":"i had high hopes for this book based on my friend's review however i thought it was way too long and it seemed to be a vehicle for waldman to voice her opinions i didn't like any of the characters so it was hard to read them i appreciated the idea behind it but only forced myself to finish it because i'd invested so much time in it","1540":"misfire i have not read this and accidentally clicked on the stars rather than whatever it was i wanted to click and now i can't undo it damn it","1541":" i really only read this book because there was a free copy sitting out on the table at my library and i love an easy opportunity to keep up with what everyone else in seattle is reading the author was recently in town and it was a library foundation book club pick or something so i wasn't super committed and my expectations were pretty low but then i enjoyed it i appreciated the complexity of the characters and the different threads of the narrative and her style of writing was really a pleasure to read if not particularly poetic or beautiful themes of personal identity search for self and national and religious identity were expertly interwoven and i appreciated the take on how art and life intersect in complex historical contexts thanks seattle public library","1542":"i've added this to my all time favorites and it's a very short list i started to wait and read it again but i'm sure excellent thought provoking fiction is my favorite way to explore a complex non fiction issue loved it","1543":"a reimagining of what could have happened if a muslim won an open competition to design the ground zero memorial smart about the architecture world but also hellaciously good on post 9 11 new york immigration and identity and what america is and ought to be","1544":"more a book of ideas than characters this election year it feels more relevant than ever the layered motivations and unanticipated consequences of our public discourse are well worth examining seems to me this would be an interesting book club pick for 2016","1545":" the submission is an interesting book that shows what can happen when a tragic event mixed with media frenzy combine to shape public opinion and how that can affect real people's lives i did find this book to be frustrating because each character never really seemed to know their own convictions nor how to stand up for what they actually believe i was frustrated by claire's inability to stick to her guns i felt for mo's predicament and understood his unwillingness to really explain his design and its intentions and believed that were he any other architect his design would have been accepted at face value built and no questions would have been asked i was angry at all the media questioning and the implantation of bigoted ideas into public discourse i think this book is eerily accurate in its portrayal of the muslim panic that has been fueled by the media and oddly parallels real events that have happened in new york city it was an excellent choice for a book discussion","1546":"not the best fiction i've read this year good writing but i didn't find any of the characters particularly compelling or relatable the plot had a lot of promise and i expected to be conflicted about who to root for but unfortunately i ended up not really liking anyone","1547":"this book surprised me i was skeptical that that the topic could be handled without becoming trite the characters too stereotyped and while i sometimes got an ayn rand fountain head feeling like the message could outweigh the delivery i don't think it ever did cross that line the characters were developed well and the author demonstrated an admirable ability to evoke both empathy and indifference in the story that were unexpected it's an excellent book club choice","1548":" this book starts with a relatively simple question what if out of thousands of anonymous submissions the memorial design chosen to commemorate the tragedy of 9 11 was designed by a muslim but through this question waldman weaves a deeply moving narrative of grief and coping or lack thereof through the eyes of the many various groups and persons affected by the attacks the submission is more than anything a character study most of waldman's characters are realistically multifaceted people who are as unpredictable as they are stubborn they are lost fragile searching they can be confusing and unreachable but in them readers can begin to understand the complexity of the national populace in a post 9 11 american both those aspects that are familiar or agreeable and those that are not i found this book to be a quick but hard read not just because i became so frustrated with the characters at times but because it drew out emotions and prejudices that i didn't realize i had one of the most gripping parts of the submission is that it forced me to recognize the trauma that we still experience as citizens and individuals every day and it gave me the chance to understand others' experience of this trauma i'll be honest it doesn't have a particularly happy or conclusive ending it leaves you stuck stuck thinking and wondering and reflecting no answers in sight but it was worth the time waldman is a fantastic author and a master of thematic writing","1549":" yes this is the 9 11 novel about the memorial competition even though i was dissatisfied with the ending i thought it was good it does get very political but i was impressed with the author's ability to portray the viewpoints of characters from both sides of the spectrum even if it is fairly obvious that she herself tends to swing left the main characters were well developed and seemed like real people although most of the jury members were more like one dimensional caricatures of artists sean reddened he didn't need to see his parents' faces to read their scorn he couldn't even pretend that he would have been as brave as patrick if given the chance faced with a building pouring fire and smoke he would have run away as fast as he could nor was he sure this would have been wrong patrick had charged into a building that pancaked almost immediately on top of him and he'd left three sad eyed children behind","1550":"i dont know if it is poor plot or story line poor character development or just this story is too close to my professional interests i just couldn't seem to get into it i gave it a good shot and abandoned it at page 130 something which i rarely do may try to read again later but for now i am not looking forward to anything that turns real world cultural conflicts into mere caricatures no thank you","1551":"at first i was a bit puzzled by this book but as i read on i was won over the author does an incredible job of looking at the fictional ramifications of a memorial to the 9 11 victims in today's world a great political read that reminded me of snow by ohran pamuk","1552":" a good read just too heavy on the telling rather than showing it tells the story of a fictional memorial being built on the site of the towers two years after 9 11 the committee chosen to decide the winning memorial design all submitted anonymously has finally made their decision the problem when they open the envelope revealing the winner's name mohammed kahn spelling may be wrong as i listened to this as an audiobook all hell breaks loose they have chosen a muslim if the name is any indication the novel is told from the points of view of several different people paul the committee chair claire a committee member representing those who lost a loved on in 9 11 as her husband was killed that day mo the designer and ozma an illegal bangledsehi who also lost her husband on 9 11 there is definite verisimilitude as the media's reaction and overreaction and those of the other characters feel very real it's a good yarn with a lot of food for thought however waldman lost me with the speechifying her characters do rather than just allowing them to show their thoughts feelings etc via their actions they are given speeches to explain everything while not didactic it still grew a bit tiresome thus i only gave it three stars would probably be a good discussion title for book clubs language some sex","1553":"beautifully written didn't love some of the characters very thought provoking","1554":" the submission was like a good tom wolfe novel without the excessive description it presents a kaleidoscopic view of new york as it deals with a controversy after a jury in a blind selection process chose a design for the 9 11 memorial that was done by an atheist non believing muslim the characters are all familiar new yorkers the urbane architect the widow who was married to an investment banker the distinguished former head of an investment bank who chairs the jury as a step towards even better boards the dead firefighter's brother whose reinfuses his life with purpose by rallying against the memorial design the iranian lawyer with a foot in the muslim community and a foot in publicity the new york post's sensationalist reporter the ambitious governor and most poignantly an undocumented bangladeshi widow of a janitor who dies on 9 11 every one of these characters are familiar almost a stereotype but they are also all presented with an impressive degree of sympathy understanding of their motives and a presentation of how they are unsure of what they are doing amy waldman also does an impressive job of taking what seems like a clever concept and turning it into a full novel as the plot develops and incident builds on incident culminating in a every effective ending and she takes what i still think of as a morally black and white issue but finds interesting ambiguities and questions and dilemmas that emerge from it the submission has a lot of good writing and interesting phrases but it is not an exercise in flashy writing or novel storytelling methods instead it is more about its range of subjects and the dilemmas it presents it is not meant as an insult to the book to say that it would be a good choice as required reading in high schools where you could picture the endless discussions of the various dilemmas it poses as well as a lesson in intolerance and bigotry","1555":" a poignant look at the events of september 11th through a fictionalized account of the memorial competition this book raises important questions about the country we live in and the way we respond to the most difficult of events the submission raises challenging questions and often leave them unanswered up to the reader to answer for themselves it is hard not to see yourself in at least one if not many of the characters as we loom back to the events of 10 years ago this book shows the power of fiction to encourage dialogue and progress recommend","1556":" a many charactered post 9 11 novel with the same ambitions as the movie crash it is a couple years after the september attacks and a jury has just chosen a design for the 9 11 memorial from thousands of anonymous entries they look at the identity of the winning architect and find that his name is mohammed khan and we are off confronting religious ethnic and class divisions in new york city from the viewpoints of a wealthy principled 9 11 widow the head of the memorial committee architect mo khan the ne'er do well brother of a fallen firefighter a bangladeshi illegal immigrant a new york post reporter the reporter by the way seemed identical to the kate mara character in house of cards this seems to be the season for ambitious amoral young female journalists all in all i liked but did not love the book while waldman is trying to capture many different voices the voices all seemed to merge to me all the characters struggle with their own biases and all in the end fail to truly connect with other people one challenge was that this is the first book i have encountered entirely on my kindle which i found disorienting minor characters would pop up and i'd want to flip back to remember their story but flipping back is something i haven't mastered and i realize how much of my reading experience has to do with the book itself i remember the narrative in part by remembering where on the page actions take place and how far through the book i have gotten the kindle gives you % read on the bottom of the page but there is nothing memorable about those numbers ah yes i last met this character at 38% read i would never think that to myself reading on a kindle is like having someone sitting next to me on a park bench and reading the book aloud i get the story but i have nothing to hold on to","1557":" this is a great conceit well executed the aftermath of 9 11 is reimagined with america plunged into a dilemma by a jury's choice of a muslim architect to design the memorial the understandable misgivings of the victims' families spread outward and are soon blown up into open mistrust hostility and eventually open racism by the misjudged actions of those involved and the cynical manipulations of the media and politicians the book it most reminded me of was bonfire of the vanities another new york novel about racial tension and competing interest groups and it has some of the same flaws like the fact that it's characters seem to be hand picked to exemplify particular types in the society as a result it's a little contrived but that's not to say it's a bad book by any means i especially like the ending which was all the more moving for being so unexpected i considered leaving this word out because i think i'm supposed to look down on their small mindedness or something but i find it easy to imagine them being unhappy on a gut level in that position no matter what their rational selves might think especially when the designer himself is such a spikey insensitive dick","1558":" what happens when you get a bunch of liberal elites in a room together to decide on the 9 11 memorial in an anonymous contest and the winner turns out to be in sara palin voice a muss lim what happens when the designer a non religious and non observant muslim who's kind of a dick refuses to answer any questions regarding his religion or affirm his secularism and in fact becomes more religious just to spite the same seemingly nosy elites throw into the mix a bangladeshi widow who also lost her husband that day but also happens to be an illegal immigrant a fiery immature and brash blue collar rabble rouser who represents the families of first responders a smug elite investment banker the very same kind of guy who would bring the financial system to its knees several years later who is looking for a solution that is both politically sensitive and sweeping and a journalist who will stop at nothing to use this story for personal gain with no real affiliations or views and you have an excellent novel of a city and nation still in shock and unable to have the 20 20 hindsight to confront their own prejudices and misconceptions it's a grand messy novel of ideas one that has no easy answers or solutions which is rather the point when we tackle 9 11 islam and our response","1559":"easy to read even funny at times while still illuminating what it means to be muslim in post 9 11 america the public personas we all hide behind how we deal with and even use grief and our ability to trust others with our true selves","1560":"compelling philosophical poetic a very good book","1561":"very thought provoking and deep thinking required makes you question the values of america v","1562":"thought provoking and infuriating to the max this novel about a design competition to build a 9 11 memorial lays out all the political and sectarian infighting the fears and the suspicions it highlights the worst in a sensationalist press and in self serving individuals leaving common sense and decency in the dust pretty much true to life","1563":"loved this book the character development was so good i had to remind myself several times that these events did not happen they felt so true to contemporary american society","1564":"most of my book club enjoyed this book i did not interesting premise but i never was attatched to any of the characters","1565":"4 5 more like not an all time favorite but very well done recommended","1566":"perfect book to be reading around the time of the 9 11 10th anniversary","1567":" my opinion of this book started out fairly high the beginning showed tremendous promise waldman penned a fluid narrative that flowed between many different characters without confusion the initial debate which never mentioned the big words like 9 11 or twin towers posed a powerful question with initially reasonable reactions and responses after this great start waldman's narrative degenerates into cliche ultimately she fails to help the reader connect to any of the characters as a side note the sexual innuendos were completely unnecessary in this book quite gratuitious and jarring","1568":" this my friends is a breathtaking book as a matter of fact i am still so much under its spell that i doubt my ability to do it justice in articulating why it has such impact as such i may well edit my comments when i have achieved a bit more thought and distance addressing 9 11 and its aftermath is always a tricky proposition and many readers myself among them actively avoid the works that try i won't go into the usual reasons here but i will say that i am incredibly grateful that i was asked to read this book otherwise i would have missed a masterpiece in lesser hands the premise might seem contrived an open anonymous competition to design the 9 11 memorial is held and the winning artist is revealed to be a muslim american the reactions and debates that follow are authentic and conflicted and different views are represented in a way that avoids for the most part being reductive what impressed me most is that there isn't an obvious right answer to questions posed and i found myself purposely slowing my reading so as not to miss any nuance this is one of those rare books that i couldn't help but think about even when i set it down it made me uncomfortable but in the best possible way the last note i'll mention for now is the grace with which the author threads the characters story and theme the last pages in particular underscored what an important but not self important work this could be and i drew a surprised breath when i realized the artistry with which waldman plays on her title re read audio december 2012audiobook note i admire bernadette dunne's voice talent but previously i had so associated her with shirley jackson's literary horror that i was wary my fears were completely unfounded as dunne does every word justice another perfect pairing","1569":"in a lot of ways waldman took the easy way out one perspective wasn't cutting it so she decided to have six perspectives bringing it all together in the end was difficult so she thrust us 20 years into the future and created a character who is making a documentary to help gather thoughts in hindsight from the novel's major characters for me the convenience of all this made the reading a little boring and took away the chance for one thing i really enjoy about reading fiction being amazed at the author's creativity and ability to convey complexity it also took away from her characters each of them is far less complex and depthful than they could be if the book had just one or two star players additional the style is a little weak cliched descriptions and really odd metaphors pop up frequently all that said waldman does accomplish what was probably her goal she captures the complexity of the american situation immediately post 9 11 by creating an intense situation the winning design for the 9 11 memorial turns out to have been created by an american of muslim background she is able to delve deeply into the complex opinions and viewpoints of americans on all sides of the issue different characters have different reactions not all of them based on their politics and many of them based very much on the extent to which the characters are under media scrutiny read this way with the situation as the main character and the characters as just tools to help define its complexities this is an excellent first novel i will probably always prefer novels that subordinate plot to characters rather than the other way around but i definitely see the appeal waldman's speculations on the aftermath of a situation that could have easily happened in america are fascinating and strike me as quite realistic themes america post 9 11 politics journalism public opinion vs principles","1570":"magnificent only because it was so thought provoking did it miss the lists","1571":"trip to new york helped with picturing locations familiarity with art and architecture helpful when reading i looked up several pieces mentioned on wikipedia of course you could read book fine without this knowledge but definitely more fully with it","1572":"i thought it was good a retelling of maya lin's story only the characters are more sinister an interesting take from the perspective of a relative of a victim and a muslim architect we discussed this book with my church book group new an interesting bunch of mostly retired intellectuals one didn't like any of the characters which was entertaining in itself","1573":"book group book about building a 9 11 memorial and the blind winner of the memorial contest turned out to be named mohammed khan i liked a lot of things about the book but i just felt bogged down in the circular stupidity of the people who were mad at anyone they attached to the group who bombed the towers some people in the group really liked it","1574":"enjoyed it really made me think about what should have been done for the memorial i liked the characters and all their interactions","1575":"this book asks if submission is the ultimate expression of love a jury charged with choosing a design for the memorial at ground zero selects from the anonymous submissions a design by a muslim american architect the story is about the response of the architect jury members politicians the muslim community and public at large can we ever be free of prejudice where is the line between the needs of self and submitting to the needs of others a thoughtful and thought provoking examination of the role of art and the artist in the public arena","1576":"wish i liked it more it didn't pull me in had 2 stars throughout the book elevated to 3because of the ending","1577":"thought provoking","1578":"very interesting and thought provoking book","1579":"ok perhaps i am being too generous based on how i generally rate books but i have been on such a roll reading good books these past few weeks this one is getting a bump too it really made me think and i wonder if at the heart of the book it really comes down to people me included not wanting to be made a fool it's this fear that drives us to cling to our beliefs i read this for my book club meeting tonight and i think it's going to be a great discussion","1580":"very thoughtful expansive and original story about aftermath of 9 11 in nyc","1581":"liked the premise and author's writing is terrific found myself wanting more action midway but ending was strong","1582":"let me put it this way i bought this because a meeting i had was set back an hour and a half and i didn't have a book with me i read it not exactly not stop afterward even though i had a library book that is nearly due i wanted to finish as well as something for book group i really loved the vast majority of it although in the very end i found at least one character behaving well out of character at a pretty key point i didn't need her to be perfect i just needed her to be consistent so the ending wasn't awful but i minded the change if i could i'd give the book 4 5 stars but i still enjoyed it","1583":" i thought this book was thoughtful and well written but ultimately too schematic and idea bound more like a framework for debate than a novel and many of the characters failed to rise above caricature yes it's a theme worth exploring and it's a very courageous choice to make both the hero and the heroine somewhat dislikeable prigs it makes the book's conundrums that much more challenging but for a book about the most traumatic day in my city's history it happens all in your head nowhere near your heart someone called it the 9 11 book for me the books that capture the bewildered oblique dread and melancholy of the post attack period netherland in particular or the emperor's children hit closer to home still waldman's book is thoughtful and at times almost inspired","1584":"the story of selecting a 9 11 memorial with anonymous submissions yields a dramatic story i feel the story took a long time to develop and move along however it did allow for thought provoking discussions and many difficult situations within the context of the book towards the end of the book the storyline picked up momentum and my interest was aroused significantly","1585":"i thoroughly enjoyed this post 9 11 story it brought up so many cultural and societal conflicts within our nation that it left you thinking how you would stand on creating a 9 11 memorial","1586":" i didn't like it as much as many reviews i thought it was unevenly written although exploring a timely topic what if a muslim american had been chosen to design the 9 11 memorial in nyc she uses characters in various roles widow of survivor bangladeshi widow of survivor politician protest groups to explore various responses sometimes beautifully written with interesting subplots other times characters seem to be used as delivery systems for a certain point of view i found myself skimming certain passages as they felt more like a lecture than a furthering of the plot or character development still i think it's worth reading and can be thought provoking","1587":" while i loved this book i may revisit my rating as i sit with it i think really that i would prefer to give it a 4 5 but half stars aren't available the premise drew me to this book and it was a book club selection but waldman's writing carried me through she captured the feeling of post 9 11 america she offered a keen view of the frenzy that often accompanies media events as well as the black white all nothing us them tone of so many of our contemporary debates she shows how uncertainty questions and nuance are lost in a torrent of words i was equally fascinated by the attention to identity what is it do we form it ourselves is it formed by others does it change who influences it can we ever truly know it the title is a wonderful word play itself being a much debated meaning of the word islam an actually description of the entry into the memorial contest and perhaps even an homage to theo van gogh's film although i have no idea that the author intended that one then of course there are the characters and the ways in which they choose to submit or not and the prices they pay for those choices while i liked knowing what happened to whom in the epilogue i think the book might have been better without it another reason that i'd prefer to hold back that last half star an epilogue that showed only the one off garden that was created would have seemed to me more true to the story itself","1588":"great book will make a super book club discussion","1589":"novel that takes place 2 years after 9 11 an elite jury in nyc has selected a design for a 9 11 memorial through an anonymous design contest they open the envelope to see that the winning architect is a muslim american stories focus on the muslim and muslim activists victims' families jury members and government officials and a illegal bangladeshi widow whose illegal alien husband worked and died at the world trade center","1590":"waldman's book is set only 2 years after 9 11 she did a wonderful job of portraying how raw people were and the characters managed to be familiar yet fell short of becoming caricatures the perceptions and changes in perceptions that each of the characters experienced through the book were very honest this would be a fantastic book to discuss and dissect i love how the simple title alone has many layers and the book makes you think right up to the very end","1591":"what an interesting read a book about 9 11 that is so thoughtful on so many levels highly reccomend it","1592":"a breathtaking panorama by amy waldman of social and emotional issues in a post 9 11 nation book clubs will find tons to discuss with this readable novel http www readinggroupguides com gui","1593":"i feel the author capitalized on the 10th anniversary and delivered a poorly developed book the topic of how america views islam in a post 9 11 world was interesting important but i felt little sympathy for the characters and the author failed at grasping the scope of what she was writing about","1594":"awesome epic provocative the conflict develops in concentric circles like in bonfire of the vanities a wide angled shot of the whole society no time for a real reviews now but strongly recommend it","1595":"such a compelling concept story told well from multiple viewpoints well done","1596":"very interesting novel about judging the anonymous competition for the 9 11 memorial and what happens when a muslim wins the competition","1597":"i liked the concept but the story really got bogged down the last half can't quite put my finger on what was wrong but didn't keep my interest up as it had in the beginning","1598":"awesome really made me think i kept reminding myself it was fiction as i totally believe unfortunately this could have happened","1599":" this is the all seattle reads book so i was intrigued the submission refers to the winning entry for the design of the 9 11 memorial it turns out it is designed by none other than mohammed khan a muslim in name at least controversy ensues as you can imagine i found it to be very thought provoking how tolerant are we where do we draw lines what does a memorial mean and what does it do brought me back to 9 11 and those months that followed a few times in teetered on melodrama but it always came back to reality i recommend it","1600":" it is amazing to see how actual world events ran so parallel to waldman's fictional story line sometimes her story came first and similar world events followed at other times the events took place and her story followed it was a double helix of timing between the real and the imagined which arose from it so much so that waldman was as surprised as anyone at what happened next this is a remarkable portrayal of a contemporary situation from every character's point of view told with

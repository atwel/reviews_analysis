brutality of the khmer rouge was softened through the author's use of poetry lyrical prose and in telling the story through the eyes of an eight year old i was in high school college and don't remember being aware of what was going on in cambodia at the time","2":"i cried i found it very emotional and appreciated the views and perspectives of the narrator as a child the mother character continued to develop and become stronger throughout the story an interesting read on cambodia at a time of major turmoil and trauma","3":"i would have given this book all five stars but at times it gets a bit too prose y for my taste i like beautiful language in a book but it occasionally lost its purpose i did gain a deeper knowledge and understanding of the khmer rouge and the atrocities they committed on their own people","4":" this is a fictionalized account of the author's life raami is a 7 year old minor princess of the cambodian royal family when the khmer rouge take over her family is forced to the countryside and after her father sacrifices himself to save the rest of the family they are sent to labor camps i wanted to like this book much more than i did my first issue was that the author made the story a first person narrative but then gave her much more eloquence than is realistic for any 7 year old my second issue was that the story didn't have much of a narrative arc mostly we just plodded through the plot","5":"i learned a lot about the communist revolutionary takeover of cambodia in 1975 told from the viewpoint of the author as a 5 year old even though this is classified as historical fiction it is because she changed some of the names and other details but the story of 3 years of her life is true her family was very wealthy and came from royalty her father was a scholar and a poet she was her father's little protege who learned many poems that seemed far beyond the capability of a 5 year old in fact that would be my only complaint of this book that the feelings and thoughts of such a young child were at times unbelievably adult the communist revolutionaries had particular hatred of everyone of privilege nearly her entire immediate family went missing were killed or died from unspeakably horrible treatment she and her mother survived 3 years of work camps and starvation and were saved by the vietnamese they then walked to thailand and finally made it to the us i couldn't put this book down and read it in 2 days","6":"i do not really like giving books that deal with serious subjects a low rating however i found it really hard to get into it got better as it went along but it was hard for me to focus on the narrative","7":"this is a beautifully written story about cambodia's civil war and atrocities of the khmer rouge from the view of 7 year old raimi it is based on the author's own experiences in her home country in the 1970's it seems strange to say it is beautifully written considering the horrific experiences of the little girl and her family but it is i highly recommend this book","8":"although the subject matter is interesting and harrowing it was just too distracting to have the story told by an 8 year old who thought and spoke like an 80 year old that alone undermined the credibility of the story and the storyteller for me","9":" in the shadow of the banyan tree is historical fiction that is based on events that occurred in the life of the author set in the late 70s in cambodia it describes the rise to power of the khmer rouge from the point of view of a small girl i wasn't particularly familiar with this historical event so i looked it up on the internet before i read the book based on the horrors i read about i was prepared for a shockingly violent book however this book does not delve into a lot of gore for shock value it also doesn't shy away from violence i would say the author found a balance of describing to the horrors of forced labor execution and starvation without being overly graphic the author weaves in lovely poetry and mythical legends that keep the young raami strong through her struggle this is an exceptional story of survival and hope","10":" siem reap in cambodia is one of my favorite places in southeast asia the khmer ruins in cambodia are amazing and probably the best in the world but there is a heaviness to cambodia i could feel the ghosts ghosts of the past ghosts of the dead i am not sure maybe i was feeling the sadness grief of the cambodian people as most of them had lost family members at the hand of the khmer rouge possibly probably it was an internal disbelief and horror that such atrocities occurred the only other place i have had this feeling was in poland cambodia is a beautiful country with lovely people i thought this book captured all of this it was haunting superstitious poetic horrific and even serene in parts my favorite chapter was chapter 15 her interaction with the ox cart diver revolutionary guard and the love and the simplicity of the older peasants they went to live with moved me i thought it was lovely there is beauty even in a world that seems to have gone mad of course this is not a lighthearted read and it is hard to comprehend the actions of the guards the author was only five years old when these events occurred the characters and events are based on fact her story but she had to make it a work of fiction due to her gaps in memory my preference in this type of book would be non fiction however being that she was so young at the time it is understandable","11":"this review has been hidden

their last words their last breath and they would know that i had witnessed not only their deaths but more importantly their fight for life their desire to live more","12":"patron review spellbinding very informative loved every minute of it worth reading again","13":" at times you would swear you can smell the beautiful flowers of cambodia with ratner's ability to transport you to this nation in such turmoil in the mid 1970's these same delicate sentiments are mirrored in her prose which at times is absolutely breathtaking not a small feat as she would be recounting the events she captures in her native tongue in her mind and translating them to english how strange to begin with flowers and end in such harshness truly a difficult story to read the violence of the khmer rouge and the devastation the young raami 7 years old experiences were the stuff of nightmares ratner truly honors the memories of those lost in those years especially that of her father an epic debut novel by any standard","14":"a very interesting read based on the author's life the story follows raami a 7 year old from a privileged family in cambodia during the time of the khmer rouge they are evicted from their home and forced to travel across the country being re educated in a rural village forced to work in starvation conditions and finally escaping when the khmer rouge is defeated with only raami and her mother surviving what makes this harrowing ordeal bearable to the reader is raami's outlook on life which has been colored by her poet father's lessons enabling her to not fall victim to hopelessness","15":"loved this book i would definitely recommend it to anyone who enjoys historical fiction","16":" when a person shares a personal story of man's inhumanity to man survival of a genocide i feel that the story must be read and shared this novel based on the author's childhood experience of the khmer rouge's inhuman treatment of the people in cambodia after the april 17 1975 takeover of the government in phnom phen is one that should be read by all of us in our well governed over fed country where we have the luxury of pondering gay marriage gun control or other social issues told from the perspective of a 7 year old girl the story is innocent of some of the most gristly crimes against humanity and could certainly be read by middle school children like the novel shades of gray which i also just finished there are no horrible rapes or killings witnessed by the child but the suffering and the emotional trauma are raw and real enough and as in shades of gray there is an enduring message of hope and love","17":" i first picked up this book because it was on a topic i had little familiarity with once i started reading i could not put it down i think the narrator is absolutely key and provides such a unique introspective and heartbreaking point of view as the story is told through the voice of a child wise beyond her years i'd recommend to all it is the type of book we all need to read so that we can get perspective on those everyday problems that we so often raise to a level of unwarranted importance","18":"heartbreaking reading exquisitely written it reads like poetry despite the material a 7 year old girl is the narrator experiencing the revolt by the khmer rouge in cambodia although this is a novel the main protagonist's story closely mirrors that of the author who was 5 years old in 1975 at this time in her country's history highly recommended","19":" around the world cambodiafiction but based strongly on the author's own experiences as a child during the rule of the khmer rouge this novel brought the brutality to the surface forcing a very intense and emotional reading experience i frequently had a hard time continuing as the atrocities piled up but vaddey ratner keeps her story from plunging irrevocably into despair by showing the reader moments with wings poetry that soars love that keeps victims from laying down in the mud and giving up if you knew very little about the khmer rouge as i did this is an eye opening story that you are unlikely to forget any time soon i wasn't sure how to rate this it was an extraordinary book but so painful that i had a hard time actually enjoying the read i kept on because i felt it was important to bear witness to events that seem to have been largely forgotten everyone grows up knowing about the nazis and the holocaust why don't we all know about this","20":"lyrical heartbreaking account of the khmer rouge takeover of cambodia as seen from the perspective of a child in the royal family the novel is based on the author's own experiences as child i can't even imagine how excruciating it must have been to relive these events while writing about them in this beautiful book","21":" by the time i finished in the shadow of the banyan i realized what a beautiful book it is in the beginning i had a little trouble following the main plot along with the poems and stories of the father it was a slow read but i feel it is a very important read this is the story of what happened to the people in cambodia during the 1970s under the khymer rouge even though i had a little trouble following the poems and stories of the father i think the feeling i came away with from this book is best expressed by what the father said i told you stories to give you wings raami so that you would never be trapped by anything your name your title the limits of your body this world's suffering","22":"amazing read slightly depressing but very well written this book is considered medium fiction due to the fact that the author is retelling the story of her childhood i highly recommend this book to anyone interested in international history or memoirs","23":"i won this book from a goodreads giveaway and really liked it it was a unique journey into a world i had no prior knowledge of i enjoyed this story through the eyes of a young girl who's life is turned upside down","24":"stellar i must admit that i was excited and apprehensive when i received this as an advance reader's edition through goodreads i wasn't sure what to think of a fictional account of real life experiences during the khmer rouge regime in cambodia beginning 1975 i've read a number of books about human suffering during political movements that were supposed to help the people e g wwii vietnam us american indian re education etc but i had never yet read one about cambodia and the khmer rouge how could i trust the narrative of a woman who chose to write her account as a fictional representation this woman was only five years old when the revolutionary army marched into the capital city what could she possibly have to say that is truthful and accurate i found myself distrusting the book from the beginning and so i struggled to really dive in somewhere in the middle of the book i met a woman who had also left the capital city of cambodia during the same time that ms ratner and her family did in sharing her story including the murder of her husband and the death of her infant girl she ratified ms ratner's narrative by the end of the book i was more than hooked i wanted to know more fortunately the editors provided that by providing author's note acknowledgements and a conversation with vaddey ratner at the back of the book ms ratner has made it on my list of people i would love to meet someday vaddey ratner had been a privileged member of royalty before she and her family were exiled from their home and eventually from each other she deftly weaves a beautiful story of anguish and endurance drawing on the mature experiences and painful memories of adult survivors in her circle of relations filling in the gaps where her own memories could not be entirely trusted or were found wanting i came to understand and appreciate that ms ratner chose to write in the shadow of the banyan as a fictional narrative in order to revive her own ghosts as they might appear without having to worry about keeping them marching in exact order by so doing she could make minor adjustments to her journey and experiences without damaging the integrity of her and her family's collective remembrances this is definitely a must read book watch for it in august this year","25":"wow this book was physically painful for me to read i felt sick with grief for the way humans can find ways to torture each other it was even more painful as it was written from the view of a very innocent child such pointless destruction we people create i wish i could say this was all pure fiction it had to have been written well to be so hard to read","26":"really really good reading at times it breaks your heart and at times it uplifts it would help in understanding to have an idea of the horrors of the khmer times but just knowing that the basis of this story are true events may be enough definitely would recommend","27":"in the shadow of the banyan will be published august 7th by simon u0026amp schuster my sincere thanks for the opportunity to read this in e galley format with a poetic voice ratner plunges us into this personal trial of a royal family wrenched from their home in phnon penh cambodia during the late seventies a time of revolution robbed of her childhood the narrator seven year old raami brings us on this horrific displacement as she and her family endure homelessness hunger hard labor and the death of loved ones in the 4 years the story depicts though raami's story which parallels with ratner's own could easily leave my heart weighted down with sorrow the beauty of ratner's writing and the brilliancy of the human spirit manages to leave me with hope in the end what struck me most about in the shadow of the banyan was that the imagery of this fictional memoir mirrors a truth that is far worse in the shadow of the banyan is a moving debut and a must read","28":"not often do you read a book about a subject so devastating that is written with such poetry touching moving beautiful","29":"utmost beauty and horrific darkness are close together in this extraordinary debut of vaddey ratner the story of raami is very closely modeled to ratner's own childhood born as a cambodian princess into luxury and comfort then swept up by the horrors of the khmer rouge genocide i don't want to give away too much because i think everybody should read about how the strength of the human spirit can withstand even the darkest times if only we can recognize the glimmers of hope and beauty around us and hold on to the love inside of us","30":"great book about the khmer rouge takeover in cambodia it's a fictionalized memoir and sometimes it's a bit too artsy for me but the actual story is very good and very sad it covers all four years of the kher rouge rule and then it includes a few pages of interviews with the author","31":"great story but the writing was a little overdone at times","32":"this is a fictionalized memoir of a young cambonian princess's experiences during the chaos and destruction of the khmer rouge era one of my piano teachers has been involved for decades in the support of cambodia through various projects and so this book piqued my interest the incredible destruction that went on through these few years continues to affect many cambodians to this day for more information please visit the cambodian support group csg at www cambodiacsg org","33":" to keep you is no gain to kill you is no loss that was the dictum of the khmer rouge a gorilla group who on april 17 1975 stormed into cambodia's capital of phnom penh and declared a new government this revolution meant a whole new way of life for the country the intellectual class became the 'enemy' as the khmer rouge tried to reincarnate them from city people to peasants it is estimated that between one and two million people died before the regime was finally overthrown by the vietnamese military this is essentially vaddey ratner's story as she was five years old when this happened and her father was the great grandson of a price in the book she is named raami and her 'papa' disappears early on in the revolution the family has to endure a forced exodus and everyone either dies or is separated from the rest of the family so that only raami and her mother remain together they eventually get reunited with their uncle in a work camp but not for long before he takes his own life because of his grief how raami and her mother survive those four years makes for a heartbreaking read but it is a story that needs to be told","34":" i really though this was a very reflective book the author tells a partly fictional account of her time in cambodia when the khmer rouge were in power the death of loved ones and hunger are heartbreaking i really enjoyed the style the author used vivid descriptions and a variety of stories told by the parents of the young girl since the character was so young i wondered if it would work to show how much understanding she had i think the telling of stories made this possible and it worked for me this book has had many mixed reviews but i would highly recommend it","35":"incredibly well written but so totally depressing knowing that the story was closely based on the author's real experience as a child in cambodia","36":"haunting story of the khmer rouge in cambodia in the 1970's based on the author's own experiences of being sent to the country side and almost worked and starved to death as a child reminded me of the killing fields","37":"wow fantastic","38":"the story was tragic the writing was beautiful this is the story of an extended family forced to flee their home and privileged life by the khamer rouge in cambodia as told by the 7 year old daughter the senselessness and horror of what the family goes through is told in such beautiful language and ultimately with such hope that it makes it bearable to read","39":"this is a beautifully written tragic and heartbreaking story the writing is so lyrical and amazing it actually diminishes the impact of what you are reading while you are reading it it was only after i put the book down and had time to think about the story itself that i could try to comprehend what the people were enduring even then i knew i could never fully understand what it would be like to try and live under those conditions","40":"this book started off slow it was one of the most educational books that i have read i was not aware of the cambodian history where the khmer rouge came into power quite heart wrenching","41":"the story of post imperialism and attempts to communize cambodia by the khmer rouge in the 1970s is every bit as devastating as any i've read about the holocaust although the book is billed as historical fiction it is based on the author's childhood and at times left me shaking my head in disbelief at the cruelty of the soldiers of the revolution the story is beautifully written but so sad it left me drained upon completion of the book","42":"so many times we hear of unimaginable events on the nightly news as was the story of cambodia in the 1970s to hear this described by the voice of a child not only brought the horror to life but also the glimpse of hope and life itself overcoming and surviving","43":"amazing though not a memoir this story parallels the authors personal experiences under the regime of the khmer rouge in cambodia of the mid 1970's the story is told by 7 year old raami a privileged royal child of phnom penh who looses all those dear to her except her mother to genocide a touching tragic tale of a horrendous time in world history","44":"i usually avoid books about the extremism and violence of war however the writing was so lyrical like a prose poem and from the view of a child that the book captivated me","45":"brutal and gut wrenching but worth every second","46":"i've read a lot about pol pot's cambodia and the genocide that took place during his regime so i was intrigued when i came upon this book expecting that the semi autobiographical story will faithfully evoke the horrors endured by the population however while some dire things are indeed presented most of the book is just flowery poetic prose musing about love and family rejoicing in an idyllic world pushing the horrors to a secondary level not what i expected","47":"lovely lyrical book that reads like a memoir a glimpse into a different world tragic but beautiful","48":" amazing book that opened my eyes to the true horrors of cambodia and the khmer rouge written as a novel but is basically the author's true story so told through the eyes of a child i have heard complaints of the language of the story being unbelievable as coming out of a child's mouth but for me it wasn't a problem because in the beginning we are told that her father whom she absolutely adored was a poet and it seemed to me that she was following in his footsteps the writing was so beautiful that i could get a complete image of the story and characters in my head which for me is the sign of a great book when i feel like i can actually visualize it","49":" it's a very personal story of the horrors visited on the cambodian people by the khmer rouge as exemplified by the family of raami a seven year old girl whose idyllic life is shattered in an instant the early pages describe life in a minor royal family wealthy sheltered loving cultured seemingly blind to the approaching forces of revolution overnight the family is taken from their home with only the goods they can carry split into groups and relocated as part of a scheme to build a new order for the organization the nameless all powerful group that punishes class enemies and the educated and attempts to destroy all previous ties so that the only loyalty is to the force that oppresses it's bleak and tragic yet the kindness of a few of the people they meet and the resilience of raami and her mother keeps it from being unbearably so","50":"the tragedy of this book reminded me of many other books i have read is there a name for the genre of fictionalized memoir dealing with political terror it is unimaginable that one can survive such tragedies","51":"excellent haunting i couldn't put it down","52":"beautifully written from the perspective of a precocious child but painful to read this book gave me nightmares","53":"this book quite simply is incredible it should be read slowly as it gets under your skin and seeps into your soul it a thinly disguised fictionalized biographical account of the khmer rouge regime's takeover of cambodia in the mid 1970's at times harrowing and heartbreaking the achingly beautiful prose lies in stark contrast to the brutal atrocities committed by the regime there were times when i had to put down the novel as i found myself weeping over the loss and despair inflicted upon the main characters at once devastating but with a spirit that refuses to die this book is a must read vaddey ratner is an incredibly gifted writer and brave and spirited soul she should be recognized for this beautiful and haunting work of art","54":" this isn't a novel this is the raw emotion of a lifetime committed to words i didn't know the story of the author when i read this but the intimacy in which she writes and the poetry of the language she uses to describe and explain the horrors of cambodia during the genocide of the late 70's convinced me that this was her story as well for those of us who benefit from living in a free country this should be required reading to remind us all of what a true privilege it is and that world wide there are those still suffering and struggling for that same basic right","55":"it was a very in depth read of a family surviving the cambodian viet nam revolutionary conflicts in the shadow of the banyan tree is sacred ground and the story of the khmer rouge is war love and staying together even when dying very delicately written with a good sense of personal feeling during the war torn era of the revolutionary army in cambodia","56":"this book was a fiction based on truth story about the mid seventies when the communists overthrew the rulers in cambodia the main characters story is basically the authors story very sad","57":"a heartbreaking tale told from a 7 year old girl's perspective it was slow to start but i was riveted after the first third based on the author's real life experiences in cambodia during the rule of the khmer rouge and pol pot","58":" a book about war not my first but still brought me to tears not from the horrendous pitiful heartbreaking scenes while the fight was on going not from the encounters and the unforgettable experiences that the characters had underwent not from the deaths tortures plights of the citizen not from the cruel heartless so called revolutionary soldiers who knew nothing but just to bully over their own people not even from the smallest detailed tale of their journey to freedom i cried because at the very end they endured everything the people of cambodia came out strong though physically and emotionally and mentally battered their hopes never wavered never faltered the will to live had won seen from the eyes of a 7 year old raami polio challenged who experienced all the hurtful things this world could give but still faced them with hope and love and courage that is truly inspiring not a memoir but an effective one at that storytelling i've learned more about the country's history genocide and khmer rouge and all as one of the book's quote says knowing comes from learning finding from seeking i am not on the blind side anymore","59":" a story depicting life under the khmer rouge in cambodia during the genocide of the mid 1970's as seen through the eyes of a young girl also a story of loss hope memory and survival while a witness to senseless death and destruction of a country's culture and society reportedly 2 million were murdered by the khmer rouge during this period while the talk was of a new democratic egalitarian country the reality was one of family separation forced manual labor starvation and the murder of all intellectuals people in high status positions those not looking cambodian enough and all other undesirables","60":"this was a beautifully written novel based on the author's experience with the khmer rouge and genocide in cambodia the author's use of language is amazing and the subject matter is disturbing making it a difficult but worthwhile read","61":"this was an absolutely moving book it was so sad at times i had to put the book down the writing was beautiful the expressions of sadness were breathtaking it was subtle but so emotional it made me want to go to cambodia and to read more about the khmer rouge it's amazing that she was able to endure such pain and sorrow and be what she is today","62":"this is a beautifully written story of a young girl's tragic experiences when the khmer rouge took over in cambodia in the midst of horror she is able to still find beauty in the world the author's writing is simply poetic","63":"this book is at once heartbreaking and lyrically beautiful the language is poetic and evocatative this is all quite lovely until you realize it's about the cambodian genocide forget everything you think you know from the killing fields because this story is told in the first person from the pov of a little girl who actually lived through it the author vaddey ratner actually experienced these things as a child beginning with the khmer rouge takeover when she was only 5 years old the ancient culture and graciousness of the khmer people as well as their legends and old way of life still manages to shine through in spite of the ugliness ignorance and brutality of war","64":"poignant beautifully written story of hope and survival","65":"i liked the book since i'm in cambodia i feel like it was really important to read the history here is so tragic and i think this book was a great way to begin to understand what it was like i really got into the book after about 60% kindle but i especially loved the ending i didn't think it would end happily but it did fascinating that the story is similar to the author's childhood","66":"i liked the story it was well written the story itself had some heartbreaking moments but it was a story of survival","67":"a story of raami's resilience as she lived through the khmer rouge revolution as a member of the royal family in cambodia the stories of her childhood and her father's strength guide her as she narrates in a lyrical and nostalgic voice","68":" this beautifully written book is both brutal and incredibly sad narrated by a fictional 7 year old whose story parallels that of the author in the shadow of the banyan chronicles the damage done to one family by the khmer rouge takeover of the cambodian government in 1975 in many wars the story parallels that of the holocaust and some of the fiction set in communist china and north korea during their revolutions it's hard to read the book's one weakness to me is that the narrator is way too adult for a 7 year old while i'm sure the brutal conditions caused her to grow up fast still both the vocabulary and the thought processes employed don't ring true for a person that age","69":"a novel based in memoir reading the interview with the author at the end added to my appreciation for this book i recommend reading that q u0026amp a first similar in genre to wiesel's night and an important complement for trouble by gary schmidt for teen readers","70":"what an amazing book terrifically sad though brought tears to my eyes well written and based on a true story highly recommended","71":"this coming of age novel about a horrific period of history the cambodian genocide under the khmer rouge in the 1970s was excellent and beautifully written","72":" ratner effectively shares her own experience during the communist revolution in cambodia in the 1970's through this novel using the character of raami to reflect her own memories this offers a unique perspective through the innocent eyes of a child who doesn't understand what's happening - she can only observe the chaos and adult conversations of a situation that is beyond her comprehension though she doesn't directly witness extreme amounts of violence aside from a few deaths the end demonstrates the aftermath of the ravaged landscape there is a palpable sense of loss throughout and raami's narrative often relies on buddhist and cambodian mythology to help her indentify with her circumstances ignorant soldiers spew communist rhetoric and the constant threat of starvation extreme work and execution is always present especially for raami and her royal family despite the hardships raami finds beauty in the world around her and inspiration from the words of her poet father ratner succeeds in painting a terrifying landscape and a gorgeous country the characters were well written but i never felt a personal connection with them perhaps it was because ratner was referencing her unreliable memories as a young child or wanted to keep a little distance from her traumatic experiences but i felt there was a subtle something lacking having not known a single thing about the cambodian revolution this offers a nice glimpse at the ruin it created i guess i was expecting more emotional tragedy and brutality i received a complimentary copy of this book from the publisher and an additional copy from goodreads","73":"a beautifully written book and an incredible tale of what took place when the khmer rouge took over in cambodia highly recommended","74":"in the shadow of the banyan tells the story of how one family's life was changed when cambodia fell to the khmer rouge a tragic and beautiful story","75":"this was a really good first novel it was told in the pov of a young girl and the author tried to keep metaphoric language in the eyes of the narrator hence it was believable sometimes there was some lagging and the story seemed to stall but the author worked hard to keep the action going and mostly it worked i learned a lot about the horrors of the khmer rouge of the 1970's and a bit of the culture of the cambodian people","76":"beautifully written truly amazing story one i'll certainly read again u0026amp again","77":"tragic heartbreaking and yet one of the most beautiful books i've ever read","78":" the reader and reviewer copied this excerpt not from the book but a reviewer of the book i saw a new world through her eyes a land of geckos scaling the walls of jeweled beetles and coconut leaves a place where people have never known the taste of ice and where naked children are slick like rain drunk carps and rockets look like banana blossoms where people swallow diamonds and hide their eyeglasses to escape the notice and wrath of revolutionaries this is an extraordinary book \"--jonathan karp executive vice president and publisher in the shadow of the banyani copied this because he has captured the enlightenment of this book the hope of the main character was compelling and endearing to me as i read how it would conclude i was exhausted with emotional sensations but grateful the author listened to her father's words and took the time and energy to create this masterpiece this author has a desire to honor her father and his brilliant contribution to life as a husband father teacher and a wonderful poet and also honor others she loved and lost in the tragic guerilla warfare which occur when nixon was the usa president in a faraway land cambodia she relived through hers and others personal tumult experiences by fighting with her personal and past demons to write a fictional story about her private memories of a horrific period in the world's history and her childhood she was brilliant with her words pouring out her soul and pen the story with elegant language and thoughtful poetry by mingling her actual and fictional memories into a book full of memories of hers and others these memories of the characters are tremendous heart wrenching reality descriptions of the atrophies which occur behind the borders and the suffering of the refugees who suffered at the murderous hands of these misguided rebels this reader thought it would help to outline some history to really appreciate this author's depth of emotional investment she dedicated to writing and publishing the truth for all to see not many in america and possibly other countries were aware of the tragedies which occur in the late 70's when nixon was president the invasion of cambodia and the torture of refugees by closed minded sick rebels who were brainwashed as young children to become terrorists armed with weapons and instilled with a manipulative agenda in their minds the commandoes sent them out to the villages to pretend to be friends to the residents of cambodia and then forced them into enlisting as soldiers to fight the enemies those people who defiant those in charge were punished severely with hideous torture of guerilla warfare some individuals and their families who were brave and disobey the commanders' orders were torn away from each other and transported to a work camp or worse never to be seen again those who went against the rebels were unfortunately taken hostage and punished to be strip of their dignity and their lives later the rebels attacked those who did not fit their definition of the idea comrade no one was safe for madness reign in the country of cambodia as the new regime ravishes the lands and all material goods and attack the families it was an attempt to have the pheasants assist the rebels in taking over cambodia to create hide outs and a killing agenda for an execution mission against the enemies the vietnamese this author has honour her loved ones and defiant her enemies and did not stay silence about the atrophies of this warfare she came to realization that the story must be written to be a memorial for herself father and her loves ones she wrote an amazing touching and brilliant story about loveable characters young raami and her family as they navigated as hostages through the harsh and beautiful lands to holding cells be a buddha sanctuary or a pheasant's home they suffer as slaves in labor concentration camps suffer through the misery of poverty starvation and inhuman abuse raami the character at the age of seven lost her family and witnessed bloody slaughter of the refugees no child should experience such horror at such a tender age she had two loving parents and a strong network that cherish her and give her strength to survival to be a fighter and seek for hope in the littlest gift to all things even in the midst of a holocaust the fragile bonds and commitment with her family was heart wrenching and fulfilling as they became her life line to survive through the bewildering atrocities of war the compassion and depth of the author's insight was breath taking and harsh at the same time this reader is still dealing with the after effects of reading this story it is awesome beautiful heart wrenching emotional draining and uplifting at the same time it is truly a gift and a warning that we need to awaken to the warfare in other countries and help these young survivors make it through to be alive to live an independent and free life away from the reality of harsh warfare this reader believes this book could become a blessing upon society if the leaders heard her views i applaud the author for listening to her father's wise wisdom and taking flight and write this memorial to him and her loved ones who were tragically sacrificed in this madness as if she wants everyone to realize no tragedy should hold anyone back from their dreams no matter what their circumstances are or were when you come to the conclusion there is a bonus an interview with the author and how she took flight to write a haunting and hopeful tale the imaginary characters as well as the real ones in the mind of the author were beyond powerful drawing the reader into her world of joy and sorrow love and hate and forgiveness the book can be locate at http www simonnovels com authors va read more http www

disappointed","80":"outstanding a must read excited to read her next book","81":"3 5 stars took forever to get into this book i really had high expectations i thought it would be riveting a real page turner it was just okay","82":"excellent story well read traumatic reading especially from a childs point of view but refreshing to hear authors talking about pol pot and the genocide that seems to be 'overlooked' far too often haunting tale of sorrow and loss but love and determination and hope well written","83":"it is hard to comprehend how vaddy ratner could write in such a poetic style about such horrors that happened to her her extended family and her country of cambodia although the events are disturbing and sometimes hard to read the book is at the same time beautiful because of the deep family devotion and the hope that exists through impossible circumstances","84":" a tragic event is never easy to chronicle more so when it has to be fictionalized so that the lines between reality and fiction are blurred so almost no one can tell what actually happened or whether the author went through what is documented or not the same is the case with the book that i finished reading last week - \"in the shadow of the banyan\" by vaddey ratner the book largely stirred me and almost made me gasp for breath in most places you will know why when you read the book and discover its power the writer's ability to weave a heartfelt and yet hopeful story \"in the shadow of the banyan\" is all about the atrocities committed by the khmer rouge regime in cambodia between 1975 and 1979 where an estimate of two million people lost their lives the book's protagonist is seven year old raami whose world and childhood is shattered the day her father brings news of the civil war's triumph on the streets of phnom penh the capital city soon the family's royal privileges are taken away they are but royalty and they have to flee their palace their home their country only to be haunted by memories and what each family member faces in that time for me the book was a heavy read but obviously given the content i had to almost keep the book aside for some time and then get back to it but more so because i was too overwhelmed to read further raami's voice is almost vaddey's voice as the author also had to run away from cambodia did not know english and yet educated herself in the united states of america and is where she is today the book is based on memory and experience and yes it is close to the author's life and yet raami's voice is not lost or diluted the book does not let you forget tragedies that took place even if it didn't happen to the author and rightly so i was just astounded by what evil lurks in men to commit the crimes that they do i was left with that thought way after i had finished reading the book ratner's writing is stark and she does not leave out anything and at the same time the description of a land torn and its people left in despair will leave the reader wanting to know more about cambodia and khmer rouge the brutality the violence and the tenderness is present in equal measure what rises above of this is that there is still hope which of course worked well for the writer and maybe for many more like her for me all i can say is that there are very few books like \"in the shadow of the banyan\" that provide the much needed comfort and hope in difficult times one can relate to it no matter what and as you close the book you feel a little more hopeful a little less angry and a little more belief in humanity through the eyes of a seven year old till she turns eleven a beautiful read be prepared though to cry a little","85":"i thought this book was beautifully written and even though the story is sad it has a beautiful ending","86":"in the shadow of the banyan is a lovely and heartbreaking read though it is based on a true story i hope the author continues to write the way she entwines stories with reality is perfect i will read anything she writes","87":"heart crushing story based on the author's own experience as a child in 1975 when cambodia is in civil war then overthrown by the khmer rouge u0026amp eventually freed by vietnam a painful heart crushing survival story eloquently written sprinkled with hope","88":" review first published on my blog http memoriesfrombooks blogspot com in the shadow of the banyan is the story of seven year old raami who is caught up in the khmer rouge regime in cambodia in the 1970s the regime of the khmer rouge has the history of genocide famine disease and destruction this book tells a very personal story of that time though a fictionalized account the book is autobiographical in its basis raami is part of the royal family of cambodia and through this time period suffers with her family she suffers hardships beyond our imagination separation from family death of family members starvation and forced labor yet she also finds moments of beauty and love throughout she fights for survival it is somewhat disconcerting to read this book the book describes such horrors yet the imagery is at the same time heart breakingly beautiful the book is narrated through raami's eyes the innocent eyes of a seven year old yet the insights and the poetic descriptions cannot be attributed to a child so young this seems to be a disconnect in the book yet for the most part it ceases to matter i am so captured by the imagery and the emotions that i willingly put that aside periodically there are moments of innocence that bring me back to the point that the narrator is seven yet mostly i remain entrenched in the story feeling the emotions and fighting for raami's survival these words from the book itself describe it well words you see allow us to make permanent what is essentially transient turn a world filled with injustice and hurt into a place that is beautiful and lyrical even if only on paper","89":"a seven year old telling the story of the khmer rouge takeover of cambodia in the 70s i knew nothing about this period of time prior to this book the author has based the story on her own experiences in cambodia at the time although it is fiction the book is not written to appease the reader with happy endings but rather to provide an accurate account of a horrible and violent time in cambodia's history","90":"it was ok pretty language i had probablems suspending disbelief that the internal world of an 8yr old sounded like the author's voice","91":" my thoughts run wild and broad yet words escape me wow one of the best books i've read in a long time as i was reading it i kept thinking only someone who has experienced it could write it i wasn't far off while it is a work of fiction the author at the end of the book describes how it is the story of her family her papa herself the storyline the writing style the poetry in motion all come together in a way so eloquently described by chris cleave author of little bee he states in the shadow of the banyan is one of the most extraordinary and beautiful acts of storytelling i have ever encountered this book pulls off the unsettling feat of being at the same time utterly heartbreaking and impossibly beautiful there are moments in this story that are among the most powerful literature this is a masterpiece that takes us to the highs and lows of what human beings can do in this life and it leaves us correspondingly both humbled and ennobled","92":"this book really gave me whole different perspective on how lucky i am to have been born here in the u s the author is about my same age so it really got me thinking about how our lives can be determined by the soil on which our seeds have landed knowing a wonderful person from cambodia it really opened my eyes to what he had probably lived through before he immigrated to the united states and earned his citizenship it is amazing what a person can live through and how they can emerge from a horrible experience and still be a positive and caring individual the human spirit is a wonderful gift","93":"so basically i'm reading genocide with a genocide chaser i recently finished running the rift which is a story of the rwanda genocide and now i'm about to immerse myself in this one which is a story of the khmer rouge about which i know next to nothing so in addition to a novel i'll be getting a history lesson many months later i finally finish the book not because it wasn't good enough to finish quickly but because lots of rl situations reared their ugly heads and i put it down and then i couldn't remember where it was and then i found it whilst cleaning the kitchen anyway i'm not sure i have much to add to the discussion of what has already been said about this book i do think the young narrator is a slightly disingenuous move on the author's part because even an extremely precocious child wouldn't have been able to retain digest process those situations and analyze them with an adult capacity but i liked that by using the young narrator whose imagination and capacity for hope are undaunted it allows the reader to take on a similar sense of hope i have a coworker who says it much better than i do","94":"i learned so much about this cambodian history that i was not aware of the writing is elegant and a joy my current favorite book definitely recommend","95":"oh the characters the plot the history just pulled me in","96":"i had a goal this quarter to read books from different parts of the world this book was from cambodia written from the perspective of a young girl it tells the tale of an aristocratic family as they suffer through 'the killing fields' of the cambodian communist revolutionary time way back in my college field linguistics course mid 80s our informant was cambodian so i got interested in the country at that time i have read a few books that tell the history of that period so i was familiar with it in broad brush strokes but even so this book moved me to tears at many times - it is still so heart rending to me that people can treat one another this way and it's doubly hard to read it from the perspective of a child you find out at the end that the author was indeed of cambodian royal blood and lived this ordeal but it is not intended as a memoir i listened to this as a bocd and was impressed by the narrator - she clearly knew how to pronounce the cambodian words and seemed to understand the culture well enough to convey appropriate moods with her voice eta jan 2015 i listened to it again and am still moved by the story i kind of wish i had a print edition so i could linger over and re read various moving or well written passages from the author's note at the end for all the loss and tragedy i have known my life has taught me that the human spirit like the lifted hands of the blind will rise above chaos and destruction as wings in flight","97":"this was an excellent book even as i felt raami's pain i knew it couldn't begin to match the pain actually endured by raami and the rest of her family the book made me sad and very angry at the cruelty inflicted by the khmer rouge","98":"this one took me so long to get into and i thought i was just going to have to give up the reader is slow which is usually a distraction for me however the subject matter is not light and the language of cambodia is best pronounced by someone else so the slowness ended up being a good thing the second half of this book is just amazing being that it's based in fact and that the author is really a princess makes it all the more compelling having experienced a great loss recently connected me to this book more than i would have expected the loss she suffered and the millions of cambodians that suffered seems to dwarf my own suffering however is a language of it's own that is shared by many my heart is heavy but it's the mark of wonderful writing and compelling story telling","99":"beautiful and tragic a coming of age tale set in revolutionary cambodia based on real events \"eight was wrong - inadequate somehow i was almost certain i'd become much older and in these past months had come to regard the reflection of the little girl i sometimes caught in the surface of the water as a kind of sprite - a phantom of guilelessness passing under my gaze before she vanished again among the ripples \" 185","100":" this is the heartbreaking story of raami a young girl growing up in phnom penh cambodia during the khmer rouge uprising daughter to a prince she and her family must keep their former lives secret if they hope to survive amidst unspeakable loss and suffering raami somehow manages to find strength in the stories and poems of her father recalling his words i told you stories to give you wings raami so that you would never be trapped by anything your name your title the limits of your body this world's suffering with beautifully poetic writing the author takes us by the hand and leads us down this dark path in history stained with the blood of so many innocent people i will not lie this book was very hard to read at times the suffering and the graphic descriptions were sometimes very overwhelming and i would have to set the book down and walk away for a while to clear my mind as if the story were not profound enough i was taken aback when i found that the events were based on the author's own life this story is so hearfelt so touching and so painfully heartrending that i needed quite a deal of quiet time to take it all in when i had finished reading the lingering effects of its pages are haunting and i'm sure will never leave me so i feel confident in saying that this is one of those very rare books that will leave you a different person after you have read it which i believe makes this a very important book if i could only convey one thing to potential readers through my review it would be this you have to read this book i have received this book for free through goodreads first reads","101":"with all the buzz this book had my expectations were very high and somehow not met it might have had something to do with having read never fall down a ya book on the same subject also with a young protagonist that i thought was excellent rough and raw plunging you right into the situation quickly and viscerally this book seemed to take a long time to get to the horror that i knew was coming which was somehow frustrating the protagonist being young doesn't tell the reader much or really anything about why the new people in charge of the country are doing what they are doing ousting people from their homes resettling them with other families transporting them to various work details also there is an extremely lyrical style to the writing and much time spent on story telling about gods and fables which i know many people loved but i liked less and less as the story went on i became impatient with what i saw as the same point being made over and over again the protagonist's father's belief that you can and must transcend the awfulness that life can bring the last quarter of the book is very engaging it's definitely well written excellent and worthy subject matter and since it's almost autobiographical the author is certainly well suited to write this story but it wasn't the story i was looking for","102":"hope in the midst of the worst of humanity a powerful story and am glad to have read it","103":" i won this book from a goodreads first reads giveaway i was expecting a fictionalized memoir that would be mostly sad and a little uplifting at the end maybe as these things usually go the books i've read like this focus on persevering through life's experiences while illustrating some of the darker sides of humanity this book was definitely better than what i expected first of all the story is about the khmer rouge revolution in cambodia 1975 1979 which i have never encountered in fiction ever second the story is told from the perspective of a seven year old at least when the revolution begins girl because of this what she thinks of her experiences may seem oversimplified at first but the more you see the world through her eyes the more you realize that these thoughts are actually very perceptive of human nature the revolution itself is portrayed realistically from the standpoint of both the social elite the main character raami is descended from royalty and the peasants raami and her family are shuffled around told their education is worthless that the organization will cure all illnesses and afflictions but who is the organization issuing these orders and proclamations raami doesn't know for a very long time her idea about what it might be a god or a leader of one of the villages is entertaining but also not surprising if i had no idea what communism was i would probably wonder the same thing based on the way the revolutionary soldiers kept talking about it the people behind the revolution were usually portrayed as naive and immature wanting everyone to be the same based on what they knew and afraid of anything else a few people loyal to the cause were genuine but corruption was rampant in every village raami and her family were taken to and it is a strong reminder why communism has failed so many times with this setting as a backdrop raami continues to think of life in relation to childhood stories and lore told either from her father her mother her nurse or from religion this gives the whole story a slight fairy tale flavor which wanes as raami matures but is always present in some capacity she is surprisingly resilient to everything that occurs during the revolution even when she blames herself for disasters or is starving and overworked overall she is a very inspirational character i also want to say that this must have been an extremely difficult story for the author to tell i realize it is a fictionalized memoir and i'm not sure how much of it parallels her own experience but i can only imagine what it would be like to live through this as a child then live through it again in the re telling i'm very glad she was able to write this i spent a lot of time with this book not only because it was a compelling story but because the perspective and writing were so well done i would definitely recommend this to anyone interested in historical fiction memoirs human nature contemporary fiction and or fiction with a little bit of magic folklore","104":"amazing book written really well some parts are hard to read makes one appreciate life even when it's a little difficult although this was fiction the story was based on the author's life am glad that she was strong enough to survive all that she went through and share it with the rest of us","105":" in 1975 when my own daughter was 7 years old the khmer rouge overthrew the government of cambodia and the life of 7 year old raami was forever changed 'in the shadow of the banyan' is an exquisitely written book about that dark time in history from 1975 1979 the country's people endured incomprehensible horror and systematic genocide 1975 is no longer the revolutionaries have declared it year zero when raami and her family are ousted from their home they begin the trek which will take them on a journey of wrenching agony and tears this first uprooting will be the first among many in which they will lose family friends and belongings each 'leaving' is a leaving of love of memories the things that tie them to their past raami has grown up in a family of privilege of royal lineage and she has this very close bond with her father who is a just caring gentle man he tells her stories and teaches her about the beauty of the natural world he tells raami that the reason he told her so many stories was to give you wings he tells her that his greatest desire is to see her live when i lie buried beneath this earth you will fly for me raami for your papa you will soar at a time when raami feels she can endure no more it is these words she remembers it is these words that give her the will to go on the story is heartbreaking and painful but the authors ability to intersperse beauty amidst the horror allows the reader to continue reading what would otherwise be unbearable it is a testament to vaddy ratner's inner strength and resilience that she has written a story that requires her to re live this period of her life so that her family's struggle as well as all those who also endured might live on she is their voice she has written a beautiful haunting novel that will not nor should be soon forgotten","106":"i loved this tells of the khmer rouge in cambodia in the 1970's and the atrocities suffered there based roughly on the author's own life i think what stood out to me most was the feeling of hope that despite the ugliness there was hope for a better future raami is young 7 at the beginning of the story but wise beyond her years and i am a sucker for good quotes and this had so many her father said you are my temple and my garden my sacred ground and in you i see all of my dreams perhaps it's natural for a father for every parent to see his child all that's unspoiled and good but if you can raami i want you to see it in yourself no matter what ugliness and destruction you may witness around you i want you always to believe that the tiniest glimpse of beauty here and there is a reflection of the gods' abode it is real raami there exists such a place a sacred space pg 72 milk mother said that stories are like footpaths of the gods they lead us back and forth across time and space and connect us to the entire universe to people and beings we never see but who we feel exist page 82 maybe it was enough that i knew i was not alone that at the very least standing here beside me was this one person who unbeknownst to me till now had all along been journeying this same journey with me only from the opposite direction 169 had i owned the words i would've told him what my heart intuited that joy and sorrow often travel the same road and sometimes whether by grace or misfortune they meet and become each other's companion pok was going to care for us as best he could teach us how to live like neak srae how not only to plant the rice but to imitate it to firmly anchor ourselves in ever up trimmed ground and at the same time sway in the direction of the wind 169 170 i couldn't explain it but i remembered all those times when death had brushed by me and i'd close my eyes or turn away i couldn't do this anymore i couldn't let those i loved face death alone from now on i told myself i would stay put be here for them and when their spirits left their bodies they woudl see that i'd been here all along to hear their last words their last breath and they would know that i had witnessed not only their deaths but more importantly their fight for life their desire to live 300 'once your papa told me there was still hope he was right always there's hope ' hope had wheels like an army truck it revved and hummed as lively as the young vietnamese soldier beaming at us from the driver's seat of his vehicle 305 a story i had learned can lead us back to ourselves to our lost innocence and in the shadow it casts over our present world we begin to understand that while all else may vanish love is our one eternity it reflects itself in joy and grief in my father's sudden knowledge that he would not live to protect me and in his determination to leave behind a part of himself his spirit his humanity to illuminate my path give light to my darkened world he carved his silhouette in the memory of the sky for me to return to again and again 310 life i believe is a circular path no matter what misery or awfulness we encounter along the way i hold out hope that one day we'll arrive at a blessed moment on the circle again 312 for all the loss and tragedy i have known my life has taught me that the human spirit like the lifted hands of the blind will rise above chaos and destruction as wings in flight 320","107":" this was one of the books i had high hope on for this year born to neak ang mechas prince of cambodia raami is a princess in every way a royal life with all its luxury awaits her until khmer rouge twists the destiny of many lives in her country raami just flew from the book and stayed with me for a long time from a life filled with priviledge and happiness her life is shattered beyond she can recognise infamous khmer rouge's tyranny leaves raami no where to go nowhere to run it leaves her family homeless her cousins and friends are all torn apart living in village working in field for 'the organization' she striken by the grief of losing her loved ones with no food and laborious work to go by the agricultural reform that was introduced by rouge's dictatorship forced everyone to work in field which resulted in famine and death in a larger scale all descriptions are short and crisp giving the reader the apt picture in a comprehensive flow still the tyranny doesn't grab all the attention in the book it is raami and her life that is marvelously done she is forced to live in a countryside along many other villagers and her father is sent away for re education like hitler's concentration camps 're education' 'reorganization' also strikes a chord raami's innocence has been marvelously portrayed through various incidents like raami inability understand why all of a sudden her cousins are disappearing why her loving father is unable to live with her and for all this she considers herself to be the reason genocide has been been hauntingly portrayed the loveliness of cambodian myths are amazingly written love and affection becomes raami's lifeline through all these distressing period the family is kind to everything around even at the face of cruelty ratner's language is simple and elegant the pages just fly as the reading pace sprintes this is one of the best books released this year its a heart aching tale of girl whose innocence and childhood is snatched away and she is forced to grow up quickly making adult like decisions i would recommend this book to everyone","108":"the good stuff heartbreaking this story will haunt you long after you have read it the prose is so exquisite and beautifully written such talent for first time author it is hard for me to express how spectacular this book is everything i want to say sounds trite when compared to the beauty of the authors words and the horror she lived through raami is such a strong girl one to be admired for her strength of character and her ability to transcend the horrific tragedy she lived through and to still find beauty in her world as the author says in her own words she wants the world to see how beautiful cambodia was before the genocide u0026amp which while reading you come to understand what was lost during the killing fields shows the will that we have to live no matter the circumstance the writing really comes across of that of a young girl so authentic and haunting such joy love and hope in such a tragic situation gives a balance to the acts of brutal violence by the khymer rouge shows that the world is full of both good and evil author mentions on quite a few occasions the power of stories to escape and to give hope wonderfully explained on pg 134 of the arc the not so good stuff it is a tough read for someone as sensitive as myself reading of the brutality and inhumanity of man sickens me and i cannot even comprehend how or why someone could commit such horrific crimes against their fellow man especially to innocent children pages 125 127 arc were brutal for me to read being a motherfavorite quotes passages but looking at the murals i had the feeling the tales had followed us here moving along with us on our journey manifesting themselves in all sorts of ways knowing comes from learning finding from seeking it was clear what the message meant if i looked hard enough if i sought i would find what i was looking for i'm certain though he remained resolute in his belief that even without him you would live through this nightmare that life with all its cruelty and horror was still worth living a gift he would've wanted his daughter to embrace bury me and i'll thrive as countless insectsi bend neither to your weapon nor willeven as you trample

so get it now people4 75 dewey'si received this from simon and schuster in exchange for an honest review thanks for once again forcing me out of my comfortable reading zone","109":"a story of horror and terror told beautifully despite the violence and death the narration is lyrical and spiritual the brutality of the khmer rouge is described and felt as is the spirit of this one girl and her mother who survive when so many others of their family do not it is a deeply felt book well written and worth every word","110":"this book is as beautiful as it is heartbreaking the author does a nice job of describing the land history and beliefs of the cambodian people while portraying the destruction of the khmer rouge on these same elements the systematic destruction of families is just appalling","111":"for seven year old raami the end of childhood begins with her father returning home in the early hours bringing details of the civil war that has overwhelmed the streets of phnom penh cambodia's capital soon the family's world is swept up in the chaos of revolution and forced exodus over the next four years as the khmer rouge strips the population of identity raami clings to

when bad things happen to kids thanks for the book again i'm sure my friends will like the book too more","113":"one of the most powerful books i've read in a long time a heartbreaking yet beautiful story at the same time","114":"it was especially to read this account of life and death and hope in the killing fields of cambodia since we were there just a year ago very touching and thought provoking","115":" i really liked this book it is a little more than historical fiction in that the author reveals in the end that it is based on her own story an ode to her father it tells what happened to the people of cambodia in the 1970's when the khmer rouge took control of the country there are terrifically sad horrid moments which were not unexpected if you know what happened during that time perhaps a personal account of the the killing fields a movie that covers the same shocking actions that destroyed a nation read this","116":"this is one of my all time favorites it is informative and magnificently written it will stay with you for a long long time","117":"beautifully written but a little too heavy on the flowery language and light on the event details it made it a little slow warning this book is not a light summer read have lots of tissue on hand i even had to skip a few pages they were so sad it is an amazing story based on the author's real life experience","118":" my knowledge of cambodian history and the role of the khmer rouge is rather limited based on viewing the excellent but harrowing film the killing fields when i was 20 i relish the opportunity to discover the history and culture of other countries through fiction and in the shadow of the banyan has the added kudos of having an author who experienced these desperate times first hand the author allows us to view the horrors of civil war up close but filters the more gruesome aspects by using a very young narrator the seven year old raami who has been swept from a life of privilege in an aristocratic family to the grass roots of a peasant existence the language is so elegant and beautiful very lyrical at times allowing the reader to see the beauty and grace of the humans at the centre of this dreadful war ironically it is the exquisite nature of the prose which causes this to be a good but not great read for me as i just can't get past the fact that the narrator is only 7 years old yet capable of such eloquence maybe it's because i have young children myself but it seems incongruous for such a young child to express herself in such a consistently lyrical manner having said that it is an extremely moving read and a very good introduction to the troubled history of a country which in my opinion has been rather overlooked by the world of literature","119":"this is a story set in cambodia during the take over by the khmer rouge from 1975 1979 it's about a girl and her family they were royalty and the changes that happened to them during the revolution it's a story about a families love for one another and a story about how strong the human will to live is this story was good but it was very depressing it's hard to imagine the horrendous strife that those people went through i don't regret reading the book because i feel it is important to read about history","120":"i loved this book and story vaddey ratner based the story on her life it was fascinating","121":"a novel based in the 1970s khmer rouge cambodia focusses it's attention on the atrocities that take place unfortunately i found it to be a really slow read forcing myself to finish the novel","122":" this book deserves five stars but i gave it four only because it took me while to figure out what was going on mostly because the author frequently uses cambodian and buddhist language and expressions along with symbolic poetry that was difficult for me to understand the narrator is a brave seven year old girl who suffered the after effects of polio with a limp her very loving family was educated royalty when the brutal khmer rouge took over cambodia so they needed to cover up their background and lie about it she was especially close to her father who was taken from her by the organization communist soldiers when it was discovered he was from the privileged she mourns for him and feels such a horrible loss it is fiction based on the author's experience as a child the families were split up many killed forced to work long hours in very severe circumstances with little food and no medical care raami loses her innocence very quickly by so much being expected of her it is very sad and yet shows the determination of the human beings to live through and overcome evil sorrow illness loss of loved ones and starvation one reviewer on amazon thought this should be required reading along with holocaust literature if we don't teach history it will repeat itself","123":"the heart of this novel is the relationship between a young girl and her father the author hassprinkled some beautiful poetry and luminous imagery but mostly its about the killing fields","124":"ratner tells a horrifying story of her family's plight when the kymer rouge force her family out of their home in 1975 but she tells the story in such a personal way using the poetry of her father and the folktales he told her as a child","125":"a beautifully written story about cambodia during and after the invasion of the khmer rouge the main character is a child of great intelligence wisdom and strength during a time of terror and human rights violations","126":"this was extremely well written beautiful use of language i wish i had taken the time to read it in larger chunks of time rather than a bit here and a bit there so that i could have better felt the flow of the overall story i really appreciated how the author communicated the horror of the circumstances of this era in cambodian history without being horrifyingly graphic in her descriptions it really was beautifully done","127":"a beautifully written novel that is so tense sometimes violent and very sad which somehow leaves you with a feeling of hope and optimism the narrator is a seven year old princess from cambodia who recounts her being forced to flee her home with her family when the khmer rouge came to power as we learn ultimately the story is roughly based on the author's own life for me this was another novel that was incredibly difficult to read despite its obvious quality much less enjoy","128":"wonderfully well told poetic drawing the reader beautifully into the depth of love loss pain survival and ultimate triumph","129":"although this book was very slow at times i would say it was good i gave it three stars because it was hard to believe it was written by the voice of a young girl there are a lot of themes that take place in this book and i think it would be great for a book club","130":" this book was beautifully written tragic and heartbreaking i liked the interweaving of historical and biographical it seems truths with fiction that being said it also made me realize that i'm not really a fan of books written from the perspective of a child for some reason they seem forced to me in some cases this manifests itself in the use of more simplistic language in this book the author was clearly trying to make the reader feel the magicalness of childhood by telling the story in such a descriptive way i can recognize that but i still couldn't get into it so while it was a moving story i wasn't as head over heels for the book as i thought i would be it does make me want to read more about cambodian history though","131":"this is an amazing book based on a true story intense","132":"this book took my breath away when you were 7 imagine being forced from your home at gunpoint only to be sent to work camps by revolutionary soldiers that's what happens to the little girl a member of the royal family in cambodia she gets split up from family members endures starvation and sees so much death yet retains her identity and sense of hope i didn't know much about the khmer rouge and the killing fields before reading this book now my heart breaks for the millions killed and those who managed to survive a fantastic book and it's based on the author's experiences","133":"details of the take over of the khmer rouge in cambodia from a younggirl's perspective my own rating was really a 5 as it's an engrossingread lynnette","134":"this book is exquisite it is like reading poetry i love the imagery and it reminded me to be grateful for my life and for love i feel like i have been given a gift i am very thankful to have won this book in a goodreads giveaway","135":"a beautiful story truly beautifully written","136":"a novel which is clearly autobiographical a child's story of the horrors of war and the loss of a way of life very movingly written through the eyes and ears of an innocent seven year old","137":" raami is seven in 1975 when the khmer rouge forces everyone to leave the cities of cambodia raami along with the hundreds of thousands forced from the cities are put into work camps in peasant villages all over cambodia with people dying all around her from starvation or from be suspected of being against the organization raami struggles to survive and stay with what is left of her family this was pretty amazing it was hard to read but beautifully done vaddey hatner chose to write a novel rather than a memoir because she was 5 years old in 1975 she wanted to have the freedom to tell the story but everything that happened to raami happened to vaddey my knowledge of the khmer rouge and what happened in cambodia was very limited i knew about pol pot and that millions of cambodians died and that was about it the problem with history in high school is that no one every gets past the 60s and the vietnam war as we get further and further away from the 60s we're missing out on learning about a growing chunk of history after i'd read the first chapter of in the shadow of the banyan i had to stop and go do a bit of background research so i would have a little foundation for understanding it was just so heartbreaking especially seen through a child's eyes raami and her family have only know love and plenty war has been going on for some time and just when the family thinks it's over the khmer rouge invade the city forcing everyone out by saying that the americans were going to bomb this was not true the khmer rouge believed everything western most be done away with this included most technology they believed that the peasants were the true cambodians and wanted all cambodians to live this life the soldiers were young and confused and incredibly disorganized there was so little planning families were split up and people were routinely taken away and killed raami's family as part of the royal family was constantly in danger people like them along with intellectuals and religious figures were killed raami constantly struggles to make sense of what's happening around her but of course there's no sense to make finally all she can do is focus on surviving because of terrible planning on the part of the khmer rouge most of the rice crops people were being forced to work were ruined by flooding and mass starvation spreads raami dreams of the day that she will be able to fly away but steadily loses hope that will ever happen the language was so beautiful it almost made it harder to read reading such a beautiful written story about something so horrible and senseless specific scenes stand out in my mind raami eating anything she can chew including insects and raw rice another child ordering a solider to kill someone the execution of someone who was once in charge it will make you sad but you should read this so this terrible thing that really happened will not be forgotten in the shadow of the banyan comes out august 7 2012","138":"this was a sad historical novel the voice was that of a seven year old girl the author didn't really sound like a seven year old girl the girl in this novel spoke like an adult this novel was in a lovely the beginning is slow and there isn't much action or suspense overall it was a good book and a pretty easy read get the tissues ready though","139":"i learned a lot about a war i never knew happened it made me sad to know these people were treated this way","140":"sad and lyrical excellent read for anyone traveling to cambodia to learn about the civil war through the eyes of a child","141":"words that come to mind when you say cambodia and the late 1960's into the 1970's include phnom penh secret bombings by the usa prince norodom sihanouk vietnam pol pot khmer rouge and the killing fields it was the dreaded khmer rouge that we heard had forcibly blasted cambodia back into a primitive rural society in the shadow of the banyan opens from the perspective of seven year old raami and provides us with a glimpse into the split up of her family and her life under the khmer rouge regime from 1975 until 1979 raami is the child of a noble family and the telling of her story sometimes seems like a retrospective account from an adult's viewpoint the book is not written as a memoir but as a fictionalized account that is beautifully illustrated with mythical legends poems and a story to illustrate the endurance of a child to survive horrendous living conditions the brutality of the khmer rouge and the roughly two million lives lost under their rule during the mid to late 1970's reminds us of the genocide of the german nazi holocaust each survivor's story is unique in the way that they decide to tell us about their experience i liked raami's story as she transitions from the daydreaming world of a seven year old to the realities that are forced on her for basic survival yet she still retains her dreams that are necessary for her survival","142":"read kara's review she has written all the things i would want to say about this book it is hard to read but life is hard u0026amp literature must challenge us at times u0026amp present us with life u0026amp humanity as it really is the writing is so beautiful u0026amp poetic that this story is a must","143":"this story was heartbreaking and captivating i read it in one day the only thing that bothered me was the voice that it was told from the pov of a 7 year old using such sophisticated imagery and language occasionally jarred me","144":" it is utterly heartbreaking and impossibly beautiful at the same time such exquisite storytelling about such horrific circumstances and evil and is able to remain hopeful you walk through this book holding the hand of the young narrator who manages to find the wings her father created for her out of stories poetry and spoken pictures it is those words those wings that help her to rise above the horror senseless evil and pain to survive survive and honor those who where lost to the killing fields","145":"great read for a closer look into the day to day life of a little girl during the horrible genocide in cambodia although it is a novel the story is based closely to the author's life","146":" not many high school students look forward to being forced to read certain texts however in the shadow of the banyan by vaddey ratner should be required reading done as a class the novel is written in the point of view of a crippled child named raami who tells her story of her sufferings during the khmer rouge reign revolutionary soldiers forced her and her family out of their own home and constantly moved them to different locations however one by one the people she cares about pass away because of the organization's far fetched ideals strict rules and irrational punishments while she tries to cling onto her past and her father's literature as much as she can she is shown reality and taught how to survive it through stories philosophy and morals there is so much philosophy hidden between all the details thus making this novel a perfect candidate for required class reading there is so much to learn from this novel for example raami's mother explains to her daughter that \"love was your reality and you should never have to...search for it in words such as those uttered by my father -...they didn't tell me how much he loved my mother or how much he loved us children love should be plain and clear it should exist in the everyday things you touch and see \" 222 to explain to her that she is not feeling angry i never knew that about affection love has always been thought of as an important emotion and is mainly for families and lovers raami's mother's words gave me a new perspective on the emotion and i can see how love would be everywhere when you order something and you eat or drink all of it that means you love the food when you buy a dress that fits you that means you love the dress another example is \"we are all echoes of one another...\" 178 this sounds like a buddhist belief because it seems like it involves reincarnation but if thought differently it means everyone's personality is formed by their interactions with others we all are influenced somehow by each the philosophies present make in depth analyzation a requirement to comprehend the meaning of the story i loved reading this book not only because i am cambodian but also because of the way the story is told raami uses a lot of metaphors to describe events and her surroundings the subtext of them shows naivety which reminds the reader that the narrator is a child from time to time because the language is very mature for a young girl her age i also find the philosophies to add beauty to the stories they are all somehow intertwined with the events surrounding raami that it stirs a lot of emotions in you especially if you are cambodian additionally this book has brought me closer to my father since he escaped from cambodia just before the khmer rouge took over","147":" this is an incredible book it's fiction but it's based on the author's own experiences as a child during the khmer rouge regime in cambodia from 1975 1979 it tells about the systematic violence and complete destruction of a society that resulted from the communist revolution it's a story of horror and atrocities but it's also a tribute to the strength of love and the human spirit the narrative voice is probably too mature for a 7 year old girl but the writing is so beautiful and lyrical that it doesn't matter it's a tough read but i learned so much from this book","148":"hard to read what is good about war and genocide the khmer rouge in cambodia in the 70's was ugly","149":"not as good as i thought it would be expected more history into the fall of cambodia","150":" a haunting story brimming with emotion heartbreak and the strength of the human spirit it is an incredible insight into a time period hardly spoken about in american literature and the insight is brutal honest and raw the prose is vibrant beautiful and alive flowing effortlessly from one event to the next we are present with raami through every challenge every small triumph every torment there are times when it becomes very abstract as the mind of a child often can be but even then the reader stays emotionally in the moment a pleasure to read","151":"phnom penh 1975 seven year old raami was a little princess a distant member of the large cambodian royal family leading a privileged life but when the khmer rouge took over she and her family were driven from phnom penh to the countryside just like all those thousands of other cambodians to work in the rice fields and dig irrigation canals many of her fellow cambodians wouldn't make it but raami somehow held on to the ancient stories that her father had told her giving her hope and the strength to survive as the author was only five when she went through more or less what raami is telling us in the shadow of the banyan is a fictionalised autobiography that combines her own vague memories with what she now knows must have happened during those years at times raami's observations seem too wise for a seven year old and this renders the story a bit unrealistic however this is a compelling narrative tackling one of history's worst tragedies and the writing is not bad at all for a debut novel on such a difficult topic please keep writing vaddey ratner you're doing just fine","152":"one of the most beautiful and touching books i have ever read it will break your heart i didn't know many details of what went on in cambodia","153":" in the shadow of the banyan is a heart wrenching story of just one family torn apart by the khmer rouge in cambodia during the 1970s their story is told through raami 7 years old when the family is ousted from their home in phnom penh this is a book that will stay with you the story of what happened in cambodia during the pol pot regime is shocking and heart breaking vaddey ratner in an afterword says that raami's story is essentially her own and that she chose to fictionalise her story because her 'purpose was to honour the lives lost and was endeavouring to turn suffering into art ' she has succeeded this is a beautiful and graceful book","154":" this novel chronicling the downfall of wealthy monarchist landowners vividly displays the inability of the capitalist ruling class to perform the work they have so long depended on indentured laborers to perform when faced with the realities of the horrors they have so long inflicted upon the peasant class the author's family breaks down although beautifully written and pleasant to read the author apparently overlooks the irony of her eventual triumph marked by the subjugation of those she depended upon in her hour of greatest need","155":"her writing is poetic and rich it's a tough read yet not depressing i love how she wove in cambodian folk tales","156":"this book was phenomenal i picked it up in an airport and i couldn't put it down i love historical fiction and this was so well written i think i actually read every word i'm a big skimmer unless something is either so compelling or so artfully written that something would be lost by not digesting every word really just an incredible read about family and how tragedy is experienced from different angles in the midst of total chaos and disaster","157":" this work is proof that even the deepest and darkest recesses of our inhumanity cannot break the spirit of life or the bonds of family love when all else seems lost hope continues to flicker only to burn brightly once released my notion of cambodia prior to reading this was of fatalistic tragedy wrought upon it by the ruthless khmer rouges and a legacy the country still struggles with almost 40 years later but in the shadow of the banyan revealed more than the brutal mindless suffering most of us cannot possibly imagine it speaks of an unquantifiable sorrow at all that was lost beauty pride cultural and intellectual capital on a mind boggling scale when everything that was good suddenly vanishes all that is left is those near and dear one's family they become the only reason for survival vaddey ratner's courageous and heartbreaking journey across an ethnic holocaust is so riveting that i find it impossible to abandon belief in the ultimate goodness of mankind no matter how evil certain manifestations in time appear to be","158":"i knew very little about the khmer rouge this book through the eyes of a child was a poetic and mild way to read about the horror of the killing fields one of the communist goal was to divide and tear apart families this story tells about the lovely bond between a daughter and father and then surviving mother all very interesting and well written","159":"really compelling story really maudlin flowery writing also do not read in public places unless you don't mind crying in front of strangers","160":"i have had a hard time reading novels lately but this is the book to pull me out of my slump it's a beautifully written compelling and heartbreaking story of war disruption relocation and loss told through the eyes of a child ostensibly fiction but in the end the author tells us this is really her story as she remembers it making the book that much more remarkable i knew very little about cambodia when i picked up this novel and now i want to know more i highly recommend this book but do be prepared to be torn up inside as you read","161":"great writing poetic and beautiful and very educational forthose who don't know about cambodian history culture my only criticism is unlike some critics i did find the point of viewof the seven year old a bit too sophisticated and it took me outof the story at times","162":"'in the shadow of the banyan' is the story of a girl growing up in cambodia during the period when the khmer rouge took over seven year old raami and her family flee their home and try to disguise the fact that they are royalty by acting and living like peasants hunger sickness guilt fear of being found out and loss of loved ones plague them as they try to survive this book had some beautiful writing and i'm glad the author told the story of a horrible and lessor know part of history the story however didn't move me quite as much as i feel it should have i never felt much connection to the characters i would have liked to be drawn into the story more the first three quarters of the book were very slow and introspective i am glad i read the book though and thank the author for sharing her experience","163":"this is the first book to bring me to tears in a long time vaddey ratner uses her amazing talent to transform the horrors of the cambodian war into an exquisitely written and loving tribute to her father and mother a beautiful testament to the power of story telling a must read for everyone","164":"through conversations with his elderly grandmother a young boy learns the details behind an explosion that rocked his home town years earlier","165":"i couldn't put this book down it was moving and inspirational","166":"this book is absolutely beautiful vaddey ratner is truely an artist every line of this masterpiece is poetry and she captures the world through her own 7 9 year old eyes magically i didnt expect to enjoy a book that is based on true accounts of this cambodian tragedy but it is not the subject of this book that only makes it so interesting i have learnt so much form this book as well vaddey ratner could write about a tooth brush in a 7 eleven and i know i'd love it just as much","167":"this is a historical novel it is a work of fiction but closely related to the author's real life story of surviving the brutal khmer rouge in cambodia the story is gripping and poignant i hope that vaddy will continue to write semi biographical novels to tell us more about her life before the takeover and her life since the liberation of her country","168":"3 1 2 stars a very good book i learned a lot i don't recall ever learning about the war in cambodia in the 1970s but also a very emotional sad book i need something lighter to read now","169":" wow this book is based on the true life of the author it takes place in cambodia and shares the horrendous events of the takeover by the khem rouge but also the hope an survival of her as a child she is removed from royalty and forced to work as a peasant and basically tortured with hunger and long hard hours of work she has a strong will and faces many hardships of her family and others they befriend during the period the book is infused with poetic prose as her father was a writer and poet a gift which is despised by the new rulers sad and yet hopeful at the same time i just had to keep reading to see what happened to her and her family there are questions author's notes and additional information including websites following the story it is classified fiction but includes a great deal of her own life i definitely recommend reading it","170":" i cried five times while reading this book very rare for a story to engulf me in tears in essence this is a book about silence i could ironically hear it throughout the book except in the end when a happy ending occurred in the shadow of the banyan is no thrilling tale but it is one that in many parts of the story succeeds in reminding us of our humanity that someone in the past has given us wings and the ones we have at present will teach us how to fly that is one of the many lessons one can sense while reading this i highly recommend this to anyone who wants to delve in cambodian 20th century history it doesn't tell scholarly details but it does give us lessons nonetheless","171":"this was beautifully written but a bit slow","172":"beautifully written conveying the harsh crimes committed to push into place an idealistic society that doesn't work this book helped me learn a little more as to what was going on in that area a good book to read and again beautifully written","173":"breathtakingly heartbreaking and beautifully poignant one of the best books i've read in a while","174":"the authors story of the horrific times in cambodia in the 70's during the khmer rogue","175":"books about the ravages of war all have a similarity an awful similarity this book was extra poignant because it was written through the perspective of a child whose world was totally shattered by the khmer rouge in cambodia and this child grew up to become the author of this heartbreaking story","176":"have a box of kleenex handy powerful but gut wrenching","177":"this was by no means a happy book it is about the khmer rouge regime in cambodia between 1975 and 1979 the story is told my a 7 year old girl so it was differnt to see what was happening through the eyes of a child it is based on the life of the author and is so well written","178":" another tragic era that goes relatively under history's radar this deeply personal although fictionalized account opened my eyes to the terror these people lived in the killing fields so often revolution is started by lofty even idealistic goals and steamrolled by the sadistic how this child maintained her sanity as well as her humanity and survived no thrived to tell the tale is a tribute to the strength of her ability to cling to the magic of her fathers legacy the afterword was as powerful as the novel","179":"this is a beautifully written novel based on the author's life as a child in cambodia it begins as the khmer rouge take over the country and turn it into the killing fields from 1975 1979 the author's lyrical style is in sharp contrast to the horrors that are a part of each day as families struggle to survive as well as stay together a definite must read","180":"made me cry but it was a good cry loved the language of the book","181":"interesting story but painfully boring book","182":"a poignant story based on the author and her family's personal experiences during the years of the khmer rouge at the time she was a young girl reads like a memoir","183":"powerful moving educational such a great book","184":"i think reading up via internet on cambodia 1975 was very helpful in understanding this book i needed a little background since i didn't remember what was happening there after the vietnam war does killing fields ring some memory bells","185":"$28 99 when the world as we know it shifts beneath our feet and nothing is

powerful than the nazis' hatred and cruelty wiesel chose to tell his story in a memoir tthere are other authors though who prefer to write novels fiction for them contains a kernel or two of truth national book award winner and native mississippian jesmyn ward experienced the mighty wrath of a storm called katrina in august 2005 when the family home flooded in de lisle ward and her family fled by car to a local church they never made it and were instead stranded in a field ward and her family decided to just stay put in their vehicle their presence soon became known to the owners of the property claiming overcrowding the white property owners told the wards who are black to leave but another white family offered them shelter down the road ward saw what katrina did to her hometown and to its people her novel salvage the bones is testament to the fortitude and hope in all of us but especially in times of great struggle in her storytelling perhaps ward was able to unleash her vitriol and bitterness and find healing twords and stories not only have healing effects but they also carry magical properties this is something author vaddey ratner knows all too well when ratner was five the khmer rouge came to power in cambodia in 1975 like other cambodians she and her family were forced to flee their homes and endure years of hardship and brutality unlike other cambodians though ratner's family were royalty therefore they were often made examples of by the communists tin 1981 ratner and her mother arrived as refugees in the united states she knew not one word of english but went on to graduate summa cum laude from cornell years later she ached to tell her story t i didn't want just to translate my family's experience a cambodian experience to a foreign audience she explains i wanted to take the readers and replant them in the fertile ground i'd sprung from to let them take root and sprout and to see my world as their own ratner wanted readers to see the cambodia of her childhood before it became synonymous with genocide before it became the 'killing fields ' she remembers the country of her birth with sad longing it was once a place of exquisite beauty... tin her debut novel in the shadow of the banyan fiction eerily mirrors ratner's reality as she tells the visceral and achingly heartbreaking story of 7 year old raami a member of the royal family and a child who should never have had to see the things she witnessed raami's story is loosely based on ratner's life tlike ratner raami holds on to her innocence as only a very young child can raami transports herself away from the ugliness and violence around her by turning inward for a time she does not speak she is in a world of her own making ratner employs magical realism and this literary device works well when one is telling a story from the point of view of a 7 year old especially one who has seen such horror twhen raami's father the light of her life disappears she grieves for him in cambodian culture absence is worse than death in all likelihood the khmer rouge did indeed kill her father the tiger prince almost immediately his absence sends raami reeling ther only solace is in words particularly in the stories her father used to tell her when the sky is dark when all around us is black and hopeless the moon is our only light he told her i should like to go to the moon he said traami's father told her stories so she could fly i told you stories to give you wings raami so that you would never be trapped by anything--your name your title the limits of your body her polio this world's suffering he explains for raami there is magic in words they have healing properties that enable her to endure the suffering that the khmer rouge inflicted upon her and her family words and stories were a way to escape the bonds of this earth and float away far above the blood red rivers of cambodia tin the shadow of the banyan shows the ultimate triumph of the human spirit a stunning feat in such a dark story despite its bleak subject matter hope wins out in the end humanity and the humaneness of man survive the beauty of this novel contrasts with the brutality of the khmer rouge tratner turns the lush green landscape of cambodia into a character in this story oh if the country could only talk ratner locates readers in the loveliness of the natural world and immerses them in the rhythm of a people's thoughts and sentiments in its literature and art only when we know what existed ratner writes can we truly mourn what is lost twords stories and storytelling are very powerful they have a fundamental influence over us all like raami ratner saw and understood the world through stories ratner remembers in cambodia under the khmer rouge when i was lost in a forest or abandoned by my work unit among the vast rice fields because i moved too slowly i would recall the legends my father or nanny had told me or those tales i'd een able to read myself she invoked them like incantations chanting aloud descriptions and dialogues she memorized the stories made her fear disappear stories ratner recounts were magic spells she used words and stories to transform and transport herself tmay we always keep stories alive for us and for every generation that follows stories should never die","186":"this turned out to be a wonderful read about half way through this book i got what it was about this isn't a story about the khmer rouge it' a story about the relationship between a mother and young daughter faced with terrible unimaginable atrocities at it's core it's about a young girl whose story drew me in and gripped me until the end i couldn't put this book down a","187":"oh my god my emotions are a mess right now there were so many times when i needed to stop for sanity's sake but just couldn't i read it before going to bed and tossed and turned for hours because i was still haunted by what i read i finished it and just stared at the last page for a long time processing in a way i rarely ever have to process the stories and the myths were beautiful and ratner really knows how to set a scene her imagery both good and bad and ability to bring the setting to life make this book leap off the page her characters are powerful and well written and knowing they're based on real people packs that much more of a punch i loved how she portrayed a child learning a way of life far removed from hers and didn't do it in a resentful way until it became horrific slave labour this is a book that shows the breaking of the spirit in bleak uncompromising ways it shows the struggle to not break as well but doesn't try and sugar coat the struggle to keep true to yourself it explores grief in all its messy terrible and unfair ways it was a book where you knew what was going to happen and the mounting dread got larger and larger every new page but it made it no less horrifying when it came this isn't a book that leaves you with a good opinion of humanity this is a book that will leave you hating people as species because we do such terrible things i was disgusted and wept at the unfairness of it all it was wrong especially because the plan was so stupid it literally made no sense and it's so obviously that millions of people died forced to do a job that was never going to work in the first place the only thing that lets you end this book without hating the human race is the small moments of the kindness of people it's not much something so small that you wouldn't notice it in any other circumstance but it's the saving grace that the reader needs just like the characters in the book it's like fresh air in the smoke and it's one of the few points in this book where you can feel even a glimmer of hope i just","188":"when i was in high school we had a foster child who lived with us for one yeat she was from cambodia and had lived through terrible tragedies i was a self centered teenager with a verh small world view maybe had i read this book i could have been more understanding of hef difficulties","189":"i just couldn't get into this book and it was a struggle to finish","190":"i really liked this book it was written very beautifully even though it's such an ugly subject it's almost like reading a poem she's very descriptive","191":"this book was a tough one to read even though i expected it to be full of tragedy and sadness more and more we see historical fiction books that are based on true experiences of the author many people have suffered in the world at the hands of corrupt government and in this case revolutionaries it is disturbing in this day and age there are areas of the world still experiencing such inhumanity a poignant story told from a child's perspective","192":" for this to be written by a first time author this book was amazing this book is beautifully written even though its a tragedy the author does an amazing job with showing the beauty of cambodia before all the bad came with the main character being a child you can really relate with her and feel for her because throughout the book you seeing the plots through her eyes there is a lot of brutality in the book that at times it took a lot for me to continue reading but in my opinion thats what makes the book good if a fiction book can make me feel than its a good read the first part of the book is slow but thats only because we are meant to focus on the beauty of cambodia in the end this book was an amazing read and the imagery from the book is enough to stay with you","193":"a beautiful telling of a horrific event of history","194":" i really looked forward to this book because i have never read a detailed account of the effect on families of the khmer rouge revolution and atrocities in cambodia however i just couldn't get into this book it is just too dreamy and ethereal for such a terrible time i also had trouble relating to the story as told by a young girl the author does a good job of telling the tale through the eyes and ears of a preteen girl but in doing so it lacks the depth of understanding and reaction that an adult would have it just didn't work for me it did not seem real","195":"actually a 4 5 beautifully written brutal @ times it actually brought a tear or 2 to my eyes hard to put down highly recommend","196":"a very interesting account of the cambodian genocide political overthrow of the 1970's i'd never heard about it but it was interesting to read about the trials these people faced through the eyes of a seven year old and seeing her coming of age albeit in a very nightmarish way you find this was a fictional portrayal of what the author went through as a child","197":" i could not put this book down i didn't realize until i got to the back cover that while not technically a memoir this was a story of the author's experience during the khmar rouge regime in cambodia in the 1970s i sometimes hesitate to recommend books with very heavy subject matter to friends but this was not a book that was painful to read perhaps because she chose the first person perspective of a small child and chose not to use graphic detail in scenes of violence the book's true message of hope and the goodness people are capable of is not overshadowed by the evil an amazing story of the selfless love of parents for their children and what we are truly capable of surviving","198":"well written and beautiful story i really enjoyed this book","199":"loved loved loved this book","200":" heartbreaking and poetic tale of cambodia under the khmer rouge the reader gains a sense of a profoundly layered culture where ancient mythology history and contemporary life coexist in a suspended tension as sad as this story is it has so many redeeming qualities to make it bearable descriptions of the natural worlds of insects flower gardens and rice terraces are well done raw cruelty in human nature is balanced by the strength and resiliency of family love and sacrifice a deep and rewarding read","201":"very slow moving i wanted to like this book more than i did","202":" a true treasure i received this book as a goodreads' first reader giveaway it is a work of historical fiction loosely based on the life of the author and her family during the 1970's revolution in cambodia known as the killing fields it is a story of resilience survival and hope the story of a country torn apart by political upheaval and takeover and during the short years it lasted the story of the systematic torture starvation and death of over a million people this is most of all a simply beautiful piece of literature amidst the horror of the actual story are words that delight and speak of magical things that although they cannot be seen exist in the mind and the imagination and offer one young girl an escape highest recommendations for this truly magnificent work","203":"some beautiful writing is marred by a narrator who speaks much much much wiser than her years","204":"this is a beautiful moving story base on the life of the author it is a testament to the courage of the human spirit","205":"3 5 stars really liked this historical fiction novel about genocide in cambodia i previously had not read anything based on this time period and unfortunate history and this book has piqued my interest ratner's prose was almost poetic in many places which made it all the more poignant","206":" amazing book this book was based off the events that took place back in the seventies in combodia when khmer rouge came into power this book is based off the arthurs own story i thought this book was very touching i had to read a little at time because it would get me to crying the story is told from seven eight year old raami who was world was turn upside from said events but she manages to cling onto memories and childhood stories that she learned from her parents and other family members to help her not get over but more cope with the loss that she suffers highly recommend this","207":" this is a beautiful written and very sad almost true story about a young child during the rule of the khmer rouge in cambodia raami and her family and everyone else are removed from phnom penh to be resocialized as workers in the rice field the soldiers ask seven year old raami for her fathers real name and when they discover that he is part of the royal family he is taken away after that survival is very difficult as each family member works very long hours for the commune and is given very little food starvation illness and depression plague them no one can be trusted the book is almost an ode to raami's beloved father his words and stories live within and sustain her although she is just a young child her recollections are filtered through adult perceptions we read an adult's memory and thoughts not a child's while this is the story of the authors childhood it was written as fiction rather than as memoir because she was so young that memory might not be accurate and she collapsed and simplified many details about facts and events her mother often helped her remember where and when but it is her father's love of words and stories that ring through this book forty years later i waited a long time to read this book because i expected one of my book groups to select it none did those members are losers while it is painful to read this book it gives us a piece of difficult history and should make us more aware of how privileged our young lives have been why is it that the books that affect us the most and have real discussion value are sad and depressing 4","208":" the khmer rouge pol pot disaster is hard to fathom the killing fields gives you one view this book gives you a more personal one with a telling of cambodian culture and the physical beauty of the country in the shadow of the banyan is a fictionalized account of the author's experiences as a young girl from a close knit privileged royal family you experience the horror holding her hand her father was a well known writer and poet and prince who gave his daughter the gift of story and of buddhist teachings to sustain her don't miss the afterword where the author talks of her life she has a clear memory as a 4 year old of being out with her father and seeing a beggar she wants to give him something so her father helps her buy a packet of rice and then instructs her to take off her shoes as she approaches the blind beggar as if she were approaching a buddhist shrine","209":" a friend loaned me this book after reading it i think i might have to purchase my own copy since the writing is so exquisite i want to be able to mark it keep it and refer to it i wonder if she is such a lyrical writer because english was not her native language whatever the reason this is one of the few books i have ever read where i would pause and savor the writing as a writer and not just as a reader i also did research on ratner after finishing the book because i wanted more incredible","210":"very vivid transported me out of my daily life she and others who survived that background deserve the best of all lives","211":"it's a good book i had no idea really of the history of the area and want sure what fully to expect the historical fiction sorry line is captivating it carries you through the imagery is a bit much for me i wish it had a glossary of some of the words","212":"keep reading it was more than halfway through before i loved it but i did loved it very good book","213":"it's hard to read a book when you know the ending is going to be tragic the first chapter was overly sweet but it was a set up for the bitterness of the novel this book has some really beautiful prose to keep the readers engaged with its characters and their demise as well as their hope","214":"a heart wrenching autobiographical novel of a young cambodian girl's survival of the genocide of the khmer rouge regime the terror and atrocity of war are somehow muted when seen through a child's innocent eyes but have all the more impact for that reason","215":"touching story of a young girl's struggle to survive the khmer rouge cambodia 1975 79 as the new regime moves to turn the country back into an agrarian society all educated and intellectuals are killed told by 7 yr old raami we see the horrors and the beauty in her crazy world her family is of royal lineage and they must deny their heritage and sometimes each other in order to survive very well written would recommend","216":"seven year old raami has lived a life of privilege until the camerouge pushes her family and the rest of her country from the safety of their homes as they flee the atrocities that are to come difficult to read at times and difficult to forget the reader should push through to the end to find resolution the images on the pages remain branded in my mind to resurface from time to time worth the effort","217":" i wasn't sure whether i wanted to read this book because i knew it would cover such horrific true events other reviews that spoke of the exquisite writing and transcendent nature convinced me to give it a try i was not disappointed this is the kind of book that heals the human spirit and helps you find meaning in the worst injustices of our time while it exposes the darkest parts of the human experience some of the worst people can do to each other in the activity of the kmer rouge it also shows how people can transcend the worst circumstances and prevail in the face of such inhumanity in this way the book is deeply healing and the writing is lyrical beautiful","218":"a heartbreaking story of a 7 year old girl and the atrocities of the khmer rouge regime in cambodia this is a book that will make you think for a long time after reading it i read it in a day","219":" ratner's story telling is eloquent beautiful and heartwarming i could not get enough of this story and had no problem envisioning the world that she described the sadness though heartbreaking was described with the most engaging and thought provoking words you care so much for the characters and find yourself falling into the deep well of their experience the end of the book was not forseeable but truthful and believable this story reads like a fairy tale with emotions truthfulness and a real ending that leaves you smiling through your tears","220":"i don't know how i finished this book it did take me forever because it was just so depressing death every where and for such a young girl but you know what each page i read there was this glimmer of hope that made me want to read the next chapter in my head it was like no it can't get worse but it would then i would read again and the author would throw you a bone and i would hold on to that so tight even though it did not have a happy ending it was more than i could have wanted i knew the reality of raami having her family again would be possible but the fact that she would not have to keep enduring the slavery she was in was such a relief for me but one thing i cannot understand is how a person is able to continue without ever really know what happens to your father mother that was my ultimate hope all through the book please let him live please let him live and you know what you don't know all circumstances point to one thing but i refuse to believe it and am just glad that a child like raami was able to continue with her life","221":"it might have been the narration but i got half way through and still didn't like it so i bailed on it can't say that i've ever done that so it really must not have grabbed me","222":" amazing story largely based on the experiences the author herself endured when her privileged family was ousted from their home in phnom penh cambodia when the khmer rouge came to power in 1975 with 7 year old raami as the heroine we see the destruction of city families social structure and cambodian society in general as the young uneducated soldiers follow orders for the good of the organization it's clear that little if anything is good about the organization but most cambodians literally had no choice death and destruction were rampant most of raami's family her father younger sister uncle two aunts two cousins and grandmother are ultimately killed either directly by the regime or as a result of it and let's just say peaceful deaths were rare in cambodia from 1975 79 still the drive raami and her mother have to survive and live carries them through unbelievable circumstances if i hadn't known it ended with them making it to a refugee camp in thailand it would have been even harder to read of their sufferings even more startling an interview included at the book's end with the author reveals her own journey to a refugee camp was even more harrowing and lengthy than raami's she hinted that portion of time may become a book unto itself in the future powerful writing powerful story real testimony to the courage and strength of the human spirit","223":" the author's choice to write about her experience with the khmer rouge as a story instead of as a straight up memoir made this novel both haunting and beautiful a difficult mix i think it was a wonderful decision giving her reign to write things as she remembered them even in the places where things seemed blurred or unreal which i think made the book much more powerful mixing in stories that her father had told her that were so important to her and imbuing them with more power than they would have had otherwise in the face of such horrors and atrocities paints an amazing picture of how it is that a child can survive something like she did it's hard to imagine a child surviving such a life and how they justify why such terrible things are happening to them how does a child deal with the death of almost her whole family and watching people she has become friends with be killed in front of her eyes how does a child react to starving almost to death or seeing that her parents cannot be the safe haven that children always think their parents are this book hurt to read it was so sad and i applaud the author for being able to do that while also staying true to the story form a child's eyes it's heartbreaking to think that the author herself thought and felt those things she wrote about this was such a horrific story told in such breathtaking language that it's borderline unreal","224":" others here have said it better in their critiques of this book there was so much prose trying to be a kind of poetry that somewhere the voice was just blurred not correctly defined did not seem like a little girl's to me nor was it the woman's voice she grew up to be either and the tale is tragic and horrific as all genocide tales are yet the education and the treatment of people that they are supposed to be liberating makes me regard these se asian and other asian communist reeducation tales particularly detestable worse and more torturous than the clean out tribal mass murders that continue to happen in africa repeatedly so i can't say i enjoyed the read at all but i did learn a few things about cambodia and this regime and do begin to understand some survival technique thinking too but i have complete disdain and antipathy toward communist revolution rhetoric or method any type or brand so most of these kinds of tales really repulse me too much to rate them a 4 or 5 unless it is really from the mind and soul like anchee min's","225":" the writing is sheer poetry metaphor allegory sensory detail events unfold in horrific accuracy but every scene is told with such an intimate child's view and patient detail that i was transported the events are history in all its brutality and incongruency the author tells her own story of surviving the killing fields of the khmer rouge altering enough to call it fiction but factual enough to represent the truth in its essence and yet it is a book filled with lush beauty of people and place this was my first time reading an entire book on my kindle and i was surprised by how quickly and easily i forgot the medium and simply swam in the words the kindle edition includes an interview with the author and other extras even some discussion questions for students or reading groups","226":"this was a very difficult book for me to read especially because it echoes my husband's own experiences under the khmer rouge many of the experiences that raami faces in the book are very similar to what my husband and his family faced the writing is powerful and authentic and moved me beyond words this is a book that should be read","227":"interesting story couldn't hang with the writing style will have to find a history book about the subject","228":"beautifully written this story is at once brutal and beautiful raami and her family are cambodian royals who are forced to flee their home during the khmer rouge communist regime of 1975 where an estimated two million people lost their lives after raami makes one awful mistake by exposing her family they are separated and she quickly learns that in order to survive they must hide their true identities all around her she witnesses the worst kinds of suffering and loss yet in the middle of it all she recalls the beauty of her father's poetry her father's poetry is like music and something that no one can take away from her it is her lifeline her sanity her connection to a father she may never see again parts of this book are horrific and brutality graphic yet ratner finds a way to save us from falling into a dark place much like raami fights her way from the brink of insanity by clinging to her father's poetry too much for any seven year old to bear witness too much for anyone this is a time of history of which i was unaware before reading in the shadow of the banyan it made it all the more powerful when i learned that this book is based on the author's own experience the author herself lived through this tragic time in history and this story is loosely based on her life in the 1980s the author and her mother arrived in the united states to begin a new life a note on the audio greta lee's voice is perfection the novel flowed beautifully on the audio and even though the book is read from a seven year old's point of view the reader's voice never became too young or distracting i can't quite find the word to descrive greta lee's voice but it is unique when i finished listening to this audio the first thing i did was search for more of greta lee's books more please vaddey ratner gifts to her readers a labour of love more than a novel more than a memoir more than an anthology of poetry in the shadow of the banyan is unlike anything i have ever read and will stay with me for some time i told you stories to give you wings raami so that you would never be trapped by anything","229":"moving and heartbreaking i never realised this part of cambodian history the language used was beautiful and made me want to read more and more of the same this was fiction and non fiction all in one i read more on cambodian history after this and about the khmer rouge and it astonishes me how things like this can go on while the rest of the world is ignorant about it people are capable of such cruelty and on the flip side so much beauty too","230":" this was a great book about the khmer rouge and their invasion of phnom pen it's amazing what humans will do to one another and it's even more amazing what people can survive i love little glimpses into history like this the story was a fictionalize account of the author's experiences living through this as a little girl she took everything she could remember combined it with what others had told her and did her best to recreate the nearly 3 years she lived through the war it is stunning and sad and inspiring all at once","231":"sad and beautiful","232":"very good but depressing","233":"beautiful sad i cried through the last three chapters i don't have much to say except that this story of remembrance endurance and hope deserves to be read and pondered my face is still puffy","234":"i checked this book out with three others but i couldn't get into it i will probably check it out again because i am interested in the story","235":"this must be one of the most exquisitely written books i've read in a long time it's based on the authors own experience during the regime of cambodia's khymer rouge the most memorable writing was the author's note in her own voice and dedication of this book to her late father","236":"it's hard to say i liked it when the topic of the book is so tragic and the autobiographical tale of suffering at the hands of the khmer rouge is only one such tale regimes relying on oppression still thrive today and hence the suffering continues but the book is worth reading not only to remind us of these tragedies but also to put a human face on them and to remind us of the resilience of the human spirit","237":"this book had a slow start for me but the story is ultimately quite powerful and worth the effort i learned a lot about the cambodian genocide and what it meant for the people who suffered i would have liked a little more background on the political environment at the time but i understand that this was a fictionalization of the author's own childhood and to go into the politics probably would have taken the book out of raami's perspective","238":" this is really unique and fantastic it is a glimpse of the khmer rouge revolution in cambodia through a young girl's eyes what is more incredible is that it really happened to the author she chose fiction because she couldn't completely trust her memory but the events happened to her in some way she highlights the heartbreaking beauty of her homeland and tells the story of cambodia in loving vivid detail it was a pleasure and honor to meet her at the gaithersburg book festival she was lovely and sweet and when she read about the losses that she suffered you would have to be made of stone to not be moved that being said it is not a depressing book the story is tragic but her voice remains hopeful","239":" i won this book in a goodreads giveaway this book is haunting and sad but as a lover of history i found it an amazing story knowing that this story is partly biographical makes your heart hurt to know that such things happen in the world but then your heart sings to know that such an amazing story of strength and perseverance can grow out of it vaddey ratner did a wonderful job drawing me into her story and making me feel the emotions she felt as a little girl whose world crumbled around her","240":"i almost gave up on this book because my knowledge of the point in history when it takes place was so lacking i simply didn't get it but at some point the language and humanity of the story took over and i was incapable of stopping it's a remarkable story and i am grateful to now understand the atrocity of the khmer rouge","241":"ti'm not sure why the cambodian genocide has not made our history books on some scale similar to the holocaust i only vaguely remember a discussion or two about what happened in cambodia and certainly it was not expressed with the horror that surrounds the holocaust the author provides an estimate that between 1 and 2 million lost their lives at the hands of the khmer rouge but in the research i've done since beginning the book i have seen numbers as high as 3 million this book has made its round through the book club i attend and i've passed it by several times finally at the recommendation of one of the ladies to read it simply for its beautiful writing i took it home where it sat for 3 months before i had the guts to read it yes you will need guts to read it the writing of this book is eloquence at its finest to be able to feel the emotions of a small girl as she witnesses the death of her family strictly through the manner of writing chosen by the author was incredible i would recommend this book to any reader i would also recommend that the author's note be read first and some basic reading into the cambodian genocide through reliable internet research be done to enhance the reading if i were still in school and able to use a work of fiction as a research project or essay this would be at the top of my list","242":"i think it would be misleading to say i enjoyed this book because it was based on the cambodian terror of the late 1979s when the khmer rouge under the leadership of the ruthless pol pot resulted in the deaths of 1 4 of the population from starvation extreme overwork and massacres so the novel was tough to take in so many parts it was however a story that more need to understand and remember and to honor those who perished in such extreme circumstances i felt that in some measure this book was a memorial for them an ode to their lives and a way for others to learn more about this reign of terror unfortunately history keeps repeating this sad saga in so many places around the world but the more we know of former regimes of terror the ore likely we are to openly and honestly reject such violence and deprivation i felt that i learned a lot with this one","243":"unbelievably affecting story i saw this when it came out didn't have a whole lot of interest in it but found it on the library shelf the other day and picked it up then i couldn't put it down i think this story almost had to be told from a child's perspective as the events it portrays are so unimaginable i clearly say that as a spoiled american as these things did occur but if you told me that someone would write a novel using gorgeous imagery and poetic language to tell a story of love in the midst of the horrors of the khmer rouge regime in cambodia i would have scoffed at you ratner has achieved an amazing thing in telling this story and i hope it was healing for her to tell her story it was certainly a lesson for this reader","244":"quite possibly the most beautifully written book i have read this year","245":" this book is about a young girl who's family is minor royalty in cambodia when the khamir rhouge sp takes over everyone is removed from their homes is taken to the jungle they are always kept not know what to expect not knowing how long they will stay not knowing who is in charge not know if the family will stay together not know if they will be eating that day it is full of sadness and terrible things that the girl must endure in the end well almost in the end i quit reading the book because i was ready for something happy to happen to someone sorry","246":"in the shadow of the banyan takes place during what would come to be known as the cambodian genocide in which nearly a fourth of the cambodian population lost their lives a radical communist group known as the khmer rogue came into power and resenting foreign influence began breaking down old social structures and relocating political enemies into labor camps and refugee areas many died of starvation or disease and some were flat out executed families were seperated homes ransacked and people were herded like animals across rural kampuchea eventually the vietnamese war intervened allowing many cambodians to flee into thailand or into the arms of the united nations the un established a temporary political system which eventually evolved into the constitutional monarchy it is today i love it when a book inspires new knowledge and i've found researching cambodian history to be very interesting and rewarding unfortunately as a novel in the shadow of the banyan falls into the same snare as so many fictional ww2 books it assumes that relating the tragic and horrifying details of a true event is enough to make the story interesting vaddey ratner certainly has an nice writing style weaving mythic and cultural influences into the narrative with a natural elegance she tells the story through the eyes of a young girl named raami and while it must be in retrospect that raami is speaking her vocabulary just isn't that of a 9 year old her childlike perceptions bring tenderness and charm to an otherwise bleak tale at once a loving tribute to a lost father and a sermon on the impermanence of suffering the book may honestly have worked better as an actual autobiography there are moments of vision and emotional depth but the plot moves thickly and slowly and doesn't go anywhere unexpected the author's memory and examination of this actual event are poetic and relevant but its hard to call it a fictional invention i'm glad to have read this book because it did inspire me to learn more about cambodian culture and history the language had beautiful moments and i admired the way the author integrated poetry and myth it just felt so much like a holocaust novel scraping by on the brutality of the actual history and bringing nothing new to the table outside of writing style liked it didn't love it","247":" in this book hope and change is not just an empty campaign promise hope and change are the difference between life and death they keep it from being just another example of maudlin narrative that takes you down to the depths of deep despair never to recover yes there are heavy doses of hope and change and it is this promise of rebirth that in the end provides for one of the most satisfying endings of any book in my recent memory raami is seven years old in 1975 living happily with her family in phnom penh when her world comes crashing down around her civil war has broken out and with the rise of the khmer rouge she begins a four year existence filled with such horror loss and deprivation that the extent of it would be unbelievable if it weren't founded in historical fact during the khmer rouge regime upwards of two million people lost their lives between 1975 and 1979 the survivors had endured hellish conditions where they saw their identities stripped away in favor of the \"organization \" as they were forced into unbearable labor raami's father taken into custody at the beginning of the story as a member of the elite class that the \"organization\" was swiftly eliminating provides the memories that enable her to bear this time in her life his stories poetry and legends resonate with her and lift her up it doesn't hurt that the author has the capability to string together the most luscious prose imaginable i could quote reams and reams of her staggeringly beautiful language \"from her corner tata watched the whole scene with wide eyed dismay as if death like a stranger uprooted and misplaced had appeared out of nowhere and taken up residence with us competing for its shared space in this refuge already haunted by so many ghosts \" page 124 or maybe \"as he neared i saw that both his ankles were tied with an arm length rope which had the effect of making him waddle instead of walk with his injuries it seemed he couldn't run even if he wanted to he brushed past our car the soldiers took turns whacking him with the butts of their guns to hurry him on he didn't retaliate or react but plodded on dragging his despair with him \" page 40 steeped in myth and legend heartbreakingly sad yet hopeful in the shadow of the banyan is very highly recommended","248":"poignant and poetic one of the best books i have read recently the author turned her own story of survival in cambodia during the dark years of the khmer rouge into a beautifully written novel that illustrates the power of words and dreams and family in the midst of great suffering i highly recommend this one","249":"i couldn't put it down it was so heartwrenching the writing is excellent and it was so interesting to learn about that horrific time in cambodian history even through all of the violence the author managed to produce moments of outstanding beauty especially between raami u0026amp her family","250":"i won this book on a goodreads first reads giveaway this is a must read i don't even know where how to start this review vaddey ratner captured beautifully the resilience of the human spirit the innocence of which children view the world no matter how horrible it is around them the world through raami's eyes makes the atrocities bearable and heart wrenching all at the same time congratulations on your wings mrs ratner well done","251":"this book is about a very sad and difficult time in a little girl's life the takeover of cambodia by the khmer rouge the cruelty of the revolutionaries is sometimes hard to read but the story is so beautifully written that i could not put it down i loved this book","252":"this was an outstanding read and a fascinating glimpse into the khmer rouge rebellion as told by a 7 year old girl","253":" this is among the most poignant heart touching poetic books that i have ever read it's right up there with the book thief on my list of most incredible reads the author takes you right into the heart and minds of the cambodian people while they struggle to strive during the khmer rouge take over of their country the effects of this destruction on a whole country and it's way of life during 1975 1979 told through the eyes mind and heart of a little girl with all due respect to the jews during ww2 u0026amp their families this story makes the reader think of the holocaust over and over again it is an definitive story of survival love and the strength of the human spirit ratner is a remarkable storyteller and this book is based on her experiences she has a strength that few people have to live through this time and then to relive the time to write about it so that the story can continue on~","254":"what an incredible book i am so glad my fiance bought this one for me for christmas because i'll admit this isn't something i ordinarily would have picked up on my own the writing is hauntingly beautiful and raami's story is heartbreaking u0026amp hopeful this was one of those books that i couldn't stop thinking about when i wasn't reading it and i know now that i've finished it's a book that will stay with me for quite some time","255":"one of the best books i have read ever lyrical beautiful moving powerful inspiring","256":"favorite quote upon meeting the person who would take in her family standing here beside me was this one person who unbeknownst to me till now had all along been journeying this same journey with me only from the opposite direction it is a lovely sentiment this author has a beautiful way with words she takes a horrible time in history and exposes it with such grace ratner points out the beauty in life even in the middle of devastation i found myself wrapped up in a world i had little knowledge of and became part of it for a while i was very moved by this story","257":"difficult to read such terrible things but well written and hopeful","258":"haunting and lyrical horrific and poetic it's the embodiment of the memoir first they killed my father if you don't know much about the cambodian killing fields or just have a vague idea what the late 70s meant to cambodia read this book","259":"beautiful prose story was told from the point of view of a young girl 8 years old as she and her family are turned out of their home in the city and sent out to the country to work as peasants it takes place in cambodia and describes the genocide of the cambodian people an inspirational novel of survival","260":"hauntingly sad as soon as i finished this i went online to learn more about the abomination of the cambodian killing fields unbelievable what humans do to each other","261":"i really did like this book for the most part i think there was some repetitive descriptions that got a little tired but her story feels so real a child that had to be so grown up and brave at such an early age","262":" wow this book is sad it's a pseudo memoir novel about the khmer rouge horrors narrated through the eyes of a 7 year old girl based on the actual experiences of the author and it's horrifically unbearably sad sad enough that i cried on public transit at least 5 separate times while reading it on my commute sad enough that one especially unbearably sad chapter took me 4 whole days to read just because i couldn't handle more than a few paragraphs at a time without weeping sad enough that the questions for the author at the end made me cry almost as much as the novel itself so sad and also poetic and inspiring i wouldn't go so far as to describe it as redemptive because it really darkly portrays the most horrible aspects of humanity without giving a real lens for understanding the brutality but lots of phrases like wonderful endurance of the human spirit or the miraculous capacity of humans to glean joy and beauty from brutality are applicable and have probably been used to describe the book ha i just checked the back cover and one of the reviews quoted calls it a road map for the resiliency of the human spirit ratner is gifted with words and writes about beauty and brutality with equal lyricism for example after the narrator has a rifle pressed against her 9 year old chest and is spared death only because she's not worth a bullet ratner writes i took a step back my feet as light as the crab's another step and another and further back until i reached only silence deep within myself within the dark grave like hole i lay they couldn't touch me anymore that's the kind of showing not telling writing that just makes the story pop off the pages and it's also really really saaaaaaaaaaaad ratner said that her purpose in writing the novel was to honor the lives lost by endeavoring to transform suffering into art that transforming suffering into art i would say she accomplished that to the same degree as picasso's guernica the story itself is about a branch of the royal family and their fates during the revolutionary communist rule over the country given that it starts out portraying the pre khmer rouge world as cushioned idyllic and enlightened and the contrast to that makes the civil war and genocide that much more brutal i understand that the author was herself a cambodian princess and is sharing her own story and wow can't imagine how traumatizing it must have been to write and re live all these events but this perspective obfuscates the context that lead to such horrors and it follows a pattern found in many re tellings of revolutionary upheaval too often the horrors of the soviet revolution are shared without the context of the horrors of czarist russia which preceded it the french revolution and robespierre's reign of terror are obsessed over without detailing the deprivation and brutality of the french monarchy for many people including myself the known history of cambodia begins and ends with the khmer rouge and the killing fields it is right to exhume the senseless violence and savage atrocities of these regimes but ignoring what came before does us no service if this kind of violence terrifies us we need to understand where it came from if the only background we see is the lovely life of a royal family if we ignore the atrocities that existed before the atrocity we cover up our hope of understanding how such horror is possible so i find this story immensely valuable and sad yet incomplete not recommended for the faint of heart","263":"this is one of my favorite books the writing is among the most beautiful elegant and poetic i've ever read stories are used to tell the story it is a heart wrenching semi autobiographical book the scenes of inhumanity are difficult and reminded me of wwii and the holocaust but the author's ability to portray hope life and beauty reminded me of anne frank u0026amp elie wiesel i did not know much about the khmer rouge this book will provide a history lesson you won't soon forget","264":"an important and powerful story much of it beautifully written but i found it pretty slow going i also never felt a deep connection to the characters raami often tells us what she's feeling but i found it hard to feel along with her","265":"this story is tragic and heartbreaking but told in a most spiritual and poetic way the author is amazingly talented and her words absolutely beautiful truly a must read","266":"absolutely amazing beautifully written","267":"abandoned did not love the writing and the hero worship of her father was over the top i guess when you lose your father as a child there is no time to see the humanity within","268":" despite the tragedies and atrocities of the story and knowing that it was based on the real and horrific experiences of the author as a child i was overwhelmed by the beauty and crafting of the writing to say it was poetic doesn't really align with the realities the author's emotion and heart wrenching narratives kept me thinking of that young girl and her family long after i finished the book i received this book through the goodreads giveaway and although most of the books i am reading currently are e versions i am very happy to have an actual copy that i can keep on my favourites bookshelf in real life","269":"in the shadow of the banyan i legitimately can't even in the shadow of the banyan follows of the narrative of raami a young cambodian girl born into royalty a loving family and a blissful existence but these lovely golden days end abruptly when everything is ripped away from her and her family gone are the pleasantries gone are the privileges gone is the reassurance that there's enough food to always keep her belly full gone is the joy the khmer rouge has come the communist reign has begun guys this novel was magnificent and as y'all probably know there's a direct correlation between the amount of love i have for a book and how much of an incoherent rambling mess i am so you have been warned the writing was exquisite i don't know whether vaddey ratner devoted heaps of time and effort into crafting each phrase into perfection or if she just has this natural talent for writing beautiful prose but either way every single sentence pierced you it was part philosophical musing part reflective memoir part poetry and strangely enough the vivid descriptions never detracted from the story quite the opposite in fact every single detail from radana's anklets to the temple decor in rolork meas enhanced the reading experience normally that isn't the case but something must be said here in the shadow of the banyan is a slow read it's a thought provoking read it's a read that must be meditated upon paragraph by paragraph chapter by chapter there's this pensive mood that permeates throughout the entire novel and it's absolutely haunting raami can be so understanding and reflective for such a young narrator that she almost doesn't seem like her age sometimes but then you think about it and all the ordeals she's gone through and how much she's been forced to mature and grow up in such a short time frame raami is eleven at the end of the novel but she has wisdom that some spend their entire lives trying to attain and yet raami constantly reels herself back and acknowledges she still doesn't understand some things in this world and her frustration at this truly speaks to you this is a little girl torn away from her innocence and plunked down into a world of oppressive adults and caring adults and adults that still seem like kids and adults that don't know how to wield the power they possess your heart truly goes out to raami especially since raami makes mistakes in times of war and revolution the stakes are even higher and these mistakes often have severe consequences as shown in the novel she's just seven years old but does that excuse it view spoiler does it excuse her from having been negligent of her sister and thus indirectly manufacturing radana's death does it excuse her from telling the soldiers that her father had been a prince thus ensuring eternal separation hide spoiler she might not have known any better but the repercussions are still there and that is why this novel is so heartbreaking it's that wistful tone of if only set in such a dire despairing world as the characters continually beat themselves and wonder what they could've done differently that appeals to your humanity it takes a whole novel for them to realize that it's futile what's done is done there are circumstances outside of their control but they can't run away they have to fight it's that internal struggle and many characters will succumb to death and disease and starvation before ever winning that is what pierces you but this story is still so much more than that it's a story of fractured families and shredded governments it's a story of noble intentions but poor execution it's a story of still trying to find meaning in such a hopelessly broken world it's a story of humans at their rawest at their weakest at their cruelest but humans are resilient raami more so than many many others and what i also love so much about this novel is that raami draws on her reservoirs of strength reservoirs that are fueled by stories her father was a writer he instilled in her a love and appreciation for words this is also a story of raami reconciling these wonderful fairytale like enchanting worlds from her childhood stories with a harsh and unforgiving reality some may call raami foolish or naive but it's this childlike hope that pulls her through in the end hope we see so many people pushed beyond their capacity to hope and live and love in this novel and it's absolutely agonizing to the reader the revolution took lives and hollowed souls even raami at the end is so near breaking point that she almost doesn't dare to hope it's a tentative faith that maybe things will get better maybe hatred will stop maybe she'll smile again we see the world of cambodia in the 1970's through a very small lens it's just a slice of what is really going on in that turbulent time a slice from a young girl's perspective is it thorough nope is it historically reliable perhaps not is it worth reading absolutely vaddey ratner has managed to take a foreign land with a distant past that i don't have any connection to whatsoever and brought it home ratner has given humanity and soul to such an inhumane and soulless time that no longer can the most detached person say that they are indifferent after reading this book i cried i laughed and above all i was struck by the force of this story a story that is much less fictional than we in our happy little bubble would like to believe it's personal it's powerful it's poignant and despite even this the prevailing message is one of optimism of joy of love and that's why this novel is extraordinary","270":"a beautiful book the story is about a horrific event but it doesn't feel that way because of the beautiful writing","271":"4 5so horrible and haunting yet so beautiful and lyrical perhaps the best book on the genocide in cambodia and the atrocities of the khmer rouge told through the young but awake eyes of a little girl she tells her story and that of her father and royal family it is a fabulous book and it deserves to be read it is fiction but the core of the story is true","272":"wow i think chris cleave author of little bee summed it up perfectly utterly heartbreaking and impossibly beautiful i was not sure how i would feel about a novel of the khmer rouge regime but it was well worth reading i was immediately drawn in and found it hard to step away the author is a local potomac woman and it is based on her life story a read i highly recommend","273":"i may not have been in the proper mood to appreciate this book i may have read it too soon after mudbound and not been ready for another intense story whatever the case i simply had a hard time getting into these characters even though it is something of a memoir as fiction the author didn't develop the characters in a way that commanded my empathy for me the plot was broken up by too much time spent trapped in characters' heads there were just enough sections of plot advancement and of character realization to support the 3 star rating","274":"now i want to know the non fiction story of her life and escape not sure it is really a four star but could not see giving it just 3","275":"she is a first time author beautifully written really recommend it","276":"haunting well written and fast moving this is a historical novel biography that traces a girl and her family during the terror of the khmer rouge in cambodia in the mid late 70s brutal and honest yet written subtly through beautiful prose","277":"i loved this book this account as told young raami heartbreakingly tells the story of her family's struggles when the khmer rouge seized control of cambodia in the 1970s the writing is lyrical and deeply affecting the story of raami's fight to overcome this tragedy will stay with me for quite some time","278":" i received this book as part of a giveaway from goodreads i am so glad i had an opportunity to read this book it was a beautifully written tale on the harrowing ordeal of an eight year old cambodian girl of royal blood and her family under the khmer rouge the imagery the descriptions all transport you to cambodia in the 1970's it also gives you a rare glimpse into the rise and fall of the atrocious communist party of kampuchea and the genocide that occurred under their rule i loved that the entire story is from the perspective of an innocent young girl and how she viewed the world","279":"beautifully written gut wrenching historical fiction perseverance thru unfathomable circumstances","280":"beautifully written painful and powerful this book is a masterpiece but not an easy subject","281":"interesting painful novel based on the author's experience as a child in war torn cambodia the little girls personality and optimism were what kept me reading for most of the book but even she began to despair at the end and reminded me how much sorrow humans inflict upon each other another reminder to be thankful for the gracious lives we have in the u s today","282":"this should have been great but i just couldn't get through it","283":"this book is exquisitely written amazing how amongst tragedy the writer is able to express so much beauty and lightness appalling sequence of events a truly beautiful novel","284":"not an easy read because of the horror of the story but such a memorable and uplifting book because of the poetry and human spirit that triumphs despite everything","285":" i wish there was a rating between i really liked it and it was amazing something along the lines i really really liked it that's what i would rate this book a novel based on the author's personal experience of living a privileged life in cambodia when the khmer rouge takes over and radical communism exists for a few short years how her main character's a 7 year old girl life changes amid the atrocities of war and political change through all of this she manages to hang on to memories of a better life and love and a spiritual connection to the universe and most importantly her father sort of borders on being a memoir but written in novel form","286":"whew this one was tough never let up u0026amp i wouldn't dream of putting it down while told thru the vehicle of fiction our author brought us almost too realistically to the reality of cambodia in the mid to late 70's i admit to not knowing of this bit of their history u0026amp this story brought it home i highly recommend","287":"i would like to give this book a higher rating the story based on the true story of survival during the kmer rouge occupation of cambodia is difficult not to give a 5 star rating but i found the writing hard to keep my attention it took me awhile to get through the book i might have been distracted by other things","288":"absolutely outstanding horrific story told with the innocence of lack of true understanding made this story much easier to read than it otherwise would have been","289":" one of those books that has left a lasting impression and not just for the undoubted and clearly depicted horrors inflicted by the khmer rouge it is told through the eyes of a young girl whose family is decimated by war it tells of the stoicism and bravery shown by ordinary people the senseless brutality of the regime and the effects of all this on a child's relationship with her mother it is both horrifying and beautiful and written with a sure touch that never lets the desperate plight of ordinary people descend into the sort of maudlin emotion laden excess that some writers rely on a truly excellent piece of work","290":" this is going to be a quickie but wow was this a terrific read it documents the khmer rouge regime in cambodia between 1975 and 1979 the story is told through the eyes of a seven year old girl named raami who is the ideal narrator the prose is beautiful but the narrative is heart rending keep plenty of tissues handy here are a couple nuggets \"but the real reason we stayed i sensed was simply that we couldn't bear to leave the place where papa had last been where the ground echoed with his footsteps the trees heaved his sighs and the pond mirrored his tranquility \"\"it was a sick sky a sky burning with welts angry and red the colors of rotting flesh of dying and death of one heaving last breath of rains that hadn't come and rains that came a long time ago \"","291":" the language ratner uses in this book is beautiful with it she is able to take a very sad subject and weave a heart touching story about family ties and personal strength that you hate to see end no matter how much you want the little girl's suffering to stop this accomplishment is all the more impressive since english is not ratner's primary language i could only wish to learn a second language so well for that matter i can't write in english as skillfully as she does this was her first book i hope it is not her last you should read this book","292":"this is a wonderful book a sad sad story but so well done it is about the khmer rouge regime in cambodia between 1975 and 1979 seen through the eyes of a seven year old girl she loses most of her family but somehow they keep going the mythical legends and poems of her father are woven into the story it is based on her own experiences","293":"a fictional story of an eight year old girl whose family is re educated under the khmer rouge in cambodia in 1975 it is a sad sad story sadder still is the fact it is based on the authors own life","294":"love love love such a great reinterpretation of trauma through a child's eyes mixing fiction with historical events in this way is extremely rewarding","295":"i read this book to learn something about the khmer rouge and the cambodian genocide the story was told from the perspective of a young girl so i didn't learn as much about the politics as i had hoped there were some beautiful moments that i loved but there were also times when i felt like it was too descriptive","296":"beautifully written story about the horrible treatment of cambodians by the khmer rouge heart wrenching and hopeful at the same time definitely read to destroy you is no loss too both excellent books","297":"heartbreaking story about the cambodian revolution told from the point of an 8 year old girl worth reading","298":"this should probably really be a 4 star rating the writing is very good but the story is just so terrible it is hard to read and horrifying what people do to each other in times of war it is a compelling read especially as it is a slightly fictionalized account of what the author actually experienced while it left me thinking it also made me want to block it out to some degree as well read it for the writing but know the story is brutal","299":"audiobook review i loved the way this story was written the language and storytelling were so great and i had to keep reminding myself it was the perspective of a 7 year old this was my first reading on the khmer rouge revolution in cambodia and it won't be my last the author's afterword was impactful as well giving even more depth to the story she wrote i would highly recommend as an audiobook as the narrator was excellent and it was also helpful to hear how the cambodian words should properly be pronounced","300":"i have mixed feelings about this book it is an incredibly cool story about the revolution that took place in cambodia at the time of the khmer rouge from the eyes of a 7 year old girl the problem it is written from the view point of a 7 year old girl some of the larger events the specific things like how she was escorted out of her home or how she saw several people die in the street are fudged up because this girl is trying to make them seem like fairy tales that here father told her it was incredibly clever to do it that way and kudos to the writer but it didn't appeal to me personally for another reader the technique of this book may appeal to them so it may not be fair to give it the rating i want just because it doesn't appeal to me the book itself is very well written also something i never understood is the title like what after reading the book i remain clueless about it and from the title you never would have known what the book is about after doing some research i found that a banyan tree is a fig tree so i'm still like what there were a lot of deep moments in the book where i had to take a second to pause and i like when a book does that unfortunately i want to give this book a 3 5 but can't because that is what i think it actually deserves that's not and option so i am going to give it a 3 instead of a 4","301":" ratner's lyrical prose almost disguises the brutality her protagonist raami experiences in this examination of cambodia's fall to the khmer rouge raami a princess of the royal family is disabled still limping from a bout with polio as a baby when the khmer rouge take over phnom penh her family must survive the evacuation of the city and the subsequent holocaust that envelops cambodia many times it seems as if raami will not survive when her poet pince father gives himself up to the organization and its harsh comrades when she and her mother are forced to leave the shelter given them by an elderly peasant couple when her mother is separated from her and raami is left to care for her dying grandmother survive she does though despite disability despite grief despite hunger and cruelty based on her own story in the shadow of the banyan is a moving story of the human will to live","302":"sometimes it seemed like the narrator was much older than a 7 10 year old child because the writing is often almost poetic like elie wiesel's night this is a book that everyone should read","303":"there is no such thing as an utopian community where all are equal we are human a ruling class always emerges people should think about that when they agree with redistribution and fair share maybe what you should be supporting is the freedom and ability to benefit from your own efforts","304":"i wanted to like it more the beginning is great but doesn't maintain","305":"this book struck me as a meditation on the author's young life and harrowing experiences in cambodia more than a story so while there are some beautiful passages and the overall plot is interesting for me it lacked impact because the characters were so thinly drawn as a result i found it rather dull which seems quite a feat given what an amazing tale it is","306":"i just finished this book and am just filled with admiration for the author what an amazing inspiring story i think this is one of the best books i have ever read in terms of writing some of the most beautiful prose i've ever read as well as story and character development the fact that it's based on her own story just makes it that much more amazing the story is based on the author's memories of her childhood in cambodia as her family was exiled from their home and forced to work under the rule of the khmer rouge love and strong family bonds provide them the strength to persevere despite terrible adversity i'm selective in the books i keep on my shelf to read again but this one will have a place of honor and it will definitely be re visited often","307":"this was a very good book very sad but well written i really didn't know much about cambodia and what took place there it's amazing to think that the author survived this horrible period in her life","308":"this was an extremely painful account of a royal intellectual family forced to flee the cambodian capital due to the khmer rouge in 1975 all from the viewpoint of the young but far too mature for her years daughter within this story is also the story of a beautiful relationship between a father and a daughter the language of the novel is particularly stunning and the poetry of words continues from start to finish","309":"semi autobiographic story of a young girl and her family caught in the khmerr rouge revolution in cambodia another story illustrating peoples ability to hate and destroy","310":"a stunningly beautiful and poignant story of redemption","311":"a beautifully written story heartbreaking in its reality","312":"this book is achingly beautiful but so so very sad it is at times painful to read the stories of the genocide are so violent so bleak and yet this horror is woven into a framework of love and hope and magic fairy tales and the power of family it is impossible to put down impossible to walk away from to forget i will be living with this one for quite a while","313":"a must read book to learn about as quoted by san antonio express news the resiliency of the human spirit","314":" in the shadow of the banyan a novel is exquisite i do not doubt it will be on my top ten list for the year and probably in the first position yes it is sad to think of those times and my eyes were filled with tears toward the end but it also reflects the beauty of the land and the people in one of my favorite destinations whether you are booking a trip to cambodia or just want to know more about the history you cannot do better than this book this is an excerpt from my review at a traveler's library see complete review here","315":"wow why do history classes at least mine neglect to enlighten us on other world atrocities besides world wars had never even heard of the khmer revolution in cambodia before this book very sad but uplifting story as told through a 7 year old girl during this revolution heart wrenchingly beautiful","316":" in the shadow of the banyan is an amazing and heart wrenching book beautifully written and full of exquisite images it's both exotic and familiar 7 year old raami tells of the unspeakable horrors of the khmer rouge uprising in cambodia from a child's perspective it's a story of the strength of family and their determination to not be broken despite being torn from their home and forced into hard labor to support the organization raami's innocence and frailty are put to the limits and she relies on the beautiful poetry and stories of her father to see her through a truly engrossing book hard to put down and equally hard and painful to read but it's an important book that sheds light on a troubled time that did not get much press in this country at the time i highly recommend it","317":"one of the saddest books ive ever read i dont know anyone who i would recommend this to although i enjoyed learning some of the history of cambodia this book was beautifully written","318":"this fictionalized memoir is compelling and haunting being only a few years older than the author i find myself contemplating my capacity to survive the tragedies she experienced it's always difficult to read about the horrors that we humans continue to inflict on our fellow man but so important to never forget","319":"based on the true story of the author's life this her first book opened my eyes to the cruelty of the khmer rouge a communist group who took over cambodia between 1975 1979 this story is not a happy one as families were uprooted and deliberately separated to destroy any unity and culture they were hauled all over the country with no warning then further annihilated thousands died i knew little of the cambodian dilemma although i was a young mother and career woman during those years the story is well worth reading as it is enlightening as to how corrupting power can be it bears the same kind of sadness as the holocaust stories","320":"this is one of those books that has to be written but is so very hard to read i could not read it before bed time as it was much too disturbing in places still i'm glad i read it intense and sad in many parts but still there was hope it is amazing the abuse that a human can endure and still survive this book is a tribute to those who suffered under a brutal regime","321":"this book was fascinating heartbreaking and uplifting the author does a wonderful job weaving poetry beauty and empthy throughout a devestating and brutal story i also found the story to be meaningful on a personal level i live in the city that has the second largest cambodian population in the united states and raami's story has echoes of stories that i have heard from people in my own community it is a testament to vaddey ratner's skill that she made something so ugly into something so full of hope","322":"this book got off to a slow start for me i like a straight path to the point it is the former new yorker in me the flowery details meandered around getting to the point another obstacle were references to folklore and gods of eastern cultures that i was unfamiliar with however this book shed some light on piece of history that i was in the dark about in the end i really felt for the characters and had empathy and compassion for all that they suffered it is sad how cruel humanity can be and that we see the same story repeated across cultures throughout history this is a good starting point if you are interested in learning more about the regime of the khmer rouge","323":" cambodian scarves kromain the shadow of the banyan is a semi autobiographical work by vaddey ratner written from the perspective of a fictional 7 year old child raami and how she and her mother survived the brutal khmer rouge regime because the book is written from a child's innocent view the tone of the book is very light despite dealing with the subject of war and destruction furthermore the novel is interwoven with numerous folk tales and myths which adds another layer of lyricism to the story the author has stated that this novel isn't about the pol pot regime or the genocide instead she wanted to write about a more universal theme the human spirit and strength to survive unfortunately i think that this message only came forth in the last few pages of the novel most of the novel contains myths and tales which i can't recall anymore and sad accounts of famine and deaths i still find it difficult to understand why the author decided to present this story with such lyricism maybe to differentiate it from other memoirs recently i read the corpse washer which is set during the iraq war and is also written with a lyrical tone but i wasn't bothered by it because the book was short and to the point here on the other hand the story was too long and felt tedious at times the narrator's voice was also not consistent sometimes very childish and innocent and then suddenly very mature and insightful finally the main character raami has polio but never once in the novel did she complain about any discomfort or pain which i found hard to believe of course raami was able to avoid hard labour because of her disability but i still imagine that a disabled person would've suffered greatly during that brutal regime overall a 2 5 star for me a line weaving through your mindlike the tail of a child's kiteunfettered by reason or rhyme mama words they are our rise and our fall raami perhaps this is why i prefer not to say too much papa for everything taken away something even more special is given back","324":" sitting on a beach in cambodia reading this made it that much more real made it very easy to picture the close and scenery she describes since finishing this book i will visit the killing fields making that much more real the only thing i would've added would've been an extra chapter describing how they settled in thailand overall this book was amazing bringing me to tears at points as i realized i'm where all these things really did occur they're always hope even in the worst of atrocities","325":"i just didn't love this book i tried really hard to get into it and feel the emotion but it was just long and drawn out kind of like a communist takeover","326":" to render historical political fiction in the voice and through the eyes of a young child a writer sets herself a tremendous challenge and takes on great risk children are naturally fanciful unreliable creatures not dishonest but only able to offer the truth as their immature brains can grasp and explain it when the story is revealed as the author's own the reader feels compelled to accept a fictionalized account as mere degrees of separation from the truth what vaddey ratner has accomplished with her striking and lovely in the shadow of the banyan is a tone poem its outline is based on the atrocious khmer rouge regime but the narrative floats on themes of family mythology and the deadly beauty of the author's homeland the nanny of the story's narrator raami the author's mirror character says it best when she declares that stories \"are like footpaths of the gods they lead us back and forth across time and space and connect us to the entire universe \" in the shadow of the banyan is a story that connects us to cambodia's recent past and the genocide committed by the khmer rouge during the late 1970's because we are seeing the events unfold through the eyes and within the heart of a seven year old girl we are twisted and wrenched by a child's vulnerability and hope but spared the most gruesome details of torture and obliteration in many ways this is a grace for it allows us to focus on the child's small world of her privileged family and their servants without being overwhelmed by the incomprehensible horror of cambodia's civil war but it also renders some characters shadowy and incomplete and glosses over context that would have helped create a firmer narrative although the book jacket declares the novel covers the four years of the khmer rouge regime the action is heavily concentrated on the first days and weeks after the capture and exile of raami's family the first half of the book is a near moment by moment recount of the first weeks after the khmer rouge declares a new state on april 17 1975 the second half chronicles the splitting apart of raami's family as one relative after another is slaughtered outright or dies as a result of their enslavement there is a reference to the second anniversary of the revolution and to raami's ninth birthday the book's final pages mention the war between vietnam and cambodia and the retreating khmer rouge armies so it must end in the early weeks or months of 1979 this is significant to me because i feel the details invested in the early parts are tedious at times whereas the shifts of time and events in the latter third of the novel as raami ages and suffers and grows as a refugee in her own homeland are given broad vague brushstrokes ultimately however it is a book i feel honored to have read ratner's language is lyrical and stirring she creates gorgeous and vivid portrait of cambodia filling the reader with longing to see hear taste and touch a vibrant complex land it offers a unique perspective into a history and culture little or mis understood in the west and i hope other readers have the same reaction as i of wanting to know more to read more to hear other survivors' stories in an effort to understand and to humanize the newspaper headlines my husband as a teacher of high school history and social studies received a fulbright grant and spent several weeks in southeast asia a few years ago cambodia and vietnam in equal measure but for different reasons touched him to his core vietnam's recent history he was of course more familiar u s history books treat cambodia's chaos as a post script to the american war as the vietnam war is referred to in southeast asia when you begin to fully grasp a reality that is little mentioned in our own history books it's a horrible slap in the face a sensation of guilt and anger that in your ignorance you are somehow complicit it is through the gift of authors such as vaddey ratner that these stories are told so we all can wake up and learn","327":"this book was so many things beautifully written vividly portrayed heartbreaking and breathtaking all at once the atrocities faced by the people of cambodia in such recent human history is astounding and the strength of the author and her mother and all the other survivors is nothing short of a miracle thank you to the author for sharing part of her soul these words will remain with me in my heart","328":"i did not know about the cambodian genocide before reading this book although there were times in which i had to put down the book and take a breather because of all the heartbreaking events in situations there were also moments in which i had to stop in awe of the beautiful language and the uplifting messages that the book contained i'm not a big historical fiction buff but this book is about more than that it is about human connection resilience and the power of the human spirit as much as this book showcases the evil that humanity is able to commit it also shows the strength that comes from love i highly recommend it","329":"a fictionalized account of the author's childhood in cambodia during the revolution evocative stirring","330":"it is not the writing but the fact this is based on a true experience that makes this such a powerful story an historical fiction piece worth reading","331":" i have to admit i did not finish the book it was boring of course it's a sad story but then millions of people had have to flee their homes because of uprisings civil wars and lots of wealthy privileged families loose their property and privileges all this means suffering and pain and i do feel sympathy and yet writing a novel means more than writing a diary vaddey ratner pretends to tell the story from the perspective of a 9 year old girl and this is simply not convincing the story you read might have been told by a 12 or 14 year old maybe and still remains what i'd label betroffenheitsliteratur a book that helps you cope with your destiny legitimate but not my cup of tea","332":"a powerful novel set during the reign of the khmer rouge in 1970s cambodia the story is told through the eyes of a seven year old girl who loses her privileged life and much of her family while the storytelling maintains some distance at times it is what i needed to be able to navigate the atrocities that were endured in light of global violence as well as individuals and families torn apart by war this is a very timely read","333":"i'm going to be thinking about this novel for a long time gorgeous vivid writing and such a tragic story about bravery self sacrifice and survival","334":"heart breaking amazing as o said a brutal novel lyrically told be sure to read the about the author and a conversation sections at the end","335":"such a sad book very lyrical and poetic i learned a lot about the khmer rouge regime in cambodia which i did not know much about","336":"very beautifully written it was an eye opening account of the khmer rouge takeover of cambodia shown through a child's eyes it was a little slow in places but perhaps the reader needed a break from the heart wrenching acts of genocide","337":"i haven't read a book that beautifully written in a long time such a sad story but i absolutely love historical fiction novels i knew very little about the cambodian genocide in the mid to late 70's and am appalled by the atrocities that resulted in the killing fields i highly recommend this novel","338":"having grown up after the time of khmer rouge headlines i've always had a vague uneasiness about the cambodian killing fields but that was about the extent of my knowledge experiencing this obscene moment of history through a seven year old child's eyes has a way of distancing the reader from some of the horror yet as an adult bringing a mature understanding to the circumstances i wanted so desperately to awaken her to the danger she was in under the shadow tells this story in a delicate yet matter of fact way the troubled relationship with raami's mother is at the center of the book though her absolute love for her father is the guiding force of her life i'll compare it in some ways to one of my favorite books barbara kingsolver's poisonwood bible in which the parents through a benign and unaware neglect place their children in an truly perilous situation through their parents' choices the children are affirmed or not in their value and love but as they grow older they come to a better understanding of their parents and the choices they made beautifully written lyrical in passages this book will remain with you for a long time and may open a few questions of your own about love and parenting","339":" this book broke my heart in so many ways in so many levels i cried for raami the narrator of this book the loss of her childhood u0026amp her innocence i cried for her family especially for her father i can't even begin to imagine the cruelties that was raami u0026amp other such people who were considered to smart for their own good was forced to suffer through in that respect i had a hard time reading through some parts of the book the writing is beautiful it's simple yet lyrical descriptive but not overly done another story that gives us a glimpse of human resiliency u0026amp that love u0026amp hope exist even in the most desolate of situations","340":"wow... amazing story beautifully written","341":"there are just not enough stars read all night","342":"very lyrical writing an increasingly poignant account you nearly feel yourself going numb with famine towards the end and throughout the horror the beauty of cambodia's landscapes comes through","343":"excellent book the story is riveting raw moving and emotional there are history books that give facts about what it was like to go through this genocide but that pales in comparison to this first hand account ratner writes beautifully from the heart and pours herself into this book worth every minute spent reading it thinking about it losing sleep over it recommending it and discussing it in our book club","344":"not that well written but an interesting account of the revolution in cambidia in the 70's of which i was only vaguely aware","345":"this book is so beautifully written i am a big fan of novels taking place during historical events so this book was very satisfying for me in the shadow of the banyan tells the story of a 7 years old girl struggling to survive under the khmer rouge during its reign of terror from 1975 to 1979 the communist regime emptied cities shattered schools and hospitals and forced families into labor camps in an attempt to turn cambodia into an agrarian utopia misguided agricultural reforms led to widespread famine people deemed intellectual -- which might mean simply that they wore eyeglasses -- were tortured or murdered outright despite taking place in such a grim period and occasionally sending chills down my spine this book is full of beauty the prose is exquisite and the stunning poems and descriptions found in chapters transported me to another world this book broke my heart yet made it soar all at once and it is even more powerful as it is based on the author's personal experiences a very haunting book that i would recommend wholeheartedly","346":"this is the story of a young girl and her journey through the horrors of the khmer rouge era of cambodia it is absolutely heartbreaking for sure but it's also beautiful and uplifting i highly recommend it 9 10","347":"this was a fabulous book a novel based on the experiences of a 5 year old during the khmer rouge terror in cambodia i thought it was very well written and was heartbreaking and wonderful at the same time this is a book not to be missed","348":" i knew next to nothing about the cambodian genocide and the khmer rouge this book was well written although i have to say the thoughts and feelings attributed to the child seemed a tad mature for her age but maybe when you live through something like this you mature quickly at any rate probably more because of the topic rather than the book itself i could only rustle up 3 stars i honestly cannot believe there are people in the world who live through this we are so lucky to live where we do","349":"this is a sadly beautiful book i learned a about cambodia the kmer rouge and also the resilience of the human spirit words have meaning and this book illustrates how words can be powerful both as a tool to oppress a culture and as a liberator of the human spirit highly recommend this as history of a person a people and culture and as a beautifully composed novel","350":" reading this book made me wonder why i didn't know more about the history and terrors of cambodia in the 1970's i knew the term khmer rouge and killing fields but didn't really recognize it as genocide now of course i do i'm ashamed that i didn't know more that the author came from these same terrors and has today written a wonderful book not to mention learned english was her high school valedictorian and graduated summa cum laude from cornell university makes me question what i have done with my life i don't know how she and her mother lived through this","351":"i would really give this 3 5 stars but i'll give it 4 stars since the story is so beautifully written it is a slow read and i almost put it down halfway through it picked up and i am glad i powered through the story is similar to dreams of joy by lisa see but much more descriptive and vivid in my mind's eye","352":"most elegant descriptions i've ever read so many times you hear someone say this book made me feel like i was there yes that is what books are supposed to do but this book this book truly made you experience the moment just as the girl did i've never had a book capture me so don't let difficult subject matter of the book scare you away for it is all about finding beauty even in the bleakest times this will become one of my all time favorites","353":"pure poetry a shattering tale told in a voice both innocent and wise it entwines one of history's darkest truths with strings of myths and legends that bind the author's tale to our own humanity","354":"i received this book through goodreads giveaways the language in this book is beyond beautifully written it's a story about a fathers love for his daughter and the mythical stories he told that ended up saving her life it's a remarkable and tragic story set in cambodia during the civil war with a little seven year old girl named raami as the main character i think being a child played to her advantage at this horrific time in history because she was able to still see glimpses of beauty in the world with the help of her father i have a feeling this book will haunt my memory for awhile it was very good","355":"excellent book the language is wonderful and you can see the chaos of this era via the eyes of a child an amazing story told with such humanity and heart","356":"read this book and realize now amazing it is that vaddey ratner was able to tell it at all","357":"difficult story to read because of the subject but very moving i would definitely recommend it great read","358":" well i knew this book was going to be heart wrenching from the start taking place during the reign of the khmer rouge and i was hesitant to start it but i thought about how books like a fine balance are heartbreaking but also wonderful and important so i pressed on this book is not just documentation of a horrendous moment in history but also a touching story about a father's love for his daughter and the spirit of a child in the midst of terror and uncertainty i think ratner does a nice job of capturing both the innocence and ignorance of youth telling the story through the eyes of a child essentially her own story while still leaving us with poignant observations which somehow don't seem out of place","359":"i found the writing of this book lovely and the prose almost poetic at early points i found the book a bit slow but as it progressed there was something aching about the pace because i knew how horrible it truly was and would become i also found the descriptions beautiful and haunting ratner did a great job juxtaposing the beauty of the landscape and the ruin they made of the landscape i've been fortunate enough to visit cambodia a few times and see the beauty she writes of experience the culture she writes about and see some of the after effects of khmer rouge devastation this background i have really helped make this book special for me","360":"one of the most beautiful passages is when the nanny raami tells her stories are like ways of the gods they take us back and forth in time and space and connect us to the entire universe what i considered remarkable and beautiful in this book is that even the author had lived all this on the skin we note in its history the absence of anger and the ability seemingly endless for empathy in my opinion the shadow figueira is a book that should be read by everyone brings teachings values and resilience to wait our time to be happy","361":"a compelling story about adversity from such a little girl reminiscent of lisa see's stories but imo not as nicely written perhaps because the author is remembering from her childhood","362":"based on the average scores in goodreads perhaps i was expecting too much from this book i felt the second half of the book was better than the first sweeping emotions towards the end grasping the horrors of war all in all it was not gripping but it was a journey of family values the hardness of war and the strength of a very brave child and her mother","363":"great book to highlight the ruthlessness of pol pot's khmer rouge i picked after listening to the author speak her writing is poetic and beautiful on a topic that is nightmarish it is going to be my assigned novel for my seniors when we discuss authoritarian regimes and communism","364":" the problem with being seven is that you're aware of so much and yet you understand so little so you imagine the worst i'm not sure a child's imagination would come up with things that were worse than what happened in cambodia but this combination of awareness and innocence made the narrative voice really special i loved her worldview and poetic language because the story is told through the eyes of a child without full understanding we aren't presented with a constant stream of graphic atrocities there is beauty and wonder to contrast with the fear and anticipation and in a way the tragedies hit me even harder because they felt personal i really liked seeing the progression of raami's relationships with her family especially with her father and mother then my heart broke even more when i got to the end and saw that raami's story was based on the author's real life everything felt so authentic because it was based on actual experience i enjoyed this book even more because i read most of it as i was traveling around vietnam and cambodia and the timing of some passages in the book would magically correlate with my travel experience for example i had met an old woman in vietnam with black teeth right before i read about raami's grandmother's teeth and the reason for them","365":"i cannot adequately express how this book affected me it's one of those books that is at once incredibly difficult to read and yet so beautifully written and hopeful that you can't put it down the story is based on the author's life experiences in cambodia as a young girl in the 1970s but it is not autobiographical which makes it all the more moving i will not soon forget this novel which cannot be said of many books i read","366":"a heartwrenching story based on the authors own experience in 1970's cambodia wonderfully told you feel and understand their heartache and pain","367":"loved this book raami was a survivor thanks to her loving parents the combination of their love and her resilience maybe as a ressult of her polio what inner strength her father gave her wings but her mother taught her to fly the light and dark imagery was fantastic","368":"i don't know much about the khmer rouge and its rule in cambodia so was really looking forward to reading this novel especially given the rave reviews the book starts lovely and the little girl's character curious mischievous idolating her parents reeled me in but as soon as the atrocities started and the family is demeaned slaved murdered the author lost the little girl's voice and instead gives her adult opinion on what happens this is not the voice of a seven year old this is not the voice of a child enduring hunger abuse loss of siblings and parents this is the detached voice of someone making sense of it many years later the characters become one dimensional and very very unbelievable the only good thing the reader won't feel traumatized by reading the story either","369":"this book defies easy descriptions it's sad and hopeful ugly and beautiful the best i can say is that it's moving and i could hardly bear to put it down it's a story that will haunt me long after the last page","370":"actually a 3 1 2 or maybe 3 3 4 just not quite a 4 it was difficult to believe that the narrator was 7 much of the time although it deals with a terrible time it isn't a depressing novel it is quite spiritual which is a reflection of the cambodian culture very introspective i'm glad i read it","371":"true story of survival and culture during the terror of the cambodian nightmare by a young girl who survived quite good writing","372":"a memoir of life under the khmer rouge loss love and family are intertwined themes i couldn't put this one down","373":"the story was tragic to be sure and raami's relationship to her father was beautiful to read about however i found the voice to be a little cloying and so much of the history is overwhelmed by flowery language and overly romanticized ideas the story would have been more powerful if told in an honest voice stripped down and raw as it is it's hard to feel the gravity if the basically true story because its buried in the moon and the mist and the tevodas","374":"i really enjoyed this account of the khmer rouge for the first time it felt as though i was getting a fully fleshed out account of that time yet it was done in a way that was not off putting it was beautifully written although not without a few missteps on the whole i really enjoyed it","375":"incredibly tragic so well written it was sometimes hard to believe it was told by a 7yr old girl at one point she said animals don't hurt you if you leave them alone but humans do a wonderfully tragic story about a tragic period","376":"this was one of the most poignant books i've read perhaps it was especially interesting to me because i know next to nothing about the khmer rouge's takeover of cambodia but hearing the story through the eyes of a child the age of my children was also unique so so sad but in the end truly a story of hope","377":" as a senior in high school it scares me that i didn't know how to properly pronounce khmer rogue before reading this book even worse was my ignorance of cambodia's history in the late 1970's the genocide that took place serves as a lesser known holocaust the horrors these people endured similar to that of the jews in the shadow of the banyan follows seven year old raami as she witnesses the communist regime take everything away from her through her eyes vaddey ratner displays the evocative environment of cambodia as it is torn asunder by the khmer rogue raami and her family are forced out of their home and into a world of brutal labor and starvation she fights to survive even as she loses her family members one by one as one might expect when reading a book about auschwitz or the holocaust getting through ratner's work was a painful trial due to the extent of human suffering portrayed while raami's narrative could be a bit dry at times it never falters taking into account all the details and stories one would expect from a child that this book acts almost as the author's account of her own childhood in cambodia makes it even more touching and bittersweet overall i recommend this book for those interested in a story of human sorrow hope and beauty all delineated through the perspective of an insightful and honest seven year old girl review cross posted on my blog the quiet voice","378":"i haven't been so moved by a book in a long time","379":"maybe it was because it was a change from my normal read i don't know but i do know that i really loved this book it was beautifully written devastating heartbreaking and filled with hope all at the same time it is an emotional read reminded me a bit of how i felt when i read unbroken it is hard to really comprehend what this must have been like read this read this very worth your time","380":"based on the history of the author as a young girl in camodia during the khmer rouge period it provides a moving look at life in cambodia","381":"vaddey ratner made a smart decision in writing a novel rather than a memoir the poetic descriptions and sometimes brutal truth in this portrayal of the time of the khmer rouge are astoundingly effective in fiction form the story is told from seven year old raami's perspective the fact that a child witnesses these events can be heartbreaking but her innocence and spirit can be uplifting as well the story begins in their family home where raami and her kin live a generally peaceful life the sudden uprooting they are forced into changes everything and the only thing familiar that remains for raami are her father's mythical stories and poems she clings to these throughout the horror of death disease and brutality and the reader learns to cling with her this novel is incredibly powerful in bringing to the surface raw and and strong emotions every character in the novel is well developed and given a personality even those we only get glimpses of ratner uses multiple characters to showcase different reactions to the situations thrusted upon them the author also manages to illustrate the extraordinary beauty in this time period in the people in the scenery this contrasts so greatly with the atrocities occurring but can be seen to represent the glimmer of hope that must always be present if one hopes to survive while so many portions of this novel are painful to read one still yearns to continue on grasping at the poetic writing for relief just as raami holds tight to what she has of her father throughout the horror that is her childhood i received this book in a firstreads giveaway","382":"beautiful terrible educational","383":"it suffered in comparison from having been read shortly after all the light you cannot see but is still a compelling read i know little about cambodian history yet the author was able to make you understand the time period the characters and the heartbreaking story","384":"the book is the story of a royal cambodian child and her experience with the khmer rouge the second half was very hard to read it was even worse to read the afterword and to discover it's basically autobiographical","385":"how fortunate i was to be able to pick up this book many times in a day and immerse myself in a beautiful poetic well written yet difficult story about a young child's life in cambodia during the rule of the khmer rouge i was immediately drawn into the beauty of the country by the poetic words that painted such vivid pictures in my mind while at other times i held my breathe in hopes of protecting raami and her family from the nightmare that became their reality i can see this becoming a book club favorite thank you to goodreads for providing me with an advance copy","386":" if you ever needed a refutation of communism this would be it reminded me of posionwood bible told from the perspective of a child caught in political calamity and her fall from innocence as she witnesses the senseless killing around her she is crippled like adah and her younger sister even perishes of malaria just like ruth may there is incredible poetry and imagery in the story a number of times i felt the narrative voice was too mature to be that of a seven year old or eight year old but i couldn't fault the author for giving words to a true nightmare cambodian families lived through the themes of suffering and peace ugliness and beauty darkness and light always existing together of loss mourning and subtle reincarnations of guilt fear and powerlessness of flight real and imagined of ephemerality of hunger of love and strength in silence make this book an important reminder of what humans are capable of destruction in the name of ideology and survival in spite of it","387":"i enjoyed this book and learned a lot that i didn't know about the khmer rouge in cambodia i thought a lot of the language and imagery was lovely but at times i felt that the story was too drawn out and then at the end it was all wrapped up too quickly i really liked raami's character and her wisdom and tenacity for a young child and i loved the relationship she had with her father right up to the end","388":"3 5 stars her poetic style is beautiful and i loved it the story dragged a little but i still absolutely recommend","389":"honestly one of the best books i've read this year","390":"moved pretty slowly for me fascinating and horrible","391":"while this novel was overall very good i found it a bit slow however beautifully written and heart wrenchingly sad","392":"a survivor of the brutal khmer rouge regime herself ratner is a prolific beautiful writer this novel is a tale of not sacrifice or tragedy but hope and love her language mesmerizes her diction precise and loving she is mindful not to reiterate the violence of such a tragic era in cambodia crafting her narrative through the voice of a resilient 7 year old girl","393":"very well written interesting historical account of cambodia in the 70s not a beach read","394":"2 and 1 2 somewhere between 'it was okay' and 'i liked it' the book is very well written which is probably the only reason i finished reading it the subject matter was very real and thus very disturbing the author published this book as fiction because she knew her memory from age 5 through 9 was not always complete however at that age it is possible to remember horrors like ratner endured in cambodia in the 1970's when the revolutionaries forced the people into labor and starvation","395":"wow just wow this book kind of reminded me of rani manicka's rice mother and isabel allende's the house of spirits i loved it","396":"beautifully written book describing the horrors of war and genocide in cambodia through the innocent eyes of a child it's very sad but also a true testament to what the human spirit can endure","397":"the link between nature and life in this book is very poetic the link between the point of view of an adult and a child's changes your way of thinking","398":"it was a heart touching tale of war era and still presented with the contrast of natural beauty around the characters' morbid fate beautiful symbolisms great story telling considering the fact that something so gloomy had to be presented the weaving of characters as accurate as having been there in that very situation a beautiful and emotionally stirring read","399":"beautiful descriptions of life amidst death and cruelty a sad story that makes me wonder about some of my cambodian classmates growing up","400":"a personal story of the cambodian genocide written in novel form if one is looking for a sense of this horror this story by ms ratner is deep and personal throughout the book i was thinking the story being told is so personal written from the eyes of a young girl who loses most of her family along the way that i'm missing just the facts of course the facts can be looked up anywhere but as a bonus the last chapter fills in the context it steps out of the personal narrative and states the facts in 1975 the kyhmer rouge swept into cambodia's capital city phnom penh and declared a new government a new way of life from 1975 1979 as the kyhmer rouge attempted to realize their vision of a utopian society one of the most complete social transformations in modern history families were separated and put into work camps systematically starved and executed the regime was finally overthrown by the vietnamese military in 1979 bringing the revolutionary experiment to an end while the true number can never be known scholars estimate that between 1 and 2 million people died perhaps as much as one third of the total population pg 318but through the main narrative of the book it is story of family loyalty and loss with raami a seven year old girl who had polio being the main character early in the story raami's scholarly and royal lineage father talked to her mother as these strange revolutionary soldiers poured into the city i hoped so much it wouldn't come to this ' he sighed and went on 'others abandoned us long ago at the first sign of trouble and now so have the americans alas democracy has been defeated and our friends will not stay for its execution pg 17as troubles began to mount raami's aunt remarked to her niece the problem with being seven i remember myself at that age is that you're aware of so much and yet you understand so little so you imagine the worst pg 94raami loses her father singled out due to his royal lineage and his fame as a poet and writer the importance of bonds of parent to child are evident throughout at one point an old peasant couple pok and mae end up being caretakers for the remnants of raami's family she and her mother at that point and raami reflects thus 'pok thor koan thor' was a bond between a parent and child who were not related by blood 'they are not ours to keep' pok had said cautioning mae against becoming too attached to us looking at him now i knew we'd fallen into good hands i knew also that like papa like any parent who understood the brevity of his role the pithiness of parenthood pok was going to care for us as best as he could teach us how to live like 'neak snae ' how not only to plant the rice but to imitate it to firmly anchor ourselves in ever upturned ground and at the same time sway in the direction of the wind pg 170sobering rich and authentic","401":" in preparation for our trip to cambodia and the killing fields near phnom penh i read three books in the shadow of the banyan by vaddey ratner first they killed my father by loung ung and when glass floats by chanrithy him each of the three books was about a young girl who with their families suffered under the khmer rouge communist regime and their genocide campaign the khmer rouge took control of phnom penh its last obstacle to ruling all of cambodia on april 17th 1975 they turned the cities into ghost towns evacuating or killing the city dwellers and forcing their populations into the countryside they nullified the monetary system making them all destitute and systematically executed all those in the former government and military the teachers the doctors the religious leaders and any they viewed as intellectuals sometimes just because they wore glasses all this was done to satisfy pol pot's dream of turning cambodia into an agrarian state isolated from western influence but this was just the beginning of the khmer rouge atrocities when the country was liberated from the regime in january of 1979 an estimated 2 million cambodians had suffered death under the regime almost an entire nation was orphaned both first they killed my father by loung ung and when glass floats by chanrithy him are autobiographical in the shadow of the banyan was such a different reading experience from the other two because it was a novel steeped in poetic prose the protagonist raami is still based on the author and raami's struggles mirror the struggles of ratner but the novel format allowed ratner to tell her story in a much different voice words you see he said looking at me again allow us to make permanent what is essentially transient turn a world filled with injustice and hurt into a place that is beautiful and lyrical even if only on paper pg 106 i told you stories to give you wings raami so that you would never be trapped by anything your name your title the limits of your body this world's suffering pg 134 if you are only going to read one of the three i'd honestly read first they killed my father but if you are going to read two or all three i'd recommend reading this novel first it is filled with cambodian tradition and stories that will give you a sense of the spirit of this people before humanity was taken from them through this coming of age story raami was able to see the violence and suffering around her without losing her ability to find the words that would give her wings","402":"well written book on a tough time in human history the author had a great task of combining personal accounts combined with others experiences of what was an atrocious and senseless genocide books like this make me grateful to be where i am at in life u0026amp in this world","403":"it showed how fragile life in a third world country could be it made me cry","404":" the period in which this novel takes place was perhaps the best time of my life while i was enthralled with beer fraternities and my hot red mustang people in cambodia were being slaughtered for something as simple as having an education this book was heartbreaking not only by the events that occurred a world away from my little iowa college campus but by the fact that we had no idea what the khmer rouge was or the atrocities perpetrated by these crazed 'freedom fighters' in search of a utopian society it is always amazing to me that countries turn a blind eye to mass murder then come back and say later if we had only known the book was poetic in it's presentation of the struggles of one family and although 'loosely' based on the author's real life experiences was devastatingly real as told by raami the 7 year old narrator of the story yet it never got maudlin the father's stories told to us by raami were in the end the only thing that brought hope to her and ultimately led to her survival although i gave this book a five i found myself skipping ahead more times than i normally do in a five star book at minimum it's a 4 5","405":" still looking for my socks knocked off early in the reading by the lyrical language and vivid images ratner's narrator is raami the 7 year old daughter of a cambodian prince trapped in the mayhem of the khmer rouge revolution in the 70s raami shows us the child's perspective on the forced migration of the intellectual and wealthy classes from the cities to the country hunger and manual labor tempered by the rich detail and mystical stories that girl clings to it's a skillful use of the child's point of view the description never extends beyond what the child could see or imagine yet the language is that of the adult looking back easily the best book i've read this year","406":"be prepared to cry i loved it but it was a heart breaker and not a read for everyone","407":"this book was so slow and so full of fluff that i could not even finish it and i really wanted to like it it sounded so good but absolutely fell flat","408":"i have to stop with the tragic memoirs though this is fiction the author evidently experienced most of the events in some form as a child under the khmer rouge very lyrical and certainly made me feel like an under achiever given she arrived in us at age 11 after 4 years of torturous conditions and famine speaking no english and yet graduated cornell with honors practically on schedule","409":" good story great even but the delivery felt raw in mostly the wrong ways there's powerful writing here but it felt uneven to me bouts of repetitious language a seven year old protagonist that sounds at least somewhere in her teens a poet prince father that launches into sermonic language at odd times i don't want to be harsh because this is in essence a fictionalized memoir and i can imagine how hard it is for the author to put her experience out there for us i wanted to like this book really i did and i did find parts of it touching closer to the end a tear threatened but but am i too harsh a judge probably","410":"this book about the atrocities of the khmer rouge in cambodia is going to haunt me for a while this book is written through the eyes of a child any country where the illiterate take power is bound for doom i recommend this book highly","411":"beautifully written very descriptive and metaphorical but for me it felt a bit slow and drawn out at times i'm glad i read it and was able to learn more about a period in history i knew very little about","412":"this is a semi autobiographical account of the horrors of the communist take over of cambodia as seen and experienced by a pre teen girl the inevitable brutality of the communist take over is actually understated in this book probably because the author was so young and naive at the time","413":"a lovely poetic writing style embraces the heartbreaking story of a child princess in cambodia during the rise of the khmer rouge at times the very adult thoughts of attributed to the young girl disrupted the realism of an otherwise haunting and heartbreaking experience which is based on the author's life","414":"a tragic story based on the author's own life poetically told","415":"i tried but i could not care about the characters one of the few books i won't finish","416":"excellently written","417":" this is a story i knew little about i think the flaw with the book is that it is told by a girl raami starting at the age of 7 to 11 during the take over of cambodia by the khmer rouge there are many passages that a child would not have been able to describe as she does raami's family is royalty when the khmer rouge take over they send all the educated wealthy and royal people to the country to work in rice paddies this book does remind me of mao's take over of china in the country they are worked hard and rarely have enough food many terrible things happen her father is taken away her uncle's family is killed her uncle in despair kills himself the really horrible part of the book is the inhumanity of the people in power small petty people get control until it is taken from them by other evil people i knew very little about this story even though it took place just after the vietnam war","418":"a beautifully written book about a part of history i am not familiar with it has definitely made me want to learn more","419":"this story made me think i would find myself thinking about the atrocities that happened in cambodia during my day it is written from the voice of a young child and at times it is heart breaking thinking that someone so young would have to witness what they did it was interesting to read the chat with the author at the back of the book as well finding out that she herself went through the devastation as a 5 year old is truly moving","420":" \"in the shadow of the banyan\" is a heartbreakingly beautiful account of survival through the genocide perpetrated by the khmer rouge in cambodia seen through the eyes of an eight year old girl you catch a glimpse of life before everything in her world is painfully and abruptly stripped away such a story would be almost unbearable to read except this one is written so beautifully the main character's father had been a poet and there are wonderful poetic images throughout this first novel by vaddey ratner and those moments of beauty are what offer the hope and the will to survive","421":"one of the most powerful books i have ever read","422":"amazing book that had me crying a lot and laughing a little such good descriptions and poetry","423":" in the shadow of the banyan tells a tragic story of cambodian royal family members under khmer rouge regime it's told from the perspective of 7 year old rami daughter of cambodian prince ayuravan sisowath vaddey ratner the author is the only child of cambodian prince of the same name that survived khmer rouge imprisoment to give the voice of the one that were lost during one of the most radical and savage social experiments in the world she decided to do it through fiction instead of memoris although as she explains in author's note ramis experiences were in essence her own khmer rouge were one of many gorilla groups that trouble young cambodian democracy during the vietnam war that was spreading though the border to cambodia they gained power and support in the country side with idealistic communist propaganda and under leadership of pol pot within 4 years they've killed 1 3 of its population the writing flows and so the story it's impossible to put the book down if you are the ones that prefer to stay away from the books that offer too detailed description of genocide brutality i can calm you down ratner gives only as much of brutality as absolutely necessary focusing rather on her characters strength to survive family love than brutality rami and her family are marked they are the enemy class rami survives only due to her parents love the stories of her father based on buddhist religion and buddhies folk mythology help her to strive for survival while she suffers hard labor starvation and is moved from place to place often spending days on her own those stories and rami's mother strength to push forward to save the daughter gave her life as ratner the author herself noted over and over again the power of the story that ratner believes in was one of the reasons she has written this great book for it's one of the best i've read this year and i'm giving it 4 5 stars not for literary reason that are absolutely fine but for the fact that it makes me want to explore the complicated history of this region more buddhist philosophy as well and it reminded me about the power of the storytelling","424":"this was a very compelling read about the brutality of the khmer rouge regime as told through a young child's eyes i thought the story was beautifully told and loved the writing style","425":"certainly not a fun read but interesting well written and gives an understanding to the khemer rouge regime in cambodia","426":" while all else may vanish love is our one eternity \" just when the sadness of this story becomes unbearable the author infuses the narrative with hope and beauty unforgettable and inspiring a must read quotes i want to remember \"you can dig a hole in my heart and bury all your sadness i'll be your grave \" \"i told you stories to give you wings raami so that you would never be trapped by anything your name your title the limits of your body this world's suffering\"\"for all the loss and tragedy i have known my life has taught me that the human spirit like the lifted hands of the blind will rise above chaos and destruction as wings in flight\"\"a story i had learned through my own constant knitting and reknitting of remembered words can lead us back to ourselves to our lost innocence and in the shadow it casts over our present world we begin to understand what we only intuited in our naivete that while all else may vanish love is our one eternity \"","427":"bleh i know i know everyone else gives this 5 stars i couldn't get past 100 pages with the plot about a family forced to flee phnom penh by the khmer rouge during the 1975 war in cambodia this sounds like a book you can't put down especially when written by someone who lived through this but instead of an action packed book we are treated to a little action described by a seven year old girl and someone supposedly the same person with an adult's vocabulary describing other things food vegetation nusic which did not add to the plot and made the whole book seem bloated overwritten and clumsy the style of writing and the plot do not match it would have been much more interesting and held my attention if it had not been written in the first person singular or front the viewpoint of a child it is extremely difficult to write as a child and keep the interest of adult readers this book did not make the grade","428":" a goodreads giveaway win that intrigued me for its concept and honestly the fact that it had a cover quote from chris cleave little bee this story is narrated by raami a girl from a well to do family with royal ties in cambodia who is seven years old when the khmer rouge takes over the capital and the country she understands very little as she flees with her family and goes through hardships that would break most people and a regime responsible for a genocide that claimed hundreds of thousands and perhaps up to two million lives raami's world is shaken but she also finds comfort in folk tales and in stories told to her by her father to say much more would be to say too much though i do recommend waiting to read too much about the author since the novel is based on her own life and it could be a form of unexpected spoiler it's always hard to say one enjoyed a novel like this since the story is hardly joyous despite the young narrator's spirit still it was a very good read i found many interesting characters from the various members of raami's family to the good people who find a way to come together in the face of evil raami doesn't always really understand what is going on a state that is probably much more real than is often the case with child narrators given the fact that the author was only a little bit older when she experienced a similar journey i appreciate that you do see a bit of what draws some of the younger members to the khmer rouge regime even while it is utterly clear to the reader that countless atrocities marked this period i did sometimes get a bit weary of portions of both the mother and father characters which is largely responsible for this being four rather than five stars not an easy read but worthwhile","429":"haunting novel chronicles the atrocities committed by the khmer rouge author narrates her own experience at the hand of the khmer rouge and how she fled cambodia at times the novel gets so dark it is tough to keep going the ending was abrupt but the author explains her reasoning at the end of the novel","430":"my husband and i traveled through cambodia and vietnam in 2010 and our guides talked about the horrors of the khmer rouge this book put those horrors into horrifying details through the eyes of a child gorgeous powerful book","431":"i hesistated to give this book five stars since i've been heavy on the five star ratings lately however i changed my mind after finishing this book on the elliptical trainer at my local gym while wiping away my tears this bittersweet tale while not a memoir is based on the author's real life experience as a young girl in cambodia at the hands of the khmer rouge this is a novel about hope family survival and the power of storytelling","432":"i grew up during this period of time and remember it well on the tail end of viet nam this is one of the most beautiful and heartbreaking stories i have ever read i could only take it in small doses i actually would set it aside and read another book and then go back to it my imagination was in over drive i felt every emotion saw and smelt everything ms ratner felt this book will live in my memory forever~","433":"this is a very well written book about the pol pot era in cambodia it's a difficult read emotionally yet full of strong and loving people who learn how to survive in the most extreme situations","434":" under the shadow of the banyan tree by vaddey ratner explores the atrocities the khmer rouge did to their people during the late 70's they killed twenty five percent of their population and vented their wrath on the educated and perceived elite of the country the story is told through the eyes of a 7 year old child as she recounts the end of her privileged life in phenom penh and the journey her family was forced to make to the siem reap part of the country later known as the killing fields of cambodia what comes through is the triumph of the human spirit in the most horrific conditions","435":"this is the month of realizing how full of holes either my memory is or my education this historical novel addressing the revolution in cambodia as well as the relationship and love between a father and daughter and the love of poetry and language was beautifully written the story progresses nicely although not as engaging as i would have hoped","436":"this book is poetry in prose the language and imagery cradle the sadness and highlight the hope of the tumultuous plot truly beautiful","437":"the descriptive writing was fantastic i was ignorant as to what was going on in the world in the 70's i was a completely self absorbed teenager it was a sad and disturbing story but it had many touching and inspirational moments","438":" the writing in this book a memoir written as a novel and recounted by a young girl whose privileged family lived through the horrors of the khmer rouge in the early 1970s is everything i don't like about writing flabby with unnecessary adjectives and too much description and yet it was utterly absorbing the story doesn't give you much in the way of political context for the khmer rouge either its past or its rise to power but it takes you into the heart of the terror and you live moment to moment frantic terrified as the story unfolds one reason i resented the descriptive pieces of the book is that i had to know what happened next as awful as it might be i can appreciate why the author included what she did aside from luck she survived this time by believing in the beauty of the physical world and wanted to bring that to life i want to learn more about this time in cambodia about its history and i encourage anyone interested in it to start here","439":"loved this book beautifully written difficult subject compelling characters highly recommend","440":"an amazing read about a time of horror for the people of cambodia the story is told with love and grace but it is always so hard to read about people who have to go through such times so amazing that people can come out of that and still want to live life","441":"this book is so many things at once beautiful horrifying and heartbreaking i really hope this one gets the attention it deserves full review to come when i can put my thoughts together more coherently","442":" this book tells the story of a young girl in cambodia during the time of the khmer rogue it took me a long time to get into this book and i stopped reading it several times to read other books so i think that prevented me from getting as invested in the story as i would have if i was more focused once i was able to focus more on this book i really liked it as you can guess by the subject matter it is full of heartbreak death and loss what struck me most was how little sense the cruel rule of the khmer rogue made families were torn apart and relocated from their homes because family bonds were not part of the revolutionary mindset people faced punishment or death for showing too much love to a family member or too much emotion over a death people who were educated or could read or speak a foreign language also faced persecution because the agrarian rural lifestyle was seen as best people living in cities were forced to become farmers none of this makes any sense as a way to build a functional society","443":"very good book based on a true story about a childhood during khmer rouge uprising in cambodia","444":"a beautifully tearful account of a little girl's journey from princess to refugee if you have a soul you should read this book","445":" i struggled through this book i did not know much about the cambodian war so i found it interesting to learn more about it but the story just dragged for me it was my november book club selection and i had to really force myself to pick it back up after i put it down to finish reading in fact i finished it via audio book on the drive up and back to a professional development conference two states away i had difficulty with the narrator being such a young girl her observations were a little too mature in places even for a young girl who knew the atrocities of war i know it was rather autobiographical that has been fictionalized so i really struggle to critique experiences the author had the writing was beautiful but while the story and the circumstances were compelling i just had difficulties connecting with any of the characters it did share some elements of a constellation of vital phenomena but i found that book far more powerful i do wonder if reading the two books back to back for october and november book club selections wasn't the best idea too much comparison and my mind was a little war weary from some of our recent selections","446":" this is a rather slow moving account of the atrocities perpetrated by the khmer rouge in cambodia betwwen their takeover in 1975 u0026amp their expulsion by viet nam in 1979 seen throught he eyes of a 7 year old girl raami whose father is of royal lineage initially expelled from their home in phnom penh u0026amp forcibly removed to farm labour they experience the wrath of kr because of their privileged background as did all intellectuals professionals or even just people who wore glasses her father reveals his identity to his captors while identifying the rest of the family as commoners in order to save them he disappears as does later his brother's wife u0026amp his 2 sons and 2 million other cambodians murdered by the kr in their attempt to purify society raami u0026amp her mother find temporary shelter with a kind old peasant couple but are then relocated to slave labour on rice fields where they are persecuted by the privileged local authorities and starved they do meet the surviving big uncle brother of the father who becomes demoralized u0026amp hangs himself ultimately they manage to smuggle themselves out to thailand where they will survive the account is poetic u0026amp has an infantile quality with no animosity or rancour towards their persecutors i found it it a bit tedious","447":"powerful story difficult to read at times because of horrible events but since it is based on real life experience the truth must be faced characters are wonderfully drawn there is a lot of spiritual light and faith and hope that keeps the little girl heroine strong and gives the reader insight as to how one survives such a terrible life i am now really curious to know what present day cambodia is like good book for a discussion group","448":"i did not know much about the when khmer rouge overran cambodia but this is an emotional fictionalized account based on the author's experience it was very moving sad but also hopeful story a great read","449":"i am currently reading the novel in the shadow of the banyan i am not yet sure if i would recommend it to other readers it is s very challenging book to understand in my opinion the book moves at a slow pace and it's very confusing i would only recommend it to readers who like history and books about war since the book takes place back during the revolutionary war in other words i am not enjoying the book so far","450":"beautifully written and a powerful story of survival","451":"there are times when i feel a little guilty for being such a pampered american and maybe even a little ashamed when i read about a significant time in another countries history that i know nothing about this was an astonishing story based on the real life experience of the author as a child in cambodia the events are heartbreaking but the writing produces some of the most beautiful lines i've read and re read and savored in a long time","452":"very sad i pretty much cried through the whole thing","453":"a beautifully written story the author takes you on an amazing journey of love survival redemption loss and the bonds of family the story unfolds from the voice of the seven year old main character and is based in the author's life i don't use the phrase achingly beautiful lightly but this is a book for any reader who loves to settle in with a book that will take you from the highs to the lows the author gives us a sense of the horrors and depravation of the cambodian killing fields and life and death under the khmer rouge but she tells it through the innocence of a child's experience loved this book and for anyone looking for a great bookclub selection this is it","454":"this is an incredible story of family and survival of terrible horror and tremendous beauty exquisitely written highly recommended","455":"incredible story actually a memoir of a child's survival of the khmer rouge regime horror outdone by the beauty of nature and goodness","456":"one of the best books i have read since cutting for stone 5 stars","457":" fictionalized account of the author's experiences of being a wealthy privileged 7 year old cambodian girl when the khmer rouge took over the country while the basics family separated sent to rural villages to be re educated witnessed torture and death of various family members and others were heart breaking the author tries to add mystical poetic touches via her poet story teller father which did not work for me and dragged the story down a bit even so it's still hard from the comfort and safety of my arm chair to imagine that so many people were able to live through the terrors imposed by that regime and continue on with their lives successfully truly a testament to human resilience and fortitude","458":" i would hesitate to guess that this book could be as easily classified as memoir instead of fiction the story is based on the author's childhood surviving the khmer rouge takeover of cambodia it's horrifying violent and tragic but it's also beautiful in the way she captures innocence and hope i learned much and felt deeply both things i find satisfying from a good \"socially responsible\" novel had i owned the words i would've told him what my heart intuited that joy and sorrow often travel the same road and sometimes whether by grace or misfortune they meet and become each other's companion","459":"i enjoyed the book mostly the history of what happened to the cambodian people it was a bit lighter which i liked because it was written through the eyes of a child i have been to cambodia and i wanted to understand such recent horrible history these people went through i understand it better now thanks to the author s","460":"beautifully written and a great story","461":" i can't say i enjoyed this but it opens your eyes to what happened in cambodia because of the extreme class divisions there i object to some of the choices made by the adults in her life but that's what makes this story so real so poignant they had to make decisions based upon what they knew in that moment no hindsight no 20 20 for many this will be a hard read its a book about war it ought to be hard i started out hating the poetic language heavy with similes but once you get into her rhythm you fall for this little girl who loved her papa more than anyone and learns to love her mother even more you know god exists after reading this book because there were too many accidents that kept these two women alive through some of the most devastating of circumstances i loved how her sounds came to life and how we got a glimpse of the native words that define the cambodian culture there is a rather romantic view of the world at heart here that softens the war view i found this to be to my liking i like to learn about the bad in the world to be better i don't want to drown in the depressing for the sake of drowning in the end i still hated her poetic language but at least it was there because of the character and the fact it fit the narrator the truth is the narrative sucks you in and makes you feel like you too are being thrust into a war zone as the book progresses this feeling isn't as strong you find yourself being put off at a distance to watch the aftermath of such experiences this is a little wonky at first as the narrative does a 180 in the middle of its story when you think about it though if you were in the situation yourself after so much pain and heartache you'd be desensitized you would be on autopilot just surviving otherwise you'd take the out that others in her family knowingly or unknowingly took pok and mae were my favorite characters in the book and i'd have loved to meet them in real life there is a lot of pondering on life and what it means to live and what it means to love those in our lives it sometimes means forgiving someone when you don't understand them in the moment and being willing to understand looking back this idea of storytelling being about enduring all that is bad that happens to you is a beautiful idea there is a lot good about this story that will cause you to reflect on your own life there are parts that are boring and you sort of wish were edited better read more about my love of her language here http perspectiveofawriter wordpress","462":"this was an incredible story about the survival of girl in cambodia during the time of the khmer rouge for this reason i love the historical fiction genre i knew nothing of the history of cambodia and the killing fields this author through her beautiful often poetic writing brought me to this time and shared the struggles and despair i've read quite a few holocaust books recently but had no idea of what had occurred during my lifetime in cambodia this book encouraged me to research and find out more so deserving of five stars","463":"i write because words give me wings 2095 even if i cannot touch you here you are always here 2411 life with all its cruelty and horror is still worth living while all else may vanish love is our one eternity it reflects itself in joy and grief 5347 bill's birthdate 1corinthians 13 13 and now these three remain faith hope and love but the greatest of these is love","464":"this new novel is written by a cambodian woman who lived throughthe communist khmer rouge takeover of the monarchy in 1975 it issemi autobiographical her family is part of the royalty and isharshly sent to a re education forced labor camp in the rice paddies the brutality and executions make every moment a trial brilliantlywritten account of one family's plight a","465":"this book was incredible it read like poetry more amazing because it was about such an ugly time in cambodia i wanted to remember every line what a talented new author i will read anything she writes in the future","466":"i'm still thinking about it","467":"this wad an amazing book i can't imagine having to go through a revolution and try to keep my family together","468":"beautifully written account of a child living through the khmer rouge revolution in cambodia based on the author's life","469":"excellent story one of the best books i have read in quite a while","470":"how can such a horrific story be so haunting and beautifully told through the eyes of a child","471":"absolutely brilliant must read","472":"i don't think i will ever forget this book or the horrors inflicted upon the people i greatly admire vaddey ratner for her wonderful writing and telling of the terrible atrocities her people endured","473":"in a country troubled by a viscious war a little girl writes the story from her point of view it's a story of inhuman suffering cruelty ignorant arrogance sadness and love it's beauty will haunt you long after you have finished reading it","474":"well written unbelievable story it didn't depress me like some books about such awful events do","475":"i'm not sure how to start i'm not even sure what to write for this review gosh this book in all its beauty this book informs us of the not uncommon juxtaposition of the most extreme horror and hope we humans are capable of conjuring and existing in vaddey ratner wrote about the khmer rouge the kr was a communist party in cambodia which resulted in approximately two million people dead this is a tough topic to think about at all for those affected by the khmer rouge so for ratner to write about this horror with such grace let alone even write about it i thank her i think i knew from the beginning before i even saw the book in real life that this book would be something i'd keep to heart especially to the special section of my roots and past despite just physically being ink printed onto paper each character would so tangibly arise in my mind raami and her family are so lovable so human i was almost scared to turn each page knowing this book was about the khmer rouge i knew the unspeakable suffering raami would endure and witness was completely inevitable refraining myself from turning pages wouldn't keep those in my roots and the other millions from dying i would remind myself raami's naivety curiosity dynamic thoughts about her tevodas and gods and goddesses and ghosts grief that grew from silence to a scream and even her poetic thoughts that some readers in my opinion wrongly deem too sophisticated for her age are all so real to me for a wisp of time the reader can almost understand what raami endured ratner wrote about these literal life ruining atrocities with such elegance and eloquence and that's one of the things that make this book so historically special because with the thought khmer rouge comes all the thoughts of killing fields and the corpses with their rotting screams i know she had actually left a lot of the torture and killing out but ratner wrote the khmer people's story unforgettably well those who survived this torturous regime generally escaped cambodia with a voice that was no longer existent after losing almost every single family member and all their will to live they'd enter refugee camps with hearts as empty as their pockets they would lock up those years of extreme anguish preferring the silence of thoughts over any emotion of suffering cracked open anew from reminiscence because of this the history of the khmer rouge became silenced too for the most part you don't learn about these massacres and their horrors in history class like all their loved ones and anybody they knew packed under the soil the cambodian people's voices were brutally driven into the ground vaddey ratner unearthed some of those voices very very well if raami were sitting here and watching me fiercely type this review she'd tell me to write that all of vaddey ratner's words are the ghosts of cambodia's deceased even if dead their spirits are still here she'd probably tell me they will still be heard through this book ratner spoke strong loud and clear for all of cambodia and that is why this book is so beautiful after all we are all echoes of one another","476":"this is such a authentically written book it was just hard to read because of the sadness and cruelty of the subject","477":"i registered a book at bookcrossing com http www bookcrossing com journal 13742674","478":" this book deserves every positive review it has received not only does it tell how a young girl survives cambodia's apocalyptic revolution in the 1970s but poetry throughout evokes a world of lyric beauty many times i found tears in my eyes from the tragic events that befell this family the young narrator never wavers in reporting what she sees even to losing hope and her own voice at the heart of this story is the question how does any family survive brutality and yet affirm what it means to be a compassionate human not an easy read but a very satisfying one","479":"so beautifully written based on the author's own experience in surviving the khmer rouge in cambodia haunting sad and beautiful all at the same time","480":"it's an astoundingly poetic and beautiful tale of a girl's experience during the oppressive time of the khmer rouge very worth reading","481":"one of the best books i've read in a long time","482":"i feel like i'm rating everything high but i really liked this book i always enjoying reading about stuff that i don't know anything about this story is about cambodia being taken over in the 70's it is not a happy story very sad but very interesting i feel very lucky to live where i live","483":"this book gave me a history lesson but was a very slow read and depressing had some beautiful pieces in it and a couple of interesting characters but no driving plot it wasn't awful but it wasn't great either","484":"a beautifully written u0026amp poignant novel that strikes your heart because it could very easily be a memoir and some things are taken from ms ratner's own history it would be a genuine heartfelt story in and of itself but the descriptive prose really takes it up a notch","485":"the first half of this book about the khmer rouge insurgency in cambodia during the 1970s is very slow the second half makes up for it though at times it's a little slow too it's so interesting that communism is intent on minimizing the influence of the family this is kind of a depressing story but is based on a true story","486":"one of the meanings of the word revolution is for an object to go completely around another thus returning to where it began or as some would say back to square one this book is an example of revolutionaries who would take apart what they considered a corrupt regime and replace it with another equally as rife with evil and corruption this story is told from the perspective of a child and the author admits that it is her story the kymer rouge seeks to rid itself of the vietnamese red and to purge the present system in cambodia raami and her family are rousted from their home in phnom penh and sent to the camps in the country where the new army will rout out all the intellectuals and minor royalty and attempt to teach the remaining people the virtues of the peasant life raami watches as her life devolves into chaos her family like all the families around are being separated starved and forced to work at futile tasks fear mongering keeps the soldiers unsteady and the families in constant flux from 1975 to 1979 raami manages to stay alive and watches in horror as her family numbers dwindle","487":" this novel may have affected me more profoundly than many readers because i visited cambodia two months before starting the book and could easily conjure vivid mental pictures of the landscape and people regardless i can't imagine anyone reading this story and not being extremely moved both by the beauty of the prose and the heartbreaking narrative typically i take book jacket blurbs with a grain of salt but in this case ravishing astonishing and masterpiece are not hyperbole this novel richly deserves every bit of attention it's garnered","488":"ratner writes with such a lyrical quality that breathes life and hope in the darkest moments of human despair this book is original imparting vernacular beliefs in spirituality that strengthens the human spirit an eye opener","489":"one of the finest books i've ever read breathtaking on all levels i hope they add this one to required reading lists at our schools and universities don't miss this one","490":"amazing exquisite read this book","491":"this book is extremely well written with delicacy and raw emotion based on a true account the author is excellent at gripping you to the characters and flooding the reader with visualizing feeling and even crying a tear or two throughout the book heartfelt and powerful this book stays with you long after you read the last page truly elegant and touching","492":" vaddey ratner's in the shadow of the banyan is her semi autobiographical account of her childhood in cambodia while the khmer rouge were wreaking death u0026amp terror upon the country raami our seven year old protagonist suffers through four years of starvation u0026amp forced labour seeing many of her family members die ratner has written a really great book she's found a beautiful way to tell the story of a terrible thing ratner's descriptions of the landscape and plants are beautiful cambodian folklore mythology are often referred to creating a beautiful and dream like contrast to the stark realities of war i enjoyed this book a lot u0026amp would recommend it to anyone who is interested in the literature of war and or south east asia while i can't find any fault with it it simply didn't have the wow factor to make it a five star read for me","493":"i really liked this book the language was lyrical but the story itself is heartbreaking this book gave me an inside view for what it was like for those victim to the khmer rouge i would highly recommend it i want to learn more about the author and her interesting life story","494":"this is probably one of the saddest books i have ever read i really don't like nor know that much about cambodian history so i was lost a bit as to that part i thought the book was too metaphorical for me just tell me what you want me to know and don't make me have to hunt for it i can see why some people thought it was good because of the struggle and the moral story of hope but it just wasn't my favorite","495":"this story is so sorrowful artistically and beautifully written it is the tale of a young girl amidst the cambodian genocide sometimes the descriptive artistry though beautiful was too much and i actually got bored with it the second half of the book was better though sadder than the first half","496":"really enjoyed this novel i hope she will write more","497":"based on the author's experience as a child in cambodia during the horrific years between 1975 and 1978 when the khmer rouge terrorized the country creating the infamous killing fields ' this is an amazingly lyrical piece of writing what could have been in the hands of a different writer a litany of torture and death is instead abeautiful heartbreaking story of love self sacrifice and survival this work prompted me to think again about an oft discussed topic in recent years what is the role of the western first world countries when genocide is occurring in far flung reaches of the world where we may or may not have financial military or political interests given our recent history in iraq and afghanistan does military intervention save lives or simply shorten the time of prolonged suffering bringing quicker deaths in the balkans africa syria would military intervention result in lives saved is it better to die incinerated by a bomb or by mutilation with a machete after wwii the world said never again and yet genocide continues to occur repeatedly can it ever be prevented a discouraging thought","498":"i had great expectations for this book and the first third and the ending third fulfilled that sadly the middle was weak and overloaded with poetic quotes much could have been edited out the child narrator seemed very scout like and a bit annoying in the middle section once i got over the middle hump i couldn't put this down and read way into the wee hours i recommend this","499":"3 5 touching story wish i would have read the author's note before i finished the book","500":"i read this while the electricity was out this afternoon i've heard glowing reviews about this one and it was nominated best fiction in the goodreads choice awards 2012 long list but i've seen glimpses of the book a while ago before that and bought it immediately i love the orange cover although the one in my possession had a boring cover of a banyan tree with branches red leaves and a green background the story is a semi autobiographical account of the author's own experiences as a child i am not sure which parts of the story are true and which are fictional but that's the best part about fiction it's the author's little secret as a cambodian raami and her family members were forced out of their homes by khmer rouge soldiers members of the revolutionary seeking chaos by mistake and naivette her mistake caused her father to be taken away from them and their identity threatened their safety one by one her family members perished and were separated until it was just raami and her grief stricken mother doing the best to provide for them and protect themselves it is through raami's eyes that we see everything through her young perspective that we interpret things through her eavesdroppings that we listen to hushed conversations through her feelings that we share her pain and sorrows i am actually glad that i get glimpses of people around raami through her narration it makes everything much more childlike and innocent therefore a little easier to bear although some parts are really gruesome and hard to go through nevertheless i love the characters they are so vivid and alive i love her parents best the lovely aana mama and the calm serene papa i love their chemistry their family dynamics their exchanged words those said and even unsaid i love raami's penchant for fairy tales as i am also a big fan of stories and myths i love how the fairy tales implicate what's in raami's life woven into them and how mama explains why she never told raami any stories when she was a child because she wanted to provide a reality for her instead of lovely stories to believe in it is sad and it is bittersweet i have tears on my eyes when i read some difficult chapters and in the end it is raami's spirits that take her to where she is and what she decides to become when i read it i can't help but be reminded of between shades of grey which i loved they cannot be compared the stories the friendships the battles are different but the essence is similar it is about the courage and hope one finds when everything else is stripped bare it is about finding strength even when all is lost a truly inspirational story with beautiful prose and cambodian mythological theme that blends nicely into the story","501":"this is an incredible document and a stunningly beautiful novel this is now part of the canon of southeast asian literature","502":"this was such a sad story even sadder to know it was based on the authors real life i had heard of this uprising in cambodia but didn't know just how horrible it really was i did find the writing to be really beautiful","503":"this is one of the most beautifully written books i have ever read loving historical novels but unsure i would relate to this story of the khmer rouge regime's take over of cambodia in 1975 1979 i decided to read it for the learning experience of different people soon i learned that living in a different place with different ideas do not change the human experience of love hate humility loss survival and more it is written so beautifully that even in the saddest events this book it is absorbed with deep resonance of human survival it is a book to read slowly and to always remember","504":"living the royal life one day running for their lives the next rammi and her family experience the nightmare that history will call the killing fields of cambodia when the khmer rouge takes over power in this small poor asian country in 1975 though this is a novel it is based on actual events in the author's life this story about a strong woman in a male dominated police state will stay with you long after you are finished with the book","505":"this one is hard to rate and i would probably give it a 3 1 2 star rating if i could it is well written and tells an important story much of the writing is beautifully descriptive but i found a lot of the dialogue to be stiff and overly formal and too meaningful to grab me emotionally","506":" it was an amazing read made me so sad and perversely my eyes were quite dry inspite of the heaving sobs in my mind this book portrays the mayhem and ruthlessness of the cambodian khymer rouge the red communist army who took over cambodia in the seventies causing all educated and well to do people to be displaced from their houses and made into farmers and labourers they hated education and finesse and wanted everyone to be bovine and mechanical they discouraged emotion and didnot even let people bury their loved ones the story follows raami a royal princess who was just seven when the chaos occured nad lost her royal father within a few weeks of the revolution then she saw most of her family get displaced or die off one by one leaving only her mother and herself towards the end when vietnam conquered cambodia and displaced the communist regime i fell in love with ayuramman raami's father who is one of the most cultured fictional characters i've ever come across i reveled in the love between father and daughter i pined for her poor mother i was devastated when her younger sister died i felt ashamed to have wasted so much food when i saw how those people ate insects off the land the list is continuous a few memorable lines 'stories are like the footpaths of the gods they lead us back and forth across time and space and connect us to the entire universe to people and beings we never see but who we feel exist' 'impermanence is the condition of all sentient existences nothing stays nothing lasts and we who cling and desire we are caught in an endless cycle of births and rebirths in the wheel of karma'animals are not like people if you leave them alone they won't hurt you but people will even if you've done no wrong they hurt you with their guns their words their lies and broken promises their sorrow ''we who mistakenly gave you away now reclaim you as one of our own' the gods are supposed to say when a baby dies","507":"i agree with all of the following that's been said about this book here on goodreads reviews 1 a powerful and moving book about a horrible part of world history the inception of the brutal khmer rouge regime in cambodia between 1975 and 1979 the author's well to do extended family thrown out of their home and into a work camp reduced to just the author and her mother by the time the vietnamese took over i doubt this is much of a spoiler knowing it involves the khmer rouge 2 rather a slow go much flowery prose and minutiae of he sat in the chair and put his chin in his hand then we rinsed the rice and boiled it well etc etc where was the editor these detailed and vivid memories of the author's own experience deserved to be respectfully and capably edited 3 told through the perspective of a child makes it a great story 4 you need to be in a frame of mind to read a harrowing book it is a you are there book regarding this time of history in cambodia and the author goes much easier on us than one might assume given the subject matter nevertheless it's a tough story about a horrible time if you're interested in knowing about this check it out decide for yourself","508":"difficult painful terrifying horrible that humans can do this to other humans amazing that someone can rise from it if this was an isolated case in history we could read this shake out heads and wonder that it ever happened that it isn't it this is continuing even now is beyond sad beautifully written only felt the prose was overblown a few times close and picturesque descriptions of the worst a human should never see let alone endure","509":"i have been trying to read this for a few months now i got about half way and just couldn't do it anymore i had to just out it down and forget about it i liked the story but the descriptions were so vivid and detailed that it took entirely too much energy to read about the shapes and colors of plants and the specific dress people adorned i tried to get through i just couldn't finish it anymore","510":"raami is seven years old when the khmer rouge come to power in cambodia and her life is changed forever her family was one of royalty with servants several large homes jewelry and privilege she is particularly close to her father a poet who tells her stories to help her lead a good life the family is relocated to increasingly more difficult refugee camps over the next four years raami endures the deaths of her family members starvation and forced labor at the hands of the khmer rouge she clings to the mythical legends and poems told to her by her father and fights for survival i didn't know very much about the khmer rouge before reading this novel but i was horrified and sickened by their behavior i can't imagine witnessing all the violence and loss that raami did and to find out that it is loosely based on actual events makes it even more horrific that being said i had a hard time connecting with raami she was supposed to be seven but much of the book read as being told by a person older than that the vocabulary and language the flowery prose did not fit a seven year old imo i think it would have worked better as an older person looking back and telling the story it was a slow read for me but i really appreciate what i learned and it documents an important event in history that needs to be recognized","511":"i really liked this book it reminded me of kite runner u0026amp 1 000 splendid suns it is so sad how these crazy govenments treat people","512":"a friend of mine recommended this book and i loved it from the moment i read the first pages it's the history of a rich family told by a little girl very touching the family is very rrich papa even is a prince and in the end they end up with nothing and family memebers don't survive the war and the pp regime what can people do to each other terrifying this is a book you should read","513":" i recently read never fall down by patricia mccormick that tells the story of arn chorn pond who is coerced into becoming a khmer rouge child soldier both that book and in the shadow of the banyan are novelized versions of a child's experience during the terror drenched reign of the khmer rouge but i think the former is a better less forced book by far mccormick's style is spare and depends heavily on chorn pond's own account of his ordeal while ratner's supposed child narrator speaks with an entirely adult voice that waxes so lyrical in many places that i began to skim not the reaction the author wants when writing of horrors inflicted on children","514":" i bought this book at the airport in siem reap cambodia the day i left the country this book captured my heart in the same way that the country and its people did how can someone possible write such a horrible historical account in such a beautiful way vaddey ratner did so in a wonderful way as i read the book i kept thinking of our guides sopal and dara both with with their own tragic stories lived at the same time than ratner maybe they were in the same rice field hunting together for something to eat or the same ox cart a big applause to vaddney ratner for her beautiful full of hope words intertwined with dirt hunger losses blood my prayers are for you","515":"this book is beautifully written it is based on the author's own experiences in cambodia when the khmer rouge regime came into power it is a story that will haunt you don't miss it","516":"the first 80% of the book was ok maybe 2 5 stars and the ending was really good 4 stars a sad story but it didn't seem like what a young child would say or think","517":"this book reminded me of khaled hosseini's books in that there were words and things i felt i needed to look up along the way as i read the book for some people that might be off putting but i don't mind it i like learning more about another culture in that way although i suppose you could just read it and not look up anything you would still get the big picture and be able to follow the story line the language is a little more flowery and less direct than in some novels but it is not so dense as to be a difficult read it did take me a little longer to read each page than some books but that may be because i wanted to appreciate the language and the culture and respect the horror of that period in cambodian history i was worried about how the book would end that it would be dismal and depressing especially since there is not much that is light or happy about what happened under the khmer rouge so i was relieved at the tone of the ending but i was not necessarily satisfied by the plot or story line in some ways it felt like the author simply needed to end the story but based on the author's note it sounds like this was really what happened so i guess i can't really criticize that too much the author has my utmost respect and i look forward to reading more by her in the future","518":"the story situation is so so sad and painful there was compelling imagery but something was missing the point of view of the child was close but not quite right","519":"this is one of the best books i've read this year and maybe the last 2 years in the shadow of the banyan reminds me a bit of the kite runner this is a tragic story and difficult to read at times and yet the hopefulness of mankind comes through ratner's story of love loss memories and hope is memorable i remember details about the killing fields but i don't recall hearing about this time told in such a moving way although ratner wrote this as a fictional novel it is based on her experiences as a child during the kymer rouge i will never forget her story the strength and love of her parents the human drive for survival one of the reviewers stated that he thought this was more a book for women that it was women giving the high reviews i believe this statement is far from true this book is about love of family and love of country and the evil that can happen when a group the organization takes all freedom away from humanity i believe there are lessons here for all man or woman adult or child we are told to never forget the holocaust we need to never forget the killing fields of the kymer rouge thank you vaddey for sharing your true story through the memories of raami a 7 year old girl bravo for such a beautifully written book","520":"this book is so beautifully written that if felt like poetry a powerful and heart wrenching story about the will to survive during the khmer rouges reign in cambodia","521":"i thought this book was very well written i felt so many things in reading it sadness tenderness loving and just sickened at the atrocities that occured the holocaust all over again in such a small country it amazes me that the khmur was able to do these things and get away with them such a strong spirit that raami had to be able to come thru this","522":" not my cup of tea it was a really really well written book and very strong effort but my perception going into this book was way off and therefore made it very hard for me to read the book and i ended up not being able to finish it the story did tend to drag off a lot in descriptions and by the end of my reading it i felt like the central story was being lost as we just explored the life of raami as she go's through these events it almost anne frank like the book felt much more non fiction autobiographical than fiction i don't know really what i was expecting i guess some historic story told from almost a imaginative eyes of a child ratner wrote a great book of an important topic many still go uneducated about i was glad to have learned what i did from it and hope to finish it one day to research more on the topic","523":"fascinating historical novelwhile reading this absolutely phenomenal book i felt like i was experiencing a history lesson i had no problems with the unfamiliar names of characters or places the story line was easy to follow and the author actually had pictures streaming through my mind i would recommend this lovely story to any adult over 18","524":"this was a hard book to read let me start by saying that i know very little about the background of the genocide that happened in cambodia but seeing it from the eyes of a child was painful though the writing style is not the style that i'm used to enjoying it did convey what it needed to pass on to the readers still this took me a long time to read because it hurt me deeply","525":" i cannot put into words the roller coaster of emotions driven by this novel the novel was beautifully written descriptive in such carefully chosen words that painted a picture of beauty amongst such turmoil hatred and devastation this is a novel that should be read by everyone i never know the tragedy that had befallen the cambodian people how horrible a life and how amazing the survival it is very few and far between that i find a novel that has changed me in some way made me a better person for having read it this novel has done that thank you for sharing your story","526":"i was dreading reading this after reading one depressing book about a terrible part of history moving onto a book about the cambodian genocide so i put it off for a while but even though it's on such a heavy scary topic it's beautifully written i wasn't surprised that it's semi autobiographical either","527":"i know this is told through the eyes of a young girl which would naturally provide a limited amount of info of this historic event but i wanted more details more back story of the family and their obvious titles as royalty that it hints too seemed slow until middle of book and then the ending was so so and seemed abrupt","528":"this novel is a semi autobiographical tale of what happened to the author's family living as royalty in phnom penh in 1975 when cambodia was overtaken by the khmer rouge a radical communist group fighting the vietnamese at the time they attempted to drive the rich out into the country to work with the peasants in an effort to redistribute wealth and set up a socialist government the story is narrated by raami a 7 year old girl with a brace from having suffered polio who lives with her father a prince her mother and baby sister radana they are run out of their luxurious compound forcefully and join a stream of other inhabitants being driven from the town the first pages establish their lifestyle filled with privilege and ancient stories her father much beloved by raami is a writer and has tried to raise her to appreciate the old ways and the country's ancient traditions now they are on the run with their extended family uncle big aunt indie the twins tata and queen mother they take as much as they can but as they are moved from village to village and work harder than they could ever imagine both their possessions and family slowly are reduced and destroyed papa is taken away early in the book as a member of the detested upper class when he is recognized as a famous poet and writer now mama formerly a pampered wife has to step up and gain strength it is probably she who changes the most and becomes a survivalist they take refuge first in an old school getting their own classroom and the whole family stays together for a while and adapts then they are split up and raami chooses to stay with mama a decision she later questions for four years they work sometimes digging embankments for the flooding of the monsoon and then the planting of rice shoots they never get enough to eat and mama trades their possessions for food as they starve the brutality is horrifying and to live through this kind of inhumanity must have taken endurance courage and resolve possessed only by the strongest among us the author uses much of what she saw in her own life to make this vivid and believable the details stay with the reader long after the book is completed later they stay for a while with a older couple pok and mae who accept them and love them as the children they never had but so desperately wanted overall it is a great tale of survival in the killing fields and the strength of the human spirit family love and the belief that good will prevail however the language seems a bit overly poetic for a 7 year old girl using words and observations no child would ever have i found that very distracting i think if she could have told it from the viewpoint of an adult looking back then adding those comments as she reflects upon certain points that would have been a better choice too many flowery words and unrealistic comments by a young child cluttered the story and made it unrealistic to me","529":"beautiful lush rich and so very tragic this book resonated with me quite a lot because my sister in law is also a cambodian refugee whose father's health was broken in the killing fields of the khmer rouge the author chose to write a novel rather than a memoir because she was so young when everything happened she cannot recall the exact details raami awakens to find the world has completely changed she is no longer a daughter of privilege but a hated undesirable forced to flee with her mother after her father is killed across a landscape of poverty surviving on bugs and grass but she remains a child of empathy amidst the carnage and brutality seeking reconciliation with her past","530":"thank you mona again another great read","531":"this book is really well written and tragedy filled without becoming sappy or overly sentimental it's heartbreaking to think that this terrible event happened and decimated a 1 3rd of the cambodian population and i have never been taught about it in a public school it is so important for everybody to recognize the devastation of war not just in bloodshed but in the destruction if lives the plight of the refugee is far too often unseen","532":"beautiful poetic language surrounds this sad story of the killing fields of cambodia this author is an amazing woman","533":"we're reading this for a book club and i neglected to add it to my books when i read it a couple of months ago the khmer rouge's attack on civilization and on their own people was horrific i was entranced by the story again after having forgotten my interest when it happened the characters and story line were well done although i felt some characters needed more depth however story editors need to make compromises somewhere an interesting book","534":"milk mother said that stories are like footpaths of the gods they lead us back and forth across time and space and connect us to the entire universe to people and beings we never see but who we feel exist this horrifying memoir tells us how a country devoured its people and its history out of greed and a lust for power the language used is soft and poetic rather than sharp and destructive it is unbelievable that anyone let alone a child could survive this","535":" probably more a 3 5 than a straight up 3 vaddey ratner's novel in the shadow of the banyan tells the story of raami a 7 year old growing up in the capital of cambodia phnom penhher her idyllic childhood is disrupted as the khmer rouge come to power and instigate a cambodian genocide which killed by some estimates a third of the cambodian population humanity man humanity i think this is a good novel and it speaks to the power of hope and love in the face of startling brutality and inhumanity at the same time the pacing in the novel seems uneven i think some sections of the novel linger just a bit too long though while i say that i also recognize intellectually the purpose of several of those moments to establish themes and characters still i wish the narrative was just a bit more swift of foot i liked it didn't love it and i think it could serve as a good novel in the classroom to begin examining genocide and modernity's reaction inaction","536":"heartbreaking and moving it will bring you to tears this story will stick with me for quite some time i'm grateful to the author for sharing her story as she takes us into her heart revealing the horrors of evil and the strength of family","537":"i liked what i read i just couldn't get through it the story was interesting but i would get distracted by her off shoot tales thoughts she interjected","538":"this book was a poetic beautiful tragedy it had times of hope times of pain and times of redemption","539":"i received this book through goodreads first reads i absolutely loved this book beautifully written i enjoyed this book immensely from the very first page to the very last page i will definitely be recommending this book to everyone i would give this book 6 stars if i could","540":"wow what an emotional journey i am grateful that ms ratner was able to tell this story so that others may understand the struggles and terrible injustice some have had to endure brava she has told a poetic and vivid tale one i'm sure it will stay with me for a life time","541":"a very heavy book there is a lot of suffering and loss it is based loosely on the author's experience of the cambodian genocide she is a very resilient little girl but more sad moments than happy in this book","542":"it was ok fairly sad and a little boring the writing is pretty good but the story was a little drawn out at times","543":"beautifully written but a little slow i kept waiting for more to happen","544":"love the poetry within the story the story itself is heartbreaking but well written","545":"it is a story of a 7 years old raami who is a member of cambodian royal family as the story unfolds it completely moves from a life lived in privilege to a life at the brink where one is faced with deprivation starvation suffering and hopelessness the account of horrors committed by cambodian khmer rouge are heart wrenching the way families were split and the way it impacted everyone including raami was very painful to witness i was immensely moved by her personal suffering her loss of her father loss of her extended family and than losing her country this is definitely not an easy book to read but despite being that it is an extremely moving and touching account of what happened to a family as a result of war at times it moves you to tears raami conversation with her father is beautiful how she remembers what she has lost is touching and unforgettable despite all the horrors she manages to survive and that says a lot about human spirit its resilience its ability to rise against all the odds i really enjoyed this book and would encourage others to read this and take a peek into cambodian history but it is not for the faint hearted","546":"beautiful and tragic i really knew nothing about the revolution in cambodia other than having a refugee girl at my church camp in 5th grade such a sad story but it's filled with strength and determination as well i can't even imagine going through what these people went through and so many were are exactly my age","547":"very good book and well written i enjoyed this historical novel about a period in history i knew nothing about good character development and story","548":"beautifully written but unrelentingly sad the author really inhabits the mind of a little girl what a terrible human tragedy the cambodian people endured","549":"knowing and understanding is not the same as experiencing to vaddey ratner thank you for sharing these experiences read this book because it is powerful and remember those lost because we didn't pay enough attention","550":" wow another great book __in the shadow of the banyan__ written about the authors life as a fictionalized memoir this book was written to honor her fathers spirit and of her desire to give voice to his memory and to all those who lost their lives in cambodia during the time of the khmer rouge and their horrible genocide of their own people the people she mentions in the book are true family members and people she met during that time instead of just focusing on the genocide the loss or the tragedy of what the khmer rouge did she focuses more on the will of the people to stay alive their choice of life if at all possible the story is told through the eyes raami the young 7 year old daughter based on the author who was 5 years old when this took place the author writes in a beautiful and quite often lyrical way making raami seem older than she is yet giving us the reader a detailed descriptions of almost everything from insects to people to her inner thoughts mixing in wonderful dose of stories and poems it is hard to read about the suffering the country went through yet we are given a lot of its beauty as well","551":"raami is seven when they come and her idyllic world of privilege is shattered she has grown up a princess her father a prince and her grandmother a queen enjoying wealth and all that any little girl could possibly desire although she suffered polio at a young age and walks with the aid of leg braces to help correct her limp she is happy and her family consisting of her mother father younger sister aunt and grandmother are all loving then her whole world changes the soldiers force them out of their homes into the streets with only what they can carry no more can they be tied to anything such as a home they are told they are part of the rebuilding process their cooperation will help build a newer stronger cambodia threatened with death if they do not comply raami and her family make their escape in their car to their summer home where they meet up with her uncle his wife and their twin sons but they do not get to enjoy the peace there for long forced on by the soldiers to a village camping out in what was once a school the people from this area have been displaced too - no one is to care for anything too much they are told the organization will take care of them ties are no longer important - husbands and wives children and parents their jobs are to work for the greater good of the organization things get even worse for raami when her family is split up - she is taken with her mother and younger sister to another location where they are to live with an older married couple who have never been able to have children and work in the rice fields the conditions are harsh and things only get worse for them as they are yet again forced to move on starvation is common disease and illness even more so but raami is determined to fight for her survival in the shadow of the banyan details the point in cambodia in 1975 when the khmer rouge turned the country upside down i read another book earlier this year featuring the country but it was more about the life of a family that had fled finding new homes in europe and the usa this one focuses on the country for the entire book and i immediately wanted to read it to see what it would've been like to experience that raami's ordeal very much mirrors that of the author i'm all too aware that i'm lucky to have grown up where i did and i've never had to face anything remotely resembling what took place in cambodia in the 1970s all the more reason to want to learn about it and try and understand what it must have been like for the people that had to suffer through it in writing the novel through the eyes of a child we are spared a lot of the political propaganda raami is just seven the most important thing to her is the attention of her parents and escaping her 'milk mother' she is old enough to understand what is happening in that they are being forced out of the only home she has ever known against their will but she doesn't not know why it is happening her father attempts to explain things to her - he is a prince with the soul of a poet and the two of them share a special relationship which is a large portion of this book she idolises her father even before she loses him to this rebellion and many of her actions and thoughts that come after that are in response to what he would have wanted or what she thought he would have wanted her to do in contrast raami and her mother must work towards an understanding after the two of them have been through so much separation heartache and despair there is a simplicity in this prose that makes the story all the more powerful although we are not treated to acts of gratuitous violence there are a few simple moments that occur in this book - raami witnessing an old man being shot in the head at point blank range the death of children etc that for me ram home the terrible atrocities that occurred during this time what could be more disconcerting for a population than to be forced out of the familiar into what is unfamiliar to leave their homes only to be told to go and live in the home of another knowing that somewhere the people from this home were in an unfamiliar part of the country to them going through exactly the same thing there is such a state of confusion a lack of knowledge and instruction from the soldiers lots of shouting about the organization but as raami muses on no one seems to know exactly what the organization is at one stage she meets a man and wonders if he is the organization the words often repeated are utterly meaningless in the shadow of the banyan is a stunning story beautifully written it made me cry more than once hitting me with one of the things that is always guaranteed to bring me to tears in a book it's a wonderful tale one of loss despair heartbreak and also of hope and love a family that were to be admired that had unspeakable things done to them that suffered in all manner of ways it was a book that was hard to read at times for the feelings it stirred up but one that was utterly well worth it","552":"i was very moved by this book true story of cambodia under the khmer rouge told by a young girl who lost most of her family faced torture and starvation and all the horrors of pol pot regime the story is told by the young girl who becomes a refuge and eventually migrates to the us and graduates from cornell university beautifully written and poignant highly recommended","553":"this novel was one of the most beautifully written books that i have read in a long time unfortunately it was also one of the most depressing books that i have read in a long time as well this piece of historical fiction told of a family's struggle i use that term loosely during the khmer rouge takeover of cambodia this is not the fun beach read but if you are looking for an extremely sad and depressing pseudo memoir this book is for you","554":"taking place from 1975 1979 a moving story of resilience and love during cambodia's ruthless khmer rouge regime","555":"very descriptive written you feel the characters emotions so vividly very deeply moving be ready to cry throughout this story","556":"if i could i would give this book six or seven stars it is a passionate powerful and moving view of life in cambodia under the khmer rouge's genocidal regime","557":"i received this book through goodreads' first reads giveaway 3 5 starsthis is a bittersweet tale told from a child's perspective of life during the khmer rouge take over in cambodia i appreciated the beautiful poetry and traditional storytelling in the novel as the world around her drastically changes raami matures in her relationships with her family members especially with her mother and begins to see that things aren't always as they appear at times the word choice was awkward though somewhat fitting for a child's voice of 7 or 8 years of age this would be a great read for middle and high school students","558":"as i predicted as with all civil unrest stories set in asia rich people get sent to work camps half the family dies or gets killed or gets separated with that disclaimer the story is still pretty good and worth the two days of beach reading it took","559":"slow didn't hold my interest","560":"i'm always amazed when you find a book with history told through the eyes of a child it makes it a little more heartbreaking as you piece together what's actually going on but in this book it also allowed for a bit more magic as raami shared her observations of people and places in a childlike way definitely a good read","561":"all the good things written about this book have great substance my slight disappointment was only in the fact that there was room to show and tell much much more depth of the atrocities and horror perpetrated by the khmer rouge","562":"s poetic language of love hope and endless spirit this book left me speechless spellbound and completely blown away amidst so much suffering there is eloquence beauty and grace in this author's poetic language of love hope and endless spirit","563":"this is one of the most sorrowful and heart breaking beautiful and powerful books i've read it tells the story of a young girl from a wealthy family as they are persecuted by the khmer rouge in cambodia during the late 1970's the book parallels the author's own hellish childhood experiences until she was able to escape to the united states i don't know if such sorrow could be endured by the reader if this story had not been told through a child's eyes her realizations of profound truth both joyful and painful wouldn't be as potent coming from an adult's perspective there is something about the resilience of children that makes suffering incredibly terrible and yet hopeful i wouldn't recommend this book lightly even though it's changed me and touched me deeply my family could tell when i had been reading by my gloomy brooding moods but if you're will to endure the pain you'll be rewarded with a moving and beautiful experience","564":" in the shadow of the banyan by vaddey ratner is a heartrending story of the adversity faced by one young cambodian girl during the rule of the khmer rouge the author having lived through these same extraordinarily brutal times in phnom penh writes in artful prose a novel that transports readers to a time in the life of the young girl raami who endures more brutality violence persecution and despair in 4 years than most people could imagine over a lifetime while these horrific life experiences are masterfully illustrated by ratner the novel pulls from such terrifying realities something that overcomes the evils committed by the khmer rouge - the inspiration raami draws from those who have left indelible positive prints on her memories most importantly raami finds perseverance by her recollections of her father's poetry a mechanism by which she is able to cope with the atrocities she has witnessed and lived through brilliantly crafted in the shadow of the banyan is a must read for those readers interested in learning of the extremely violent times in cambodia in the 1970s but with that knowledge and understanding readers should be forewarned that humanity can be and was in these times graphically brutal making some passages very difficult to read while in the shadow of the banyan was difficult at times i am deeply grateful for being given the opportunity to read ratner's book and believe in the shadow of the banyan would make for an excellent albeit difficult discussion group pick","565":"years ago i read first they killed my father i would call that soft core holocaust porn and this one is hard core interestingly enough both are written from the point of view of a young child but hey who else might have survived that horror between these two readings i have visited phnom penh seen the killing fields spoken with people who survived the khmer rouge madness it is a definition of terror the starvation is the worst reading about the pain in the stomach how they saw the communal kitchen staff fat the kids with the distended bellies the adults who carve down to bones and sinew the randomness and uninformed rantings of the youthful leadership brought terror to the reader as well as of course to the characters the revolutionary leaders were corruptible despite their rantings about purifying the nation the book was written by a woman whose family was directly related to the royal family they were educated intellectuals exactly the target of the revolution they were relocated to villages and farming communes moving often to allow for no ties to local peasants while it was a work of fiction the author says it was based on her own experiences it was hard to read but people need to learn more about this experience it cannot happen again","566":"can't speak highly enough about this book you want it on your shelf","567":" while not a memoir ratner draws heavily on her own experience being displaced from her home during the khmer rouge revolution in cambodia to write this novel she didn't have a clear enough memory enough mementos or enough surviving relatives to tell the story as a non fiction tale also the most salient theme of the novel is the power of storytelling so it's fitting that she allow the power of the human imagination reign in her book the protagonist of the novel is a seven year old girl with polio who is a member of a royal household she's very attached to her father a poet and a scholar soon her world is shattered as soldiers thrust her and her extended family from their home they move from place to place over the period of a few years suffering hardships and loss with each removal nevertheless her father's poetry his manner and his advice fortify her through each ordeal both beautiful and horrifying this novel brought a richer understanding of the horrors faced by the cambodian people as communist revolutionaries ravaged the country for several years it's a strong testament both to the evils people can perform and the triumph of the human will","568":"the prose of this book is beautiful poetic and heartrending the story of cambodia though a violent one is told through the eyes of a child the love of family and the strength of the individual is an amazingly redeeming quality of this story you will be moved to tears numerous times","569":"while i thought the book was beautifully written the narrators voice was in my opinion too eloquent to that of a 7 10 year old child it took an effort on my part as a reader to try not to let that bother me as i read i thought her story was a powerful one and one that i am glad i read overall it was worth the read","570":"an incredibly beautiful account from a survivor of the khmer rouge in cambodia","571":"out of the depths of despair i couldn't quite get to grips with the fact this was happening in such recent history it must have been difficult to write but well worth the effort for her sake as well as her country's some fantastic philosophical ideas and mantras from her father a story ultimately of hope in the future the family and right defeating evil wrong","572":"i think it's safe to say that this is the saddest book i have ever read honestly it made me sob and i can't think of any other book that has done that the novel is a horrific yet beautiful and poetic tale from a child's point of view of the atrocities that took place in cambodia during the 4 year reign of the khmer rouge it's based on the author's own life story but is not a memoir as such certainly it is a testament to the incredible will to live and the capacity to hope for something better that most human beings possess but i tell you humanity sadly has a long way to go","573":"this book was very well written but i kept comparing it to other books of the same subject situation and i found this one lacking i got halfway through before i lost interest","574":"review and excerpts to come","575":"beautifully written and moving account of the khemer rouge reign of terror in cambodia","576":" in 1975 the khmer rouge took over phnon penh in cambodia and declared a new government to keep you is no gain to kill you is no loss was the message the revolutionists constantly repeated as they brutalized those they took captive the author of this book was 5 at the time and says that in essence this is her story raami in whose voice the story is told is 7 when she and her family are taken from their home into the country to make them into people of the revolution for almost four years those who survived endured unspeakable treatment and conditions and yet through all this the message seems to be that even with all this cruelty and horror life is still worth living the book will break your heart ut it is beautifully written","577":"amazing how she can write so beautifully about such horrific events is a testament to her strength and talent","578":"heard an interview with the author on npr and was so touched by her story and the love she has for her fathter that i had to buy this book what a great read it is written as fiction but depicts the real life events of a family in cambodia who get displaced under the khmer rouige it's very hard to read only because it's so tragic but you can't put it down because this little girl raami and her mother are so determined to live if only for the memory of their father husband who gave himself to ensure their safety i blew through this book couldn't put it down i'll probably read it again someday","579":" it's hard to believe this is ratner's first novel she is such a stunning lyrical writer i feel a bit lucky to have randomly picked this one up while roaming a book store i had only periphery knowledge of cambodia's history and ratner brought me there and inspired me to research more i was talking with my students about independent reading yesterday about the joy of the moment your genesis when you're inspired to learn more about a topic because of a book we also talked about the difference between a teacher forcing you to uncover a theme that he she may already have in mind and when that theme comes from yourself there is value in both i argue but i shared that while i was reading this text i thought about the power of story as a life saver as the recurring theme i've always been a fan of fredrick the mouse by leo leoni about a field mouse who collects sensory memories to share with his fellow mice during the cold winter months in the same way the protagonist uses the stories of her father to get her through an absolutely torturous few years by writing this text from the first person point of view we are with the protagonist the entire time one particular scene that is stuck in my memory is when the protagonist's father is talking to her about poetry \"poetry is like first all you have is a line weaving through your mind like the tail of a child's kite unfettered by reason or rhyme \" her father is a poet and she is separated from him when she is pulled from her family and relocated to a refugee camp by soldiers the way she survives this external conflict is by rolling her fathers words around and around in her mind in this way their relationship never ends and stories save her life","580":"the descriptive text of this book is like poetry which i think helps ease the content it is unbelievable what the characters who are based on the author's own life endured should make an interesting book discussion","581":"4 1 2 stars beautifully written my book group discussed this today and it is unanimous we all loved it it made for an interesting discussion as well","582":"i seem to be the only one who didn't absolutely love this one i really think it's a well written novel that gave me insight into a time u0026amp place in history that i wasn't as aware of as i should be there were parts that were so beautifully written that they took my breath away but there were also parts that i felt dragged and made me almost want to put it down as a result i have to give it 3 stars definitely worth reading although it didn't wow me as much as i would have hoped","583":"beautifully written this tore my heart up","584":"this should have been an interesting story but for some reason it just wasn't engaging","585":"amazing story of survival during the khmer rouge regime in cambodia between 1975 1979 although fiction the author tells her own story using beautiful language filled with intense emotion describing her family's ordeal","586":"this is very nearly non fiction it took me a while to get beyond the unbelievable narration of this story by a 7 9 year old if you choose to read this beautiful book and i think you should just know upfront that you should just let it go p s the setting is cambodia in the '70s be prepared for heartbreak","587":"although this is a novel it is at least partially autobiographical the author like the main character was the child of educated and well to do family in cambodia at the time the khmer rouge overthrew the government in 1975 she was 5 years old at the time and the raami the lead character was 7 the story follows raami as she and her family suffer tragic and brutal treatment by the communist revolutionaries the story covers 4 years at which time the khmer rouge were being driven out by the vietnamese army and raami is escaping to a new life this is a time and place that should be of great interest to americans who lived through the vietnam war i recommend it for that reason it provides a first hand perspective on events that shaped southeast asia during a turbulent time","588":" in the shadow of the banyan is a moving account of one of the modern world's worst atrocities the khmer rouge's murderous reign in the 1970's this story takes what we've read in history books and recounts it as life lived u0026amp breathed u0026amp lost raami is a 7 year old girl trying to make sense of the sudden upheaval in her world why do they have to leave their nice house in phnom penh so suddenly why can't she tell anyone that her father is a prince and why must she lie about her mother's role only in glimpses of brutality does raami finally begin to understand the severity of what's happening her father's parting words stories u0026amp poetry is what pushes raami to survival after losing so much in the almost 4 years of the devastating khmer rouge rule i love the country of cambodia so so much and i wish i actually loved this book more but i really struggled through it getting lost in the stories u0026amp the poetry and the buddhist philosophy i only truly connected with the story once i read the author's note afterward when i found out how closely the story was based on her life u0026amp family either way i'd still recommend the book especially for someone wanting to know more about cambodia's tragic history then read never fall down by patricia mccormick way better for all the loss u0026amp tragedy i have known my life has taught me that the human spirit like the lifted hands of the blind will rise above the chaos u0026amp destruction as wings in flight afterword","589":"a great book about a young girl during the genocide in combodia one of the best novels i have read in my life i cant wait to read this writers next book","590":"chris cleve author of little bee could not have described this book better when he said it is utterly heartbreaking and impossibly beautiful all books will have a new standard in which to measure gorgeously and propounding written truly a story that should not and will not be forgotten","591":"on of the best books i've ever read lyrical poetic inspiring horrifying all at the same time vaddey ratner is a gifted writer and an inspiring human being","592":" not since the book thief have i read a novel that was both soaringly beautiful and heartbreakingly tragic at the same time the writing was gorgeous the story moving and terrible and yet always vital i can only imagine how difficult it was for the author to write this book since it's essentially the story of her own childhood i'm glad she found the strength and resolve to do it this is a book i didn't necessarily want to read given the description but i sensed i needed to read it and i was right i knew very little about the khmer rouge and while this story is hardly a history lesson it does inform the author has a truly poetic style -- it breathes life into her characters pours color into her settings and breeds hope that love will always outlast sorrow","593":"this novel which takes place in cambodia is about a royal family displaced by the war i normally like this type of story told through the eyes of a child but i was bored out of my mind during the second half the point of view just wasn't believable and it was too slow for me but admittedly i read this while on vacation so maybe i just wasn't in the right mood","594":" this was an excellent book it is hard to describe why this book is so compelling but i have to say that i learned a lot when i describe the book to others it sounds depressing but it is honestly a book of hope and gave me a different perspective on my own life it never ceases to amaze me the people who have been through the most harrowing experiences remaining intact optimistic and seemingly grateful for life in spite of the incredible trials they have endured like elie wiesel and corrie ten boom two highly inspiration people and holocaust survivors vaddey ratner is every bit as remarkable she is a hero this story is a novel not a memoir but based on her real life experiences and what makes it even more remarkable is english is not her first language but she is a superb author it took a lot of strength and time and effort for her to write this account and i am thankful for it we hear so much about the vietnam war but i had never heard about the plight of the cambodian people and the genocide that was happening there in the mid to late 70's i think it is so important to know these things and if you are going to take a history lesson this is the best way to do it read the book you won't regret it","595":"a haunting and devestating story about the khmer rouge in cambodia during the 70's the story is told from the point of view of a 7 year old girl beyond the violence of a country in turmoil it is a well written novel about loss and an eduring mother daughter relationship the story stands on its own but the beautiful writing sets it apart it broke my heart i don't know how people survive such tragedies","596":"certainly makes you appreciate living in the u s very moving story with the history of that period in cambodia woven throughout","597":"unbelievably beautiful and moving and also devastating that the story and suffering is based on real events the emotions that come through ratner's writing are so raw and so real the writing is beautiful poetic if not a little mature for a narrator only 7 years old i like that ratner didn't choose to highlight certain atrocities that though a documented part of history tend to be prevalent in most stories of this nature she stayed away from a lot of cliche plot lines making this book unique","598":"beautifully written and disturbing that it is almost a memoir it's amazing how the author paints such vivid pictures with her words the relationships between the daughter and her parents is touching","599":"ratner wrote this book which is based upon her life when she was growing up in cambodia during the revolution interweaving fiction with fact ratner draws a picture from a 7 year old's perspective as to what did happen and what else might have happened during this time the book is beautifully written ratner the daughter of a poet clearly gets her feel and sound for language from her father one criticism of the book is that it is told from the perspective of a young child but the voice and tone of the book doesn't match up well with that approach this conflict didn't ruin the book for me but some of my more sensitive reading friends would likely be bothered by this issue another issue that i had was the lack of detail around the revolution there were references to the us bombing of cambodia but nothing else from a historical perspective which made the book fall a bit flat for me all in all though a solid read that i would recommend","600":"\"in the shadow of the banyan\" by vaddey ratner published by simon u0026amp schuster category - fiction literaturethe reviews of this book have been excellent and i could not wait to read it the story is fiction but relies heavily on the real life experiences of the author a young girl in cambodia who comes from an affluent family finds her life completely turned around when the khmer rouge come into power her family is up rooted from their home and is transferred to several different villages in rural cambodia instead of being part of the nobility they become common workers they are able to subsist by selling or trading off valuables that they were fortunate enough to take with them the young girl raami must overcome the separation of her family the loss of her father and the violence and starvation that she must face day after day it is hard to imagine but the khmer rouge in only four years of power killed an estimated two million people this book is definitely geared toward the woman reader i found it to be slow moving and not very interesting and it was a struggle to get to the end if one looks at the positive reviews they are all by women and probably well deserved if you are interested in reading this book i highly suggest that you read the reviews and determine if the subject matter would be of interest to you","601":"loved this book at first i thought it was moving so slowly then i realized that it had to move that way to reflect the magic of the stories that the characters lived by and as it moved i felt the suffering just as the author had her main character and her family suffer it was gripping and mystical and ended with the hope of overcoming the worst and choosing life","602":"in the shadow of the banyan is a story of a girl known as raami who loses her whole family except her mother to the wrath of the khmer rouge regime i recommend this book to those who are interested in the cambodian genocide","603":"i surprised myself by really liking this book despite the fact that the author's story is is tragic understanding the atrocities that took place not that long ago in cambodia under the khmer rouge is so important as we sit and watch similar tragedies in syria the book which is largely autobiographical is softened by the fact that the story is told by a child and by the strong relationship between the author and her father i found the book difficult to put down i highly recommend it","604":"3 5 4 stars i really enjoyed the story but found the book slow moving at times and didn't like that the narration was done through such a young child's perspective","605":" i didn't know so much sadness could exist in so small a placethis must be one of the most exquisitely written books i've read in a long time it's based on the authors own experience during the regime of cambodia's khymer rouge there is a few things that stands out and makes this different to other war genocide books i've read firstly the first part of the book is very slow and focuses on the beauty rather than the impending horror at first i didn't understand but closer to the end i realize that this is the way children see things they are extremely adaptable and as long they still believe that their immediate family is save they think that they are protected and that nothing bad will happen especially as raami had a very protected childhood before the war the second differentiating factor was that the author really shows in detail how you can lose your life and everything that you love in an incremental way and not in one big event the war itself was also fascinating i've never read anything about the cambodian war genocide in fact i've never even heard of it before if you enjoyed the sandcastle girls then this if for you","606":" tear city i cried more in this book than perhaps any other book i've ever read it was really tough but it felt important to plough through the narrator bothered me for a lot of the book i would rather have heard the adult viewpoint looking back than the reimagined child viewpoint this was a strange mixture of complex vocabulary and mama and papa and overly simplistic descriptions of happier times by the end i appreciated that the narrator was somewhat hardened but i think it could have come across similarly with a different narration style viewpoint to begin with the one thing that impressed me most was how ratner was able to tell this story from a child's point of view without a seething anger coming through for me reading this book i felt outraged at the injustices that can be visited upon families to tear them apart not just in cambodia but all over the world all throughout history ratner's family was torn from her for no reason at all and i find that and all the other senselessness portrayed infuriating i think she did a good job of telling the story and making us angry without letting the anger be told to us if that makes sense","607":"well written i was glad for the insight into the lives of cambodia refugees since there are so many here in lowell where i live","608":"i really wanted to like this book i wanted to hear the story i really did but the style of writing i just could not take turning each page was painful it moved very slow i never got engaged i just didn't like disappointing","609":"the khmer rouge came to power the year i was married 1975 so i can forgive myself for being preoccupied with starting my family and not learning all i could about the trouble in cambodia this book which is essentially the author's story opened my eyes and gave me insight i love her style of storytelling and appreciate her hard work in bringing her story to a wider audience","610":"i knew very little about the khmer rouge regime before reading this story learning that it's based on the author's real life makes the suffering and will to survive so much more meaningful","611":"heartbreaking and beautifully written","612":"the author is an extremely talented writer the story is fascinating my only critic is that is a little repetitive i really enjoyed this book","613":"poignant and beautiful this was a book i could not put down it moved my heart i am wiser for having read it","614":"this is a beautifully written book but so terribly tragic i was touched by how resilient the human spirit can be","615":"one of the best books i've ever read beautifully written and exceptionally moving","616":"gratuitously depressing but so was i guess the khmer rouge i had an even harder time stomaching this than orphan master's son though","617":"another heartbreaking story of life and death in the cambodia of the khmer rouge well told well written and a true account fictionalized for effect no matter how many of these tales i hear while grasping the horror is an easy thing any understanding of the motivation behind it eludes me completely with the storyteller here a girl of 7 in 1975 i cannot help but think of my daughter who was about the same age at the same time but with the greater good fortune of not being born in cambodia as the mother also of two children who were born there i can only grieve for their history while being so grateful for their lives","618":"thus was a beautifully sad book it tells the story of a girl and her family during the occupation of the khmer rouge in cambodia in the 1970 s the language is poetic while the book is fictionalized it is essentially the autobiography of vaddey ratner don't miss this book","619":"completely devastating this story of brokenness and resilience will confirm every horrible thing you already know about humanity before offering hope that we can survive we can build something better","620":"ratner's story is a gift the history of what happened in cambodia like other historical atrocities must be read must be told must be remembered so that it never can happen again","621":"a wonderfully written book about khmer rouge time in cambodia from point of view of a seven year old","622":"this book both broke my heart and made it sing what a triumphant portrayal of the resilience of the human spirit in the face of overwhelming adversity and the wordsmithing ahhhhhhhh it borders on poetry transcendent and beautifulbeautiful i am not much of a 'crier ' but this one brought tears to my eyes a couple of times heart wrenching thought provoking and a call to keep hope alive its a 5 star read no question and an important one","623":" the writing was so beautiful with the story being so real and sad yet hopeful teared up a couple of times the struggles the cambodian people had to go through as told through the eyes of a little girl were heartbreaking but the lessons learned from her family especially her father helped her maintain some minute hope of a different and better future and then the author's notes broke my heart again to learn what more she went through but then gave me satisfied closure that she and her people were able to rise above their own heartbreak caused by their comrades","624":"an excellent book written from the five year raami's point of view of the revolution that took cambodia by storm in 1975 vaddey ratmer has mixed history with fiction and included her first hand experience of the trials and tribulations that anyone connected to the monarchy experienced during the khmer rouge period the book is written in a beautiful language from the first page the very first paragraph the book grabs you such is the language plot descriptions in the book here is the first line in the book 'war entered my childhood world not with the blasts of rockets and bombs but with my father's footsteps as he walked throght hallway passing my bedroom toward his' instantly i became raami my curiosity aroused trying to unravel what vaddey meant there are beautiful exchanges between raami and her papa as he guides her trying to prepare her for the difficult times ahead 'no matter what ugliness and destruction you may witness around you i want you always to believe that the tiniest glimpse of beauty here and there is a reflection of the gods' abode' 'if you pay close enough attention you know you're never alone there's always someone or something guiding you ''i told you stories to give you wings raami so that you would never be trapped by anything your name your title the limits of your body this world's suffering' the best thing about this book is that the book is clean it can be read by all in spite of the attrocities being described the author does not dive into rape sensationalism to get more readers","625":"a beautifully written book about the khmer rouge revolution in cambodia delivered from the point of view of a child the prose is absolutely gorgeous the story is unforgettable but beautifully told","626":"what an intense story hard to read but it will stick with me for a long time i wonder why i didn't know about this atrocity before","627":"this book is beautifully written it will break your heart and fill you with hope","628":"riveting story well written story which describes the turmoil in cambodia","629":"i have this thing for the historical tragedies like hitler and the black american tortures though the characters and the plot of the story are fictional they're somehow weaved into the real horror of the \"dreadful hitler like\" history of cambodia really terrible sad and gruesome you would have a feel of the actual tragedies of early cambodia two thumbs up for me","630":"i dislike a book that takes me to places where humanity is exceptionally mean to humanity this book is telling a story of cambodia where that is exactly what happened however because it is told from the perspective of a 7 9 year old girl i felt she held my hand or i hers as she witnessed heard terrible unexplainable things that she did not understand as we walked her path to freedom we held on to each other i could read what she experienced as an innocent child and rejoice with her survival in the end","631":" this book should be required reading it is one of the most heartbreaking beautifully written stories i have read the unique point of view--a girl tells the story over ages 7 8 and 9--will leave you breathless i don't recommend reading in overly public places unless you don't mind people staring at you as you cry sob the guy in the airplane seat next to me thought i was crazy and the woman on the treadmill next to me couldn't understand why i had to stop running to wipe my eyes catch my breath as someone who rips through books i need a few more days to allow this story to settle before picking up another a must read must","632":"i've only managed to read 4 chapters in 2 weeks returning to the library and not renewing maybe i'll pick it up again at a later date but probably not","633":"so beautifully written that you can't stop reading it so brutal that you don't want to continue absolutely one of the best books i have read in my entire life ratner has done an amazing job of honoring the memories of those who were silenced","634":"interesting insight into life in cambodia during the khmer rouge period based on the author's own experiences sad brutal time hard to understand how it could all have happened but it did and fortunately cambodians are slowly recovering we were there a few years back resilient people","635":"beautifully written account of the in humane treatment of the people of cambodia by the khmer rouge in the 1970's narrated by a 7 year old the semi autobiographical account of her experience brings one to tears this book cannot be skimmed the descriptions and wisdom bear careful reads","636":"gorgeous and heartbreaking this book has given me deep respect for cambodian culture and brought the 1970s communist revolution starkly to life so much beauty and culture destroyed for no reason","637":" revolutionaries always instigate the masses with grand promises of a better future yet seldom deliver throughout history and all over the globe nations that witnessed major revolutions nearly always ended up with brutal regimes that fed on fear corruption and empty slogans cambodia is an extreme example given the chilling level of violence unleashed on its people by the pol pot regime in the aftermath of its victory in april 1975 \"in the shadow of the banyan tree\" is the horrific story of a seven year old princess and her family who see their whole world collapse as the khmer rouge roll into the capital phnom penh emptying it of all its inhabitants sending them to be re educated in the rice fields in order to become true peasants\" a life of plenty turned into an existence of perpetual hunger this story must be translated into arabic for readers in the middle east to realise that ideology in all its different guises is detrimental to the nations it infects in cambodia's case it was the khmer rouge that ran havoc taking the country back to its stone age in the promise of building an \"agrarian utopia\" in the arab world it is the militant islamists and dogma driven political parties that threaten the very fabric of society i would have given this book more than five stars if goodreads had allowed me to the story articulates the strength of cambodia's continuity and its people's desire to move on a glimmer of hope for all those nations drenched in its innocent blood and besieged by civil war where common sense lacks ideology spurs turmoil","638":"this was a heartbreaking but powerful book i knew nothing about the subject matter but i was pleasantly delighted that this book was from a very different genre sometimes i get stuck in a rut this book like a few others will stay with me for a very long time i liked a conversation with vaddey ratner found at the end of the book makes an even stronger connection to the author i received a complimentary copy of in the shadow of the banyan from goodreads first reads","639":"a hauntingly beautiful story it will stay with me for a long time","640":"a book about the atrocities living under the khmer rouge in cambodia although fiction it is based on the author's experience as a young girl who was five when the khmer rouge came to power well written it recounts what happens to one royal family and those they meet forced to leave phnom penh and live as peasants in the countryside while i liked it very much i didn't think it was as powerful as when broken glass floats and first they killed my father books that cover much the same ground","641":"i quite liked this book and definitely recommend it although it is a novel it's semi autobiographical and feels like it's a true story i've read quite a few books about china's so called great leap forward but books about cambodia in the 1970s are much fewer and further between i appreciated learning history about a culture and place i don't know much about that being said it's really a story and the history and facts do not bog it down it reads quickly and is about the characters more than the information","642":"beautifully written full of heartbreak u0026amp hope one of the finest debuts i've had the pleasure to read","643":"not for the weak of heart but for those who are willing to take the journey of the killing fields with raami you'll be stunned by the atrocities these people had to live through and yet survived the beauty and passion of words time and place resonate through the book the power of story keeps alive the memory of her people amazing","644":"read this book i either slept through all my history classes or just wasn't taught several things important things things that should be learned read this book","645":"exquisite writing","646":"this was a beautifully written story about a tragic time the author's descriptive details were amazing","647":"truly one of my all time favorite books this is one of those books that made an indelible impression on me u0026amp will always stay with me the writing is absolutely soul sharp beautiful at times it reads like poetry but the most beautiful poem about the some of the worst atrocities imaginable because the writing is so beautiful i feel like it allows the narration to move deeper into your soul psyche heart u0026amp the reader feels the story more fully","648":"inspiring story of survival and love during the revolutionaries invasion of cambodia in 1975","649":" this story got much stronger and sadder as it continued i was not enamored with the young narrator early on probably because i was aware of the impending atrocities of the khmer rouge while she obviously could not predict the future the writing improved as story turned into personal survival rather than just an ode to the main character's father as the mother and big uncle developed the emotion and suffering of the time period truly came to life this book is a high end 3 but i recommend the memoir first they killed my father if someone is interested in learning more about cambodian life under pol pot","650":"this book goes under my category of 'uplifting' my favorite type of books the main character a young girl is put through every imaginable horror and heartache but she finally makes it out of cambodia where people of education and stature are being eliminated she emerges rarefied it's a triumph of the soul","651":"the mechanics of building from year zero are hypnotically terrible and for me had always been general this book held my hand through the basics of an evicted family and country getting in the car leaving it behind continuing on foot hunger separation and all a prelude to the full terror of 1975 78 likewise recounted here what also stuns in the prelude is the hope and self deceit of adults and the stories they tell children to make sense of chaos the young girl at the centre holds onto her stories and you believe that they're fused to survival because again and again as ratner shows you a handful of the plus 2 million deaths during khmer rouge rule you wonder how anyone lived past it","652":"beautifully written account from a child's eyes of the terror imposed by the khmer rouge","653":" 'we are all echoes of one another raami 'author vaddey ratner has revisited her life changing childhood experiences growing up in cambodia to create this fictionalized tale that incorporates much of what actually happened to her the story is narrated throughout by a young girl named raami who is seven years old when we first meet her she enjoys a happy priviledged life with her wealthy well connected family her mother and father little sister and other relations and servants of the family then one day her father comes home with the news that in the capital phnom penh civil war has begun suddenly life changes for the family fleeing their home and forced into the countryside with thousands of others with no idea of where they are being taken or what will happen to them the family endures an enormous amount of hardship sadness separation and loss over the next four years i found this tale very moving and i learned about a place and a period in history that i knew very little about seeing these events and experiencing them through the eyes of a child gives a very particular perspective on things raami is an insightful observer but at times it is beyond her to comprehend this world as one of relatives tells her 'the problem with being seven - i remember myself at that age - is that you're aware of so much and yet you understand so little so you imagine the worst 'raami is forced to grow up fast as a result of what she endures worked almost to death in the fields scrabbling desperately for any food that is available clinging to the few loved ones that remain around her she lives through a heartbreaking horrific time and witnesses so much cruelty and pain for one so young nature reflects the condition of the people's lives toiling day after day clearing the earth under the constant guard of the revolutionary soldiers the language conveys the affliction felt by them all 'it was a sick sky a sky burning with welts angry and red the colors of rotting flesh of dying and death of one heaving last breath 'throughout all of this raami thinks often of her beloved father a gentle man a prince and a poet and of the stories he used to tell her he taught her of the power of words to transcend and transform even the worst situations 'words you see ' he said looking at me again 'allow us to make permanent what is essentially transient turn a world filled with injustice and hurt into a place that is beautiful and lyrical even if only on paper ' they meant so much to her and now as she faces the lowest points of her short life so far these stories legends from the past are what she recalls to bring her through the darkest moments a beautiful and captivating debut novel from a first hand witness of the times","654":"i really wanted to like this book so as i finished the last chapter i realized i was disappointed that it wasn't better some of the writing is exquisite but much of it feels slow and tedious i realize it is based on ratner's own experience but i think she could have made it flow a little better i did get a new perspective on what was happening in cambodia in the 70's i give it a 6 5 on my 10 scale","655":"what a heartbreaking novel rich in cambodian culture and folklore but tragic in its

this book is a perfect example of why it's important to give a book a fair chance before giving up on reading it my rating moved from 3 stars at first to 4 stars as i continued reading to 5 stars by the time i finished it at the very end at first i thought the story was just so so but then as i read more the author's poetic lyrical use of language captured my imagination by the end the true deeper meaning of her story struck a chord in my heart the story is very sad and strongly based on the author's own life which makes it only that much more moving but has a message that is important for all of us as humans to read","664":"i read this as a book club selection it is the story of the khmer rouge revolting in cambodia in the 1970s told though the eyes of a 7 year old child she was a child of privilege who endures the atrocities that the world did not initially witness this is a book of almost unbearable sadness but is well written ratner was given the gift of language by her

cry and only three others have done so before this one the prose is beautiful and although the story is very emotionally intense and heartbreaking it is one that needs to be told whoever reads this

message of hope and love a fantastic debut","666":"the story in this book is great and really shows the deterioration of childhood innocence during hardship the writing was fine but not especially engaging","667":"this book is beautifully lyrically written ratner is truly insightful about human nature and society she's clearly thought a lot about it some parts particularly early on dragged a bit and it felt a little unfocused not sure if that's purposely the child's perspective she's giving it or if she couldn't didn't want to focus more because of the overwhelming nature of the experiences she went through i think this would make a fine movie and it certainly helped me to understand this time and place in history better","668":"i want to give this book 4 5 stars not 5 because the middle of the book was a little slow ratner is an extremely gifted author and her story is a must read","669":"moving book about a young girl and her family living in cambodia when the

been struck as a baby with polio she limped and wore a brace she saw the world through her father's eyes his stories and his poems gave raami hope for the future as a cripple and amidst the destruction and violence of the civil war of cambodia that ripped raami's entire family from their home and led them along with millions of other families to a transient lifestyle being carted from one village or camp to another the prime minister was executed along with other important leaders phnom penh burned bourgeois life had ended in cambodia there was no more religious practice in the

school students","672":"beautifully written","673":"this was such a beautiful book it has a beautiful narrative flow that transcends the horrors of the time imbued with the spirit of buddhist mindfulness the book is ultimately an examination of how mindfulness and story can triumph over evil and suffering","674":" this is one of the most powerful books i've read maybe ever at the book's end the author writes of this novel i didn't want just to translate my family's experience a cambodian experience to a foreign audience i wanted to take the readers and replant them in the fertile ground i'd sprung from to let them take root and sprout and to see my world as their own mission accomplished there were times during reading that i had to put it down and walk away because it was just too much to imagine the atrocities this child witnessed and the cruelty of the khmer rouge against its own people i knew nothing i mean nothing about this prior to reading her story and it's hard for me to imagine that now if you're looking for a light hearted fun read this isn't it but if you're looking for a beautifully written and incredibly inspiring heartbreaking and hope filled novel i highly recommend this","675":"this is a great book based on the author's childhood in cambodia very well written and lyrical the writing was as beautiful as the subject was painful","676":"this is a extraordinary historical novel about a child's experience during the horrors of the khmer rouge and the revolution in cambodia in the 1970's the author paints each scene with word pictures that will stay with you but more than that she explores the depth of a parent's love amidst challenging circumstances a good read","677":"is autobiographical fiction a category that is what this book is it is the fictionalized account of the author's ordeal when the communist khmer rouge took over cambodia in 1975 and ruled until 1979 it is the beautifully written account of an horrific experience in interviews with the author she states that everything in this novel really happened to her it is narrated by seven year old raami who is of royal heritage and therefore she and her family are targets of the khmer rouge many do not survive and i am in awe of those who did survive as the author states toward the end of the novel while all else may vanish love is our one eternity highly recommended for all","678":"very few novels can inspire educate and haunt me and at the same time keep me turning the pages at a quick pace this one did just that i only wish it wasn't so sad but then it wouldn't be real a story of how humanity survives in yet another inhumane world","679":" this is a story based on the author's memories as a child during the khmer rouge takeover in cambodia during the seventies although not entirely true to her life some of the story is ratner's a story of love survival and hope during a time of atrocity to know that she survived and went on to graduate from an american university and to become a successful author truly shows her resilience and strength a heartbreaking story that is hard to read at times but at the same time the prose is quite beautiful all in all a good read that will stay with me now that the last page is turned","680":" this book was recommended to me by my english teacher right before my winter break when she pulled me aside and told about this book i silently thought \"oh hell no i'm not going to read about any genocide on my break \" anyway i ended up looking it up checking it out at the library and read it over the break i enjoyed it immensely in the shadow of the banyan tree is about seven years old girl raami who grew up sheltered with love and security in a privileged royal family of cambodia her precious childhood abruptly ended when her family was forced by the khmer rouge to evacuate from their city phnom penh into the jungle and beyond to become laborers as fate would have it their high ranking and fame took a toll on their survival as the khmer rouge soldiers became determined to seek out and abolished all the intellectuals and the gentile in the midst of this horrendous revolution trust in a little seven years old to relay a touch of imagination and wonder of the beauty of a lost culture to the story this book could've been more depressing for me but i chose to revel in the lyrical prose the powerful imagery and all the wonderful things the story has to offer i love a good story from the account of raami's survival to the narration of her beloved father's mythical tales lore and poems what a treat because this book was full of it while i was reading this book i tried looking up info about cambodian culture and about other numerous things i learned from the story i was disappointed to see there were so little that i could find i couldn't even find pictures of what cambodia looks like or what people wore before the 1970s without being paranoid of the terrifying pictures of genocide i might see on google image i even got a friend to check the khmer rouge wiki page for scary images for me which thankfully there was only one i still wondered if cambodia was as colorful as raami described in the story but in the words of the doctor from doctor who \"the good things don't always soften the bad things but vice versa the bad things don't necessarily spoil the good things and make them unimportant \" despite the heavy topics of genocide and violence for the first time this book has opened a door of wonder and curiosity about the cambodian culture to me and in some ways it reminds me to open another door for my own http www oprah com omagazine the be","681":"intriguing sad the troubling story of the persecution of ordinary cambodians by the kymer rouge starts with the story of the people being forced to move out of cities and then moved again and again and then it gets worse told from the point of view of a young girl who really doesn't understand what is going on at first and then she survives the horrors of losing most of her family and escapes cambodia with her mother it's a novel but written by a woman who lived it as a little girl my impression it is more fact than novel this is a must read to fully understand the impact of the atrocities of the kymer rouge that we heard about way over on the other side of the world but probably didn't really grasp","682":"wow this was a difficult book to read but so masterfully presented with beauty and love entertwined in a world of hate and confusion this book leaves me with a thankful heart for the blessings in my world","683":"i don't even know what to say except read it super good but be warned there are many tear jerking horrifying parts definitely worth it though","684":"i was captivated by this story told from the perspective of a 7 year old girl living through the takeover of cambodia by the khymer rouge the shocking story of loss and survival prompted me to watch the killing fields for further context not sure how i missed that one but i definitely recommend it i have a whole new understanding of what these people experienced","685":"i loved this book i sat down and read it in one day it broke my heart i love books that teach history as well as tell a great story this books does both i recommend this book to anyone","686":"amazing i knew almost nothing about the cambodian genocide until i read this book this novel has the distinction of being both lyrical and devastating ratner captures the color of pre revolution life and presents it in sharp contrast to the life during the revolution so very much was lost thankfully ratner gives a taste if it back","687":"unbelievable writing beautiful","688":" in the shadow of the banyan is fictionalized memoir that describes the horrors of life in cambodia from 1975 1979 through the eyes of a child beautifully written the book's lyrical poetic language kept me emotionally off balance while i read about the genocide starvation and disease in cambodia during the reign of the khmer rouge this is a book that will continue to haunt me for a long time to come highly recommended but may be hard for people to get through emotionally i admit it was tough for me at times and i'm not usually moved to tears by what i read in novels it becomes even more horrifically poignant after reading the authors notes and the q and a on her website http www vaddeyratner com","689":"the book overall was good but it just was hard to read i appreciated the fact that the author wanted to share the many stories that her father expressed but after awhile i lost interest and i wanted to move on beyond the stories","690":"i hesitate to criticize a work that bears so heavily on the author's own horrific experiences under the khmer rouge but the story made for laborious reading and despite the author's never ending descriptions about each character i struggled to form real attachments to any of them","691":"this was a beautifully written book about a period of history mostly unknown to us it brought tears to my eyes and made me appreciate how strong some people are to overcome misery and inhumanity","692":"exquisite poetic heartbreaking and a story that will stay with you for a long time","693":" i knew nothing about the khmer rouge regime in cambodia between 1975 and 1979 when an estimated 2 million lost their lives after reading the book i don't know much more about it and i had a hard time believing the narrator was a 7 yr old child she seemed much older by her thoughts and actions i also did not like all the mythical legends and poetry passed down from her father i liked the first part of the book better before they were forced from their home after that it was just too slow for me","694":"i never thought i'd use the word beautiful in writing about the khmer rouge but that's exactly what this novel is a beautiful literary account of one young girl's experiences during the cambodian genocide other accounts i've read of this time period in cambodia's history focused on the horror ratner does too but she juxtaposes it with the beauty of the cambodian landscape and the compassion of individual characters that's what gives this account its magnificence","695":"i was expecting to like this book because it has mostly received great reviews but this book is definitely not my favorite any dramatic story told from a child's perspective is always humbling but i was so bored with the fluff in this book although beautifully written fluff that i couldn't finish it","696":" a seven year old girl from a privileged background has her life turned upside down with many of her relatives killed when the khmer rouge take over in cambodia and are determined to destroy every trace of the former imperial regime largely autobiographical and told through the child's eyes is it poetically written but brings back horrid memories for those of us old enough to remember the killing fields of the 1970s a bit like a holocaust novel it should be read just to remind us that we mustn't let this sort of thing happen again","697":"heartbreaking story but beautifully written very glad to have had a chance to visit cambodia but it made the descriptions in this book a bit too real knowing i had been in some of the places where such atrocities happened","698":" books very rarely leave everything on the table but who can argue with ratner's biographical fiction here being anything but complete this was as real a book as i've read in a very long time i'm not sure if it's the horrible tragedies she endured under the massive one that was the khmer rouge or her impeccable way of telling the story but this was one of the most emotional reads i've ever endured so much pain and sorrow threaded through countless legends and tales help one cope with this book there's so much to learn about limits and how far inhumanity can go but honestly in the shadow authentic to the core can't say how much i appreciated and feared this book while reading absolutely a must read","699":"i'm not quite done but this has been an amazing read i had heard about khmer rouge but had no idea loved the lyrical writing style what a wonderful book","700":" a tragic tale of the cambodian diaspora told with grace in the shadow of the banyan tells the story of one family's re education and relocation when cambodia fell to the khmer rouge this period of history is really pretty much unknown to me so i was so interested in it the book is narrated by vatti the daughter of a prince because of their high status they have the most to fear from the revolutionary army ratner takes us from the chaos of the emptying of phnom penh using clear images and sounds when the family settles into one destination the worst seems to be over but the revolutionary guards want to make sure no one is comfortable the family is moved again and again they are ultimately separated from one another by force and by death in the shadow of the banyan was very interesting and portrayed a story of a time in history that most of us know only through brief news footage","701":"a great enchanting story that becomes cumbersome and repetitive with cambodian politics","702":"one of the best books i have ever read such loss and struggle but written with a beauty that my words will not do justice i loved every gut wrenching moment of this book vaddey ratnet is a true inspiration to anyone who has struggled","703":"story of 7 year old raami and her family as they live through the cambodian civil war of the late 1970s their family was part of the royal family and during the revolution they are forced out of the city and into labor camps the book is beautifully written it is somewhat autobiographical i know very little of the history of cambodia this opened my eyes to the struggles of the people the book mixed in poetry cambodian folk tales and details of life during the revolution","704":"amazing story a gruesome story beautifully told","705":"this book started out strong but then became wy too depressing for me","706":" a heartbreaking autobiographical novel in the shadow of the banyan is told through the eyes of a seven year old cambodian princess raami raami and her family suffer in the aftermath of the revolution as the khmer rouge toss them from their privileged existence and into the cruel world of work camps separation illness and death raami endures by reliving the stories she learned from her father lending a poetic elegance to an often disturbing narrative this was an emotionally difficult read but one i would suggest to everyone nontheless","707":"this was a very emotional read esp knowing the facts that it was based on not for the faint hearted","708":"i was slightly uncomfortable with the way that this author fictionalised her life and it was certainly description heavy but this taught me about a place that i don't know the history of very well even though i've been there was beautifully written and was very emotional in a mostly good way so i'm glad i read it it certainly taught me lots about the reign of the khmer rouge","709":"this is an absolutely heartbreaking and beautifully written book i highly recommend it for anyone who not only savors a good story but a well crafted one","710":"a really slow read but still pretty good","711":" i wanted this to be better than it was i knew almost nothing about the civil war in cambodia when approaching this book i really still don't but this book did shed some light on the conflict raami is seven when the story begins and nine when it ends the story is written from the perspective of an adult's memory this is where my problem with the book is ratner is a very flowery writer purple even this book would be half the length id you took out all the superfluous metaphors and similes all that purple prose is very distracting and i had a hard time connecting to raami as a character because of it that is a shame because the story ratner tells is an important one","712":"this book is beautifully written and very moving a novel that's practically a memoir this story is both sorrowful and joyous and made me appreciative of my own blessings easily a must read","713":"devastating beautiful and ultimately inspirational my absolute favorite type of story","714":"had difficulty getting into the book at first but was hooked by chapter 4 as the book progressed i was struck by the evil that was so pervasive equal to the holocaust in my opinion what bothers me is that i knew nothing about this until i read this book this book will be on my mind for some time to come","715":"this is one of the best books that i have ever read it was so well written that i found myself re reading sentences just because they were so beautifully written i had no idea that these atrocities had occurred what an eye opener","716":" this is the story of seven year old raami a girl of royal privilege who lives outside of phnom pehn cambodia's capital her childhood is shattered when civil war breaks out and her family is forced to leave their home over the next four years raami endures the deaths of her family members starvation and forced labor at the hands of the khmer rouge it is a heartbreaking story but i felt like it rambled a lot there were lots of poetic references and flowery side tracks which i felt took away from the story itself this story mirrored the experiences of the author as she grew up i wonder if she really thought all those poetic thoughts as a seven year old child","717":"well written historical fiction told through the eyes of a child at times the book was a little slow going but the story is eye opening after i read the book i read the back of the book leaf and found out this is basically the author's story the beauty of cambodia and the cruelty of the khmer rouge and the tenacity of the human spirit shine throughout the story","718":"the first two thirds of this book were somewhat slow and for me overly detailed the final third of the book however focuses on the escalation of khmer rouge brutality as the revolution starts to unravel and as such is powerful and highly moving i finally began to feel the characters' despair and to admire and root for their tenuous hold on hope the author's notes at the end of the book which explain that this writing is essentially her own story were equally poignant ultimately it was well worth working through the first part of the book to get to the heart at the end","719":"a little girl's view of the barbarity of the khmer rouge based on the author's own story of surviving the khmer rouge incredibly sad but a look at history many in the west forget","720":"the start was 3 5 but it ended as a 4 a book that makes you wonder at people both their depravity and their humanity not as good as when broken glass floats but still very interesting sent me to do research on cambodia and the khmer rouge","721":"beautifully written novel covering strife love loss and resilience loosely based on the author's experience during the cambodian killing fields worth the read for the historical perspective and the human perspective i really enjoyed this even though it stirred up many unpleasant emotions","722":"after having read ~ 100 pages i can give it the highest marks no further comment for now no time have to continue reading and some days later now as i have just finished the last pages i am still overwhelmed in her rich language and poetic style vaddey tells us her fictitious but so very personal of solemn life martyrdom and death that it leaves no one untouched it cannot be subject to further criticism it just could not have been done better","723":"sad but a great story","724":"this book is well written but i can't say i 'like' it because the events were so horrible even more so because they were based on the authors experiences","725":"while a fictional account of the civil war in cambodia it is beautifully written excellent book","726":"i would give this 4 1 2 stars it is a beautifully written story of the amazing survival of raami a seven year old girl crippled by polio who with her mother survived the re education and relocation process when cambodia fell to the tet offensive in 1968","727":" i liked the book but didn't love the writing style but the material was so engrossing if you read history about the khmer rouge it's so ghastly horrific that this book seems mild a great introduction to this period of history starts a little slow but gains anxious momentum parts will move you to tears unless you are an inanimate stone but i do think that following the many members of one family's destiny is a brilliant way to illustrate the destructive nature of the khmer soldiers destroy familial connections and you can break people down to obedient servants the short note at the end and the short interview with vaddey ratner are simply devastating so much of this is biographical you wonder how anyone can survive so much that the author learned english starting at age 11 and was her class valedictorian is evidence of what a truly special individual vaddey is it is particularly chilling that she mentions in the short note that what she in real life witnessed before her escape is 'enough for a separate novel' great introduction to the environment and day to day life of cambodians under the oppressive khmer rouge reading about suffering will make you appreciate your blessings and make you more human","728":"interesting read on the khmer rouge","729":"had a difficult time getting into this book and found the voice to be unbelievable i did like a section that focused on the mother and think the book may have been better for me if the author had used the mother's voice rather than the child's i also found the ending to be somewhat convenient and forced what happened in cambodia was awful and the author's personal story is compelling and deserves to be read i just don't think the author was successful in translating her story to fiction","730":"unbelievable account of a terrible tragedy and the sufferings that humans can inflict on each other and at the same time a beautiful story of a little girl who was forced to grow up too soon i stayed up late over several nights to read this i just couldn't put it down i found myself re reading passages to make sure i took in all the imagery descriptions and emotions will definitely re read this at some point can recommend highly enough","731":" after hearing all the hype at bea i was really looking forward to this book i've been fascinated with the horror of the khmer rouge and pol pot since i learned about it in college the fact that i was in my 20s when i finally learned about this is still unbelievable to me and i've always wanted to write a story set in this place even though it's not mine to tell i was thrilled a book like this finally came along and from someone who lived through the monstrosity to share her story in a way we haven't yet seen and with that anticipation and the way vaddey ratner's editor spoke of this book with such awe and passion i probably held this book to a higher standard than i would have normally i think ratner has created something beautiful but overall it left me wanting i feel as if we only got half a story in the shadow of the banyan follows seven year old raami through her journey as the khmer rouge take over cambodia we begin in raami's peaceful family home in phnom penn and end in a place that can only be described as hell complete with fire heat and scorched earth ratner's descent into this terrifying space is so subtle that i hardly noticed how far things had gone until the very end--this was particularly spellbinding but i had a hard time believing in the reality of our narrator would a seven year old have understood what her family were feeling so completely i'm not so sure but while we were privy to raami's unique insight we learned nothing of what was happening politically throughout the country i feel as if this story could have been better told through several lenses--perhaps from a young citizen of the country and from a young soldier on the khmer rouge side something was just missing that said the ending is poetically beautiful it's uplifting in the truest sense of the word much of the hype about this book is that it's finally a novel not a memoir but i was more moved by ratner's \"note from the author\" at the end of the book than any part of her fiction to hear her speak of her father the real tiger prince who suffered the same fate as raami's father in the book and her trip back to cambodia years later was so so moving part of me wishes she had chosen to write a memoir instead of fiction all in all i thought this was a great start for ratner and for a movement to give a bigger voice to other cambodian writers who lived through this horrific event i'm sure this book will be embraced by most readers and the media alike i still need more but i completely respect this work of art thank you to ms ratner for having the courage to tell this story bravo to this beautiful memorial to her family friends and countrymen who lived and died under the khmer rouge","732":"beautiful lyrical prose astonishing survival story from an imaginative little girl's perspective the way she used stories to try and make sense of what was happening to her creative and thought provoking i loved this book i couldn't stop reading it especially the second half","733":" in the shadow of the banyan tree by vaddey batner is told through the perspective of 7 year old raami the story begins by introducing a cambodia rich with fragrant flowers a lush beautiful place raami lives on a sumptuous estate her father a minor prince and respected poet the family is lovely attractive and affectionate if not for the brace on her leg from childhood polio raami's young life seems charmed but it is 1975 in cambodia and young raami's life is far from charmed it will become a living nightmare khmer rouge overtake the country emptying the city forcing people from their homes driving them into the countryside to be educated is dangerous to be a prince even a minor prince is deadly yet in this bleak and frightening time there are moments of grace raami's story is very similar to the experiences of the author as she survived the killing fields of cambodia she tells not only of the horror of the khmer rouge but also the beauty of her country and the kindness of its people","734":" a difficult book to read there is so much sadness and loss in each page its hard to comprehend what it must have been to be in the thick of this revolution as difficult as it was it was a page turner for me the fact that it is fiction doesn't defeat the context that it is written by a person who experienced it first hand as a child and lived to write about this nightmare years later the book truly captures the child like mind and thinking but at times makes you think raami is too smart for her own good too grown up too soon if the book were written from an adults perspective i dare say it may have been too grotesque to read vaddey has written beautifully to keep the innocence intact throughout the story making it sad but bearable this is another part of history i have had limited knowledge about and for this am glad to have come across this book this has certainly opened door for me to learn more about khymer rouges","735":"3 5 stars for this beautiful but depressing story of a privileged child of cambodia thrown into the chaos of the revolution of the communist khmer rouge the book is based on the author's own life and as such has even more impact she finds beauty and strength in the love and teachings of her father but ultimately learns her own powerlessness before outside forces all that is left to be controlled is the inner life","736":"if 10 stars were an option this book deserves it hands down the most beautifully written book i've read to this day it takes true talent to write about ones personal experiences during the cambodian genocide so poetically","737":"this should be required reading for every soul on the planet the atrocities that we as humans commit on one another is without words or understanding unspeakable and yet the spirit the will to survive is strongest when it is in grave danger and proves time and time again that it is unstoppable","738":"beautiful sad story of life under the oppressive khmer rouge in cambodia i was amazed to read that it's mostly autobiographical though written as fiction","739":"did not could not moved way too slowly having read other accounts of life under the khmer rouge the value of this book to me was in hearing a new perspective i could not however get on board with the weak metaphors and poorly executed voice of the protagonist mayhaps another time","740":" this work of historical fiction is based on the author's childhood as a child in cambodia her family was repeated 'relocated' by quasi military groups resulting in the loss of family connections either to distance or death as well as a life lacking all but the most basic of needs while being filled only with uncertainties ratner's personal experiences give this novel a true sense of voice as it takes the reader into the rice paddies inside of the family into the hearts of those brave enough to offer help and down a rough path through a frightening childhood in which there are few trustworthy souls life is far too short and death is sometimes preferable to life great read","741":" i really loved it and urge others to pick up a copy the narrator is a seven year old girl and it really captures some of the innocence some reviewers claim the voice is more mature than any 7 year old could be and that's probably true but it didn't distract from the book i loved it because it shared a history that i hadn't learned about before more than that the characters were lively and easy to picture i loved the way the way the author painted her stories it was easy to imagine oneself in the middle of street surrounded by khmer rouge soldiers or in the rice patties with the characters i have to admit that i cried several times during this book but i think those scenes resonated deeply with me the mother of two children i cannot imagine being helpless and watching my child die watching my child suffer i cannot it'll be a book i think of for a while longer","742":"i learned so much from this book about cambodia and the khmer rouge depressing to say the least but always wanted to know what would happen next","743":"beautiful heartbreaking inspiring so many words i could use to describe this gem of all the books i've read about the cambodian genocide and i've read many this was the most uplifting even through all the hardships and tragedy i felt some silver lining of hope in a book about such a heavy subject that's hard to achieve ratner's tale is a must read for all","744":"culturally rich highly descriptivea compelling story of survival this work of fiction closely follows the author's recollections of her own experiences as a young girl in cambodia during the 3 years of the khmer rouge brutal regime the story is told from perspective of 7 year old raami daughter of a well educated aristocratic father because of this background the family is at enormous risk from the khmer rouge and suffers greatly while the brutality and horror of the family's experience is softened somewhat by a child's viewpoint at the same time there are moments when this point of view feels a bit jarring and the narration perceptions observations seem far too sophisticated for such a young child a tribute to the bravery and selflessness of her father and courage and strength of her mother narrator of the audiobook has young sounding voice appropriate for the story and her pronunciations of cambodian names and places sound very authentic however at times i found myself losing focus in some of the more descriptive storytelling sections of the novel not sure if my experience would have been different had i read the print version at the conclusion of the audio version the author reads her own notes adding a very moving conclusion to the book","745":"the human spirit like the lifted hands of the blind will rise above chaos and destruction as wings in flight","746":"beautiful story of a life's shades and shadows of endurance","747":"when one first looks at the book cover of in the shadow of the banyan you will notice a blurb with the word \"masterpiece\" mighty high praise but as just having finished reading vaddey ratner's book i can only describe it as a masterpiece ratner delivers some of the most beautifully crafted writing you will ever read along with a compelling story the lines are poetic lyrical and paint a vivid picture for the mind's eye the pace of the book is excellent and you will fall in love with the family members especially the narrator little raami the last chapter of the book was so touching that i read it with moist eyes and yes a tear or two did slip out also the author's note at the end puts everything into a beautiful perspective i highly recommend this brilliant achievement in literature","748":"interesting story about a part of history i never studied definitely would recommend to others","749":"this book was so good and at times i had to stop reading it made me andit made me cry littlie my heart ached the book was told in a way that it felt like i was right there when she was telling her storyi have nothing bad to say about it i won this book on good reads","750":"it's a biography more than a historical fiction so the beautiful writing cannot hide the subjectivity of the writer the family is misfurtune the soldiers are bad nothing about the reasons for the revolution or the disconnection between the royal family and the way the people in their country live","751":"this is a powerful and moving story that grips you in the first couple pages it is a great piece of historical fiction that provides perspective and insight on the cambodia civil war it doesn't provide all the answers both rather focuses on the 4 years of khmer rouge regime and their brutal attempt to create a single class of people","752":"i enjoyed learning about the khmer rouge regime in cambodia the author is a survivor who wrote this book based on her experiences it is a sad book but still an enjoyable read","753":"the author really gives us the feel of what it would have been like to grow up during the time of the khmer rouge as she herself was five and living in cambodia at the time ratner's writing style and characters that you connected with keep the story moving i found it really interesting to read about this time period and events that i didn't have a really good memory of growing up","754":"beautifully written the cambodian genocide of the 1970's as seen through the eyes of a child who endures the survives incredibly well done","755":"loved this book despite being a little slow reading at times this book was absolutely wonderful u0026amp i will recommend it to anyone who wants to learn about the cambodian revolution in the 1970s u0026amp the power of family love u0026amp hope","756":" this novel takes us to cambodia in the late '70s in the time of the civil war raami is seven years old the oldest daughter in a royal family she wears a leg brace as a result of polio she lives in phnom penh with her father and mother and little sister radana her aunt tata and grandmother queen when the khmer rouge take over the city raami and her family are forced to flee their home at first they go to their country home near the mekong river but are soon forced out of that by the revolutionary soldiers as well as they join others living in makeshift shelters forced into further and further hardships separated from those they love raami tries to keep her father's advice in mind he told her that you can always find a tiny glimpse of beauty no matter what ugliness and destruction is around you raami's papa is a poet and has told her stories ever since she was little engaging her imagination and teaching her the myths of the cambodian spiritual world while witnessing the world changing around her raami keeps her imagination and the stories she is a witness even while being a victim of the regime raami's voice is strong and individual and brings the novel to life before us raami is a child who is forced to mature under harsh conditions forced labour and the loss of family members but she hangs on to a bit of that childhood innocence throughout the author was also young only five when she too was forced out of her royal house with her family bringing portions of her own history into this story adds to the emotional integrity of the book and the afterword where she tells us briefly of her own story and her own return to cambodia as an adult is moving i also found the mention of the youth of many of the soldiers interesting given the large number of child soldiers today in the middle east and africa this seems to be a theme common to internal uprisings that warrants discussion this book is an amazing read bringing a country in a difficult historical time to life for the reader i highly recommend it my parents visited cambodia earlier this year and i look forward to talking to them about it after they read this book","757":"despite the beautiful cover and the narrator's youthful voice this is a dark depressing book i'm glad i read it because it bought to life the history of the khmer rouge rule in cambodia in the 1970s but as the book went on i found it more and more difficult to listen as the story kept getting bleaker and grimmer","758":"every now and then a book comes along that knocks you six ways from sunday and in the shadow of the banyan was one such book for me this semi autobiographical novel about the horrors inflicted on the people of cambodia by the khmer rouge is compelling reading and the writing is exquisite ratner finds glimmers of beauty and hope in even the darkest moments and the strength of the human spirit to endure in the face of incomprehensible evil shines through brilliantly cambodia's lush bountiful countryside and rich cultural history of storytelling are contrasted with the emptiness and brutality of the khmer rouge to great effect i shed many tears while reading this book but one of the most moving passages came towards the end when raami must listen in silence as her friend and friend's mother are forced to dig their own graves nearby in a rice field during a purge of traitors their crime was looking too vietnamese the sound of digging echoed and vibrated i lowered myself to the ground careful not to make a noise i waited i did not know why why i waited had i not heard enough seen enough had death deepened my appetite for more dulled my senses to violence a friend's murder was it shock paralysis that kept me there i couldn't explain it but i remembered all those times when death had brushed by me and i'd close my eyes or turn away i couldn't do this anymore i couldn't let those i loved face death alone from now on i told myself i would stay put be here for them and when their spirits left their bodies they would see that i'd been here all along to hear their last words their last breath and they would know that i had witnessed not only their deaths but more importantly their fight for life their desire to live in the shadow of the banyan is a testament to all that ratner saw and heard during this terrible time it gives witness to the suffering of countless people during these years of terror and ensures that they will not be forgotten it is also a tribute to a father's love that endures and gives strength beyond the grave and the bonds that can't be broken even in death i found this book to be deeply spiritual and profoundly moving i can't understand why it hasn't won a whole swag of awards as in my opinion it really is deserving of the highest praise","759":"beautifully written story about the tragic events in cambodia during the khmer rouge occupation i agree with one reviewer who found the novel to be a bit dry in parts and to have a few too many underdeveloped characters that might have added depth still fully enjoyed this amazing sad tale","760":"this novel is really exceptional i've read a lot of memoirs written by survivors of the cambodian genocide so i knew that this would be a difficult read when i started this novel i read on with almost a sense of dread because i knew that chances were i'd get attached to characters that were not going to make it i wasn't proven wrong afterall roughly a third of the cambodian population didn't survive the pol pot years the odds weren't good however what i didn't expect from this novel was the way love and humanity shone through even in the darkest moments this book does not read like a catalogue of horrors the way some other memoirs do it is lyrical and thoughtful it is about the unconditional love of parents and children of brothers sisters and families it is about those unexpected kindnesses even in the midst of great tragedy of love that grows even when we're faced with terrible sorrow this isn't an easy book i cried several times reading it the book gets off to a slow start but this helps establish the characters and in the second half events move fairly quickly with the author perhaps wisely realizing that 2 years into the khmer rouge regime the reader is already reaching his her emotional limit even writing that last sentence feels like such a privilege since so many had to live through it and they didn't get a merciful fast forward at the halfway mark as difficult as it is as raw and real as the emotions in evokes are this is a book very worth reading","761":" this is a beautifully written story that said at times i felt like i just wanted it to move along a bit faster that is my only complaint this novel is in a way an autobiography of what the author went through as a young child in cambodia seven year old rammi lives a privileged life in phnom penh cambodia's capital when revolution turns her life into utter chaos and exodus from the safe life that she knows for the next four years she endures the deaths of family members starvation forced labor and a life of violence where your next moment may be your last not allowed to tell anyone that she is of royal lineage she fights daily for survival this is a tender story told from the perspective of a very young girl who grows up amidst the cambodian killing fields definitely a must read","762":"wow this one is a hard one for me it was pretty slow moving at first but once i got into it it was much quicker the atrocities that occur in so many countries never cease to amaze me i have read a little about the khmer rouge takeover in cambodia but this book still had me in shock i liked that the author made it a fiction book but interwove so many real events from her childhood the writing is super and many of the characters were endearing to me especially the main character and her sweet dad this is a tearjerker my one complaint is that the narrative seemed a bit mature for a 7 year old girl i kept thinking of my almost 7 year old and how there is no way she could communicate or comprehend much of what was written but that's my only complaint","763":" this book was beautifully written i loved the language the story however is not a pleasant one i was expecting the level of gruesomeness but it's still hard to read it the narrator starts out as a 7 year old girl in cambodia when khmer rouge is taking over in fact it is a fictionalized story of the author's own experience i cannot imagine surviving what she experienced at such a young age she was a very precocious bright girl that probably had something to do with her survival it was very interesting and yet at the same time it took me a while to get through this book something about it did not grab me the girl and her father were poetic dreamy communicators maybe that is what i did not relate to sometimes i felt it dragged a bit as she cogitated over stories and poems otherwise it was a good story and a good look into the psyche of revolutionaries and how their ideals get twisted due to past injustices and love of power","764":" this was a selection my book club chose and i was intrigued by the idea of reading about cambodia during the great genocide in the killing fields this was a difficult subject to read about but one of the things i love about reading is that it can take you to a whole different place without having to travel to the particular place the prose in the book was poetic and flowery the characterization was rich and vibrant in the final analysis this is why i gave the book an average rating i kept waiting for the plot to get more interesting and it never really did it was definitely a slow moving story my thought is that writing the book was a cathartic experience for the author as she experienced the genocide in cambodia as a child i thank her for having the courage to share her traumatic story so that we can all marvel at the strength of the human spirit this book discusses a heavy topic but it is worth the read","765":"a powerful eloquent debut novel about a cambodian family experiencing the upheavel and terror in the time of the khmer rouge told from a young girl's perspective","766":" i loved this book a few years ago i read a memoir written by a young woman who survived the khmer rouge atrocities it was so sad but i was glad i had read it because i learned so much about what was going on in another part of the world when i was a teenager this book reminded me of that but because it was fiction it was not as bluntly horrible the writer managed to tell a tale in such a way that i felt transported to a different time and place and felt a connection to the characters i will look forward to reading more by this author","767":" i loved this book it was powerful and moving and held out hope even in the depths of despair i wish that the author had chosen a different narrator for the tale though because as the mother of young children i found it hard to believe that i was hearing the voice of a 7yo weaving the narrative and it bothered me from time to time that said the characters and their struggles were incredibly compelling and i thought the author did a beautiful job with that aspect of the novel i especially loved the portayal of mama and big uncle and the contrast between the two of them and their reponse to their suffering and loss would definitely recommend this one without hesitation simply incandescent","768":" this book was a beautiful written account of the persecution and enslavement of the cambodian people during the reign of the khmer rouge it is told by a seven year old girl who through that awful history continues to search for hope in the devastation of a people and a land while the book is a work of fiction it is based on the author's actual experience i have the greatest admiration for author vaddey ratner who lived this life and survived to tell us what happened i couldn't recommend this book more highly","769":"beautifully written and moving partially based on author's escape from khmer rouge regime a member of my book group arranged for us to have a telephone chat with the author which was wonderful and added to my appreciation of what this woman has done with her life","770":"i rarely give a book five stars this one deserves six beautifully written poignant story of the takeover of cambodia from the eyes of a six year old a story of strength and endurance that will haunt you for days after you have read it","771":" this horrific time in cambodia's history reminds me again of something i heard long ago during a show about the wild west the narrator stated that the people that moved west to start over again didn't settle the west to create any new society but to recreate the society they left with themselves at the top the khmer rouge and other communist regimes have a grand utopian picture of life on earth but in practice the leaders really seek to set themselves up with the power vacated by the vanquished this sad poignant tale follows a minor princess through her years under the khmer rouge it is a beatific portrait of despair and hope spoiler alert hope triumphs","772":" raami is seven when the khmer rouge force her and her family from their home in phnom penh no one is safe under this new regime but as members of royalty there is even more danger for the sisowaths their exodus takes them into the country and things go from bad to worse raami's father is the first to be taken away then she her mother aana and younger sister radhana are separated from grandmother queen aunt tata big uncle and his wife aunt india and their children travelling further and further from home they are stripped of everything they own bit by bit and forced to work first in the fields and later building useless embankments to keep the floodwaters at bay tragedy follows everywhere life in a forced labor camp means sickness starvation and death through it all raami remembers the stories that were told to her the myths that explain life religion and tradition she stops speaking but holds on to her stories she protects herself but never forgets who she is ratner's writing is eloquent and lyrical reminiscent of jhumpa lahiri this book is lush with metaphor myths and stories the narrative voice of raami is imbued with a child's understanding and the knowledge that comes with hindsight it's a story of survival a firsthand account of life during war like agnes humbert's resistance it's a story that resonates and is as riveting as it is moving","773":"the book is somewhat based on the author's life as a young child in cambodia during the chaos of the khmer rouge interesting and well written but it was a little slow moving at times i still recommend it","774":"this novel just didn't pull me in as i had hoped possibly due to my lack of knowledge of both the khmer rouge regime and the many legends in the cambodian history that being said the book will make for a great discussion when ladies hooked on books next meets","775":"profound fiction based on fact ms ratner is a remarkable woman and survivor cambodia has known turmoil and we need to pay more attention to this nation","776":" vaddey ratner has written a stellar novel that grabs the reader from the first page it is exquisitely written even in the horror of its telling the book is about her life in cambodia once the khmer rough took power and evicted her and her family from their home in the years 1975 1979 though a novel with a protagonist named raami the book is more like a memoir of the author's life we learn of raami's life of privilege before the invasion of the khmer rouge and her struggles and pain during the holocaust that killed close to two million people in cambodia ms ratner talks about elie wiesel's book night being inspirational in her being able to find words to write this book raami's life parallels the author's but she changes the number of people in her family along with their names the only one whose name stays true is her father's a poet and lover of words who raami worships this book is profoundly inspirational while not being cloying or maudlin at any time as the author says at the end her purpose is to honor the lives lost and i wanted to do so by endeavoring to transform suffering into art she does this brilliantly and this is a book not to be missed by anyone who wants to understand resilience and love despite adversity","777":" of the many stories i have read about the khmer rouge some by cambodians others by foreigners trapped there during 1975 1979 i felt that this was the least informative i understand that in the shadow of the banyan sought to be an artistic rendition of the experience as opposed to a realist one such as that of chanrithy him or francois bizot and hence in the light of this different objective was not concerned with the details of the decrepitude that i encountered in the other two novels but this decision to use fiction rather than a memoir style to explain what happened left me feeling either that 1 ratner was maybe privileged in her treatment perhaps due to her royal connections which although suppressed may have had an impact on those around her or that 2 because she was so young during the kr's rule only 5 as she says she may have had to reconstruct a lot of what happened based on the reading of other similar stories nevertheless either way one must not dismiss her experiences her pain especially and i have profound respect for what she has undergone and how she has wished to translate those experiences into words i know it's not an easy thing to do and i know that regardless of the quality of the story one always has much more hidden that can't be translated into words let me say a few words about this artistic novel then whose reading for me would not have been complete had i not inserted bits and pieces of my own knowledge of other stories about the khmer rouge as an artistic novel this is how s u0026amp s qualifies it i read the novel carefully because i wanted to absorb all the images that ratner captured and tried to convey some no most of them were beautiful very beautiful but if i were to assess this novel purely for its artistic qualities without letting the emotions of pity sympathy and a respect for the author's personal experiences cloud my judgment i would say that it suffers from some of the jarring deficiencies that most artistic novels i know suffer from that is the slow and cautious pace that i had at first was quickly lost as i turned the pages therefore it became less artistic less soulful i now remember that i have always felt that most of salman rushdie's books suffer from the same defect it's as if the procedural constraint that most literary agents have of requiring say the first 20 30 50 pages to be sent to them before they make a decision on representation has made authors perfect only those pages i feel that ratner could have spent more time on the rest of the story to make it more artistic and soulful qualities that i feel she could easily add to the story because i can see she has it in her not many authors do lastly i do agree with other reviewers that the child narrator's voice in the novel didn't sound authentic one can't imagine her observing deducing and remembering so much if she were only 7 years old one of the books in my opinion that had it from beginning to end was vladimir nabokov's speak memory this memoir deserves to be read over and over again just because of that","778":"so so book some nice prose and poetry but nothing i would recommend to a friend","779":"wowthis book was incredible but so sad it has been years since i cried over a book but i did over this one","780":"i really liked this book club selection it taught me things about cambodia which is an area i know so little about inspiring magical sad and compelling highly recommend it","781":"this is a beautiful written story about tragic events it's about a seven year old girl named raami who is the daughter of a cambodian prince the book takes place when the khmer rouge come to power it's hard to believe that it is based on a true store","782":"i've been waiting a while to read this book it didn't disappoint two thumbs up","783":"the writing was beautiful and vividly painted the scene it was interesting to learn about this time period and what happened in cambodia the story line was heartbreaking and definitely a tearjerker which was unfortunate because i read it on the airplane and only had the small drink napkin available","784":"disturbing book that was difficult to put down a must read","785":"this one is so hard to rate because the story is beautifully written and yet so terrible that i can't say i enjoyed it the story which is a fictionalized memoir of sorts tells the tale of a young girl whose world is turned upside down under the khmer rouge what happens to her family and the people she loves is truly terrible yet ratner writes it beautifully certainly not one to read casually but i found it very interesting and at the same time terrifying","786":" ernest hemingway wrote in a farewell to arms the world breaks everyone then some become strong in the broken places ratner's moving novel tells the story of a 7 year old cambodian girl raami whose world is broken when the khmer rouge take control of her country in the 1970s as i read this novel i said to myself the author must have lived through this the vivid and detailed descriptions of what raami and her family endured in what have come to be known as the 'killing fields' could not be the product of research and creativity alone when i reached the author's note at the end i discovered that yes ms ratner's novel is semi autobiographical so yes she did survive ratner was inspired to write about the genocide in her country when she read elie wiesel's night while in high school in the u s the story is told in the voice of the little girl raami who walked with a limp due to having had polio raami and her family were ordered to leave their home along with everyone else in phnom penh and were transported to the countryside this massive uprooting of the urban population was a major component of khmer rouge ideology which was masterminded by members of the intellectual class and carried out by thousands of uneducated teenage soldiers recruited from the peasant class families were broken apart in an attempt to insure greater loyalty to the revolution and the organization the people were subjected to forced labor starvation horrific living and working conditions and a systematic campaign of intimidation brutality and murder ratner is one who became strong in the broken places this book is valuable not only because it educates us about what happened in cambodia but because it is a testament to humanity amid inhumanity we come to understand how the bonds of family the spiritual strength raami learns from the poetry and stories told to her by her father along with the dogged determination of her mother sustain her through unimaginable suffering and loss when a book drags you through hell lifts your heart to heaven brings tears of pain and joy to your eyes and connects you to the very essence of what it means to be human it is a very good read thank you ms ratner for sharing this incredible journey with your readers","787":"heartbreaking and unforgettable this novel is the fictionalized story of the author's early childhood in cambodia when the khmer rouge came to power i found i needed to read this slowly as the descriptions of the brutality and hardships endured were very hard to take however her luminous prose and compelling story as well as the relationships among all the characters keep one mesmerized and horrified at what happened in a way no news reportage ever could","788":"a very good book doesn't delve into the privations so much as explores the strengths that kept the characters going during the khmer rouge era","789":"i had a hard time getting into this book at first i think it was because this is a novel about a very horrific piece of history the genocide in cambodia under the khmer rouge regime and i knew that really bad things were going to happen to the sweet little seven year old narrator of this story once i got into it it did prove to be a disturbing read but the story was so interesting and the protagonist so compelling that it really didn't matter this is the author's life story although she chose to fictionalize it at first i wondered if she should have just told her story as a work of non fiction but her fictionalized version is such a beautiful love song to her deceased father and her lost country that i think she made the right decision a non fiction version would likely have presented the facts without the beauty and that would have been a terrible loss","790":"i loved tis book becuse i knew nothing about this sad chapter in history and i found that it was an amazing narration through a child's eyes of what was horrifying and inexplicable to adults then and now it's sad lyrical but also hopeful since the narrator is a survivor a lovely novel about a disturbing time in a beautiful place","791":"4 5 stars for sure i couldn't stop thinking about the author long after i finished the book the darkness during this era were viewed from a child's perspective thus allowing the reader to feel some hope that goodness would prevail excellently written i kept telling myself it was a true story without any modifications","792":"this was beautifully and heart breakingly written the sense of love triumphing over life is on every page the little girl raami is both adultly eloquent and childishly innocent her tale of ultimate survival in the midst of forced labor starvation and death is highly engaging","793":"the word i keep coming back to for this book is wow it is such a journey such an experience and knowing it mirrors much of the author's own childhood makes it all the more shocking all the more horrible and beautiful on this occasion one of exceeding few the book blurbs are exactly accurate the author brings to life the killing fields and the many atrocities of the khmer rouge but more importantly also brings to life the people who experienced that dark time even the khmers remain true to life instead of receiving a blanket portrayal as arch villains as easy and probably tempting as it would be to demonize the lot of them several are sympathetic even friendly the result is impressive engaging at times transcendent and intense my only criticisms are that some of the descriptions are overly flowery and that the main character is sometimes too perceptive too discerning for her age however those are small criticisms indeed and easily dismissed in favor of the story an easy four stars","794":" this is the first time i have ever felt compelled to right a book review on goodreads which means i really loved this book i was hooked from the very beginning and loved the author's beautiful use of language story telling the excellent character development and the portrayal of the family's raw emotions throughout the book after finishing the book i just couldn't stop thinking about the amazing story and how real it all felt almost as if i was there i will definitely recommend this book to friends and am putting it on my favorites list for sure","795":"at first i was concerned that the language was too flowery but it evolved into a rich depiction of a terrible time while not exactly the uplifting tale of the year it shows the true strength and adaptability of the human psyche and the beauty of familial love","796":" this is a book i will be thinking about long after reading it once i got into it i couldn't put it down and the fact a lot of it is based on what happened to the author vaddey ratner makes it that much more poignant the story is told through the eyes of seven year old raami who lived an idyllic life as a cambodian princess that life is gone in the blink of an eye as the khmer rouge sweeps through the country and tries to destroy anything considered modern or harmful to the new regime raami and her family are ordered to leave immediately with only time to pack up the barest essentials what follows is her bid to survive the horrors of the genocide as her life and the lives of her family go from bad to worse the loss and pain and suffering were moving and hard to read at times however what does emerge is the power of the human spirit when all hope is lost somehow she manages to carry on when those around her are dying either through a bullet sickness or starvation in the hardest of times she remembers the words of her father when i lie buried beneath this earth you will fly she feels she has to survive for him and all who have lost their lives and their voices it is worth reading the author's note at the end of the book as she explains her connection to the events in the book and a tribute to the father she lost","797":" ratner weaves a gripping devastating and yet encouraging story of a young girl and her family during the khmer rouge rebelion in cambodia in the 1970s we follow the family as they are forced from one location to another losing their royal status but keeping what is important to them a sense of family i was especially touched by this story because in college in the late 80s i had a cambodian friend who told the story of his escape from cambodia and the khmer rouge i couldn't help but think of him throughout the book this is a book worthy of your time a story that deserves to be told","798":" based on the author's own childhood this is a heart breaking and inspiring story the daughter of a wealthy foreign educated minor noble family the narrator's happy and comfortable childhood is suddenly and violently disrupted as the khmer rouge take over cambodia they are forcibly driven from their estate sent into internal exile condemned to forced labor and endure starvation execution and terror the love of family the power of story the indestructible conviction that hope will prevail and suffering can not last forever sustain the narrator and her mother through 4 years of unimaginable horror it is certainly inspiring to see love goodness and hope survive the slaughter of brutality hatred and cruelty it is heart breaking to realize how often this century we have heard this story from the soviet union to nazi germany from chili to china even more disturbing is to admit that these stories are even now being written in the lives of children from syrian refugee camps to sudanese villages","799":"i would read another book by her especially if it continued the main character's story as she came to the u s and began her new life excellent book","800":"i didn't give this a perfect rating i did love this book but there were a few things that sort of bothered me i'll start with the positives the setting cambodia from 1975 1979 the khmer rouge revolution i've never read anything from this period set in this country and only had the vaguest of ideas about pol pot's reign of terror i really liked that i could read about it from a person who was there and experienced the same thing as the little girl in the book did the author is raami i also liked that had no white savior character she doesn't make any friends with a revolutionary i hadn't realized how much of a cliche the golden hearted bad guy had become until this book avoided it the book is unflinching in its portrayal of death despair and hunger it moved me to tears a few times i almost never cry but most of all the language of moons and fireflies and guardian spirits lyrical beautiful now for the things that made me wonder a bit the girl she's very sympathetic but she is even before the revolution a very precocious child almost too precocious she's the kind of girl who thinks of her father as a god waxing lyrical out of the silence a line from his poem that she thinks describes him perfectly see what i mean this is something that is clearly retrospective but it's attributed in the novel to a sheltered girl of seven however much the novel beats on our heads that raami is seven the actions words of the others clearly are geared towards someone older at one point when the revolutionaries want the names of the people they've captured they ask raami for the name of the father she gives it not knowing that because her father is a prince he's an enemy of the revolution and he needs to hide everyone makes a huge deal she's seven the revolutionary had a gun they never told the kids not to call their parents by their real names yet no one holds this child and tells her it's ok in fact they even go so far as to blame her there's more weirdness view spoiler when raami's younger sister dies her mother becomes numb a while later when raami tries hard to bring some feeling in her mother the mother tells her that she was closer to the younger girl because she loved raami more raami has polio but radana the little one is perfect i don't understand this she also tells raami that she doesn't blame her for giving up her father but she may have wanted raami to think that because she feels that she cannot blame her husband because she understands that he gave himself up for a reason but somehow she has it in her to feel vengeful about her little daughter was i the only one who remembered that raami was seven even without a revolution it's too tender an age to wound stupidly like that needless to say i didn't like her mother's characterization much hide spoiler my ultimate problem with the book was the conceit of a too young child with a very mature narrative had there been a gradual progression of her maturity i would have agreed but it's the same from start to finish with a couple of spikes and dips here and there but it's still a great book with beautiful language describing ultimately among all the sordidness and the cruelty the triumph of will and that will be what i take away from it","801":"beautifully written as i read i felt connected to the author this book for me was difficult to put down","802":"a haunting story of one young girl's experience of the khmer rouge revolution in cambodia and it's aftermath","803":" it was certainly well written and certainly worth reading but it failed to grab in the way that other novels about genocide have done while beautiful and lyrical i wasn't sure that way of writing quite did justice to the horror of this experience i suppose it's fair to say its a great book but not at all what i anticipated and while written from the perspective of a young sheltered child her perception of the events around her are mature and complex and i think that unrealistic element made it difficult for me","804":"poignant lyrical and difficult to put down i loved this book","805":"if i could give this book a 10 i would","806":"vadday ratner was 5 years old when the khmer rouge took over cambodia although this book is a novel the author based it on her horrific experiences as her family was separated from their home their belongings and each other and moved around the countryside having visited cambodia two years ago i found this compelling reading having seen the evidence of the recent 1975 1979 atrocities","807":"the book started off as a very fast read and i whipped through the first 80 pages but then it began to slow down and to drag even i was dismayed but upon reflection i think this was perfect see the book is about a wealthy royal family in cambodia when the revolution breaks out and what happens to them seen through the eyes of the oldest 7 year old daughter raami and at the beginning it is hectic and discombobulating and no one knows what's going on exactly they are herded from their home exiled separated from friends and family and have no idea what will happen to them and then as their new life begins to settle in although settle is not exactly accurate as the revolution wants to keep people on their toes by constantly changing things up so in the course of four years raami and her mother end up in at least three different places things do slow down life becomes more rote a series of identical horrible little indignities as they are forced to work like laborers and are slowly starving to death the pacing of the novel echoes the pacing of their lives and as the narrative slows so do their lives ms ratner has written a masterful novel one filled with poetry and beauty despite the degrading and horrifying circumstances sadly it is based on her own life story although obviously she has thrived in the aftermath normally i don't gravitate towards books that are particularly foreign and i also am not crazy about war novels especially as regards wars i am less familiar with but i am glad i was assigned to read this book by my book club as i really did love it in fact it is one of my favorite book club reads all year there was a ton to discuss and other readers' angles on the story were fascinating incredibly sad but ultimately filled with uplifting hope in the shadow of the banyan should be widely read and treasured","808":"this was a very good book with believable characters consistent themes and stories and descriptives that make sense for the place and time i think the horrors of the cambodian genocide are downplayed in this book but i also think that adding graphic details would detract from the voice of the author a survivor of the genocide herself this is perhaps the best written debut novel i have ever read","809":"not a fun read but it really brought home the horrors of the khmer rouge years in cambodia an autobiographical novel by a woman now in the us i realize that the owners of my favorite local thai restaurants are the children of parents who undoubtedly lived through the horrors described here how brutal people can be and how full of hope","810":"this was a very moving book with many twists and turns i was tearing up and giggling page to page the culture was a bit hard to follow at times but laid a wonderful tone to the story be prepared to be moved","811":"please read this book i grew up with many se asian refugee kids in ca and never knew their stories today there are 21m refugees and 65m forcibly displaced people around the world this is a beautifully written and absolutely heartbreaking account of one journey but these stories are not over yet","812":" this book was somewhat of a slow burn but oh so worth it in the end it is beautifully written and the blend of fiction and memoir was done perfectly i learned about the war torn history of cambodia with beautiful prose and stunning character growth to guide my way although the story is narrated by a child you can clearly see the influence of an adults interpretation of the story history through her descriptions and understanding of the events around her i think this is where the blend of fiction and memoir is done so well you see beyond the eyes of a young girl in a way that i think lends importance and resonance to the story instead of hindering the fictional aspect a really wonderful read","813":"the story of an 8 year old cambodian girl whose village is taken over by the khmer rouge","814":" i hope this book becomes a huge hit its story deserves memorializing we live in the shadow of the jewish holicaust and it strongly shapes our us political life today yet there are so many other instances of genocide that we know little about the loss of at least 2 million cambodians at the hands of the khmer rouge in the late 70s is one this is a lyrical largely autobiographical novel about a young girl who survived this horrible event at great personal loss and struggle the sadness and brutality of the reality is tempered with the spiritual writing and story telling it really deserves a second read because i was so interested in what what going to happen next that read without stopping to savor much of the language and meanings she manages to tell a horrific story with the softness of imagery making it both disturbing and uplifting a very talented new author i hope she has more stories to tell","815":" the language is lovely i cried off and on through the book the misery is palpable the thin thread of hope every now and then i've come to better understand that lunatics really do come to power evil in the garden of beasts by erik larsen is another example this one is closer to home because the voice is that of a 7 year old girl who suffers with polio as the khmer rouge comes to power and systematically destroys cambodia senseless and tragic this is the first book that i have every contemplated reading again","816":" i began the book thinking i wasn't going to like the writing style the first 10 pages or so begins with characters and myths and the life of cambodia leaping out at you all at once i felt like the writing was rough and was going to be unmanageable but then she hit her stride the book developed a tension like so many stories of war would things get better or would they get worse do we take the chance of staying put or should we move one people begin to disappear and lives are changed forever as the cambodian war rages for 3 plus years the main character a young girl of 7 gives the story a child's view of the events that unfold she has an undying love of her father who is sadly a casualty of the war the story is emotional and her writing of the land is lush my only issue was my lack of familiarity with the mythology that is sprinkled throughout the book it was written in such a way that left me feeling like i needed to do a bit of research to fully understand the book","817":"at once tender tragic powerful exotic poetic beautiful a must read","818":"beautiful poetically written story about the horrors of phnom penh in cambodia through the eyes of a little girl who sees her cherished family and way of life destroyed","819":"this book did not hold my attention well it had a lot of reference to ancient cambodian folklore told through poems and stories i did not like being sidetracked from the story line with this folklore it really added nothing to the story in my opionion i also wish we heard more of the main characters' daily lives under the khmer rouge","820":"a remarkable story read the author's note at the end before you start while it reveals some aspects of the book it gives concrete historical background for the basis of the author's story","821":"written from the point of view of seven year old raami a member of the royal family living in phnom penh she recalls this most brutal of times when the revolutionary khmer rouge took over the family is forced out of their home and marched miles away to various hostile places for four years she and her family endure brutal forced labour starvation and the deaths of members of her family during this time raami stubbornly clings to the myths and legends of her childhood and to the poems her father wrote which give her hope for the future this is an extraordinary story made all the more so because it is really a memoir the author explains in an afterword that raami's story is actually her own although she the author was five years old at the start of the revolution to most of us in the uk the 70's was a decade of glitter glam rock flares and kipper ties i remember it well i also remember the war in cambodia on the news almost every night it is often a forgotten war being overshadowed by the vietnam war those of us who were alive during this time need to remember and those of us born later need to be told this beautifully written book does just that my thanks to amazon vine for a free copy to review","822":"i found this a touching reminder of the terrible days of the khmer rouge told through the eyes of a seven year old trying to understand her changing life a suvival tale with beautiful stories and poems that give light and hope in the darkest of times","823":"this gorgeously written book was not easy to read at all like hillenbrand's unbroken or weisel's night it's full of poetic language and heartbreak mankind can be atrocious yet ratner's writing is so lush i will count this as difficult and rewarding as mccarthy's the road of you can handle the horror it's really fantastic","824":" this book is good but at times i grew weary of the child's point of view at times the narrator was too much of a 7 year old other times she was noticeably wise beyond her years i think the author was attempting to keep the story from becoming too didactic and for he most part she was successful but i'm a sucker for these sort of post bloody revolution novels and this isn't one of the better ones i've read just this year i read a book about the rwandan genocide running the rift by benaron and i believe it was more successful","825":"a beautifully written 'autobiography' of her struggle and survival from the khmer rouge she adapted her life experience into realistic fiction totally and highly recommended for all who's interested visited intend to visit cambodia","826":" it's difficult to review a book like this the subject is so important and powerful first i thought the writer did a fantastic job turning something so close to her into fiction it can be extremely hard to do i think but maybe ultimately more rewarding than a memoir because it allows the writer to elaborate on events that were not elaborated on at the time it allows the writer even in first person to go into other characters' experiences i think that was especially important here because the cambodian genocide and diaspora is not something that americans know alot about i thought ratner did a fabulous job giving us enough information to follow what was happening at least as much information as the characters themselves had but not so much that we would be overwhelmed the situation was extremely complex not only encompassing internal conflicts but also outside influence from the united states and vietnam i also thought ratner did a great job describing place i've never seen a rice paddy i've never been to cambodia or anywhere in southeast asia but i did not have a problem following raami from place to place this is something that could have easily bogged down the reader given how many different places raami moves through in her experience but the writing and structure was flawless the same goes for passage of time the rule of the khmer rouge lasted four years not an impossible length for a book but still a long time ratner did a great job illustrating and moving the reader through the most important moments she didn't bog the narrative down with too much repetitive description of what must have been a pretty monotonous day to day existence most of the time i took off one star and nearly two because to me the writing itself just wasn't right there it was really close there were some very beautiful lyrical moments i loved how ratner used the bits of raami's father's poetry i loved the use of folk and religious tales at some points she used very spot on specific metaphors but not always to me it felt like the second to last draft of a novel where certain moments are perfect but some still need to be teased out to match of course this is ratner's first novel so that might account for it and it was i'm sure a difficult novel to write but for me lyricism is a perfect pair for dealing with difficult content and i think it would have brought the reader closer to the text","827":"very well written author makes you feel like you are there with her sad story with happy ending","828":"i enjoyed this book i liked learning about a situation and country i knew little about i loved the author's writing style so lyrical","829":"a great novel about the dark period of cambodian history under the khmer rouge recommended if you are traveling to cambodia or just have a general interest in it","830":"very thought provoking","831":" i think that in the shadow of the banyan by vaddey ratner is a great book about the strife of the cambodian people after the civil war and i would definitely recommend it to anyone looking for a good book based on real and lesser known events this book follows raami a seven year old royal girl threw her experiences of the aftermath of war ratner captures the loss of innocence and hardening of one's soul in times of trouble with raami and her families progression into what the organization wants them to be and how the family is broken up and ground down to a select few ratner paints a perfect picture juxtaposing the beauty of the cambodian wilderness to the hardships brought by the organization and it's followers this book shows and explains the real life struggles after a side has come out victorious and takes grip of the country anyone looking for a good historical fiction book set in cambodia should pick up this book","832":"a lyrical read about a young girl living under the khmer rouge regime the author combines history and fiction in this beautiful sad and empowering book the young girl survives many tragedies and still has a positive outlook","833":"this story is set in cambodia during the revolution of 1975 1979 it is loosely based on the author's own experience as a child at that time very moving and sad yet a great insight into history and people also beautifully written","834":"loved this book clearly felt the pain of the author although i discussed with friends thatch this book the poetry softened the blow a little as compared to other similar books very engaging would love to know more about the authors life enjoyed the exposure to the culture and religion","835":" how can a book break your heart u0026amp make your heart soar all at once how can certain passages be of a horrific nature u0026amp yet be written in such a beautiful way that you must go back u0026amp re read them i don't know how but this book does that a story about the cambodian genocide and all the tragedies that came from the khmer rouge coming into power in 1975 it is nontheless a beautiful book the subject matter is heartbreaking u0026amp disturbing reading about the true evil some people posess always is but it's also a story of the strength of spirit u0026amp the endurance of love between people u0026amp the truly remarkable way people have of surviving the most terrible tragedies imaginable that the story was told through the eyes of a 7 year old worked for me because it was written extremely well u0026amp though vaddey ratner wrote about her own experiences u0026amp drew the main character of raami after her own self it followed more of a literature format than a memoir and this is what makes this book stand out from others that may be similar in subject matter there were some truly beautiful moments in this story words that swirled around your mind as you read them u0026amp enchanted you i loved ratner's inclusion of a love for poetry u0026amp words from 2 of the main characters their love of stories it was a beautiful connection between them u0026amp as an avid reader you can't help but connect to those feeelings i hope this author hurries up u0026amp writes something else because i'll be first in line to read it","836":"this was beautifully written the first half was slow but i couldn't put the book down for the second half the tragedy of the kahmer rouge is portrayed through the eyes of a child with much more knowledge and insight than any 7 9 year old ought to have it is also a beautiful memorial to the author's father","837":"not finished yet i think i have to wait to be up for the khmer rouge","838":"fiction book about her experiences in cambodia when the khmer rouge came to power very gripping and powerful and tragic","839":"amazing story of life and survival","840":"the pain caused by humans@war versus the incredible moving beauty of human love even in time of profound pain please read it it may make you cry","841":"spoilers wavered between four and five stars but since i couldn't put it down for the last few hours i went with five this book was equal parts hopeful and heartbreaking i felt like i knew each character intimately and i hated each time one of them was lost on this journey ratner's descriptions are beautiful i'm not sure there is another way to effectively describe them this is a book i would definitely recommend","842":"the author tells the story of the khmer rouge from a child's perspective very moving in parts the author grew up in cambodia and most of the story is true her father was a descendant of royalty and a poet it is written as a novel with details added to childhood memories and changes to other names and characters the relationships among family members are well developed","843":"another gem this book is called fiction but is based on the author's childhood in cambodia during the socialist revolution her family is forced from their home and eventually into a labor camp the depth and intricacies of her love for and from her parents is beautiful the writing is wonderful descriptions beautiful and story both heart breaking and uplifting","844":"a young girl who grows up during the time of the killing fields in cambodia heart breaking beautifully rendered","845":"the book was really a depressing read as it told the plight of a family particularly a young girl who suffer at the hands of the khmer rouge in cambodia it was extremely well written however certain events in the story were disturbing i would rate this book a 3 5","846":"it took me a long time to get through this book yet it was beautiful lyrical and poetic and heart wrenching based on true events","847":"goodreads first reads giveaway free book from simon and schuster a sad but riveting story about a family of cambodian royalty torn apart by the khmer rouge takeover of phnom penh in 1975 this book is beautifully written and its' characters impossible to forget the fact that this novel is based on the author's actual experience as a young child in cambodia and her immense research into her past as an adult makes it heart wrenching in the shadow of the banyan is worthy of being considered a classic novel to be read for generations to come thank you simon and schuster and goodreads for giving me the opportunity to read this novel","848":"wonderfully written and phenomenal characters but horribly sad i am also glad i read it because i know a lot more about cambodia now","849":" a fictionalized memoir of the genocide of the khmer rouge in cambodia in 1975 79 as seen through the eyes of a very prescient articulate perceptive 7 year old girl i held off on reading this for a while fearing that it would be a hard and unfamiliar read it was however beautifully written and while describing atrocities nonetheless focused on humanity and universal themes like a daughter's love for her father her relationship with her mother her struggle to understand evil and suffering","850":"so sad yet compelling i learned about that timeplace in history in a way you can't from a newspaper be sure to read the afterword and interview with the author in the kindle edition adds a another dimension","851":"the horrific subject of this book cambodia and the khmer rouge is written from the point of view of a displaced child the language is mesmerizing and beautiful this is a must read i urge you to read it","852":"amazing story i shed many tears but overall it has a bit of a hopefulness to it that soothes the sadness","853":"the gripping story of one family's struggle to survive in the cambodian aftermath of the vietnam war their desperate efforts to survive the cruelties of the khyme rouge a must read","854":"such a sad story but i love reading historical fiction to get a feel of the times and the events that occurred it is unbelievable to me that people can suffer so much and still come out with such strong spirits very inspiring","855":"shockingly beautiful this story tore my heart out from the first page this story told through the eyes of 7 year old raami tells of so much more than the khmer rouge revolution in fact the events of the country take a back seat the the stories of the people this book has inspired me to find love in places otherwise neglected","856":"technically not read one of the few books i just didn't want to finish the story should be amazing but the narrator seemed so pollyannaish and mystical that i found her distracting","857":"this was a beautifully written book the first half was hard for me to get into but the second half has hard to put down i like how it was written from the perspective of an 8 year old but had a difficult time in the beginning understanding what was going on since i was truly ignorant on the regime history in cambodia overall it is one of those books that move you and it is impossible to say anything really bad about it was well written in a memoir fiction style and i would recommend it to anyone","858":"this book was just heartbreaking unbelievable that it happened and still does happen makes me thankful for where i am and what i have","859":"\"a shaft of light fell on the front of the house and spilled into the open hallway from the balcony i imagined it a celestial carpet thrown from the heavens by a careless tevoda-- an angel\" 2 \"...the mekong heaved like a waking serpent\" 42 \"a small wispy cloud was moving across the waxing quarter moon like a veil pulled over a lopsided smile trying to hide its amusement from us\" 103 \"it's true mine is a life of povertymy home a half built thatched hutits walls the winds and rains\" 122 \"a chorus of mourners joined them an endless lullaby of tears\" 127 \"i didn't know so much sadness could exist in so small a place\" 138 \" 'you are full of private thoughts comrade aana

smile and for a moment i forgot my unhappiness thinking how awful it was to be this giant with his enormous grief with no one to comfort him in the way that i in my smallness could be comforted\" 260 261","860":"slow going","861":"beautiful lyrical writing style emulating what i imagine to be a traditional cambodian dance a story of the horror of revolution where ignorance and bestiality overtake centuries of civilization and culture but where the power of familial love remains undefeated in at least the heart of our protagonist the author's note at the end must not be missed but be sure to have a tissue handy","862":"very sad story of the khmer rouge atrocities and genocide in the mid to late 1970s told from the perspective of a 7 year old girl beautifully written and moving i recommend it","863":"the more i read about the khmer rouge the more confused i become about how any of that could have possibly happened definitely one of the worst tragedies of modern history what i found nice about this book was that it was in the point of view in a young girl captivated by khmer tales her father and other loved ones tell her after i realized that the father in the book was the same father of the author herself my heart broke this book of all things feels more like an ode to the father that she lost and trying to come to peace with what happened to her as a child definitely recommend it","864":"i was disappointed with my reaction when i started reading this book as i was really looking forward to it it's premise sounded very promising and interesting however i just couldn't get into it maybe i found the writing too long winded at times too flowery i don't know but i found myself flicking through the pages most of the times the only part of the book i read with interest from beginning to end was the author's note at the end of the book","865":" i listened to this book from audible which i love it is the poignant and real though fictionalized story of a little girl whose family loses everything in cambodia during the time of the khmer rouge the brutality and cruelty stand in contrast to the child storyteller's observations of nature using weather birds and bugs as her teachers and creating stories to help her grasp the unspeakable fate that has befallen them the will to live is an extraordinary thing at the end the author speaks of her own experiences and her devotion to the father who endangered his own life so that she might live to tell this story","866":" please check out all my reviews at http ultraviolentlit blogspot ca ratner's novel would be better classified as a fictionalized memoir of an overlooked period of history in the western world cambodia in the 1970s during the khmer rouge revolution ratner herself writes that she has \"chosen the medium of fiction of reinventing and imagining where memory alone is inadequate \" p 318 author's note as a young child during the revolution it would certainly be hard to differentiate fact from fiction when reporting on the atrocities of the khmer rouge regime the story is ostensibly told from the perspective of a seven year old girl raami but with a strong adult slant the point of view is inconsistent with raami sometimes childlike and uncertain and at other times understanding too much about the world because of this it is more like an adult describing childhood than an actual child's voice i didn't mind this inconsistency at all because it was clear that ratner was reflecting back on her former life putting words into the mouth of her child self raami speaks often of the importance of storytelling of bearing witness to the crimes of the past on page 82 when leaving her own past behind she says \"it was clear to me now that while books could be torn and burned the stories they held needn't be lost or forgotten \" when everything seems lost she can recall her father her sister and her old life by telling stories and isn't this why we read and write the novel begins with moment by moment detail of the first days of the revolution then dissolves into vague swaths of time in the second half of the book i think this is probably related to how young raami saw the world - in the beginning everything was sharp and new and vibrant but as time passed she lost her sense of place in the world and the narrative becomes unreliable starving and overworked ten year old raami is a far cry from the sheltered pampered girl she was before the revolution the girl who saw the beauty in everything her vivid descriptions disintegrate into the monotony of a life passing in internment poetry is a major part of raami's family life - her father a prince of cambodia is a poet who is targeted for his intellectualism as well as his royal connections raami's voice as well as ratner's narration is lyrical also but it does not feel overdone i got lost in the language in a foreign country that i have never been to but felt like i could see in front of me the horror and uncertainty of raami's existence during oppression is only made redeemable by the strengthening of connection between her mother and herself they are bonded in their love for raami's father who was doomed although he continued to believe in the revolution he never stopped looking for goodness in the people who aimed to destroy him it takes time for disillusionment to set in and although raami and probably ratner did lose her hope for a better life she regained it through the act of storytelling","867":"fantastic book","868":"heartbreaking and beautiful beautifully written so don't skim every sentence a work of art what makes this even more inspirational and in a way overwhelming is the fact that the novel is actually the story and experiences of the author even in the midst of all of the horrors she kept her belief in humanity and survived","869":"amazing one of the best books i have read in years absolutely breathtaking poetic and inspiring beautifully written","870":"this book gave me chills it was written through the eyes of a child and was so accurate of the innocence of knowing too much and understanding too little that it was breathtaking and heartbreaking all at once i would recommend this story to anyone","871":"amazingly written the story gripped me from the very beginning and was made even more poignant to know the author lived part of the story","872":"this book was so beautifully written about the genocide of the educated peoples of cambodia see also the great leap forward in china","873":"beautifully written and haunting story of life under the khmer rouge based on the author's actual experiences and her family","874":" raami is the seven year old daughter of a prince she lives in a beautiful house in the capital city of phnom penh in cambodia her father is a poet and a buddhist and he has created a serene peaceful place for his family within their home raami lives with her parents her mother is a vision of beauty her baby sister radana and her grandmother the queen as well as a variety of servants the year is 1975 and the winds of a lost civil war are blowing into town the khmer rouge regime has just taken power of cambodia they arrived in phnom penh and proceeded to evacuate the city raami's family piles into the family car in sweltering heat in a rushed exodus never to return during the next four years the khmer rouge tries to systematically destroy the infrastructure of the country and its people by creating a group mentality separating family reeducating the educated populace in the ways of the peasants and stripping each individual of their memory of self two million people lost their lives during the brutal communist regime of pol pot the author vaddey ratner is a survivor of the cambodian genocide she was five years old when the communist regime came to power she lost almost everything during the revolution including most of her family she survived to tell her story in this semi autobiographical novel most of the characters in the book are based on her family members and her personal story is embedded in the narrative of in the shadow of the banyan ratner is a beautiful writer while the story itself is tragic the beauty of the writing and the hope of the characters make this story exceptional the love of family the beauty of the moon the hope for tomorrow are all reasons to fight and live among tragic and terrible circumstances poetry is woven throughout the pages as well as traditional stories and myths of the ancestors at times in the shadow of the banyan is hard to read yet the author offers equal parts of tragedy and grace imbuing the novel with small moments of kindness love and spirit at one point in the novel the family is housed in a buddhist monastery classroom this quote is written on the chalkboard \"knowing comes from learning finding from seeking \" pg 69","875":"a moving story of the human sorrows inflicted under the deadly khmer rouge regime as seen through the eyes of a young girl it is a bit odd to describe a book about such a terrible subject as beautiful yet that is what it is due to ratner's wonderful narrative some could say that is 'fluffs' over the realities of the time but these are thoughts and memories from a child's perspective there are countless other books available that cover the horrors in grim detail that is not what this book is about the story is not just about the plight of the cambodian people under the regime it is the tale of a young girl's experiences as she is dragged from innocence through a series of tragic events and her way of finding hope by referring to the stories and traditional beliefs of her culture books like this remind us of the ugliness and the beauty of human kind","876":"one of the best books i've ever read it's historical fiction at its finest great storytelling and character development couldn't put it down and never wanted it to end","877":"a beautiful book illuminating a genocidal revolution not often written about ratner's weaving of cambodian stories and cultural icons provides poetic insight she wraps pain in poetry one of the only ways to deal with such agonizing loss","878":"i usually love historical fiction but this story just didn't grab me raami's tale of family and loss as she faced the atrocities of the khmer rouge regime are haunting and lyrical almost to a fault it wasn't until the second half of the book that i felt that her story became personal and harrowing enough to capture the reader's attention and unfortunately at this point most people will have given up","879":"i'm not sure i can review this book somehow it feels too personal how does one pass a critique on the story of a life how does one argue literary merit with a seven year old narrator wise beyond her years yet still stuck in a childish understanding of the world it's pithy and trite to say but recommended for anyone who loves their parents","880":"a beautifully written but utterly painful book to read anyone who has read and appreciated to kill a mockingbird will also appreciate the beauty of this book like to kill a mockingbird it's history told from a young girl's perspective but for a longer period of time and with more dire consequences for anyone who wants to understand more of what it might have been like to live in cambodia during this time this book is a must","881":"in college i studied international relations with a focus in peace u0026amp conflict i don't know where my fascination with genocide and civil war came from but to this day i find myself drawn to non fiction works about rwanda cambodia armenia east timor etc in the shadow of the banyan was my first fictional novel about genocide and it made a great impact on me to put a face and a personal story to the atrocities committed in cambodia is to humanize the conflict which for me made it all the more horrific i know that raami is a fictional character but it is her story that made me mourn for the lives lost in cambodia not the non fiction textbooks with their cold language and disillusioned rhetoric i have learned so much from the memoirs the biographies and the history books but i now understand that to truly capture the spirit of the tragedy you have to incorporate fictional works as well","882":"not sure why but this book did not catch my attention maybe i will try again sometime","883":"i give this book 3 49 stars vaddey ratner is a great storyteller while i had some difficulty getting into the book that might be my own issue i thought ratner took a horrific subject and turned it into a story of hope","884":"heartbreaking imo slow at start but soon couldn't put down","885":" this book was haunting i read it with a sort of morbid fascinated interest and my heart ached as i imagined what kind of a world this child must have lived in while i read i thought how real the characters seemed how vivid the places it was only when i reached the author's note at the end that i realized with a stab of shock that this is ultimately a true story i don't mean to minimize the horrors of war i am sure that many suffered even more than this child who coped with enough tragedy for two dozen people and more and others have endured greater cruelty and sorrow in different circumstances but to walk the road this family walked seeing things through a child's eyes living the experience sick with anticipation of what new pain would come next i could almost feel her physical hunger and her emotional hunger too and then to realize that it is a memoir a true story i sat for several minutes in disbelief wondering how a woman could put pen to paper to share this story wouldn't the memories be too much i think they would be for me but i am glad that vaddey ratner had the courage to share her experience with the world and to share her story for the thousands who can not tell their own read it it will stay with you for the rest of your life","886":"a powerful story focused on one family's struggles and hopes as they endure the khmer rouge's regime in cambodia starting in 1975 a story of survival that will fill you with sadness and yet lift you with it's message of hope love and family broadly based on the author's own life story","887":" 3 5 stars well written retelling of the khmer rouge era in cambodia from the pov of a young aristocratic girl raami at the beginning her naivete and privilege grated on me but i warmed to her as the story went forward though i was a little jarred after realizing what a strong parallel raami was to the author herself ratner wove cambodia's rich history and culture into the story and i particularly enjoyed learned about the buddhist spiritualist and the stories of the reamker text however sometimes these tidbits distracted from the plot which started off slow and flowery anyway the story picked up significantly towards the middle end and i appreciated the realism that avoided veering into the gruesome despite the heavy subject matter","888":"this book was hard to get into but well worth persevering on to the end this novel is based on the author's own experiences in surviving the khmer rouge takeover of cambodia in the late 1970s family survival love grief cruelty and a young girl trying to make sense of her world turned upside down no more like shattered a great book club discussion probably earned it an extra star","889":"beautiful haunting and uplifting don't miss this one","890":"rather dismal but well written","891":"5 star read for sure","892":"beautiful prose story written from the perspective of a seven year old and her experience of the atrocities in cambodia under the pol pot regime","893":"this is a touching story full of more philosophy than the horror you might think the setting would evoke however the prose is beautifully written but there is something missing that left me too attached given the struggles and heart breaks of the characters i did though carry with me their dignity nobility and courage","894":"in the shadow of the banyan by vaddey ratner raami is a 7 year old girl in 1975 when the khmer rouge revolted and took over cambodia the uprisings massacres violence and starvation were ongoing for four years raami's family was torn apart they lost everything everyone and every way of life as they knew it they had been a peaceful spiritual loving family and its these memories that keep raami alive believing and even when all odds are against her survival holding on to a bit of hope this novel based on the authors own life history is moving and honest in ways very few people can describe i was both on the edge of my seat wondering what the outcome would be and in tears as raami has to accept things most adults let alone a small child could endure this novel and the writing are stupendous i have learned and loved these characters and their story will always be in my heart","895":"heartwrenching and clearly based on authorial experience about a period of cambodian history i know next to nothing about but the inconsistent naivete of the narrator was off putting i had trouble believing in raami's voice throughout the account","896":"fantastic and sad poetic and wonderful quick read that is beautiful","897":" during the first few chapters i was worried i would hate this book i found the young protagonist raami to be a sheltered spoilt child of wealthy parents oblivious to the problems many khmer were living while enjoying plenty in her large house cared for by a nanny and many servants however as the book progressed ratner's beautiful language and way of telling a story without making us pity the characters but instead taking us into their world and all the challenges they face especially when through the eyes of a child once so sheltered i couldn't stop reading in the shadow of the banyan doesn't describe the history of the khmer rouge but there are other books that do that this is really a much more intimate look at how one girl and her immediate family experienced the terror of their reign","898":"this book tells the story of the takeover of cambodia by the khmer rouge in 1975 and how it decimated her family it is beautifully written with tie ins to cambodian legends this book will leave your heart feeling bereft","899":"i sat down to read some of this book on sunday afternoon and realized 4 hours later that i'd completely lost track of what was going on at my house i had gotten so deep into this story that i could not put it down i had to finish so i would know how raami and her mother survived and what happened to them at the very end i have vague memories as a very young teenager of reading reports about the horrible brutality of the khmer rouge in cambodia after reports started filtering out to the west i remember seeing a news broadcast where a man who had been imprisoned in the infamous tuol sleng prison went back years later and recounted the torture and slaughter that he had witnessed there vaddey ratner's account through the eyes of raami a child makes no less an impact on the reader to temper the endless pain that starts when the family is told to leave their compound in phnom penh and ends in the last page of the book the family does encounter some leavening instances of kindness especially with the couple mae and pok who treat raami her sister radana and their mother as their own family raami's mother is a commoner from a wealthy family who married a minor prince in the cambodian royal family and they embody everything the revolutionaries hate however it soon becomes evident that the revolutionaries hate everyone and everything","900":"it's not often that a book lives up to it's pre publication hype it's even less often that a book not only lives up to the hype but that it moves me so much that i give it 5 stars in the shadow of the banyan is that rare kind of story this is a story that is mind numbingly horrifying and yet shows a rare kind of grace and beauty within the horror this is the story of raami though it is as much the story of vaddey ratner the author raami is seven when her entire world is upended in the stroke of a revolutionary heartbeat being royalty her father a prince her family are immediate targets no matter where they go raami narrates the book demonstrating both the innocence of a child and the maturity of a girl forced to grow up far too fast in the killing fields of cambodia as she and her family are shuffled from one place to another they are ripped apart from each other and face incredible horrors the organization expects to be the only family the only loyalty and the price to pay for disregarding that is death ratner who lived every experience that raami endures in the book writes with the same kind of poetry that presumably her father did i found myself underlining passages that struck me as so beautiful that i wanted to remember them and be able to go back not something i typically do for example no matter what ugliness and destruction you may witness around you i want you always to believe that the tiniest glimpse of beauty here and there is a reflection of the gods' abode it is real raami there exists such a place such sacred space you have only to envision it to dare to dream it it is within you within all of us there is little one can do to describe this book it is a force of nature much like the monsoons that bear down upon cambodia every year it is darkness it is death but ultimately this story is about the beauty of life and of love and the wings we give our children to fly within the world","901":"so sad so beautiful a memoir cum novel about the cambodian genocide a story of loss on many levels four stars because i felt somehow detached from the story not sure why","902":"didn't love this book it was an emotional story about a young girl who lived through the khmer rouge period in cambodia but i was hoping to learn more about the history of that region and historical context some of this was explained in the epilogue which i wish i had read first","903":"great read for understanding the true hell of living through the khmer rouge beautiful and touching a true tribute to her father and his loving memory","904":"great book interesting insight into the cambodian genocide through the eyes of a child the stories relating to buddhism kept much of the story lighter without losing the true meaning and emotion of the moment","905":"a book about the struggle for survival and the pain in cambodia during the time of the khmer rouge beautifully written but sometimes the seven year olds voice did not seem true to her age","906":"i'm having a hard time getting into this book and i'm more than 1 3 done not sure what it is maybe it just feels too predictable to me just gave up on this","907":"gripping very intense another must read","908":" in the shadow of the banyan in the early chapters reminds me so much of many of the folk tales i read as a child the book goes on to describe a family's reeducation during civil war in cambodia 1975 1979 people were forced to leave their houses and moved from one place to another each step deeper into being slaves to the organization raami who has polio remains strong when others grew weak she learns everyday skills that are important to her family survival and at her young age becomes much older in her selfless desire to take care of herself but also the weak family members around her raami was once the beautiful pampered daughter of privilege even as being ridiculed she remains a survivor whom nothing and no one could destroy raami's father a prince a poet a warm loving man leaves her with his tales and hopes life's lessons that will give her the courage to go on with her life","909":"historical fiction which takes place in cambodia when the khmer rouge took over the country exquisitely written i couldn't decide if i wanted to read fast to find out what was happening or slowly in order to savor the writing truly a work of art","910":"i'm done i have been listening to this book for about a week and have 5 hours left and i just can't do it i was very interested in reading a book about the khmer rouge and learning about the plight of the cambodian people but this was not the correct book for me to do that i think the killing fields may be something i need to pick up this story is told through the eyes of a 7 year old girl who i might add has the vocab of a professor of literature making this voice highly unbelievable i can stretch that belief if she were say 12 or more i know other stories that have done this but 7 is way too young for me to be able to believe and it bothered me there is so much flowery descriptions of food and flowers jasmine lotus that i want to scream just tell the bloody story every time i heard a flower mentioned i cringed knowing a full on description was coming the story itself is there somewhere i can get to it now and then once the author got into the actual story i would start becoming interested then she would go on some flowery tangent this is just not for me i want historical fiction where i can learn be engaged with my characters get a sense of what the people are going through not poetry read between shades of gray now there's a book that keeps the it simple yet it's power is undeniable","911":"informative educational and saddening a book you will remember and ponder for a long time i would definitely recommend this to all","912":"this was a fantastically written book the writing was beautiful i found the story line slow at times but overall i think the book was very good i would recommend it as it describes an event in history that is not well known","913":"this book was very moving for me i was of the era when the vietnam war was taking place when that was over i didn't remember anything about what was going on in cambodia after reading in the shadow of the banyan i was so taken back about the events that took place more so that this was mainly a true story about the author i guess i am so ignorant about the fact that cambodia has royalty i found this book to be well written and kept my interest the facts could have been way more gruesome but the author chose to get the readers imagination working instead","914":"it was beautifully written just exceedingly boring i really struggled with the story being told by an eight year old who never once had a simple child like thought every single line was descriptive and 'deeply thoughtful' best part of the book was the epilogue","915":"maybe more of a 3 5 i really need to stop reading books about genocide in other countries","916":" in the shadow of the banyan tree is a beautiful story a young girl tells of the crashing down of what she has known and of the revolution she is now experiencing the author has a wonderful way with prose and poetry and as the reader i felt the heartbreak of the child raami as she remembers the tales told to her by her father it's a book filled with myth folklore and poetry the book is set in cambodia during it's civil war i believe this book will be a classic one day i recommend the shadow of the banyan tree to anyone who loves historic fiction and loves a beautifully crafted a story that brings with it much emotion","917":"i thought the prose of this book was beautiful and poetic but as a narrative it disappointed me though this may have been due to the book's 7 year old perspective i craved a more in depth explanation of the khmer rouge and political atmosphere of cambodia at the time everything was left in the vague and muddled i also felt the book spent too much time on flowery observation than the meat and potatoes of plot and character key points would hold my interest but they were heavily padded by a few too many musings on the sky landscape etc","918":" after reading in the shadow of the banyan i had to separate my thoughts on the book into two categories the language and story of the book and the history and culture it conveyed in regards to the language and the story i loved the way vaddey ratner conveyed a very difficult time in cambodian history telling it through the eyes of raami made it easier to comprehend the horrors of the events taking place while being able to read on without having to take as many breaks to digest the information and distance myself from the events my second thought is how highly effective the book could be to motivate students to look deeper into the complex history and culture of cambodia before during and after the revolution as a high school teacher this is exactly the type of book i like to recommend as outside reading reading this book would allow for students to develop an understanding of a historical event while also being able to learn about and appreciate a rich culture i hope some of my students take my recommendation next year to read in the shadow of the banyan it will help jump start some very productive discussions if they do","919":"couldn't force myself to finish it too depressing","920":"beautifully written as said by parade a love story to her homeland and an unflinching account of innocents caught in the crossfire of fanaticism","921":"astonishingly breathtakingly beautiful for such a brutal and heartbreaking story i think this one will stick with me for a long time","922":"a beautifully written book based loosely on the authors experience during the khmer rouge takeover in cambodia 1975 1979 the narrator seven year old raami goes through so much loss and devastation it is heartbreaking i didn't realize how horrific a time that was in cambodia definitely a great read","923":"beautifully written i cried thoughout the book the khmer rouge takeover of cambodia i love learning history through a story and this one was heartbreakingly good","924":" i liked this book i thought that it was truly admirable and necessary for this vaddey ratner to write this novel i found it particularly interesting that the story had to some degree been influenced by the author's experiences i found that as a young american i wished that prior to reading this book i had been more knowledgeable about this period of cambodian history so that i could have appreciated its richness even more although it was beautifully written at times i had difficulty believing that the words came from a seven year old raami seemed a tad bit older may a pre teen or teenager","925":"this is one selected by my real time book club i probably wouldn't have picked it up on my own but that said i am curious i have a young friend whose mother escaped the khmer rouge regime but not before her husband and her young children were killed my friend was born years later in canada he has told me his mother's story and has tried to give me a sense of how his mother's experience influenced every aspect of his family life so yeah i am curious to read this novel and perhaps gain a little more insight into that time in cambodia there is a three letter word that perfectly describes my reaction to the book meh it really didn't work for me the narrator's voice was not always believable as that of a young girl at times it felt really strained the author is trying too hard to make this a piece of beautiful writing for me it ended up being mostly fluff and not enough substance","926":"i feel bad giving this book 2 stars because it's about the difficulty cambodians had when they were at war although i feel for the author the writing contained too much fluff it was almost as if the author was trying too hard to write beautifully a little less and it would have been great","927":"i learned many new things about the killing fields and about khmer culture i thought the language of the book was quite beautiful but i had trouble with the extreme precociousness of the narrator no way would an eight year old have such adult reactions and insights","928":" heartbreaking yet the author weaves a beauty through her prose that allows the reader to comprehend that though evil can be temporarily victorious love can overcome all obstacles and fan the small embers of hope that one doesn't have the strength to even realize remain although a work of both fiction and fact we know that atrocities such as these described here occurred and still occur across the world in places with just different names how grateful we should be that ms ratner has the courage to help us put a face to these atrocities it is immensely difficult to read this beautiful book and not want to help right wrongs that still occur each day in whatever small or large ways we can from our places of immense privilege and peace thank you ms ratner for reminding us with such grace how grateful we should all be","929":"beautifully written a sad and haunting story","930":" you will not be able to put this book down it is electrifying here vaddey ratner fulfills her father's dying legacy and flys on the wings of poetry in spite of the horror of the subject matter the killing fields of cambodia during the khmer rouge's revolution in the 1970's this is a book about transcendance the child ramii survives against all odds dislocation slave labor brutality murder the loss of her family the loss of everything she had known as a young princess of the royal cambodian family this book will lift you up and fill you with reverence for the enduring dignity of the human spirit ratner is an incredibly gifted storyteller whose prose reads like poetry and rings with truth i loved this book","931":"4 stars instead of 5 because it was just hard for me to get into at first so glad i did though truely a good telling of life in cambodia in the 70's as you follow a little girl through her trials of loss and hope her close ties with family and her faith","932":"ratner is definitely a writer to watch she is brilliant in her poetic descriptions of love loss and hope i cried several times reading this the book flows along beautifully but it is a lot to process several times i found myself going back and re reading sections of the book because the language was so rich and powerful definitely a book to read over and over periodically","933":" wow this was a very difficult novel to read it is beautifully written but very dark the depth of despair and tragedy of the cambodian people that is so vividly described prevented me from being able to read this in anything other than a chapter or two at a time however despite being so haunting and heartbreaking the author weaves into this emotional story a small glimmer of hope that is so eloquently shared through memories of and stories from the main character's father knowing that this fictional account parallels the author's own life story makes it even more compelling","934":"this book was very disturbing in it's content but it was a great book i knew next to nothing about the revolution that happened in cambodia other then the movie 'the killing fields' u0026amp even that was so long ago that my memory was almost nonexistent this book has piqued my interest to explore further what happened there the story is told from the point of view of a 6 yr old cambodian princess that is crippled in her right leg from polio when she was a year old this is a fiction book about the author's experience during the takeover it is horrifying the things that were done to her her family u0026amp the entire country of cambodia","935":"this is a work of heartbreaking beauty and the erosion of loss falling drop by drop upon the heart of a child until she is rendered silent by the horror of her life the debut novel of ratner it is a masterpiece of bright love shed like bloody petals amongst the sharp stones of the 'revolution' a senseless savagery visited upon the innocent citizens of kampuchea","936":"amazingit never ceases to amaze me the cruelty that the spirit can endure another book that shows how humanity can survive","937":"beautifully written but sadly a war is pressing on war does not care if you're rich with gold or poor without it's the heart that keeps pushing on with hope perseverance kindness and love even in survival mode","938":"a beautifully written heartbreaking tale of a country ravaged by war and the horrors that unfold because of it told from the perspective of a 7 year old child and written from the author's true life experiences i will think about this book long after the discussion we have about it at book club great pick bonnie","939":"clearly autobiographically inspired the details of the suffering of the cambodian people are vivid corrupt royalty may provoke revolution but the khmer rouge went beyond retribution to complete destruction of a culture the mystical elements may reflect the culture but as usual i have a hard time buying into that dimension","940":" what a beautifully written novel the language and imagery that ratner uses is as lush and soul stirring as any i have ever read it was this beautiful language that made it possible for me to get through the gut wrenching horrors of this minimally fictionalized account of the bloody revolution brought about by the khmer rouge in cambodia there were moments when this story had me in tears many moments i would like to say that there were moments of joy to offset them but there weren't there are moments of serenity in the chaos and ratner's obvious love for her homeland pulls beauty from the ugliness but it can be a difficult read at times it is a wonderfully written novel that tells a very personal and heartbreaking story that needed to be told i am very happy that i read it but some readers might not feel the same","941":"good story apparently mostly true sometimes the writing was a bit too lyrical for me june 3 2016 starting it again this time for bookclub","942":"heartbreaking but well worth it","943":"poetic heart breaking and life affirming i loved this book even when i had trouble seeing to read it","944":" this book is too grim for me to recommend a child herself a polio victim watching most of her family die in different ways if i had known how sad it was going to be i would not have started the book personally i would have preferred a little more balance to the bleakness of the book e g we could have heard more about the author's time post the khmer rouge experience clearly she has been successful also vaddy's writing was too inconsistent for me sometimes i felt i was missing nuances given the use of non english phrases possibly poor translation merged review this is a grim book following the sad tale of young girl polio victim who during the cambodian khmer regime experiences the horrid deaths of her family i wish there had been more of an 'upside' to this book perhaps we could have learned more about her latter situation in thailand i can't recommend this book as i simply found it too bleak","945":"amazing book about the cambodian genocide from a child's perspective it is fiction but written by a survivor of the genocide based on her memories","946":"i just finished this book written as a novel but really based on the authors own experiences in the killing fields wow what people have endured it is just unbelievable this books is really well written hard to put down i learned a lot about a piece of history that i had little prior exposure to it would have been helpful for me to do some background ready and it would have be useful for the author to include a glossary of khmer terms she used she might do that in the paper version i read an e version and i couldn't find it but other than that it was a memorable read","947":"beautifully written a different perspective of the war explored through emotions and understanding of a child","948":"written as fiction rather than a memoir this book recounts the life of a young princess during the purges of the khmer rouge regime experiencing the horrors of this brutal regime from the viewpoint of a child is incredibly powerful this is not a fast paced thriller this is raw recommended if you want an intimate view of cambodian history","949":"i read this to share with my little girl and i was pleased that it was such a meaningful book one with a caring poet father too the khmer rouge ravaged cambodia at a time when the united states was in full retreat from southeast asia and the things we had done there i think that to this day there is a reluctance in the us to really confront the killing fields ratner brings the genocide to life through the eyes of an eight year old girl the horror dawns gradually on the reader as it does on the main character and this helped me to really get the full force of ratner's experience the writing is poetic and simple a great read and one worth reading and discussing","950":" beautifully written i'm amazed that the author knew not a word of english until immigrating to the us at the age of 11 then chose to write this poetic moving book in her 2nd language she was able to inform of the atrocities of the khmer rouge regime performing the cambodian genocide yet i didn't feel i was overwhelmed all the time with horrific details don't get me wrong there were horrific details portland where i grew up was one of the bigger settlements for cambodian refugees i vaguely remember some discussions about the refugees but i never understood what was really happening there depending on the numbers you look at this genocide caused about 2 million deaths wwii holocaust caused 6 million this one was in the mid 1970s i was a teenager and had no idea i love historical fiction and this one gets a very high recommendation","951":"3 5 starsmy favorite part about this book was the author's note at the end it was a personal touch that made the story resonate and placed the novel within the historical context of that time in cambodia","952":" i've read three novels about cambodia under the khmer rouge over the last few months all of them deeply moving see below out of the three in the shadow of the banyan is the one i'm least likely to recommend but it is also the most beautiful one vaddey ratner chose a young girl herself as the narrator of this story raami comes from royal blood and grows up incredibly sheltered despite the war that has been going on for quite some time when the khmer rouge evacuate phnom penh and her family's long journey begins we can see her lose all those privileges one by one her family soon has to pay the price for their heritage as the khmer rouge's new world order doesn't accomodate royals or intellectuals and raami's father fits both of these categories i told you stories to give you wings so that you would never be trapped by anything her father is a poet and raami's world view or a young girl's equivalent of such a thing is coloured by the colourfulness of his verses and by the mythological stories he and others have taught her the narrator creates images of a haunting beauty to go along with the suffering of her characters which sets a very strange mood along with this raami often flees into her own world of spirits gods and demons trying to find their equals in the world around her she tries not to give up hope but it becomes harder and harder for her the more she understands what's going on inside the grown ups around her there are no gods if they were the ones who gave life created it they'd know its value there are no gods only senselessness the author describes her experiences as well as she can which means that raami is sounding way more grown up than she should right from the beginning but even so she is a child and adults don't tell her much or leave out important things and raami is too young and unexperienced to put enough perspective into things all by herself this is part of what keeps me from recommending this book there is an afterword and everything but to get a clearer picture of the time you'd be better of with a different novel my other issue is with the poetry of the language i have encountered this in a lot of south asian and some south american novels and i love it i really do but i have encountered a lot of readers who are put off by it and if you've never encountered an asian author i would encourage you to read a chapter or two before deciding wheter this is the book for you or not much as i love the mythical aspects the conjuring of deities is another part that takes away from the realism of the experience and you have to like this kind of storytelling to be able to understand what it can give you instead i have a slight problem with the fact that you don't really know where the story is supposed to be going but this is a minor issue and didn't bother me much once i was in love with the language and crying for raami and her family it is important that stories like these are told and when they are told well they have a chance of staying with you and reminding you of what is important that life with all its cruelty and horror was still worth living this i think was what he was trying to tell you a story about your continuation the disappeared by kim echlin it is the story of a young canadian woman going after her cambodian lover and is perhaps the most accessible from a western pov my review dogs at the perimeter by madeleine thien this is the complex story of a survivor trying to remember and come to terms with what has happened it offers multiple stories and also a modern perspective which makes it easier to understand my review this review can also be found at my blog","953":"to keep you is no gain to kill you is no loss senseless killings in cambodia killed more than 1 3 of the population under the khmer rouge in just 4 years and vaddey ratner captures the day to day tragedy in this incredibly moving book it's historical fiction but essentially a memoir of the author's horrific ordeal whose father's words gives her the strength and hope to persevere i couldn't put it down and cried my heart out beautifully written","954":" the story is written in a romantic way the underlying reality is a tragic loss of life an estimated 1 3 of the population over a 4 year period but the author has a unique way of writing and describing her experiences she is an amazing story teller if you are interested in what is happened in the lives of people who have survived an historical peroid in their countries history then this book would be of interest to you it is based in camodia during the time of the khmer rouge it is a sad and poignant story and i am glad i read it","955":"a compelling story of a young cambodian girl a part of history that i knew very little about and will remember for a long time","956":"could not finish book i think if you lived there this would be more interesting","957":"this is a beautiful novel clearly autobiographical if you do not know what happened in cambodia 1975 1979 and you would like to read a gorgeously written novel with a female protagonist whose life is broken but somehow survives this is the book for you unfortunately it is the latest in a string of books that all tell the same true story pol pot came in destroyed our lives overnight put us in death camps and starved or otherwise murdered half of my family","958":"this was a fictionalized account of a child and her royal family that suffered under the communist takeover in cambodia in 1975 it is based on a true story i never cease to be amazed at the cruelty that human beings can inflict on their own kind this book is full of atrocities and yet the main character a seven year old refuses to be brought down by the sufferings and sorrow she must endure this is a book filled with horror and beauty i highly recommend it","959":" i don't usually write book reviews on here but what an amazing book this was i had a hard time putting it down i finished reading it a few days ago and i'm still thinking about it great read especially if you enjoy historical fiction one of the quotes from this book that has stayed with me i had learned not to be afraid of owls or other night creatures animals are not like people if you leave them alone they won't hurt you but people will even if you've done no wrong they hurt you with their guns their words their lies and broken promises their sorrow","960":"this one will stay with me for awhile a heartbreaking story if this wasn't a book club selection i may not have finished it looking forward to the discussion","961":"a good friend gave this to me so i gave it a shot but this isn't a book i'd have chosen for myself but sometimes those are the best books bringing something unexpected to life unfortunately i could not generate much interest in the family this centers around and i found the prose of the child narrator at the start off putting ranging from annoyingly childlike to suddenly using phrases like 'prescient absence i might not have noticed this dichotomy if i'd been more into the story though i gave up probably long before i should have but this just didn't hold my attention","962":"this book is about the communist reign in cambodia in the 1970's and it's effect on a close knit royal family in the capitol city while it's a novel it's based on events that really did happen to the author when she was a 5 10 year old child i felt almost embarrassed to read the book at some points in the story i felt like i was looking in on someone else's most private and intimate thoughts and they cut straight through so that you could almost feel the joy the pain and the suffering there the words were so real and so raw the writing style of the author was just captivating i am shocked that this is her first book it's a page turner and full of imagery and the strength and will to survive amidst almost unsurmountable obstacles","963":"i have one word to describe this book heartbreaking","964":"in her fictionalized autobiography vaddey ratner recounts her survival of cambodia's occupation by the khmer rouge the story was well written but felt sanitized and devoid of deep emotion it did interest me enough to make me get the killing fields dvd from the library and to do a little online research i was a college student from 1975 79 so i surely should have been more aware than i was of what was going on over there","965":"wow loved it beautiful writing especially for someone who only learned english at the age of 11 and gripping story cambodia and the khmer rouge at first it seemed the described perspective of the 7 year old raami was way too adult but then i looked at it from the perspective of an adult recounting her childhood although it is fiction it is based on the true story of the author and her family a great read","966":" this is one of the best books i've read it was mesmerizing and heartbreaking and inspiring based on her childhood in cambodia ratner tells the story of a young girl part of the cambodian royal family and the way her life and family were torn apart when the khmer rouge takes over following the cambodian revolution her voice is poetic and lyrical and seems to transport you to her homeland and the story of young raami is full of unimaginable pain and sadness and loss yet ultimately her message is that there is hope and goodness and humanity in even in these senseless atrocities i received this book as part of the goodreads first reads program","967":"broke my heart","968":"in this beautifully written coming of age tale vaddey ratner uses a child's eye view to give the reader a glimpse into the chaotic destructive and senseless world of the khmer rouge regime and her family's attempt to survive imbuing her story with wonderful characters and gorgeous language recommended","969":"i won this book from goodreads' first reads giveaway thanks this is a novel based on the author's personal experiences as a girl growing up amidst the brutal khmer rouge killing fields the story is heart wrenching yet hopeful it's a superbly written account of survival - not only physical survival - but the survival of love in the most horrifying circumstances this is one of the best books i've read in a long time","970":"lyrical and poetic this writing is a joy to read even though the content is heartbreaking and heavy it is a must read especially for those who love historical fiction and it is a reminder that one can find light even in the darkest hour it is a tragic story but it is still filled with hope and beauty a fabulous read","971":"in the shadow of the banyan is a beautifully written story about terrible atrocities and the strength of those who endured them knowing vaddey ratner was recreating her own history makes the novel even more compelling","972":"a beautifully written story about a displaced family during the cambodian revolution at times it was unrealistic but it is based on a true story","973":"a lyrically woven tale of anguish and loss love honor and strength rammi is a young girl who survived cambodia's four year revolution while millions of others were savagely exterminated her parents' love sustains her and her memories are often poetically presented giving a ethereal shade to the narration revealing the beautiful amidst the sordid","974":"here is my review in portuguese http oquevcestalendo wordpress com","975":"i loved this book this was another book group pick that i never would have chosen on my own it is a story of a young girl who goes throw a terrifying ordeal and makes it through despite horrific losses and unending challenges it is a beautiful story of survival growth endurance and the strength of the human spirit it is based on the actual events of when the khmer rouge overthrew the cambodian government back in the 70's i never knew anything about this historical event prior to reading this so it was a real eye opening the narration is beautiful and rich in language and seems to flow effortlessly without it ever seem like the author is trying too hard she has this way of speaking that makes her story seem soothing somehow although you are reading about this scary stuff the tone is very much zen it's an interesting experience for the reader i loved it because i got to learn about an event in history that i knew nothing about and also because the story is told so beautifully there were many moments in the book where i read something and then read it again just because i was enjoyed the wording and symbolism so much great book and highly recommend","976":" i haven't written a book review since high school and am compelled to write a few words about this book which spoke to me on three levels as a member of a family affected by the holocaust as a father of a young daughter and as someone who visited cambodia 10 years ago my family's history is wrapped up in the holocaust in migration and in loss nearly 70 years after the second world war at 40 years old the events of that time still mark my thoughts regularly we've lost most of the few survivors i live a comfortable and privileged life in canada i've never been hungry cold or homeless i find it very hard to connect with how genocide happens what's it look like on a day to day basis it seems silly but try as i may i'm not of those genes who can shrug off the events and move on completely i end up reading books like in the shadow of the banyan to try and understand the experiences of my grandparents as survivors and my parents as immigrants creating a new life even though it's historical fiction ratner has done a brilliant job in evoking how genocide becomes almost quotidian as a reader you're there watching listening feeling the writing is very very strong second i'm the father of a 5 5 year old daughter who i love to pieces ratner was five years old at the start of the cambodian revolution her autobiographical main character is seven the relationship between raami and her father moved me over and over i'll return to this book to remember just how important a father can be to their kids i don't want to discount the role of raami's mother who is also a remarkably strong influence i appreciated raami's mother's role more towards the end of the book as it's her mother who assures raami's survival the acknowledgments at the end of the book where ratner writes a few words of acknowledgement to her mother really drives the point home lastly i had the chance to visit cambodia a decade ago the country is lush and beautiful and even ten years ago had still not completely recovered i regret not having read or understood more of the history before the visit there is much for us to learn still from the cambodian history the genocide there happened in our lifetime there are still survivors there are still perpetrators anyone visiting should read ratner's book before going fiction it may be but it's so descriptive and rooted in reality that it makes me want to visit again and when i do i'll re read in the shadow of the banyan and trust that it will move me as much or more than it did this first time","977":"wow this was a good educational read","978":" this book tells the story of the cambodian genocide when two million people were murdered or starved to death at the hands of the khemer rouge regime between 1975 and 1980 it is a story we should all know and it is beautifully told by the author based on her own struggle to survive and deal with the profound loss she endured having visited cambodia in 2010 i became aware of the genocide and met several survivors who spoke about their ordeal this book should be on everyone's reading list thanks to this talented author for sharing her story so vividly and with such love","979":" a very touching heart wrenching debut from a truly gifted author and considerung that ratner had learned english only at the age of 11 the exquisite prose was only all the more impressive knowing that the author herself had experienced the horrors retold in this semi fictional book it made no difference whether the main character's name was raami or vaddey some fellow readers complained about the pov the voice being too mature for a child and yes this is true but the thoughts and actions were those of a young girl nonetheless i'm not a fan of two page long descriptions in general but i quite enjoyed them in this book as the prose was so beautiful i appreciated that the main goal of this book wasn't to report the crimes committed by the khmer rouge and horrors witnessed by the cambodian people but rather to send a message about love sacrifice and clinging to hope even in the darkest moments conclusion a battle between horrifying content and beautiful prose i recommend it to readers with an interest in semi fiction realistic fiction crimes against mankind and cambodia","980":"this novel is written by a survivor of the khmer rouge in cambodia her beautiful writing and love of cambodia's natural beauty soften the horrors of her childhood during that period","981":"i love historical fiction especially when i learn about a period of history that i didn't previously know much about this book was very realistic about a girl growing up during the mid 1970's in cambodia check out amazon for book description","982":"glad i read it i really did not much about this horrific time period difficult to read emotionally but glad i did","983":" this was a beautifully written story about horribly sad and tragic events it had me pondering afterward why anyone would want to learn and read about atrocities that have happened in the world's history am i supposed to leave the comfort of my life to go work in an aid camp in africa then it dawned on me that stories like this are not about the reader it's not about me it's about the author trying to share his or her story with the world it's not a call for action it's a person telling the story of the path they have traveled and how they came out on the other side i can't do anything to change that and i'm not supposed to i am just supposed to listen","984":"an amazing story full of poetic writing and truth","985":"this book was an interesting look at this fictional memoir based on life in cambodia in the early 1970's the book cronicles the life of raami who is a seven year old child she faces the death of family members loss of her home and life as she knows it and hunger raami is forced to move to different locations throughout cambodia after starting her life which included money and privilege it was a good read with great character development","986":" beautifully written heartbreaking personal story of a child's perception of the brutalities of the khmer rouge in cambodia in the 1970s amidst widespread despair there was also a thread of hope in this gorgeous book that had me in tears more than once some of my favorite quotes the problem with being seven it's that you're aware of so much and yet you understand so little so you imagine the worst we are all echoes of one another raami oh i don't know i suppose he just wants to give shape to her sorrow explaining why pok was carving a little wooden calf to hang around the grieving mother cow's neck joy and sorrow often travel the same road and sometimes whether by grace or misfortune they meet and become each other's companion","987":"this book is so beautiful and so heartbreaking you would have to be made of stone not to weep when reading of this family's story i had picked this book up before and put it down afraid it might be too much to absorb the triumph is in the remembrance all of those who died and those all those who lived through these atrocities i will never forget this book","988":"if someone can explain this novel to me it would greatly be appreciated is it based on spirits i was just confused throughout the entire story trying to put the pieces together it just was not my cup of tea and i wish that i gave it a much higher rating in the beginning it had potential but as i kept reading more like skimming nothing was making a lick of sense who are these characters why is one talking about a spirit and one is talking about seeing the dead i just was not following the story at all the best part about the book was the page i stopped reading i refuse to torture myself when i can't comprehend what the story was about","989":"although incredibly depressing this book was an insightful look at the life of a girl in the middle of the khmer rouge it was told through the eyes of an innocent one who witnessed too much while it took place in cambodia this could have been nazi germany","990":" very well written book about the revolution that brought the kymer rouge to power in cambodia raami is a 7 year old girl who comes from a royal family although her father a poet feels that the revolution could be a good thing for cambodia in one day the revolutionaries empty out the city of phnom penh her family is torn apart in the ensuing years and the lone survivors are raami and her mother it's based on the author's own story and is written lyrically but the brutality of the regime also comes through yet another history lesson about what happens when fanatics take power","991":"seen through the eyes of a child this account of the revolution in cambodia is truly horrifying i did not want to believe this was all true and could not stop reading","992":"despite the horror of the subject i just could not put this book down the prose was lyric and unbelievably moving that the author survived is truly a tribute to the human spirit both her own and that of the people who loved and helped her","993":"a powerful read about strength and survival but i thought the complexity and profoundess of the communist revolution in 1970's cambodia requires the input of an adult perspective not just raami's 7 year old narrative this detracted from story for me","994":"a lyrical novel based on the author's experiences as a young girl in cambodia when the khmer rouge came into power","995":"seven year old raami is the fictional alter ego of the author who went from a privileged upbringing to imprisonment forced labor and starvation during the khmer rouge's takeover of cambodia","996":"resilience beautiful language a family during the war in cambodia and the fight for survival","997":"genocide and family tragedy are the topics addressed in this beautifully written novel by vaddey ratner although a work of fiction the story is based on ratner's own experience living in cambodia as a child during the khmer rouge regime starvation forced labor camps and family separations are all hardships that both ratner and raami our seven year old narrator had to endure the story is heartbreaking and uplifting at the same time showing us some of the darkest moments in human history while at the same time revealing the enduring spirit of humanity text taste smoke was everywhere as black as the soldiers' clothes on sidewalks books and papers burned in piles ashes flew up into the air like burnt butterflies i wondered why they were called khmer rouge 'red khmer ' there was nothing red about them why did they have so many names revolutionary soldiers communists marxists was how papa would invariably refer to them and tata never failed to retort khmer rouge rebels thieves jungle rats they won't last she predicted their victory would be short lived and called for their punishment they should be hanged like the common criminals they are revolutionaries papa would insist his tone tentative as if he himself had yet to discern their true name their intentions you must be careful how you speak of them i wondered what they were really soldiers or peasants children or adults they looked neither like devarajas nor rakshasas the mythical gods and demons i'd imagined them to be in those plain black clothes they looked more like a race of shadows each one a repetition of the others 34","998":"an amazing beautifully written life changing book a must read if you are a parent","999":"this book got off to a slow start for me but i am glad i stuck with it it is a heavy and difficult read as it's set in cambodia during the uprising of the khmer rouge it was hard to read about the way the people of cambodia were treated by the revolutionaries the book was based on a true story as the author was living in cambodia during the revolution so finding that out gave the book even more impact","1000":"this was exceptional heartbreaking i almost stopped early on because the things she writes are so brutal but she lived them and writes about her experiences and her family members so beautifully","1001":"it is a few hours since i turned the last pages of this haunting and powerful novel and i am still trembling from its nearly unbearable power such is the power of vaddey ratner's story telling and it is story telling that is at the core of this book at one point ms ratner reflects \"a story i had learned through my own constant knitting and re knitting of remembered words can lead us back to ourselves to our lost innocence and in the shadow it casts over our present world we begin to understand it \"her story is as universal as mankind and yet uniquely her own the story has been told - in varying ways - by carolina de robertis in perla by naomi benaron in running the rift by thomas e kennedy in in the company of angels by william styron in sophie's choice it is as old as the hills man's inhumanity to man the brutishness cruelty and sheer sadism of those who inflict damage in the name of an evil cause in ms ratner's capable hands this familiar story rises to sheer poetry as she not only survives but also transcends in it she inhabits her younger muted self and gives her a voice in an epilogue we learn that details have been changed but her character's story is in essence her own raami - the little girl who speaks for vaddey ratner - is only seven when her world shatters the infamous khmer rouge comes to power destroying her innocence her youth and her family what ensues is achingly real and beautifully realized we follow raami as she undergoes the ultimate in heartbreak deprivation loss and sadness as the khmer rouge endeavors to destroy the last sparks of individuality and humanity yet even the worst humiliations cannot break her spirit she clings to hope through the power of story telling and through small gestures of kindness this impossibly brave author ended up in the united states after four years of forced labor and starvation and went on to graduate cornell university summa cum laude just as her father - a gentle poet - offered her wings so she offers those wings to her readers i cannot imagine how anyone could read this book and not be incredibly touched","1002":"i wish it had been more memoir than fiction","1003":"worth reading beautiful and sad story of love loss and a world unimaginable in cambodia 1975 the author gives credit to her father's storytelling by masterfully weaving personal experience with cultural and religious myth telling and a knack for bringing the geography of cambodia alive with vivid descriptions she honors her mother by telling it all not a book you can read in a hurry or without tears","1004":"this book was terrible i could only get through 200 pages before i gave up if i read milk mother one more time i was going to scream the author was trying way too hard the whole thing felt like a grade school creative writing exercise it's too bad because i'm sure the story would have been great but i couldn't get past the terrible writing","1005":"okay so i didn't actually finish this book but i am still giving it a 3 star rating the story was good and it was very well written but i've got a gang if books waiting to be read and it just didn't captivate me that much it is a pretty slow read perhaps i'll pick it up another time and adjust the rating","1006":"one of the most poignant and moving books i have read in a long time maybe ever heartbreakingly beautiful","1007":" i loved this book the author writing is like poetry set to music this novel is told through the eyes of a young girl whose father is a member of the cambodian royal family he is also a poet the novel chronicles her family's lives after the khmer rouge overthrows the government and rules the country the last thing her father writes before leaving his family is bury me and i'll thrive as countless insects i bend neither to your weapon nor will even as you trample upon my bones i cower not under your soulless tread or fear your shadow casting upon my grave from in the shadow of the banyan vaddey ratner","1008":" it's so hard to put what i think into words on this one i have friends canadian friends who moved to cambodia a few years back and when they came back after the first year they told stories about the khmer rouge and pol pot's regime it happened just before i was born so i had no idea and it's not taught in school like the world wars a couple years after that i read first they killed my father a daughter of cambodia remembers in which i read some of the worst treatment on the cambodians it was a memoir after all that book didn't really explain the why behind it though so this book is a mixture of things for me it's a chance to learn more about this terrible regime albeit a fictional book it is based off ratner's own experiences with the khmer rouge at the age of 5 i found it a bit soft compared to other things i've heard and read about the genocide in the sense that the author toned down the violence and somewhat romanticized it's the wrong word i can't seem to think of the right one the character's ordeal she talks of people settling in and as if they went about ordinary lives when in reality they were being carted off and executed tortured and starved to death that's not to say that the characters didn't go through some extremely hard things it's just that the story was softened the violence is only occasionally mentioned until near the end of the book when it picks up the pace a little one thing this book did do was answer a little bit of the why questions i had it doesn't fully explain it although i'm not sure it can be fully explained but it was a start the author included many of the rules of the regime in the plot and some of their way of thinking it was delusional too ideological and that's why it failed but it shows something of the human condition it's something we see in war after war after war the way people were treated has happened in war after war after war it's sickening as for the characters we start off with a family who is very privileged and we see them torn apart and their spirits broken throughout the book i felt a strong connection to raami and her father though her mother seemed a bit distant perhaps because the book is written from raami's point of view and that's how the relationships were developed i started to see raami's mother in a different light as the book goes on but i still felt disconnected from her which is weird i feel that as a mother myself i should have identified with her more all in all the book is beautifully written and if i hadn't known a little bit about the more violent parts of the khmer rouge regime i would have completely loved it it's probably an excellent book for someone without this knowledge as an opening to learn about this genocide that doesn't seem to get the attention it deserves","1009":"i thoroughly enjoyed this one in the shadow of the banyan by vaddey ratner the author was five when the khmer rouge overran cambodia which is the story ratner writes between 1975 and 1979 a third or more of the population of cambodia died including nearly all of her relatives she survived and made it to america at eleven not knowing english but eventually graduating summa cum laude from cornell from the publisher for seven year old raami the shattering end of childhood begins with the footsteps of her father returning home in the early dawn hours bringing details of the civil war that has overwhelmed the streets of phnom penh cambodia's capital soon the family's world of carefully guarded royal privilege is swept up in the chaos of revolution and forced exodus over the next four years raami clings to the only remaining vestige of her childhood--the mythical legends and poems told to her by her father--and fights for her improbable survival displaying the author's extraordinary gift for language in the shadow of the banyan is a brilliantly wrought tale of hope and transcendence","1010":"beautifully written my only regret is that i read it immediately after another difficult book about violence and war when you love a flower and suddenly she is gone everything vanishes with her i lived because she lived now she's gone without her i am nothing to morn then is to feel your own nothingness 22we are all echoes of each other 170","1011":"i loved this book vaddey's descriptions of life in cambodia during the revolution were vivid but poetic i didn't expect the ending to turn out as it did as i had not read the author's biography i had not read about this time in cambodia before what a terrible time","1012":" review originally shared on closed the coverin the shadow of the banyan by vaddey ratner has the potential to be an epic historical fiction novel readers are swept up in seven year old raami's world and experience the heartache of death starvation and brutality alongside her previously privileged family ratner creates a wondrous fictional story set in the gorgeous landscape of cambodia and sharing with readers the stark contrast between human resilience and the tragedy of war this could have easily been a ctc 5 star book and it is a new york times bestseller but the issue for me was the narrative voice ratner's decision to write from the point of view of a seven year old girl instead of in a third person narrative is what made this book an awkward read there is no denying ratner's talent for creative writing and storytelling she captures reader's hearts and attention from the opening pages as young raami watches her mother's grace and elegance while questioning her own awkward clumsiness raami sees the world around her as only a young girl can - with eyes full of magic and wonder it's a beautiful way to introduce an exotic locale like cambodia to readers and draw them into raami's privileged world unfortunately this innocent childish perspective begins to feel awkward as the story progresses civil war takes over and raami's family must fight for their very survival the language and vocabulary begin to exceed the reasonable voice of a little girl the narrative voice no longer fit the story and at this point i as a reader began to disconnect from raami's plight the lofty descriptions so poetic and brilliant in the beginning of the story also begin to detract away from the struggle of the family brought on by the civil war during the early chapters these are necessary so that readers can visualize the locale and feel a part of the story but as the war takes over and the family is suffering the continual heavy descriptions of the local flora is uncomfortable and distracting the novel would have been better served for the heavy handed descriptions to focus on the systematic violence sickness and suffering rather than on every locus or jasmine in the landscape ratner is a wonderful storyteller and the plot of in the shadow of the banyan is a story that should be told within these pages is a character that readers will fall in love with and mourn for as her little world falls apart around her however ratner's choice of narrative and overwhelming constant landscape descriptions drag down the novel during the latter half of the story causing many readers to disengage before the final page review by ashley lamarclosed the cover","1013":"more like 2 5 stars review in a few days","1014":"while i knew vaguely of the horrible happenings in asia in the 1970s i had no idea of the extent and devastation of cambodia and its people while a work of fiction it is based on the life of the author and it is a very powerful and moving work","1015":"cambodia 1975 79 ratner contrasts the gentleness and intellect of the protagonist's family with the heartless brutality of the khmer rouge the little girl witnesses systematic violence yet continues to seek meaning in life only by clutching at scraps of beauty as her father taught her is she able to survive","1016":"i read this book along time ago it was a very good book but difficult to read i had to read every word carefully as not to miss the details in this story it was very heart breaking to read also","1017":"i really liked this book i love to read a book with a bit of history and this book mirrored the life of the author in the book as in life her father was distant cambodian royalty killed by the khmer rouge the author and the seven year old in the book suffered terrible violence starvation and the loss of most of their family once again as with many recent books i feel like i am filling in the gaps of my youthful ignorance of current events i would have been about the same age as the main character at that time and i was in a safe place with plenty of food surrounded by my family and playing in the back yard the language of the book sometimes poetic","1018":"\"in the shadow of the banyan\" is all about the atrocities committed by the khmer rouge regime in cambodia between 1975 and 1979 where an estimate of two million people lost their lives it was slow going and a heavy read the author takes you through this killing field through the eyes of a child and with much hope it's beautifully done","1019":" ratner's use of language and imagery is exquisite as i told a friend i found myself reading slowly dreading what fresh horror would appear on the next page \"in the shadow of the banyan\" is set during the khmer rouge revolution i'm sure most people are aware that during the mid 70's these communists took power and subjugated their fellow cambodians raami comes from the royal family who were especially hated by the communists because their learning and their strong sense of self made them a threat to the thugs along with their country people raami and her immediate and extended family's homes were destroyed they were kidnapped and then hustled from one place to another and from one back breaking manual labor task to another they were all but starved some people did die of starvation and over work they tried to stay together and they tried to survive throughout the story the only person you feel confident will survive is raami the storyteller who was based on ratner's own experience during the revolution all other lives are in jeopardy raami's father a prince was a poet and storyteller he'd raised her on stories these stories and the way they taught her to view the world helped her endure she grows up quickly and learns unbelievably hard lessons along with beautiful life affirming lessons about humanity don't miss the author's afterward and an interview at the end of the book where she discusses why and how this book came about again not easy to read but well worth your time this review was based on an e galley provided by the publisher","1020":"young raami tells her story of love and loss while the khmer rouge scourged and decimated its own people in cambodia from 1975 79 the tone is understated while delivering the harsh realities of those years","1021":"wonderful book took me a little while to get into it but then mesmerizing","1022":"this is one of the most well written beautiful books i have ever read it should be required reading especially for students as it helped me learn a lot about the cambodian genocide","1023":"a testament to the human spirit at ant age it never fails to amaze me when faced with insurmountable obstacles people find the courage to stay alive and overcome them it also speaks to the evil in the world that must be fought constantly","1024":"haunting story exquisite prose each chapter held at least one passage that i re read several times just for the beauty of the writing this is literature","1025":"a very interesting read historical fiction based on the history of cambodia as seen through the eyes of a child heartbreaking but well written","1026":" a story of hope in spite of its setting four years of rule by the khmer rouge in cambodia from 1975 1979 led to one of the worst episodes of genocide in human history with an estimated two million people killed this novel tells the story through the eyes and ears of a young girl who holds onto stories and hopes to carry her through the darker moments vaddey ratner's often lyrical style carried me also i had the privilege of visiting cambodia and of walking through the halls and stairwells of s21 a khmer rouge concentration camp set in a high school on phnom penh this brought back the memory","1027":"moving especially because it was based on the authors life in cambodia it is beautifully written","1028":" is this a novel or a memoir in some respects thye book comes off as a re do of orange is the new black but what makes it a far superior work is the exquisite writing by ms ratner she has a wonderfully eloquent way of expressing her thoughts and infuses her narrative with small stories and anecdotes that act as metaphors of the author's thoughts and ideas raami the seven year old protagonist is really the author she leads us through the khmer rouge seizure of the government of cambodia in 1975 and takes us through four harrowing years of mental anguish disruption of families murders and other atrocities until the vietnamese deem it necessary to invade cambodia depose the inept communist regime before it annihilates the entire populace fortunately we are not treated to the gruesomeness of the killing fields and ms ratner does an able job of portraying life in cambodiabn villages from 1975 1979 it remains to be seen whether she can be more creative in the future and create a storyline not based so closely on her own experiences","1029":" this book is one of the reasons i love participating in book club discussions here on goodreads if this book had not been selected as a group read i never would have picked it up on my own and i would have missed out on a real gem thank you author vaddey ratner for sharing your story even in fictionalized format you and your mother are strong amazing women your father was a great man who taught you many beautiful things about life he would be so proud of the woman you have become the survivor of the horrors you saw

surviving the war in cambodia the killing fields the horrors of the khmer rouge and all the atrocities that occurred it is beautifully written and poetic heart breaking yet heart warming","1030":"brilliant book wonderful language and a unique perspective would highly recommend this book","1031":"story telling is a sacred art we often associate with myths and passing on cultural knowledge and lessons here the story which takes place during the cambodian genocide of the 1970's starts with the family of a prince poet whose very name means life possessing told through the eyes of his five year old daughter the beauty of age old traditions coupled with the father's poetry colors the beginning chapters you learn about the tevoda or spirits and that \"how you carry yourself is a form of art\" the contrast with the khmer rouge heightens the horror of their eradication especially of people who carried the soul of traditions you will learn much about cambodian history as well as the inconceivable actions of the organization and their dehumanized attitudes sprinkled generously with words of wisdom about desire as something you want so badly your heart hurts and the larger sense of love for instance thor means loving someone you did not expect to love and how love hides in all places even being stricken with polio is an invitation to love it is easy to want to adopt save each of the characters persecuted the simple sentences they didn't make it and tell them you are my papa echo in my mind imagining the uncle and little raami as if they were part of my precious family","1032":"in this autoboigraphical novel we see yet another testament to the resilience of the human spirit despite the horrors than mankind can inflict upon mankind it is the story of a young girl's survival in khymer rouge cambodia and the power of words and poetry that her father instilled in her her wings to fly","1033":"absolutely heartbreaking beautifully written gives a unique perspective through the eyes of a 7 year old girl of the horrors experienced in cambodia under the khmer rouge","1034":" this is a heartbreaking look at coming of age in cambodia as the khmer rouge take over based on the author's own life she tells the story of living in phnom penh in a family whose roots go back to the royal family it is a life of privilege which is quickly turned upside down her father tells her that he tells her stories to allow her to fly and that is what this book does it is the story of heartbreak and love fear and loyalty sickness and torture wrapped in beautiful metaphors and images of cambodia and family that allow all of us who are touched by this book to fly it is the essence of why i read","1035":" this is a one of a kind book a true labor of love by the author who endured much of what the book's characters suffered under the khmer rouge regime of the 1970's in her comments at book's end she tells of having to walk away from the writing of this story from time to time because of the pain that remembering caused the story though fictionalized is her story that ends in achievement and happiness in the united states in addition to being a heartbreaking chronicle of the effects of the khmer rouge's cruel ruthless rule the book also soars with lyrical writing insights into the beauty of humanity and the power of hope and love to survive and eventually triumph the book begins with a charming tableau of the sheltered life that seven year old raami and her family lived before the revolution breaks through their gates removes them from the city to a series of locations where they live the lives of rice field peasants made all the harsher by the regime's incessant irrational demands there are many deaths of loved ones along the way a death narrowly avoided by raami and her mother who are on the brink of starvation and exhaustion when war breaks out between cambodia and vietnam the war opens the door to salvation with their escape to thailand raami's father who offers himself to save his family is a pervasive force in the story even after his disappearance it is the stories he told her the life lessons he ingrained in her and the love which poured forth from him to surround his beloved daughter that sustains her in hours darker than we can imagine the book is pervaded by the thinking and philosophy of buddhism weaving that religion's beliefs into the mysticism of the novel a beautiful evocation of the darkest and brightest manifestations of the human spirit","1036":"it is a challenge to write beautifully about the worst ugliness of humanity and not only to write beautifully but to communicate hope and wonder even in the most heartbreaking of our histories","1037":" there are no appropriate words to describe the beauty of this book i have been left feeling both sad and elated it is rare that i feel this way about a book the prose filled me with such conflicting emotions it was so well done that i cannot recommend it enough what gives this book the most weight is the fact that it is by the admission of the author semi biographical while classed as fiction it is fiction only to a point the larger events did take place and millions of people experienced a life that can only be described as hell on earth this gives the story a potency that often lacks in other \"tragic\" tales the story takes place in cambodia during the rule of the khmer rouge in the 70s and its narrator is a 7 year old girl called raami this instantly gives the book a sort of innocence and a gentle tone despite the heart breaking story and harsh reality it follows the exodus of raami's family from the city phnom phen and the trials and tribulations that they go through over the next three years the resulting narrative is a devastating account of the atrocities that were committed during the khmer rouge's rule but more importantly it acquaints the reader with the emotions that the cambodian people must have experienced during this time the tenderness with which raami tells her story the beauty that this young girls sees amongst all the devastation gives the story so much more depth and power further adding to the weight of the story is the poetry that is dispersed amongst the chapters not overused it just adds eloquence to events and emotions both dark and light the final story telling tool is the author's gift to the non cambodian reader the myths and legends of cambodia beautiful stories of mythical creatures selfless actions and a strong belief in reincarnation lift the story adding to it a sense of hope despite the hardship of a whole peoples as i mentioned in the beginning this book escapes words the story is extremely potent devastating and yet gentle in the manner it is told you will be left feeling a better person for reading it","1038":" \"we are all echoes of one another raami\"it's crazy how much you can be ignorant of in this world i had never been aware of the revolution that occurred in real life cambodia that provided the basis for this novel's based on true events i think it was a nice eye opener for someone like me who may not have had such a traumatic childhood the whole setting really was just so chaotic and troubling that i was constantly afraid of the characters in this book dying the in the shadow of the banyan\"we are all echoes of one another raami\"it's crazy how much you can be ignorant of in this world i had never been aware of the revolution that occurred in real life cambodia that provided the basis for this novel's based on true events i think it was a nice eye opener for someone like me who may not have had such a traumatic childhood the whole setting really was just so chaotic and troubling that i was constantly afraid of the characters in this book dying there is a sense of hopelessness that is incredibly moving in how they find meaning in this time of hardship i did not connect really with any of the characters in particular but there is something to be said for the way ratner depicted this story from the eyes of a child and what differences a child can see in a situation compared to an adult overall good read glad my university picked this book to read","1039":"9 2014 based on her own story the author chose fiction as a tool to share the emotions and horrors of the khmer rouge's take over and reign of terror in cambodia after the vietnamese invaded the author like her main character escaped to thailand the poetry of the writing is beautiful and an underlying theme is how stories can transcend loss and suffering","1040":" this is somewhat an autobiography of the author's experience as a young girl in cambodia the lead character is 7 years old when the khymer rouge rebels take over the country rammi and her entire extended family are forced from the capital into the rural areas to be re educated since they are of the royal line the family is especially targeted but this isn't a book about her experiences as much as a story how to survive she remembers and recreates the stories her father told her and the beautiful poetry he wrote the writing is beautiful and rich with description and context the reader sees the world through the eyes of a young girl this is a story so well written and so poignant that it lingers even after the pages are turned","1041":"amazing story i will update my review soon","1042":"this is a beautifully written story about the brutal struggle to survive in cambodia during the reign of the khmer rouge told from the perspective of a young girl get a copy with the author's note and interview at end but don't look ahead","1043":" beautifully written but depressing another book about man's inhumanity to man the khmer rouge's motto to keep you is no gain to kill you is no loss says it all the novel has more meaning since we were just in cambodia a year and a half ago we saw the killing fields the flip side to the horror of pol pot's regime is the resiliency of the human spirit how in earth do the seven year old raami and her mother find the will to live this is about the 10th book i've read in the past couple of years where if it were me i wouldn't have survived ps this was not a book club selection","1044":"beautifully written book already one of my all time favorites tells the heartbreaking story of the war in cambodia through the eyes of a 7 year old girl lyrical language with khmer stories generously interwoven","1045":"rated it a 3 8 most of it is from a true story that ratner lived thru she truly was royalty as was her whole family very deep reading","1046":" i am amazed by how unfamiliar i was with the events that unfolded in cambodia in the 1970s the cruelty and inhumanity of people can be extraordinary time and time again we as a people commit horrible atrocities all in the name of righteousness this vision varies from time to time from country to country but it always ends in evil this story is beautifully told but difficult to read i can only hope that we can learn from our past mistakes but i fear that too few truly understand the consequences of repeating them this story will haunt my dreams for some time to come","1047":"this is the story of a little girl and how her life was turned upside down by the takeover of cambodia by the khymer rouge this is a fictionalized account of the author's true story beautifully written with vivid imagery","1048":"heartbreaking read i remember when my hometown hosted a teenage cambodian refugee when i was a child i never heard his story but was told he had walked across the country to get out","1049":"fantastic book about the cambodian war it's a historical fiction but it is mostly autobiographical not a light read or for the light hearted","1050":"based on the true story of author vaddey ratner's childhood in the shadow of the banyan depicts the atrocities of the khmer rouge from the eyes of a young cambodian princess seven year old raami a polio survivor is a bookish dreamer when the revolutionary army takes phnom penh she has just settled down in the family garden to read her illustrated version of the reamker a cambodian adaptation of the hindu ramayana but even before she can reach the point early in the epic where the noble prince preah ream is exiled soldiers have stormed her home to demand the family leave immediately when raami her parents sister aunts uncle and grandmother are relocated to a forested province outside the capital the family's royal lineage immediately becomes a tremendous liability promptly recognized as the prince poet and scholar that he is raami's father is left with little choice but to sacrifice himself to save his family though his departure ultimately saves his wife and daughter it also marks the beginning of a series of tragedies that one by one claim the lives of all of raami's extended relatives the losses weigh heavily on raami and her mother but they also steel their resolve to stay alive--and to remember who they are--despite the direness of their circumstances the imaginative raami turns within summoning the parables poems dignity humility and wisdom of her father \"raami shares my faith in people \" ratner has said of her protagonist \"perhaps the big difference is that she can articulate it and in so doing magnifies it even more her intuition becomes prescience \" in the end this is the powerful story of how even the most brutal regime lacked the power of a father's love for his daughter http www thedailybeast com articles","1051":" raami is 7 and happily living in 1970s cambodia with her family they are educated prosperous and exactly the kind of people that the khmer rouge wants to break just as news comes of the revolution soldiers come to raami's house to liberate the family they and everyone else in phnom penh and any other city are asked to leave their homes temporarily everyone will be taken care of no one should worry these actions mark the beginning of horrible times for the people of cambodia as the khmer rouge tears apart families kills the educated starves the population and rules through terror vaddey ratner the author lived through this awful period in time and this novel is a semi fictional retelling of her own personal story while the subject matter is gut wrenching the story manages to be wonderful and even magical for the first part of the book the characters were extremely well drawn and i felt like i could relate to them despite the fact that their lives were light years removed from my own it is a rare thing for me to read all of the author's note let alone an interview but i devoured both at the end of the book they really completed the picture for me this was an amazing book i would recommend it for fans of the kite runner the art of hearing heartbeats and rooftops of tehran","1052":"heart wrenching story of cambodian royalty in the 70s during the revolution well written and inspirational","1053":"the killing fields of cambodia the khmer rouge in power from 1975 1979 before the vietnamese drove them out by this time one to two million cambodians were either killed starved to death or committed suicide raami is seven her father a prince and a poet who has instilled in her a love for stories and words which he told her would give her wings and allow her to see the beauty in even the ugliest things a the start of this when they are herded into the streets and taken from camp to camp they are a family of nine by the end only 2 will survive told entirely from the viewpoint of raami this book and the way it is told has a poignancy and yet a strange beauty too as it is not only about a horrible revolution but about the strong bond and love between a father and daughter this is in fact the authors own story though she was only 5 when the actual revolution happened and as she explains in the afterward she writes this book to honor her father and those who never made it through this horrific time this book is beautiful y written my only question is would a seven and eight yr old have the capacity to relate all these things she had seen i decided that what she did' t understand at the beginning after everything she sees and experiences she would have grown up relatively quickly so i think that this is entirely plausible great book and one i would definitely recommend arc from netgalley","1054":"excellent story told from the viewpoint of a 7 year old girl through age 10 11 which takes place during the cambodian civil war in the 70s loosely based upon the author's true life story as a member of the royal family","1055":" unfortunately for me i didn't realize until the author's note at the end that the book was connected to the author's family's experiences she was a child when the khmer rouge took control of cambodia the poetry of the writing created a veil between the atrocities occurring and the protagonist's childlike view of it all it stopped me from feeling fully involved for much of the book i felt quite separate from the horrors that were being conveyed an odd reading experience it makes sense in that the point of view is that of a 7 year old girl but it was too distancing for me somehow","1056":"i woke up at 4am to finish this book as i couldn't sleep another night without knowing their fate beautifully written this emotionally exhausting novel is very closely linked to the authors experience during the khmer rouge uprising a five star book","1057":" although in the shadow of the banyan tree received high marks from goodreads i did not share the favorable review i thought the novel was painfully slow moving and dull the prose is beautiful but the language takes too much of a central role i thought the inordinate amount of extraneous details about the surrounding landscape hindered the plot's pace and impeded the story's flow in addition the narrator was supposedly a young elementary school aged girl and though she was precocious and quite observant her thoughts and analyses were implausible for a child her age maybe if the protagonist was an adolescent then her keen commentaries would be realistic this too mature voice bothered me as a postscript i read the author's note and i am tempering my somewhat negative review the fact the story is a dedication to the author's father as well as being somewhat autobiographical is making me soften","1058":"i loved this book it was so intriguing to read about something that happened in my lifetime and that i really knew nothing about so many sad realities it is hard to believe all that the cambodians had to go through","1059":"i'm always impressed with a story that takes true tragedy and shows a character who is maintain some sort of light this is a novel but it is based on true events which makes it all the more tragic it is based on events which the parents of one of my best friends survived which breaks my heart","1060":"it is hard to rate this book because it is so uneven the first 200 pages dragged but the last 100 were so horrific that i couldn't put it down this book is basically an auto biography written in the first person as a novel i think that is part of the problem names were changed except for her father's facts may or may not have been changed it was a horrible period in cambodian history and the story needs to be told i am just not sure this is the best way to do ot","1061":"a very poignant story of a young cambodian girl struggling to survive during the kymer rouge slaughter what keeps her going are the stories here father has told her beautifully written and inspiring one of the best books i've read","1062":" this is well written and as often happens when i read historical fiction i learned a lot about the regime while reading this it could have captured my attention a bit more but i think one of the reasons i wasn't dying to pick it up is because it was really depressing u0026amp difficult to read at times because the brutality of the regime was just unreal the tragedy that the author and main character lived through is just so hard to comprehend how do so many pple get so messed up and view the world in such messed up ways it's also hard to believe how relatively recent this all happened","1063":"the story of red cambodia from a prince poet daughter's eyes lyrical and brutal sobering and hopeful all at once fiction but clearly based upon a real life experience thanks for telling the story","1064":"in the spring of 1975 i was in the ninth grade falling in love listening to elton john impatient to be old enough to do whatever i wanted that was not the case in 1975 in cambodia how did i not know 1 to 2 million cambodians would perish under the khmer rouge regime surely it was on the news but i didn't know and my guess is a lot of us did not in this novel we flee phnom penh are shuffled from one place to another seperated from family and starving our guide is a resourceful 7 year old girl there is triumph read this it is excellent","1065":"so much pain among so much beauty very moving autobiographical story of the human

will to survive anyone who in their minds has glorified communism should read this book","1068":"mixed feelings i like the author's writing she knows how to tell a story and build up characters although i believe it's easier to work with characters which are inspired in one's real life but then i didn't like so much the story true there is nothing to like in khmers rouge's cambodia and i knew it as i have a fair knowledge of the events in the country i felt like it's just another dramatic personal account of a dramatic situation by writing this i might be unfair to the author for her nothing in in the shadow of banyan is banal but for me informed about the events and the personal dramas which took place it's just more of the same","1069":"i give this a 3 1 2 it was very interesting about is time in cambodian civil war and the effect it had on the people it was amazing how must they endured and how family members were divided and used their wisdom to fool the ignorant terrorists that continually moved them it was a little hard to follow but worth the effort to learn about this history","1070":"incredible story great writing highly recommend","1071":"i am ashamed to say i knew nothing about the tragedy in cambodia in the late 70s this book opened my eyes it was heartbreaking yet beautiful it's about what we hold onto when our world falls apart and the power of

for me","1074":"knowing comes from learning finding from seeking what was left to find everything was lost in that coffin i have never read a more beautifully written book about such a devastatingly horrific time in history vaddey ratner writes in such a powerfully moving way it is hard to believe that english is not her native language the author uses her own history to weave a tale about a family living in cambodia during the khmer rouge regime raami the seven year old daughter of the a royal prince and poet is the narrator of the story she tells the how her family is forced from their home and into the country side i have never been more moved by the authors words as i was in this story it is unforgettable both for the story it tells and for the words that told it ratner was able to fulfill her father's prphecy she soared","1075":"i hadn't read much on the khmer rouge regime of cambodia in the 1970s but this book really opened my eyes so harrowing and sad yet it was beautifully written which made it more bearable to read i am so grateful for my life and the freedoms that america provides","1076":"sad but surprisingly i wasn't satisfied i skimmed quite a bit and found this book very put down able","1077":"after listening to the author's interview on npr i was looking forward to reading this book but at page 84 i had to set it aside it was just so slow going i could not get into it i'm thinking i will try again as i have read reviews from so many others who have been moved by this story","1078":"based on events from the author's own life this is the story of a child living in cambodia under the khmer rouge i could not put this book down the author's ability to express her own pain and suffering through the story is magnificent as is her powerful message of the life lesson she learned from it all if you have a soul this book should both touch you and haunt you","1079":"i read this book because i am going on a trip to cambodia it is relentlessly sad about the 5 years of brutal khmer rule but it is also magical because the young narrator interweaves her memories of the stories of her ancient land magical and mystical stories that

pace but in its midst are children who don't go to school and are put to work to help the family earn money my daughter paid what they considered to be a hefty fine at the border because she didn't

you to the front of the line extortion lack of education enforcement lack of modern tools to build a modern infrastructure abandoned children are the remnants of how the country was ravaged visiting

read top 5","1093":"gripped my heart a historical period and place that i do not know much about the khmer rouge communist regime caused much devastation in the country of cambodia during 1975 1979 the author has firsthand knowledge of this as the story is essentially her own i found myself caught in the human pain and loss but also simply admiring of how people can also find ways to survive in midst of such awfulness this one will stick with me","1094":"excellent imagery and beautiful writing this book gives a child's perspective of the horrors that occurred when the khmer rouge took over cambodia this book is based on ratner's own personal experience in cambodia and gives a very historical picture as to what happened the terrible atrocities that occurred families being ripped from their homes relocated separated from each other and executed all this is documented in the form of flowing beautiful writing","1095":"grabbed this book at the airport before we left chicago on our way back to hong kong i was not familiar with the atrocities that happened in cambodia during the 1970's this was based on a true story and very well written","1096":"this was hands down one of the best books i have ever read raami's story pulls you in and doesn't let go it was heartbreaking and i horrifying and sickening and beautiful all at once i didn't know much about the khmer rouge or what happened in cambodia in the 70's except that it was bad and a lot of people died now i can't stop thinking about it all and it makes me really wonder how the hell the rest of the world let that happen and i hope in my lifetime or anyone's lifetime that nothing like this ever happens again","1097":"very pretty writing but too slow confusing timeline as well interesting because i didn't know much about this subject","1098":"amazing and heartbreaking","1099":"did not find the writing captivating did not find the primary character believeable and could not finish the book","1100":"this book is a beautifully written narrative that was my first exposure to the horrors of the cambodian civil war i give it only three stars because despite the emotional subject of the novel the author moved me neither to terror nor to tears i believe she throttled back her emotions in order to protect her mother and other adults who survived the insanity from revisiting the brutality and devastation visited upon her as a child i would enjoy reading a sequel the author's experiences as an immigrant to the united states","1101":" i think i have read too many historical fiction books about mass genocides at this point so i feel like i am hearing the same story over and over horrible thing to say i know the thing is there was more fiction in this book than history history was a major backdrop and the central story was about this girl and her mother really kind of boring in fact i have 2 hours left on my book audible 13hr book and am not going to finish i am disappointed because this book had such great reviews","1102":" wow this was intense i can't believe i didn't know anything about the terror in cambodia in the late 70's the khmer rouge regime read like something out of a dystopian novel only it was all real this one gave me nightmares and since the book was somewhat autobiographical it makes those nightmares terrifying my only complaint was that the first half of the book was drawn out a little longer than it needed to be and i would have preferred more focus on their escape but i realize this book was in part a tribute to the authors father and appreciated that as the reason for more focus on the early part of the takeover","1103":"great writing based on author's own devastating experiences sad story but i am glad to learn more about what really happened in cambodia and the atrocities that occurred as recent as the 70's she is truly a hero to live through it and write this beautiful novel","1104":"beautiful writing and great character development horrible circumstances but incredible story of survival by author learned more about this genocide then i'd know before","1105":"astounding and heartbreaking story even more astounding after reading the about the author section and finding out how close to autobiographical it was","1106":"a lyrical prose of how love and family sustain life under the cruelest circumstances","1107":" one of the best books i have read it is a novel based on the author's own experiences during the khmer rouge upheaval in cambodia it is beautifully written one of those books where you continually re read passages for the pleasure or emotion of seeing hearing them again i rarely cry but felt teats in my eyes several times during my reading i think many of us were not so aware of the pain and atrocities of this time if you saw the movie the killing fields you know now what we didn't fully realize then and in this book we get to see things from the perspective of a little girl it was beautiful and heartbreaking i am grateful to my book club for choosing this book","1108":"beautifully written very moving and worth reading","1109":"it cannot be easy to couch such a sad story in such beautiful prose what a testament to the spirit and how this story honors the love of her parents each offering survival in their own way","1110":"in the shadow of the banyan is a gripping book full of the chaos of revolution loss and survival balanced by the poetic beauty of the simplest things i loved it","1111":"it was well written but i often had a hard time believing that the narrator was really a 7 year old child it felt more like an adult's point of view","1112":"many books have been written about cambodia and the atrocities committed by the khmer rouge but this book this book sees it from the perspective of a child a child who is trying to make sense of why they she has to deny the identity of her father and the guilt she carries for her sister's passing amidst the suffering she tries to find kindness and love in the most unlikely places had i owned the words i would've told him what my heart intuited that joy and sorrow often travel the same road and sometimes whether by grace or misfortune they meet and become each other's companion but again i couldn't express what i felt","1113":"this novel based on the author's own experience concerns a young girl in cambodia during the time the khmer rouge were in power 1975 1979 it was a harrowing time the young girl and her family were related to cambodian royalty the khmer rouge style of ruling was to create chaos they forced families from their homes and relocated them the young girl and her family were relocated more than once with fewer family members surviving each time at the end those left are building embankments planting growing and harvesting rice they are also starving the narrator is the young girl who reacts to many events as one would expect a young girl to react jealous of her sister angry at her mother etc however she never gives up showing great personal strength in surviving the atrocities","1114":"this lyrical and poetic retelling of the killing fields in cambodia is softened by the viewpoint of a child the humanity of man is never completely wiped out even during the unthinkable in vaddy's eyes cambodia still maintains it's beauty even though her memories are filled with fly covered corpses lovely","1115":"this is such a well written and heartbreaking book this story is told through the eyes of a seven year old girl in cambodia during the khmer rouge in the 1970s she has a beautiful voice which was shaped by her father a poet the love which her family shares for each other and their country is so touching i've been thinking about this child and her story even days after i finished reading the book i think it will stick with me for a long time","1116":"this book broke my heart","1117":"before reading this book i knew nothing of what went on in cambodia in the 1970's although the first half of this book was difficult for me to get through for a variety of reasons i flew through the second half of the book finding it hard to put down even though this is a work of fiction it is based off the experience of the author vaddey ratner while reading the book i often looked back at the about the author and picture of her at the end of the book i cannot believe what the khmer rouge did to the citizens of cambodia and what a testament to survival and hope vaddey ratner is to her readers","1118":"i had high hopes for this one however sadly after much deliberation i put it down before finishing it i just did not enjoy the read the character's voice seemed distanced and for me that ruined it plus i did not find anything unique about this story","1119":"a truly heart wrenching story that could not possibly have been told in a more beautiful way not at all for the faint of heart and yet i found myself deeply moved perhaps even inspired by the themes of sacrificial love family bonds hope in the face of despair and more this is a book i will not soon forget as it should be","1120":"a young naive child raami's world changes in an instant when her family is thrown into the chaos of civil war in cambodia the revolution brings violence and horrors into what previously was a very sheltered and comfortable life her family is educated well off and descendants of royalty which puts them at increased risk raami is forced to face harsh realities while also reflecting on traditional tales and poetry that she used to share with her scholarly father the way in which she makes sense of everything around her is both sweet and heartbreaking as her innocence is repeatedly shattered what emerges is a stronger more mature and resilient raami but she is put to the test so much that it's hard to believe a little girl could withstand any of it","1121":"probably one of the most beautifully written books i have ever read in my life with every page i was amazed by the skill and power tangled in her words it is a story that i will cherish and share and remember my entire life it is a book that everyone should read","1122":" a moving story of a royal family's exile from phnom penh in the days of the khmer rouge time is marked by the birthdays of the narrator who was seven at the beginning of the novel otherwise day runs into day to the reader as it probably would to those experiencing the relocation and forced labor and hunger at least twice the dark irony of improvements upon the ways of the peasant rice farmers appears improvements that ignore accumulated wisdom and inevitably fail sometimes that wisdom is told as overheard conversations occasionally the child narrator's observations and questions are convincingly childlike however overall the depth of thought and beauty of description is more adult and yet even though it was difficult to remember the age of the narrator i am not sure i would have wanted to give up the language with which the tale was told perhaps an omniscient narrator would have worked better still no narrator choice is without loss as well as gain there is a point where the mother decodes a note i wondered both why so late and would she have been able to use the information if she had understood it earlier also i wondered at the two dimensional nature of the child military the khmer rouge perhaps that is all a seven to ten year old child could see but rarely is someone pure evil there is more beauty than flaw in this novel and it provides insight into a time it behooves us to understand","1123":"good never fall down by patricia mccormick was better this story is poignant without the mind numbing inhumanity of never fall down by patricia mccormick i think i've read at least six perhaps eight novels about the khmer rouge in preparation for my travels time to move on","1124":"this book tells the story of the khmer rouge takeover in cambodia as told from the perspective of a seven year old girl although it is one of the few books on this subject that is fiction and not a memoir ratner explains in the author's notes that all the experiences she writes about are ones that she lived through as a child during this tumultuous period in cambodia this is one of the most beautifully lyrical and moving books i've read in quite a while the main character's father who is a poet plays a key role in the story and it is as though ratner has created a prose narrative that is pure poetry itself the father's words are interwoven throughout her flowing gorgeous descriptions of beauty terror heartache and hope buddhist tradition and thought also seem to blow like a gentle breeze through the story always present but never too noticeable or clunky and while this book will make you profoundly and deeply sad the reader is still somehow left with hope left with the belief that life no matter how terrible is still worth living as long as we can discern just a bit of beauty in it occasionally the book seems almost self referential often when the main character interacts or thinks of her poet father instead of being distracting it pulls you into the story even deeper words both written and spoken play a pivotal role in the novel and if anything these references make us pay even closer attention of ratner's carefully chosen prose \"'words you see ' he said looking at me again 'allow us to make permanent what is essentially transient turn a world filled with injustice and hurt into a place that is beautiful and lyrical '\"in the shadow of the banyan will be available august 7th","1125":" in the shadow of the banyan is a poignant story about a young girl's experience during the horrific regime of the khmer rouge written perfectly and beautifully by vaddey ratner i have read reviews on this book in which the reader was concerned that the voice of the narrator raami 8 years old was too wise and well spoken for her age i don't feel this way as i think it is supposed to be read as raami telling the story looking back on her time in cambodia during the khmer rouge regime i imagine her being much older telling the story especially since her story parallels the authors own experience during that time around the same age readers have asked how an 8 year old girl could think so maturely but i think she is telling her story years later and being older she has a better understanding of what she went through and how it made her feel the circumstances she went through forced her to feel and experience grown up emotions and thoughts she was essentially forced to grow up but i think ratner did a great job of showing this and also showing her innocence and age by displaying her feelings of jealousy toward her younger sister or the way she sought comfort from her father's stories and her mother's embrace in the shadow of the banyan definitely had me shedding many tears but i think this book and others like it are such important books to read we should never forget those who had to endure senseless suffering it puts life into perspective and touches the soul i also feel like i learned a lot unfortunately even though this did not happen so long ago i didn't even know anything about the khmer rouge regime this is a great book beautifully written and i would recommend it to everyone","1126":"beautifully written often read like poetry very dark book but i learned a great deal about the genocide that occurred in cambodia","1127":"amazing loved it","1128":"an amazing story richly written and even more impressive when you find out that english is not the author's 1st language","1129":"this could be the most devastating yet beautiful book i've ever read the story is based on the author's experiences in the killing fields of cambodia when she was driven from her home at age 5","1130":"a memoir of her time as a child in cambodia under the khmer rouge very sad but uplifting","1131":" in the shadow of a the banyan is a fictional story based on the author's real life experience of living through the khmer rouge takeover as a child the story is told through the point of view of a young child and this point of view was a big stumbling block for me i felt the lyrical prose of the book didn't match the child narrator although the prose was beautiful i couldn't get past the viewpoint i also think the storyline could have been deeper with an adult point of view however i am glad i read the book to get this sobering account of the khmer rouge it was tough to read at parts but worth it anyways","1132":"i could not put this down the incredible tragedy of the cambodian people under the khmer rouge set against the beautiful landscape of cambodia and told by the daughter of a poet who interweaves the legends and history of her people is simultaneously horrific and breathtakingly beautiful i would recommend it to anyone with the caveat that you cannot read it without being touched by the tragedy of the characters it is an intense read","1133":"this is perhaps the saddest book i've ever read the overwhelming sense of loss had me near tears at many points through raami a 7 year old we see the horror of the khmer rouge and the cambodian genocide we also see her father a man of morality integrity and a love for his family so deep that he willingly gives up his own life to assure their safety and despite the losses accrued there is finally a message of hope that beauty exists that love endures that despite the pain we can go on","1134":"despite the fact that this book is about the horrors commited by the khmer rouge in cambodia it is also a beautifully written story about love courage and the will to survive","1135":"poignant and sad but a story that should be told and read it is also one way to learn about the cambodian revolution in the 1970s","1136":"an informative horrifying beautiful all at the same time book","1137":"an important story that needs to be told about the atrocities suffered by the cambodian people it is a fictional account based on the actual experiences of the author difficult and painful to read at times but a powerful account of the strength of the human spirit","1138":" a fictionalized account of the author's story of living under the khmer rouge in the 1970s raami is a young princess from the sisowath royal clan she was seven at the time so she fictionalized the story because she couldn't completely trust her memory as a member of the royal family their lives are in danger the khmer rouge marched into phnom penh in 1975 around buddhist new year in april the populace knew they had lost and that the khmer rogue had won so they were especially willing to cooperate with the rogue army so that they would see that they didn't mean harm and had surrendered as soon as they were in the city's gates the khmer rouge announced that the americans were coming to bomb the city and insisted that all residents leave the city as soon as possible people weren't sure how long they would be gone so they brought various amounts of food and belongings some residents walked others biked rode animals or carts and the wealthy used cars raami's family used two automobiles and originally left for a summer home the family had in the country once they were aware that the army knew where they were they attempted to continue in their autos but abandoned vehicles and belongings were strewn about the roads and the family was forced to walk into swampland with others death starvation and tragedy is strewn over the area and people are divided by family and relationship so that people will be powerless alone education former wealth and any position of status is attempted to be weeded out by the angkar as they call themselves the organization the khmer people have no idea who is really in charge and the soldiers they meet are usually young and uneducated some educated people are used to weed out those who are educated and expose them the idea presented is so that they can assist the organization but in reality they are marked for death something that wouldn't clearly become apparent until later this is a very nice novel of a young girl who does end up surviving when many died including most of her family in reality author vaddey ratner graduated from the top of her class in high school attended cornell university majoring in southeast asian studies and there graduated summa cum laude also","1139":"language didn't fit the character","1140":"i found this one to be a chilling narrative of the brutality that the khmer rouge brought to the people of cambodia in the 1970's told from the point of view of a child raami in one day her family and comfortable life is swept away when the revolutionaries evacuate phnom pehn and one by one raami looses each person that she loves it is not a cheerful tale and it was heartbreaking to read i don't recommend it for sensitive readers and i do urge that the reader avoid skipping ahead to the author's note it's worth working through four stars overall for the longer review please go here http www epinions com review vaddey","1141":" this is a tremendous book set in cambodia it is absolutely in our top 20 reads if you want a bit about history of the revolution that took place in there 1975 1979 and a beautifully told story part autobiographical then this is an absolute must cambodia just lifts off the pages the jungle the heat the oppression the animal life all observed throught the eyes of raami an 8 year old girl written in a style that is both lyrical and profound it is a book that lingers long after the book has been closed for the last time","1142":"i read late into the evening slept woke in the middle of the night to finish reading this moving novel the shadow of the banyan is inspired by her childhood ratner chose to write a novel rather than a memoir her goal wasn't to provide journalistic evidence of pol pot's genocide in cambodia where it is estimated that the khmer rouge killed 1 million to 2 million people between 1975 and 1979 she wanted to remember her family","1143":"in the shadow of the banyan is set between the years of 1975 1979 in cambodia when the khmer rouge regime took power as revolutionaries who would change the country for good instead they killed about two million people and probably ruined the whole country in the shadow of the banyan is about seven year old raami one of the many inhabitants of phnom penh who is taken out of the city and into the countryside with her mother father and younger sister gradually only herself and one of her family members are left as the others are taken by the organization or by malaria raami takes courage and holds on to who she is by remembering the stories that her father told her while meanwhile the khmer rouge discourages people from remembering the past the khmer rouge are obviously communists and this is one of the many instances in which communism went terribly wrong and resulted in disaster throughout the book the khmer rouge tortures and shifts people around indiscriminately but also in trying to boost rice production they cause a famine basically the bureaucrats are trying to tell the rice farmers how to farm when they obviously have no idea how to do it the book itself was really moving it focused on one royal family's exile but also the atrocities committed against everyone raami is only seven years old when it starts and her childhood is left behind forever just like in journey into the whirlwind a memoir or 1984 a faceless government big brother the organization controls people's lives and no one knows who or what it is i understand the communist ideal of everyone being equal but what's the point of that when everyone has absolutely nothing no food poor shelter and unsanitary conditions and i'm sure there were some rich leaders sitting in giant mansions feasting themselves in the capital i'm also rather ashamed that the developed countries like the us or the united kingdom didn't do much well perhaps they did but not enough to affect the people for four long years i seem to be focusing more on the issue in general incidentally i had never heard of it before i read this book but really i think in the shadow of the banyan was probably a very accurate portrayal even though it is fiction the author herself was five years old in 1975 when the khmer rouge took power i received this one from simon u0026amp schuster and really enjoyed it though it could be practically heartbreaking at times www novareviews blogspot com","1144":"this was a great book heart wrenching and soul crushing to read of such inhumanity as seen and experienced through the eyes of a child the book stayed with me for days after i finished it i kept noticing so many things around me that we take for granted and that are so truly inconsequential she wrote with prose and beauty and conveyed such a sense of love for family culture and tradition i was impressed with her skill to write in such a way while telling such a disturbing story","1145":"a very well written and riveting book i never knew the stories of cambodia the powerful takeover and the refugees vaddey ratner writes it with such grace excellent book and as with all good books you don't want it to end","1146":"a beautifully written tragic story yes the subject matter is difficult and heartbreaking but it was written at times with the most poetic stories and life lessons from which we all grow historical fiction in my opinion is a must for all that want to learn and develop while enjoying a great novel this book is one of the best and taught me much of this cambodian struggle","1147":"beautiful writing and enlightening interesting story very sad as expected three stars only because i felt the narrative was too wordy at times and some parts dragged a bit","1148":"i thought this was an incredible book in many ways it tells the story of an important historical even that most of us know way too little about and something that continues to happen over and over around our world it shows the power of stories to get us through both the difficult times and the wonderful times of life it had lines that made me stop and ponder before i could go on reading even without the book here in front of me i can still recall them... i am not a poet but the daughter of a poet and i see the world through my father's words ... we are all echoes of one another ... words give you wings and somehow in a book that was heavy there was incredible hope in the story i really loved this book and think it was a great first pick for worth the read","1149":"i could not stop reading this semi autobiographical book about a young girl who survives the genocide started by the khmer rouge this was a book about love relationships resilience strength and beauty and i simply loved it the courage of some people to survive and love and carry on despite unimaginable suffering is simply awe inspiring this book will stay with me for a very long time","1150":" although i have some knowledge of the khmer rouge period in cambodia this book makes the suffering personal it is a beautifully written book lyrical and soaring but also plummeting to the earth my only criticism is that the thoughts ascribed to a 7 year old seemed a bit advanced for someone of that age anyone who wants to understand the personal costs of the insane pol pot regime should read this book but it is not only about suffering and pain it is about transcending ugliness and pain and finding beauty and meaning this was a very moving book","1151":" beautifully written a mixture of fairytales folklores history and autobiography i love the quietness of this novel death is almost silent here and tragedy is intertwined in everyday life of the characters this is not a novel about self victimisation and finger pointing it is rather an attempt to bring back what has been lost from ratner's childhood however i don't like how ratner relied so much on descriptive thoughts rather than dialogues and actions raami's narrative is a bit annoying for me she doesn't sound like a seven year old girl an interesting book should show not tell still recommend this anyway","1152":" i don't know if i can find any way to describe this book accurately now what with just closing it's pages and being so invested and moved by all it contains it's just so utterly heartbreaking compelling beautiful and needs to be read by everyone i don't normally read books like this because they take so much out of you and the world can be a miserable place without saddening yourself further yet this story needs to be known and despite the horrors there is hope and love which permeates every page that will resonate for a long time with me i can't praise this book highly enough it's utterly beautiful and heartbreaking read it edit now that my brain has taken a moment to contemplate i still do not want to change my rating at all the only slight issue this book gave me was trying to reconcile the fact that such exquisite prose and thoughts could possibly come from a seven year old it's just not possible but soon enough you just become utterly swept away and entranced by this story and all it represents and it fails to matter in the slightest","1153":"cambodia's killing fields survived by the author as a child in a family of royal lineage beautiful often lyrical descriptions many close to home and vivid for me of cambodian countryside nature rural life family customs cultural heritage collide and clash with angkar's brutal rule through the khmer rouge - forced migrations family separation and loss slave labor deaths from hunger disease executions powerful story of survival","1154":"very well written but incredibly sad book so can't say i 'enjoyed' it hence the 3 stars","1155":" this book was interesting i've read these types of texts before but i didn't feel as connected to in the shadow of the banyan than i did for say funny boy by shyam selvadurai it was a very poignant novel and i understand that it was written in part as an autobiography but i just wasn't as compelled there was a sense of repetitiveness to it and though it was a very sad story it's probably not one i would recommend i agree with other reviewers that the voice was too mature for a child even if it's written after harrowing events that have made the child more mature i also thought that the poetry was a little too much unbelievable that someone could think that lyrically in the midst of such trauma","1156":"i am overwhelmed by this book it was difficult to read about this period of history and yet i could not put it down it is utterly heartbreaking and at the same time written with such a sensitive poetic hand the depth of love and loss and hope and despair is described with such palpable emotion that this is vaddey ratner's own story and a living tribute to her father is amazing","1157":"there is real evil in the world and khmer rouge ranks with the nazis a superior work of fiction based on real life events told from a young cambodian girl's perspective this book reminds me of between shades of gray by ruth sepetys a young lithuanian girl's story of the struggle and survival of love over hate","1158":"this book was very hard to read but i learned a lot about a subject i didn't know much about the khmer rouge occupation of cambodia in the 1970s like some others have noted the narrator raami is a little too precocious for age 7 to relate what happened and especially for her to have the kind of exchanges with her father that she does but i will forgive that since the book is so beautifully written","1159":"this book was fiction however if paralleled the authors life when she was 5 years old and the khmer rouge revolution destroyed her country it was a heartbreaking story but had moments of beauty and hope through story telling passed down from her father thoughtful and well written","1160":" this was a beautiful heartbreaking book it reminded me of isabel allende's best books in its magical use of language pacing and tone yes the content cambodia in the 70s is disturbing but the author's choice to use a young girl to tell her story allowed me as the reader to hold the same hope that a child might i recommend it with caution to anyone with a love of language and a capacity to enter a historical nightmarish hell if only in a story there's a sense of hope and wonder that i carried with me even after i turned the final page i look forward to vaddey ratner's next book","1161":"what a great read the story is compelling the characters well drawn i loved it","1162":"this book resonated with me the story takes you through times of political upheaval in cambodia when the khmer rouge took over communism their ideal and any semblance of class destroyed the book is listed as fiction but based on the author's own recollection of these times her father was an educated poet a gentle man her parents love was evident not only to each other but to their children siblings and mother within days all was changed through tenacity and luck the child lives having endured unimaginable horrors the people we meet through her journey will stay with us and her forever it is a journey of the human heart and good over evil prevails","1163":"cambodia mid 70's the story of a family during the revolution their struggle to survive the horrors of the khmer rouge displacement the will to survive u0026amp love this story will stay with me the writing was unbelievably beautiful in relating loss u0026amp recovery through the eyes u0026amp experience of a little girl who is 5 years old when it all begins","1164":" this is a lovely novel about the effects of the khmer rouge on a young girl and her family if you know the story of the khmer rouge which was in control of cambodia for only five years but committed a massive genocide and huge social revolution in that short time then you know people die and it's basically a tragic story but because it's the story of a young girl a survivor there's a 'positive' ending there's also a lot of tenderness and love in this story the writing is beautiful poetic but the story is not terribly interesting i would more likely recommend a memoir about cambodia rather than this novel","1165":"a compassionate and beautifully written story of a time situation in cambodia 1976 1979 that i had very little knowledge of the human story is filled with love hate cultural spirit and hope ms ratner makes real the unspeakable horror that she experienced as a young child under the rule of the khmer excellent","1166":"beautiful descriptive language but a little too much of it for me i found myself often skimming through it looking for something to happen even so interesting based on the author's true life and experiences as a little girl in cambodia when the khmer rouge took over","1167":" as her country and family are torn apart in the violent uprising that put the khmer rouge in power young raami watches with an old soul and the eyes of a poet i don't know nearly enough about the history of cambodia but as i read this book i recognized so many familiar elements from world history threaded through the steamy jungle scenes it was easy to understand the rise and fall of the communist part of kampuchea i smiled with raami's father as he momentarily rejoiced at the idea of the people taking power for themselves i shook with rage when i realized that the family was being pushed out of their home with no explanation and i ached with devastation as i watched the family spilt and separated to scrabble for survival ratner has taken these universal emotions and dyed them with the rich dyes of her lost homeland making this book not only an eye opening read but an enjoyable one as well","1168":"this is one of the most beautiful heartbreaking stories i've ever read","1169":"this is a little girl's story of what she experienced in cambodia in the 1970s wow those times were so intense what massive devastation it's so depressing to reflect on how around the world humans come up with reasons to kill each other on massive scale levels thank goodness there's also the resilience of the human spirit and it's that combination that makes this book not completely a heart breaker there's the even if muted triumph of survival through adversity one quote i liked we strolled to the edge of the rice paddies climbed onto the dike and as we stood there drinking our breakfast in companionable silence more comfortable now without speaking i thought maybe it wasn't necessary to explain anything at all maybe it was enough that i knew i was not alone that at the very least standing here beside me was this one person who unbeknownst to me till now had all along been journeying this same journey with me only from the opposite direction p 169","1170":"this is one of those kinds of books that i love dread reading in the 1970's the khmer rouge ruled cambodia over 20% of the population lost their lives to \"social engineering\" ratner paints exquisitely beautiful and achingly horrific images to the pages of this book the writing is poetry for the soul but it was almost too painful to pick up a child's description of genocide and how her family and those around her were affect by it raami's papa says to her \"i told you stories to give you wings so that you would never be trapped by anything your name your title the limits of your boy this world's suffering \"","1171":" this is a difficult book to review partly because it's such a difficult book to read i'd suggest readers go to the back of the book and read the author's notes before starting the book although it is a fiction it is based on the true events that happened to ratner and her family when the khmer rouge regime took over cambodia in april 1975 ratner a five year old at the time although raamni the little girl in the story is two years older spent the next few years being hauled from one work camp to another as her family members struggled to survive the starvation and violence that was thrust upon them it's important to read books like this to understand the atrocities that have happened and continue to happen to innocent people it is very very difficult to read though and to realize that the human race is capable of such horrible crimes against humanity how can it be that the events described in this book happened as recently as 1975 yet as unbelievable as that thought is you have to ask yourself how it can be that similar crimes are still being committed somewhere in the world right now brutal the only reason i didn't give this book 5 stars is because it was just a little too poetic or lyrical for me in spots this is just a personal preference of mine it is beautifully written and i can see that it's just a style that i don't always care for although maybe the prose is necessary to soften the cruelty of the story anyway a tough book but definitely worthwhile be prepared to have your heart ripped out","1172":"i keep trying to think of what to say about this book and the only thing that keeps coming back to me is read it read it read it read it this book is a fictionalized account of the author's very real lived experiences through the takeover of the khmer rouge in cambodia in the 1970s it is a horrifying account it is incredibly well written again all i can say is read it read it as soon as you can","1173":" this beautifully written story tells a tragic tale through the eyes of a 7 year old girl i love how the author portrayed the strong bond of family love and sacrifice raami and her family are forced to leave their ancestral home in phnom pehn cambodia by brutal revolutionaries the khmer rouge raami observes processes and then reacts internally to everything she sees and hears things that no one let alone a child should have to endure her innocence is eventually shattered it is the fantasy stories that she remembers hearing at the knee of her tender poetic father that ultimately save her","1174":"good book on a culture and country i didn't know enough about","1175":"a well written story about a sad subject leaves me with a heavy heart in the end the narrator on audible is a bit slow so i had to speed x2 to listen","1176":" this was a beautifully written book i loved the author's writing it's honest and beautiful and every word was heartfelt besides that the plot was engaging and resonated with me every character had a purpose honestly this story was enlightening and the fact that it mirrors the author's experiences makes it magnificent i have a lot of appreciation for someone who can write so beautifully about the horrors of reality they faced so in conclusion i've fallen in love with this magnificent book","1177":"essentially a fictionalized memoir told through the voice of a 7 year old child during the war years in cambodia 1975 1979 intense glimpse in to the horrors of that time but beautiful stories interwoven throughout","1178":"starts very slow but good story about the pol pot regime from the perspective if a seven year old girl with physical disabilities the result of her childhood polio","1179":" a few years back i visited a holocaust museum in richmond with my daughter and it was an experience i'll never forget with each step i was repelled with nausea and my mind reeled at the inconceivability of it yet i could also see the slivers of light that appeared for example in the innocent drawings of imprisoned children and it reminded me of the hope we cling to even during our most desperate moments i found myself thinking of such things as i read in the shadow of the banyan a relentlessly sad novel set during the khmer rouge uprising just as i felt a suffocating sense of pervasive despair in the museum so i also felt as i pressed onward through author vaddey ratner's novel she gives just enough hope to keep reading but barely at that ratner tells the story of a royal family uprooted from phnom penh during the khmer rouge's bloody rise to power and the subsequent forced march to the killing fields of cambodia told as the memoirs of a seven year old fictional girl the parallels to the author's own life are numerous and thus the story comes across more as a roman a clef than pure fiction in the author interview at the end of the book ratner admits the excruciating difficulty of digging up her memories and transforming them into a story i can't even begin to imagine this is far from a page turner it is a narrative that appeals to your heart rather than your short attention span if i have but one complaint it is that the author is given to excessive descriptive passages that do little to ease the burden of the non stop misery i nonetheless recommend it for fans of evocative writing or those who enjoy tales of human strength in the midst of tragic circumstances there are certain stories that need to be repeated because as the author stated they are given a permanence that is necessary and beneficial to all of us in the shadow of the banyan is such a tale","1180":" i had high hopes for this book but never was really able to get into it the story of the genocide in cambodia is extremely tragic especially since so few seemed to be aware of it especially when told through the eyes of a child as in this novel the narrator is made to grow up very quickly as she and her family lose everything plenty happens in the book but i had trouble staying focused on the descriptions and i often found myself getting lost on where the narrator and her family were at each point in the book and how they even got there or why they were taken there i was relieved when i finished the book so that i could start something new","1181":"after being at the u s holocaust museum this winter and hearing more about the cambodian genocide reading this book was really powerful seeing similarities of how people adapt in these situations is important i am not interested in reading this time in history from the political perspective","1182":"rating 3 5 a well written but heartbreaking story of pain and loss the ending is full of hope for the future for the author and her mother","1183":"i'm giving this book a 3 75 rating it was a great story but the author kept beating it into us the fact that her father was a great man i got it from the very first","1184":"this was a wonderful book vaddey has a true gift as a story teller","1185":"the book started off slow but ended at a better pace maybe slow isn't the right word it's just that in the first half of the book every bug the girl saw brought about some new transcendental philosophical expericence and let me tell you there are a lot of bugs in cambodia with that aside learning about the everyday experiences of someone living during the khmer rouge's rein was very interesting and very sad","1186":"such a sad but beautiful tale of the genocide of the cambodian people brought me to tears many times beautiful poetry heartwrenching depiction of war and it's effect on an entire country","1187":"heart breaking one of the best books i've ever read","1188":"very plodding hard to get through","1189":" this is a story told from the eyes of a seven year old when the war starts in cambodia is is a fictinalized account of what the author and her upper class family went through when the cambodian khmer rouge regeime take over the atrocities that the cambodians inflect upon their own people in an attempt to strip them of every shred of their individuality is unbelievable i was only a child when the vietnam war raged on i now feel like i understand why the us could not stand by and watch i highly recommend this book","1190":"this story is eloquently written and has a great cast of characters this story transports you to a distant land and culture thus giving you rare insight into it","1191":"this is a poignant fictionalized autobiography it chronicles the ways the author protagonist's life changed after the khmer rouge took power in cambodia at first i thought the language a little flowery and overwrought but it gradually came to represent the lush beauty of the country in contrast to the atrocities taking place the author has written a beautiful tribute to her lost family members and to everyone killed during the violent changes in her birth country","1192":"ratner's fictional account of the revolution in cambodia and her family's sad experience during that time is heartbreaking it is however so much more that than her father was a poet and she writes beautifully i am amazed that someone for whom english is a second language uses that language with so much artistry","1193":" it's a pretty rare occurrence when a book lives up to its advanced praise hype but ratner's debut novel most certainly not only meets the high expectations set after reading such comments but exceeds many of them simply put this is a wonderful novel american audiences may find this piece of literature based on the author's own experiences to be both educational and a beautiful example of fiction each scene with vivid detail comes to life with the power of ratner's prose the actual connection to the land itself to the people really is evident on each page as raami narrates her life during the horrible regime of the khmer rouge in cambodia through all of the horrors and hardships the author is careful to give glimpses of beauty and even hope into this tragic story it's a powerful and moving novel and one that may cause a box of tissues to be on hand all in all it is an amazingly strong debut novel and i can't wait to see what this new talented author publishes next","1194":"heart wrenching read it is the fictionalized story of the author when age 5 9 and her family's lives as the khmer rouge stormed in to cambodia in 1975 declaring a new way of life be sure to read the author's notes at the end they too are a must read","1195":"an amazing story based on the author's life set in cambodia during the reign of the khmer rouge the horrors endured by the people are unbelievable an amazing story","1196":"beautiful tragic highly recommended","1197":" i'm not sure how she did it but somehow the author has told a heartbreaking brutal story in such a way that the words are like poetry at some parts you want to close your eyes to avoid seeing the vision that the story provides of human beings treating other people worse than dogs of families experiencing such sorrow of a lovely country being decimated but at the same time the story is so beautifully written that you can't stay away an excellent debut by a talented storyteller i hope she gives us more","1198":" truly gorgeous poetic evocative beautifully written the author has a gift for seeing the larger patterns of fate without neglecting the smaller moments between people i loved her description of mae and pok as trees to come life with their weathered faces and rustling movements i felt so much for raami on her journey from privileged sensitive child to silent hollow survivor but even though the experience claimed so from her you get the sense that she took everything beautiful from it that she could","1199":"seven year old raami is a privileged daughter of a cambodia prince when the khmer rouge comes to power in 1975 her family is uprooted from the capital phnom penh and go to live in their summer home with relatives soon they are again moved out and what follows is a constant moving around raami's story is heart breaking as her relatives fall victim to the regime over the next four years she endures starvation brutality and forced labour she meets both the good and bad side of the human race raami clings to her father by remembering his legends and fables this is both a horrific book and an awesome book horrific in the fact that the story mirrors the author's true experiences and awesome in the beautiful writing the reader can not help but fight along side of raami and cheer her on at every awful turn in her young life this is a beautifully wrought tale of human resilience","1200":"am giving this book four stars because i really cared for raami and her family at times the story seemed to move rather slowly i would have liked to learn a little more about the monarchy before the khmer rouge regime used wikipedia to refresh my memory about poi pot did not watch movie the killing fields when it came out because i knew the atrocities would upset me am tempted to see it now to match its visuals with clear descriptions the author gave","1201":" loss is the revolving theme of this novel that is told through the eyes of a 7 year old girl at the time the khmer rouge came to power raami's family was forced from their home in phnom penh to labor in rural communities her parents tried to protect her from the brutality of the political environment but there were limits to the protection their love could offer in the face of mass horror many sections were difficult to read but the author had a compelling writing style and the main character was a fascinating narrator","1202":"based on a true story about the khmer rouge genocide in cambodia hard to believe this terror took place in my lifetime","1203":"not an easy read because the topic dealt with man's inhumanity to man the story was so realistic that i was surprised when i got to the end of it and discovered that it was fiction but based on fact it tells a story similar to what happened in china during the cultural revolution and to the jewish community under hitler's rule and needs to be told","1204":" in the shadow of the banyan is a story about cambodia's turbulent history a hard subject which is beautifully told through the eyes of a five year old child raami's story begins in phnom penh cambodia's capital war entered my childhood world not with blasts of rockets and bombs but with my father's footsteps as he walked through the hallway passing my bedroom toward his she continues to tell her story as she and her family are forced to leave their home we had to move fast if the revolutionary soldier came back he would shoot us so starts the nightmare this family must endure the terror of the khmer rouge the communist party that took over the cambodian government even though it's a difficult subject the author includes stories of human kindness that helped her continue to hope for a better life once your papa told me there was still hope he was right always there's hope vaddey ratner writes beautifully","1205":"the author uses language with the delicacy of a debussy composition layered subtle and the fading of the chords what we refer to as the decay resonates for weeks stunning to me was my own horrible ignorance of these atrocities which occurred in my own lifetime there but for fortune...","1206":"beautifully written anyone who lives in se asia has visited asia or is just interested in asia this is a must read","1207":" in mytho poetic language in the shadhow of the banyan is a worked immersed in grief and tragedy and yet finds in the darkest shadows of human experience cause for hope the great grand daughter of a cambodian king vaddey ratner was inspired reading elie wiesel's night to transform suffering into art in order to give voice to her family's struggle against the atrocities in her homeland for in the words of the father in the novel words allow us to make permanent what is essentially transient this is brought home in an early funeral in the book for a baby dying as families are dispersed across the country a monk stripped of his robes but not his holiness with a voice of a thousand monks he chants while even as a lotus endowed with beauty fragrance and color must fade impermanence is the condition of all sentient beings he promises the father of lost infant that his giref will fade like a flower and leave behind always a seed of possibility having come to america as a refugee knowing no english ratner graduated as valedictorian of her high school class in minnesota and then summa cum laude from cornell where she studied southeast asian history and literature she return to live in cambodia with her husband and daughter for four of the years in which she wrote this novel in the novel as in life the father gives his daughters stories--the great epics of cambodian literature--saying i told you stories to give you wings raami so that you would never be trapped by anything and yet the difficulty in keeping the stories alive in the face of ongoing and arbitrary brutality is revealed through the pages of this novel raami is taken with her mother and sister to the country to be reeducated through living with peasants and says if i am to survive my uprooting and transplantation i must grow and stretch myself as a young rice shoot would i must rise above the mire and muck the savagery of my environment while appearing to thrive in it as the country tumbles deeper into chaos and the mantra becomes to keep you is no gain to kill you is no loss a third of the population is put to death often out of petty jealousy and spite often out of the senseless machinery of the revolution through this raami recaptures her sense of a story's ability to cut through time and space a story i had learned can lead us back to ourselves to our lost innocence and in the shadow it casts over our present world we begin to understand what we only intutited in our naivite--that while all else may vanish love is our eternity and so through this novel ratner transcends the particular of the great human tragedy that was cambodia under the khmer rouge in the late 1970s to find hope in the midst of tragedy through the power of the story this is a luminous story of remembrance forged from within the dense shadows of human existence as revealed through broad scale inhumanity which succeeds in the author's goal of transforming suffering into art","1208":"one of the best books i've read this year i love the prose even with the overuse of metaphor and simile the writing is just fantastic and using the point of view of a child made it all the more poetic and heartbreaking","1209":"i read a lot i love reading sometimes i find a book ok sometimes i love it but this one is more than that this is one of the best books i have ever read because it's a story told by the heart a true story a remarkable story story of horror and death seen through child's eyes no hatred no artificial observations no fake everybody should read that book and it should be read over and over and over again because it truly deserves it","1210":" ratner tells us in her author's note that raami's story is in essence my own this is a novel about love and survival and the power of stories raami is just seven years old when the novel begins when the khmer rouge comes to power the murderous regime over the course of four years was responsible for as many as two million deaths wiping out about a third of the cambodian population in their attempts to establish a communist utopia the story is described in blurbs as lyrical i thought at first too lyrical bordering on purple as ratner paints an idyllic life among mangoes and butterflies and jasmine and the banyan tree poetry and legends it wasn't long before i was pulled in though it occurs to me all that lush imagery isn't without its purpose and not the one i thought at first it's not so much that the golden world of her childhood is presented as a contrast to the horrors to come as that it's a vision that sustains raami through it raami's parents are especially strong characters and the warmth lingers through much of the novel i couldn't help comparing this in my mind to wiesel's night the memoir of his time in auschwitz when barely in his teens that wasn't cloaked as this story is in fiction but the main difference is that this story somehow escapes its bleakness despite the at times graphic brutality hope and faith even to the end shines through it's not as powerful as night and the voice did strike me as a bit too sophisticated for such a young child but this is still a moving story and very evocative of time and place with characters to care about","1211":"in the shadow of the banyan was very slow and i had to slog through some parts of the book i didn't buy the 7 year old narrator she sounded too old to be 7 i saw all the wonderful reviews and was looking forward to an exceptional read i obviously don't have the same tastes as most of the reviewers at this site","1212":"very well written gave me a close up view of the cambodian struggle the cambodian's religious beliefs and inner strength i loved the stories that raami's parents shared with her during the course of the book it broke my heart that this little girl had to witness such atrocities","1213":" this book is not a light read it exposes the catastophic events in cambodia from 1974 79 when the khmer rouge murdered millions of their own people though it is fiction the narrator is a 7 year old girl which makes it even more terrible watching her family and nation be destroyed while she lives on is the most unnerving part of the book to me fiction can never outdo the truth people can think of more horror and call it for the good of all than can be made up by any writer will we never learn","1214":"excellent book extremely well written as it tells the story of the cambodian genocide parts of it however were just to slow","1215":" i purchased this book based on a number of reviews i read in fact the endorsement by chris cleave on the pretty cover a masterpiece utterly heartbreaking and impossibly beautiful didn't hurt either i was underwhelmed there were several problems with this book for me what could have been a powerful and moving story was compromised by alternating overdone and awkward prose written in first person the narrator is a seven year old girl and i was unclear throughout whether this was a retrospective account of the khmer rouge or the telling by a child that i was confused by this is not the fault of me as a reader then again perhaps any seven year old would think in such sophisticated terms i told myself i would stay put be here for them and when their spirits left their bodies they would see that i'd been here along along to hear their last words their last great and they would see that i had witnessed not only their deaths but more importantly their fight for life their desire to live sorry i think not it simply didn't work for me parts of the book were so obviously emotionally manipulative it turned me off the author states in her acknowledgements that raami's story is in essence her own i'm uncertain why vaddey ratner chose to use a novel to tell her story it may have served both her and the reader far more meaningfully had it been written as a memoir of the actual events","1216":" may 2014 book clubi had a difficult time getting into this one maybe i just wasn't in the frame of mind for such a heavy topic i finally started to really get into the story in maybe the last third of the story this is the story of raami and her survival through the khmer rouge revolution in cambodia although a fictional story it is based on a very real uprising in cambodia in the 1970s i had never heard of this movement so the story was educational for me the story is based on the authors own experiences during this time which makes it even more moving","1217":"i just couldn't connect with this book at all i know it's a beautiful story but no matter what i couldn't focus on the writing and what was going on in the story i constantly found my mind wandering it was a huge struggle to get through this and i really can't say the ending was worth it i actually felt a huge sigh of relief when i got to the final page last night the afterword was actually pretty interesting though","1218":"it is rare to come across a book that jolts you and makes you weep i am more than glad that i came across this one and read it this is set in the time of 1975 79 at cambodia the period of khmer rouge the killing fields the systemic breakdown of the fabric of the cambodian society the story is that of a young 7 year old raami who is forced to flee her home with her loved ones barely packing up what could be a few bundles it is the story of loss tribulation of a seven year old who is forced to understand things that even adults would not want to it is also a story of dreams hope beauty and the human want to survive at all odds when her father is taken away by the khmer rouge the young raami beseeches with him to not go away she begs him to tell her one last story if that doesn't break your heart nothing will her mother's fury at what she felt was abandonment at the hands of her husband in just a few lines of a story of a family of birds the author gets the reader to feel what this woman goes through only when she finally manages to flee her country not knowing what had become of her father what his last moments were like does the child dare to take his name there are too many poignant moments like these too many for me to list down if you are looking for historical facts or if you want to understand what the genocide was like this book is not for you but if you liked the kite runner or the thousand splendid suns i would seriously recommend this one this is one book i am sure to read again and again","1219":"beautifully written and all the more heartbreaking because it is based on a true story the author's cambodia and the khmer rouge regime from the eyes of a little girl who endured","1220":" this is the first book i have read about cambodia during the khmer rouge brutal regime as a jew whose family fled to escape the nazis i have this horror ingrained in my being i knew about the horrors of the khmer rouge but i hadn't read in depth about it the author vaddey ratner tells a nightmare story beautifully like a poem that carries you with it it is her story as a young child in spite of the atrocities and nightmares they lived through the love between this young girl and her father is deep and enduring the complex and altering relationship between her and her mother unfolds so beautifully writing this book must have been extraordinarily painful and yet the author writes in such a magnificent poetic style brava ms ratner for your courage your brilliant writing and for surviving","1221":"one of the most heartbreaking stories i've ever read with just enough hope and just enough beauty to stitch you back together again makes you re examine your life worthwhile read but prepare with plenty of tissues","1222":"well written story of a cambodian young girl during the pol pot era very engaging and uplifting despite the topic","1223":"beautifully written but too much violence though that is what war is about","1224":"this is a heart wrenching book i am not sure i could of read the complete book except that the writing was flawless","1225":"i just couldn't get past the flowery prose story just too slow for a novel when being captured by the k rouge for four years is a perfect drama setting problem with narrative is that instead of going into main protagonist's character author fills pages with the poetry of myth nah uh all i know about the little girl is that she had polio and so i gave up at page 180","1226":"in the midst of war in cambodia raami seven years old and crippled from polio seeks life and some beauty in the middle of chaos and evil like a child she often blames herself for consequences beyond her control this is ratner's own story but she chooses to tell it in the form of a novel when her weathy royal family is driven from their city home into the countryside who they are becomes a major liability raami's father a poet gives unconditional love to the child and imparts wisdom through poetry that the child leans on during the four years of work camps while raami has worshipped her fathr she learns more and more about her mother as they lose one family member after another the horrors and deprivations of this war are especially palpable in the novel when raami's mother offers to raami the only food she has a waterbug balancing this dismal picture is the poetry that is intermixed with the plot sometimes the voice of a seven year old is a bit farfetched but i had to give this a five based on the lyrical prose throughout the novel which is literally beauty in the midst of chaos and evil with lines such as lightning struck the sky roared and the night cried a giant's tears thunderous and inconsolable i'll remember this book as a thing of beauty for a long time","1227":" this is a wrenching story but the evocative language which depict beautiful images and heartfelt emotions provides the most entralling experience it's simply sweet agony a tension between the horrid times during pol pot in cambodia and the struggle of a young girl and her family to survive the writing style is absolutely gorgeous and married with such a horrific episode of recent history the read is at once bracing and totally engaging i was moved throughout the book her writing style sang and the poetic moments were so tender and emotional wow","1228":"one of the finest books i've ever read","1229":"this book sucked me in and made me care deeply about the narrator and her family i felt their losses profoundly and toward the end i had to hurry to finish so that the suffering could end theirs and mine i did not realize until i finished that it was a fictionalized autobiography i did not know much about the khmer rouge before i started the book other than having some awareness that they were bad it has been quite an education this book is beautiful and heartbreaking it had me crying on the lightrail i highly recommend it but don't take it on when you are feeling fragile","1230":"this is an autobiographical novel about the cambodian holocaust it is being told from the memories of a 7 year old girl the beautiful prose and the innocence of that young child make the horror of the genocide by the khmer rouge more vivid and harrowing an unforgettable story in an unforgettable style","1231":"i found this book absolutely beautifully written i would of liked to have a little more historical content but one gets the sense of the torment suffered by the cambodian people during the khmer rouge revolution without turning the reader off the subject by being too graphic it is definitely a triumphant of spirit and life certainly enjoyable and eloquently written definitely recommend","1232":"any book that can make me cry is immediately 4 stars and this one had the extra sobs to make it 5 stars","1233":"that children can be wise is something of a surprise to the adult population age popular belief dictates is precursor to wisdom a necessary step without which that sort of elevated thinking and perspective is impossible to be fair there may be some truth to this but to forget that the age of numbers and the age of experience are vastly different things is a fallacy vaddey ratner's debut novel in the shadow of the banyan is a testament to the brand of naive wisdom that is characteristic to children and the power their perspectives hold at the age of seven young raami's world is destroyed by the force responsible for the destruction of cambodia in the mid to late 1970s the khmer rouge expelled from her childhood home in phnom penh raami and the rest of her royal family set out among the masses to take their place as citizens of the new democratic kampuchea in a time known as year zero when educated people are massacred and the rest of the population is put to work in labor camps across the countryside hiding their identities and seeking refuge whenever possible the family is carted forward through four years of brutal khmer rouge rule ripped and torn at every stage a polio survivor raami's physical deficiencies protect her for some time allowing her the chance to escape into a world of poetry and stories that occupied her active mind before the war as time goes on and the organization grows panicked any semblance of compassion is stamped out and even starving children are forced to work this is a tale of perseverance pain family and wisdom told through the eyes of the young raami the stories of starvation loss and forced labor are actually memories from ratner's childhood in cambodia using raami as a foil ratner shares versions of her own history injecting some adult perspective into the child's observations treating her protagonist with care and allowing her to harness the power of stories and legends to escape her reality that ability to remove herself from her immediate surroundings to see magic in the nature around her and to imagine that things aren't what they seem not only gives raami an unexpected perspective it saves her over four years raami ages more than can be imagined taking on a physical mental and emotional toll that seems practically unbearable and though her escapes into fantasy become less frequent their power is apparent in keeping her connected to a past worth honoring history and popular culture tell us that a child's perspective is not worth that of an elder's to those who subscribe to that belief i challenge you to read in the shadow of the banyan and then continue to think the same certainly raami's perspective is directed by an adult author but the thrill and fear of discovery the sense of imagination the willingness to believe that what she sees may not be reality-all this is wisdom packaged in a way to which we are not accustomed and through raami's changing perspective accelerated by four harsh years of firsthand experience we learn things about cambodia about history that we could never know otherwise check out the cardamom creme brulee recipe inspired by this book at paper plates","1234":" i loved this book because the language poetry imagery and myths gave beauty to a time of great sadness and destruction without ever minimizing the somber elements rather than changing the shape of the sadness vaddey added a layer of hope over the whole thing such that you could see the sadness for what it was but then also see something over it it's hard to explain the story is about a young princess's journey as she and her family face the harsh relocations and conditions under the khmer rouge regime in cambodia in 1975 i knew absolutely nothing about what happened other than that it did happen and that it was brutal i didn't learn too much about the historical events and happenings but i learned much about vaddey's own experience the mythology she adds only made me fall in love with the book more because when you read and hear a lot of stories it only makes sense to refer back to them when you meet something unfamiliar in life her reliance and constant returning to her childhood tales made perfect sense to me in this context although others have commented on it with slight negativity i liked that she focused so much on the early days that's when your memory of the separation the trauma and the heartbreak is at its clearest once you have been subjected to those things for a long period of time it only makes sense that the days start blending into each other with days going slowly but months passing quickly memory blurs you become numb and things just start to get muddled up overall it was a fantastic read and so so beautiful if you eat words like ice cream read this book","1235":"so beautiful and sad this one will stay with me for a long time","1236":"although this book is essentially about the same thing as lulu in the sky by loung ung it couldn't be more different both books describe what it was like in cambodia when the khmer rouge took over but the similarity ends there both authors were a similar age and both saw the starvation and depravation of those years as well as deaths disappearances of family members but loung ung was trained as a child soldier this book is more poetic and beautifully written therefore a slower read","1237":"slow at first because details were focused on too simple random things yet written beautifully narrated by a 7 year old who matured both through the story in her atrocious experience escaping the khmer rouge and as the writer's voice matured and the book improved a beautifully written journey worth reading to know the power of the human spirit strength of hope and demand for empathy","1238":"a beautifully written heart wrenching tale told through the eyes of a young cambodian girl as she and her family experience the deadly political uprising of the khmer rouge the language used by the author is breathtaking and raami's story of strength and survival will break your heart","1239":"what can you say about a book like this wow ms ratner you blew my socks off the horrors in this book were unbelievably heinous it is difficult for any sane person to believe another human could be so inhumane unfortunately it happens all the time the writing is like an absolutely beautiful but mournful song i could not help but cry my way through it the father's bravery and honour the mother's stoicism the uncle's bravery all made me weep i was so humbled to read of their suffering","1240":"girl and her mother fought to survive when communists aka the khmer rouge overtook cambodia in the mid 1970's the story of the ill treatment and genocide in cambodia was very moving and sad the writing was good as well but i never felt a rich connection to the characters and i'm sad to admit that at times i felt like i was forcing myself to finish it","1241":"really wanted to give this a 3 5 a little slow and too many word but an interesting topic and made me want to learn more about cambodia appreciated that it was somewhat based on someone's life experience","1242":"excellent though disturbing also can't believe how oblivious i was when all of this was taking place","1243":"3 5 stars beautifully written about a horrific time i started the book listening to it on cd but had to quit as it was terrible to listen to way too slow and just boring once i picked up the book i was drawn right into the story and the poetic writing the most moving part to me was with pok and mae i love the idea of loving someone you did not expect to love","1244":"as i read the book i could only found myself question the actions of raami's father and being stuck on the folklore connection to what the main character is going through when i first picked up the book i was not really sure what to expect form the first few pages from talking about milk mothers to a grandmother being a queen it was very confusing to understand at first but as you read it began to become more clear who ever one was and why they were in the book even though i will admit that i did not know if raami was at first a boy or a girl i soon realized that was just a small thing compared to the rest of the events in the book raami makes several connects to the mythology of the culture and in my opinion that was a great add on by author ti can honestly say that i did find the reading interesting but as i read i kept finding myself being reminded that the book is a novel therefore some of the vents in the book were made up form what the author remembered for me personally i found it hard to get emotionally attached to the book because some of it was made up it was being told a dram and called a \"true\" story i am not saying that the events in the story were not emotional and that i did feel saddened by somethings but at the end of the day i still felt like a true story will always beat a novel","1245":"i accidently found this book without knowing what it was about the result of an e book download without a cover image or description it was on my kindle and i decided to just read a few pages to see what it was about almost immediately i was pulled into the novel the author writes from the voice of a child but with an adult awareness of suffering change and hope i highly recommend this book to anyone who loves to become immersed in experiencing a tale to the extent that you stay awake for hours just to find out what happens next i do not wish to give away the plot but i will say that as soon as i had finished reading the book i immediately googled the topic to read about the real life foundation of this novel","1246":"due back to the library with no renewals available just not interesting enough to keep me reading i am returning half way through","1247":" this book tells an important and heartbreaking story of the khamer rouge takeover of cambodia and the effect on one small girl and her family the narrative style made me feel quite distant from the characters throughout much of the book on the one hand this made the horrors more bearable on the other hand i never connected with these characters the way i felt i should have the narrator for the audiobook version was unmemorable not horrible but also not particularly noteworthy perhaps i'd have enjoyed what seemed to be elegant writing more if i'd read this in print","1248":"beautifully written ultimately a book about the power of stories and the power of hope a very personal read for me helped me to more fully understand the history of some cambodian refugees that i have had the honor to befriend","1249":" so i'm not sure i could give this whole book 4 stars the last 100 pages are definitely 4 stars but maybe i just didn't read the first 200 pages consistently i had no idea about this civil war in cambodia it amazes me even though this was fiction based on author's life what people have gone through in other countries to survive in coux war tragedy etc overall i really enjoyed this book despite a very tough subject matter it was definitely slow going the first 100 pages but the ending touches me and how much grit and determination of a 7 year old girl","1250":"this is a disturbing and beautifully written story of the khmer rouge era in cambodia it gave me new insights into the lives of cambodians in my adult esl classes some of them lived through it and some were born later but are more than aware of it it's horrific","1251":"so lyrical beautifully written i actually stopped reading to highlight passages","1252":"a beautiful telling of a very tragic story i appreciated seeing this told through the eyes of a child","1253":"beautifully written amazing story","1254":"maybe i expected too much based upon the reviews but i found this to be shallow and dull i put it down and may pick it up again maybe","1255":"a moving and beautiful autobiographical novel set during the tyranny of the khmer rouge the author was a little girl when her world turned upside down the intervening years have allowed her to create an elegant fictionalization reminiscent of khaled hosseini's work","1256":" this beautifully written poetic book is the fictionalized history of the author's experiences surviving the khmer rouge and eventually escaping from cambodia although she did eventually escape the story is mainly about her experiences during the terror of the khmer rouge's atrocities while i found this book beautifully written it didn't ring true as the story told by a seven to nine year old it was told in the language of an extremely articulate adult nevertheless the book is well worth reading","1257":"i don't know exactly why this book didn't move me but it didn't perhaps it was the seemingly endless descriptions of the landscape i also found it repetitive i feel bad as the story is certainly horrific and the writer clearly overcame huge odds to endure tragedy in her family and her nation","1258":"wow what makes this story so powerful is the true background and it being somewhat true from the author herself","1259":"i had wanted to read this book because the reviews i had seen were all positives and i have a fascination with viet nam and its history the second half of the book was certainly better than the first the beginning story moved slowly however the language throughout was lyrically beautiful the books message that hope and love will elevate us in all situations overshadowed the atrocities that people commit against each other","1260":"exquisite a beautifully told story of hope and love","1261":" this is not an easy book to read due to its very serious content however the message of hope and survival in the midst of devastating evil is too important to ignore told from the perspective of a child of the cambodian royal family in the shadow of the banyan tells of the atrocities imposed by the khmer rouge from 1975 until they were driven out by the vietnamese army in 1979 it is the story of the extermination of a significant portion of the cambodian people in the name of revolution vaddey ratner's novel is essentially her own life story told in beautiful poetic language and steeped in the traditional stories of her people her losses were excruciating and yet she has managed to tell her story without being overly graphic as readers we see her narrator grow from childish innocence to wisdom beyond her years as she clings to the stories and poetry told to her by her father for inspiration he meant to give her wings her survival attests to his success this is an important book for anyone interested in southeast asia for readers of historical fiction and anyone who enjoys reading stories of people rising above adversity","1262":"this is a beautiful book i listened to it and the narrator was excellent this is a book i shall return to again and again","1263":"the author's brilliant lyrical writing makes this heartbreaking historical tale one ill never forget","1264":"a truly gripping and emotional story about survival during systematic genocide in cambodia during the khmer rouge this book was hard to read and hard to put down because of the inspiration of survival","1265":"beautifully written heartbreaking story of a family living in cambodia during the mid seventies during the khmer rouge revolutionary period i cried i loved the child's perspective and the relationship she had with her father i loved the story her father told her about the rabbit and the moon i will look at the full moon differently now i believe i identified with the main character in this story more than usual as i was in second grade and around the same age when i was aware my father was leaving to serve in vietnam i have vivid memories of this time in my childhood i live in a diverse metropolitan area near washington dc the author lives nearby this book is a reminder that you just never know the full extent of someone's life experiences be kind to each other","1266":"personal story that chronicles atrocities committed by the khmer rouge regime in cambodia between 1975 and 1979 when an estimated two million people lost their lives","1267":"so beautifully written so sad","1268":"wow what a book amazing story about the incredible human being this book will put you through the emotional roller coaster which is why it is such a great read for someone who went through civil war as a child this book brings back a lot of memories your story is powerful thank you for sharing vaddey","1269":"incredibly beautiful and heart breaking highly recommended it doesn't take long ro realize that the little girl telling the story is the author amazing that this woman now lived to see today when most of us would have given up","1270":"this book is fiction but it tells the authors story of her struggle to survive under the khmer rouge it is hearbreaking eye opening and tear jerking the story is very well told and a story that needs to be told one of the best books i have read","1271":"i feel like in america the nazi holocaust is well taught however so many other genocides are never even mentioned i don't enjoy reading these stories but i feel they are vital to our understanding of other nations and of ourselves i appreciate therefore this novel written by vaddy ratner herself a survivor of the khmer rouge in the 1970's while this radical communist regime killed between 1 and 2 million camobodians this book is a very personal story of family and simple relationships told by a 7 year girl the novel recounts the life of cambodian royalty the fall of phnom phen and the subsequent struggle for survival of the many newly educated peasants it is heartbreaking and tender","1272":" what a novel if you are a fan of novels like the kite runner then this emotional rollercoaster is for you this part memoir and part novel tells of raami a young girl who is part of the cambodian royal family and her survival of what must have been 4 years of terror during the rule of the khmer rouge the author states that it cannot be claimed truly as a memoir as she was to young to fully trust her memories of her experiences regardless of this much of what happened to raami is truly believable and heartbreaking the reader laughs and more often cries with raami this poignant story will stay with me for a long time","1273":"this review has been hidden because it contains spoilers to view it click here it's the story of raami a princess whose world is torn asunder by the khmer rouge starting with the evacuation of phnom penh in 1975 raami suffers as her family is uprooted from their home her father is stripped away from her because she unknowingly told the kamaphibal his name and then her extended family is separated into its core units and shipped to the farthest reaches of the country's countryside life's experiences continue to become harsher for raami until there seems little poin it's the story of raami a princess whose world is torn asunder by the khmer rouge starting with the evacuation of phnom penh in 1975 raami suffers as her family is uprooted from their home her father is stripped away from her because she unknowingly told the kamaphibal his name and then her extended family is separated into its core units and shipped to the farthest reaches of the country's countryside life's experiences continue to become harsher for raami until there seems little point in living but both raami and her mama choose life and continue to struggle to survive what's heartbreaking about raami's tale is that is starts off full of love life and poetry even as her family starts its exodus into anonymity the prose and descriptions describe a beautiful country side motorized trucks carry loads of city dwellers into country areas via roadways lit with flame trees but as raami sees years pass and deaths pile up the beauty of the world seem to get drowned in absurd cruelty the beauty and and reverence shown to the buddhist temple that serves as a temporary residence gives way to the peasant hut that serves as raami's next home this is in turn replaced by communal houses where all the undesirables sleep when they are not being forced to labor the world became dry and parched filled with labor raami becomes mute surviving by not speaking and not saying something to aggravate the kamaphibal there is no beauty left for her to wonder over there is only survival i'm torn on what i think of this book it's beginning with joy and life followed by descent into despair and suffering isn't exactly a refreshing read i started out thinking it could be one of those beauty in hardship stories but the hardship never ceased the burdens only became heavier and the beauty stopped showing up it became a tearjerker to continue listening it was also difficult to listen to the narrator since the audio job was horrible the tracks were three minutes in length to so you wouldn't have to sit through a large portion of the story again if you stopped the disk in the middle of a track the editing was atrocious there was a pause at the start of each track this created the impression that there was an intentional break in the narrative every three minutes such as a scene change or new chapter but it wasn't it was just bad editing that detracted from the listening experience i couldn't decide how to rate the book on goodreads i want to give it three out of five stars for the first half but the second half loses the poetry of beauty that the first has and i feel two stars is better this was my first thought upon finishing the book but as a little time has passed i feel three stars is better overall the second half of the book is more eloquently explained by ligaya mishan in the new york times review quote as a work of fiction \"in the shadow of the banyan\" is less a testament to atrocity than a reconciliation with the past at one point raami's nanny tells her that stories \"are like footpaths of the gods they lead us back and forth across time and space and connect us to the entire universe \" what is remarkable and honorable here is the absence of anger and the capacity -- seemingly infinite -- for empathy quote mishan's referral to the novel as a work of fiction brings up another important aspect the novel is based on a trues story rattner has fictionalized her own life she was a cambodian princess and lost nearly everything in the khmer rouge's purges the afterward read by rattner is very moving she dedicated the work to everyone who did not survive the khmer rouge's reign and i like how she decided not to do creative nonfiction such as angela's ashes or she's not there since creative nonfiction changes the sequence of events and people involved to maintain the flavor of the story rattner's tale is all the better for acknowledging that she isn't altering her history in memoirs i am grateful for that the story reminds me of a mash up of 1984 by orwell the behavior of the governing kamaphibal and the concentration camps of the holocaust such as shown in schindler's list a very sad combination there will only be so many of us left as can stand in the shadow of a banyan tree this statement is said by grandmother queen as raami's family is evicted from their home it gave raami a feeling of security since the banyan in their garden was large and a symbol of broad strength it's only after her family is diminished that the prophecy includes all of cambodia not just raami's family the book cover does a nice job of capturing this feeling the cambodia before it's killing field days and it's time under the khmer rouge the banyan growing through the center casts it's shadow over raami and mama the only two survivors from raami's pre kamaphibal word their silhouettes are in red both for the symbol of blood and life and for the khmer rouge communists that created the cambodia raami experiences the birds are raami and her papa two souls given wings by stories and the ground also in read looks like the clothing seen in sampot the traditional cambodian clothing item end result i'm glad i listened to it but it's not on my list of books to purchase so as to have my own copy more","1274":"beautiful and haunting","1275":"this is a mesmerizing book it took me so long to read because i wanted to savor every word despite the fact that it was very heart wrenching to read in many areas the writing is beautiful and everyone who is remotely interested in cambodia's khmer rouge should read this book i feel like i know every character you love the people an amazing story you will not be disappointed at all won from goodreads","1276":"this book is so beautifully written that i didn't want the story to end 4 1 2 stars ms ratner's writing pulled me in to this fictionalized version of her life and would not let me go","1277":" i like it when fiction can introduce me to a part of the world about which i know very little the story of the rouge khmer was certainly new to me i know enough about pol pot to answer a trivial pursuit question or two but these atrocities were certainly left out of my education the story itself was interesting and told in a straight forward manner i struggled to believe the narrator was a 7 year old girl throughout but given the things she went through perhaps she matured faster than average perhaps because i knew this was going to be a sad story i kept the characters at a distance and tried not to get attached or maybe they were not as well developed as i would have liked i am glad i read this and am looking forward to hearing this author speak in september","1278":" this was a difficult book for me to read as death is everywhere the fact that the story is what the author actually went through was a message to me that our love of family and heritage is ever present and can keep people going under many difficult circumstances the characters were well developed and you feel what each one goes through as they are taken from familiar surroundings to worse situations and then to even worse situations unbelieveable how people can treat one another my heart broke for each person and yet felt strong for them as they endured if you are interested in cambodia and the political situation there in the 1970s this is an excellent source","1279":" this book was recommended to me by a good friend i read it knowing thanks to the author's note that it is largely autobiographical though she changed the names of most characters except for her father what she narrates is a horrible part of the history of cambodia when it was taken over by the khmer rouge subjecting everyone but themselves to one of two fates death or slave labor most of ratner's family including her father were killed but she and her mother escaped to thailand after the vietnamese army overran cambodia and conquered it the issue the writing is autobiographical but it is styled as a novel competing idioms that never resolved themselves in my view i would rather for what it's worth she had written it as an autobiography straight out but said she was changing the names of the characters still worth a read","1280":"loved this book extremely well written heart wrenchingly sad but fervently hopeful and resilient","1281":"painful moving beautiful thank you moira cullen for sharing this gem with me","1282":"this a well written book about cambodia and the internal war and what the khmer rouge did to their own people as a westerner i did not pay much attention in the 70s to what was going on in the world sometimes ignorance as a youth is bliss","1283":"great book told from the eyes of an 8 year old girl about the communist regime in cambodia in the late 70's and it's destructive attempt to remake society killing millions of people","1284":"a beautifully written piece filled with despair and horror heartbreaking yet hopeful","1285":"writing a book with so much grace and charm about phnom penh cambodia during their civil war is no easy task but it is a beautiful book","1286":"this is a tough book to read so much sadness however it is a great history lesson on a subject i did not know much about","1287":" this memoir written as novel chronicled the author's four years as a young child 1975 to 1979 during the reign of terror of the brutal khmer rouge regime for the cambodian people it was their own holocaust as they experienced unspeakable horrors at the hands of these so called revolutionaries and close to 1 3 of the entire population was murdered or died of starvation just as with the american liberators of the concentration camps of europe the vietnamese who rescued them could not believe the skeletal condition of the survivors of the khmer rouge occupation the royal sisowath family is one of many intellectual families targeted as undesirable by the regime whose insane purpose is to root out people at all levels of education learning religion and social strata and destroy them the sisowath's journey and loss through long years of deprivation and suffering is a testament to the inner strength and resilience of its remaining family members and a tribute to the patriarch of the family who led by such moral example told in first person by raami the main character this beautiful heartbreaking book would be worth reading just for the quality of the writing but i learned so much about an era and a country of which i knew almost nothing and that was invaluable to me","1288":"interesting although heartbreaking i love historical novels so thoroughly enjoyed that aspect","1289":" at first i found the book a bit slow i had read better written fiction and non fiction about the topic it picked up after about 100 pages and really sparked a great deal of emotion questions to ponder how does storytelling help us all cope in times of hardship are the stories told by her parents what keeps the girl alive and gives her strength through out the book yet again i find it extraordinary the lengths a mother will go through to keep her children alive we see the mother as a wealthy almost weak character in the beginning yet she is the complete opposite it always amazes me the strength women have to survive also ponders the questions as children do we love one parent more than the other as parents to we love one child more than the others a beautiful tribute to the author's father","1290":" this was such a difficult book to begin reading because based on the subject matter i knew it'd be sad raami is seven years old when the khmer rouge come to power in cambodia her father's from a royal line which makes them targets for the revolutionaries and although raami doesn't fully understand what's going on around her she narrates everything she sees and experiences trying to make sense of the world and struggling to survive as violence and turmoil everywhere increases the first few chapters were a little slow simply because they set the stage for the rest of the book but once chaos breaks out in the world the book became so riveting i did not want to put it down despite its increasingly horrible events having such a young girl for a narrator made this book have a bigger impact and seem more insightful overall the same way raami struggled to make sense of what her world was coming to i struggled to understand why such terrible events actually happened especially knowing that the story was based on the author's actual experience some of the narration made raami seem wiser than her age but i think this illustrated how quickly she was being forced to grow up and how the world was shaping her understanding this book could have been completely and utterly depressing and on its own it was exactly that however the author somehow managed to make this story more than just a depiction of the atrocities committed by the khmer rouge and how awful everyday life became instead this is a story with glimmers of hope throughout i loved small revelations such as when raami realizes that she didn't miss a book she had to leave behind it was clear to me now that while books could be torn and burned the stories they held needn't be lost or forgotten trying to keep safe raami's family transformed into peasants attempting to hide their royal lineage and even then they were still in constant fear after a while it almost became less about why chaos and violence ruled and more about the fact that this was just the way things were it amazed me that despite the everyday atrocities despite the fact that there seemed to be no end to violence and hardship the characters still fought to survive as life tried to beat all hope and light out of them raami's mother reminded her that they are more than the lives they'd been forced into this made raami realize that they were anchored to solid ground only by a flimsy thread of self knowledge this faint notion that once we had been more that there had been more to ourselves besides loss i loved the way the author portrayed their fight for survival and their hopes for the future feeling like they were never truly alone this is not the kind of book i'd want to reread in the near future the subject matter is so heavy but i'm really glad i read it and think it's the sort of book everyone should read somehow despite the depressing background the story itself is uplifting it's also eye opening and astounding to read about what so many people the author included must have gone through on a daily basis under the khmer rouge this book would be excellent as required reading in school or in book club discussions the story is one that will stick with me what an amazing book in so many ways i received a free advanced copy of this book through the first reads program","1291":"this review has been hidden because it contains spoilers to view it click here a beautifully written semi autobiographical book about a young girls life during the atrocities of the khmer rouge the book reads as a fictional memoir of her father and her family who perished during the story however the book is not just about despair but of love and survival hope and sacrifice the storytelling is well done","1292":" in the shadow of the banyan by vaddey ratner4 stars \"we are all capable of extraordinary beauty if we dare to dream \"in this autobiographical work ratner recounts the tale of her family's ordeal during the immediate aftermath of the khmer rouge reign of terror in cambodia between 1975 1979 raami the narrator is seven years old when the black clad soldiers force everyone to evacuate their homes constantly relocate the country's residents throughout the country and suppresses them under forced labor through unimaginable horrors since they are one of the royal blood lines the family attempts to blend into the crowd however once they are discovered raami's father sacrifices himself in order to give the rest of the family a chance at survival i really wanted to give this work 5 stars and it did completely absorb and move me raami's story will stay with me long after i've moved on to other reads the writing is beautiful and haunting at once with a mystical undertone having lived it personally ratner vividly describes the atrocities that occur under a communist revolution not only the initial upheaval but what it takes to break the individual for \"the good of the collective\" what was particularly important to this narrative was the attempted destruction of the concept of the family unit - children don't belong to parents they belong to the community although it is a secondary theme i think the distinction ratner draws between those drawn to the cause by ideology an honest desire for everyone's needs to be met versus those that ultimately emerge with power deserves credit while i don't share the dream i can understand the attractiveness of a utopian society to some however as ratner illustrates history bears out the same results and impacts of those attempts while the history is eye opening and presented well there are some timeless themes anyone can appreciate the most moving is the love of parents for their children the relationship raami has with both of her parents is absolutely moving her relationship with her dad is one any girl would crave and her mother's fierce determination to protect and heal is moving i also appreciated the insight into traditions of buddhism there is one reason i simply couldn't award the final star i kept thinking the story should have been told from a different narrator raami comes across as entirely too precocious for her age and it really disturbed the flow of the story about the time i would get lost in the lyrical narrative raami would have an observation like \"to my left a dung beetle buzzed with the aplomb of a seaplane \" her observations and vocabulary was just far too advanced for a seven year old for credibility i also don't think this work is for everyone the plot does not drive this book that combined with the narrator challenge will drive some of you crazy but it is a beautiful and harrowing story and ends up being a wonderful tribute to the author's father","1293":"a novelized tribute to ratner's father and family as they struggled to survive the communist takeover of cambodia although it is a story of tragedy it also through its writing is a story of courage and rebirth and a testament to the human spirit the writing is both poetic and beautiful the book is the best novel that i have read this year and is truly a modern classic in my opinion it is also a worthy tribute to ms ratner's family and friends that she lost over that painful time","1294":"good book but not great she tells a good story and i learned a lot about the khmer rouge's take over of cambodia but i kept waiting for the big moment the story kept slowly building and getting more depressing but there was never a big moment to really make the book great","1295":" i finished this on audio in july or early august i loved it but didn't feel like i got to savor the beautiful writing enough by listening to it so i had to actually read it this is a work of fiction but it is basically the author's story of life under the khmer rouge in cambodia 1975 1979 it was told on a very personal level not from a broad historical perspective the story is very moving but the best thing about it was how beautifully it was written i loved it i marked up passages that i liked like i always do in non fiction books i loved the author's note and the interview questions with her at the end she is amazing","1296":"it sends chills through me when i think about the atrocities committed by the khmer rouge when they gained control in cambodia in 1975 vaddey ratner wrote a fictional story that was based on her family's actual experiences raami was a seven year old girl living a life of privilege as the daughter of a prince her father was a poet who loved telling her traditional fables which emotionally helped her after she had polio as a one year old her father told raami when i thought you couldn't walk i wanted to make sure you could fly the story starts off slowly as it shows the family's life as royals there was mass confusion when the khmer rouge came into power and intellectuals and royals were marked for extermination the khmer rouge forced people out of their homes they were sent to work in the rice paddies or off to dig earth and stones to form huge dams to hold back the water from the monsoons the people were starved tortured and killed the survivors were dealing with the grief of losing their loved ones the story of raami's family keeps picking up pace and increasing in terror until raami is mute and near starvation before they finally escape the author was only five years old in 1975 and she escaped into thailand four years later with her mother they arrived in the united states in 1981 and she became a high achieving student vaddey ratner writes in a beautiful lyrical manner it must have taken great courage to relive this experience in her mind as she was writing this book","1297":"more reviews and no fluff on the blog http surrealtalvi wordpress com this is a beautifully written novel on a very hard subject at times i wanted to both laugh and cry the mark of a truly well written book the images from the story will haunt you but perhaps that is what we need to remember and never forgot the atrocities that are still being committed in the 20th century","1298":"this is the story of young raami a 7 year old girl living in phnom penh the capitol of cambodia her father is a royal prince and the family is accustomied to luxury and ease when civil war breaks out the family is forced to flee their home and head towards the country rebel soldiers order them to leave all of their belongings and say goodbye to life as they know it the organization needs them to work together to make the country strong as the family is separated raami struggles with her place crippled by polio as an infant she is not seen as a strong worker her parents attempt to hide the fact that they are royal descendants in order to protect the family but the khmer rouge red army is determined to make everyone contribute years of captivity slave labor and near starvation make raami's childhood a nightmare no child should have to live through ratner herself grew up in cambodia and says raami's story parallels her own in many ways a disturbing yet eloquent look at the killing fields and how a communist uprising destroyed life for millions of people","1299":"amazingly well written which almost felt at times like reading poetry a very harsh story that most of the western world has already forgotten but is worth remembering","1300":"remarkable story beautifully written u0026amp heart wrenching be sure to read the author's note","1301":"i loved loved loved this book it is impossibly beautiful and while the elequonce of the poetic prose fills your heart with joy the unimaginable horror of the senseless and sickening violence that serve as the backdrop for the story will rip your heart into shreds amidst the hopelessness and fear this novel delivers a beautiful message about family motherhood unconditional love and the strength of the human spirit i didn't realize until the end that the author presented this book as a fictionalized autobiography and she had actually escaped the horrors of the khmer rouge and its killing fields","1302":"beautifully written descriptions of cambodia in the time of khmer rouge taken from authors own experience and escape to america","1303":"the story was compelling and the writing beautiful","1304":"incredible story","1305":"wonderful heartbreaking i kept wishing it to end to stop crying","1306":"i lack the words to do justice to this book i was moved beyond description by the power in this story the characters are powerful the prose is stunning in it's simplicity and clarity and the gut wrenching sadness in this story left me sobbing at times but through it all the spirit and the ability to see the beauty in life to fly and soar even with clipped wings left me in awe not a light read but definitely an illuminating one a must must read","1307":"lost interest in this i quit reading it","1308":"one of the best books i have read in a long time this book literally had me crying so sad in so many places and yet still hopeful beautifully written descriptions i could almost feel like i was there i can not suggest this book highly enough","1309":"i loved the insight into cambodian society my daughter was born in cambodia and i have read so much about the horrors of the recent past it was a welcome relief to read more about the culture and learn of the loss of an entire way of life that was serene and beautiful the author is a true hero to me and i thank her for reliving this terrible time to bring us her story","1310":"since becoming a parent i have sometimes thought books and movies that depict children being hurt or killed should have a warning label but if that we're the case i would not have read this book and i'm glad i did this book is so beautiful it is hard to believe it is mostly true and yet it depicts events do horrific that it is hard to believe they too are mostly true worth the pain","1311":"this book was very tough in the beginning to get into because of all the historical events of which i was not familiar with so because of that i had to do a little background reading on it once i got into it i became totally enthrall end with this story which is more like a work of fact than fiction wow it was pretty heart wrenching and beautiful all at the same time well worth the read","1312":"i was in love with this book right after i finished reading the first page a very rare occasion i have read so many books related to war and turbulent times but nothing comes close to being as poetic as the words of vaddey ratner this is one book i shall keep coming back to again and again trying to find a different silhouette to the sunset of the words and all the magic","1313":" this story is told from the author's experiences during the time of the cambodian killing fields her father was actually royalty in the cambodia she chose to tell the story through the perspective of a seven year old girl whose very comfortable and happy childhood is shattered when the revolutionary forces force them from their home over the next four years she endures the deaths of family members including her beloved father starvation and brutal forced labor raami clings to the only remaining vestige of childhood the mythical legends and poems told to her by her father her mother struggles with her losses and attempts to help raami and her survive the author has an extraordinary gift for language it is a brilliantly wrought tale of human resilience","1314":"wow what a beautifully written story the thoughts of the main character are so deep and moving it's so easy to forget that it's a child speaking the whole time the descriptions of even the littlest things are so perfectly written and the flow of the story is entirely captivating","1315":"semi autobiographical book about the author's experience during the khmer rouge's reign over cambodia and the horrible treatment suffered by the citizens of that country during their rule beautiful story of family love and sacrifice","1316":" this was a very well written book the author has a gift for beautiful descriptions and for making the characters seem so real which is extremely important and helpful when dealing with a culture so foreign to our own experiences however it is also a very hard book to read emotionally it follows the experiences of raami a girl who is 7 when communists take over her country cambodia in 1975 the people there experience 4 years of hell on earth this is history i never was taught about in school fortunately the ending brings happiness of a sort after the atrocities they experienced i definitely recommend this book to anyone who enjoys history well written literature and stories of the amazing enduring human spirit","1317":"some history i had never learned about not a happy book but a very very good one","1318":"this is another book to make you wonder how much evil can exist in one place i didn't know anything about the cambodian war so learned a lot i took me a while to read because it was very emotional and i had to take a couple of breaks but the story is told very well","1319":"this book is beautifully written captivating haunting and profoundly depressing it's an astounding story and is truly a powerful writing feat in harnessing so many emotions it's an extremely sad book that keeps getting sadder in ratner's words sad was too small a word and it really is","1320":" i did not learn anything about history in school with the exception of the civil war and some made up story about the discovery of the americas i have had to learn everything as an adult through historical novels biographies documentaries conversations with my husband and plenty of wikipedia searches i knew nothing about khmer rouge before i picked up this book a chapter in i asked my husband what he knew and was impressed by his answer but also how much it clarified what i was reading the author does explain more as the book goes on if you know nothing going in all will be revealed as events unfold this book is devastating and full of heart i cried i was stupefied by the senselessness of it all i cannot believe the horrors we can inflict upon one another often the result of a nugget of good intentions i am continually shocked by the horrors that have happened that continue to happen in our lifetime i cannot ask much more of a book than to make me understand something new through strong feelings and thoughts i will definitely be seeking out more books on this moment in time","1321":"i downloaded this for free from book blurb although it was horrific it was a great book based on the author's own life it is the story of a special young girl during the kymer rouge era in cambodia a very graphic picture of what happens when a country is overtaken by a bunch of young thugs i loved the main character raami a seven year old cambodia princess who goes through hell","1322":" this book depicts vaddey ratner's fictionalised account of her own experiences living through the khmer rouge genocide in cambodia from 1975 to 1979 the story's narrator is seven year old raami who is in essence portraying the author herself raami and her royal family's happy sheltered lifestyle is thrown into chaos when one afternoon the khmer rouge swarms into pnomh penh and forces everyone out on the streets over the next four years raami witnesses the khmer rouge stripping people of every shred of identity with systematic violence starvation and forced labour the khmer rouge or revolutionary soldiers' as they like to call themselves are attempting to bring in a new cambodia kampuchea focusing on a purely agrarian society the people are forced to become farmers in labour camps working all day long without adequate rest or food all around raami witnesses death and starvation she is once so hungry she wishes she could find a scorpion to eat as she begins to lose her family members one by one the soldiers are forcing people to purge their minds and forget their history but all raami can do is to cling to her childhood to the many mythical stories and legends and poems told to her by her father amidst terrible suffering near starvation and loss raami fights for survival the prose is beautiful and raami's journey is described with such exquisite detail that i could picture the scenery quite clearly in my mind her father's poems and stories are shared with the reader and are a joy to read my one grouse with the book is that i could often not wrap my head around a 7 year old using such eloquent prose for e g i pretended not to hear her resting my chin on the carved railing of the balcony a tiny pale pink butterfly with wings as delicate as bougainvillea petals flew up from the gardens below and landed on the railing near my face i stilled myself it heaved as if exhausted from its long flight its wings opening and closing like a pair of fans waving away the morning heat hard to imagine a 7 year old child saying that isn't it i found some parts to be too prolonged with almost moment by moment details in some places as a novel it may or may not work for readers but as a story it is one i feel more people should know","1323":"animals are not like people if you leave them alone they won't hurt you but people will even if you've done no wrong they hurt you with their guns their words their lies and broken promises their sorrow","1324":"this was a beautifully written story about a horrible period in history for cambodia the narrative is told through the eyes of an 8 year old girl whose family is torn from there home and sent to the camps in the country the author was 5 when she and her family were sent away by the khmer rouge though the story is not a happy one it is full of hope and poetry","1325":"this was a hard book for me to finish really well written but as one reviewer wrote i did not realize so much sadness and pain could exist in such a small country","1326":" in a word vaddey ratner's debut novel in the shadow of the banyan is gorgeous it is one of the most lyrical titles i have ever read although this novel portrays an incredibly difficult subject the rise of the khmer rouge and the genocide of between 1 and 2 million cambodians ratner's extraordinary gift for language makes this book not only accessible but a must read based on ratner's own experience as a 5 year old cambodian when the khmer rouge came to power this novel explores the depths of despair and unspeakable horrors she witnessed during this coup for seven year old rammi the shattering of her childhood begins when her father returns home telling of the civil war that has overtaken phnom penh cambodia's capital soon the family's life of royal privilege is swept up in the chaos of revolution and forced exodus over the next four years of the war the khmer rouge attempt to strip all individual and familial identity from the populace raami struggles to keep what little childhood she remembers through the legends and poems told to her by her father in this climate of systematic violence raami fights to the end for her survival a truly amazing story told in vivid masterful prose a must read","1327":"this is one of those books that it's almost impossible to say i really liked because it is so devastatingly sad the author fictionalized her cambodian childhood under the siege of the kmher rouge very talented author i believe she survived for this story to be written","1328":"really good lots of history about a battle i knew nothing about would recommend to anyone","1329":" after finishing this story told from the point of view of 7 year old princess raami i don't really feel i have adequate words to express the way the poetic and often lyrical words moved me as they described loving unbreakable family bonds as well as brutal unimaginable horrors suffered at the hands of khmer rouge captors and tormentors who told the cambodian people to keep you is no gain to kill you is no loss i can't find words to explain the width and depth of the horrors this little girl experienced and the kind of courage she and her mother clung to as they fought to stay alive while loved ones and strangers alike were murdered all around them raami and her mother were abused starved humiliated and each lost their fear of death as they were so filled with loss sorrow and exhaustion that they had little hope for a better day ahead yet there are jewels of hope in stories raami's father and later her mother tell her there are small treasures of joy found in unexpected kindnesses and this keeps the tragedy from completely overwhelming raami and her mother and the reader i would highly recommend this book to anyone who considered my opinion worth something","1330":"a horrifying history lesson and a poignant story of a loving family literally torn apart written from the perspective of a seven year old child but by an adult looking back it's always distressing to see how inhuman man can be so corrupt u0026amp irrational in such contrast to the beautiful family we saw at the beginning of the story","1331":"review originally posted on my blog http utahmomslife blogspot com 2012 in 1975 the khmer rouge the revolutionaries took control of the country of cambodia forcing people from their homes and into work camps over a million people were brutally murdered by the communists vaddey ratner takes her own personal experience as a child during this time and weaves it into a simultaneously beautiful and horrifying novel in the shadow of the banyan the narrator raami is a seven year old girl and the daughter of a royal prince and poet as her aunt says after they have been driven from their home by the conquering army the problem with being seven is that you're aware of so much and yet you understand so little so you imagine the worst raami does not have to imagine the worst the worst is bent on destroying her family and a country this is not just a tale it is the story of our shared human history our recent history a history that should be remembered so that it can be prevented in our future it should take it's proper place with we the living by ayn rand and dreams of joy by lisa see and other books that detail that tragedies that follow evil regimes intent on destroying liberty bringing her own experiences and pain into the story ratner excels at creating overwhelming scenes of emotion she writes with a passion that is rare and the intimate scenes that raami describes between her parents as they prepare to be separated are exquisite in their intense love and despair while tragic in the shadow of the banyan is also full of hope this novel will rip your heart out and then slowly put it back together just trust me on this one read in the shadow of the banyan by vaddey ratner as soon as possible","1332":"heartbreaking and lyrical","1333":" heartbreaking story about life under the khmer rouge in cambodia written from the point of view of a seven year old powerful lyrical writing and all the more poignant because it's based on the author's actual experiences yet it's fiction she takes us through the takeover and purge from phonem phen sp to the illogical and cruel relocation of people throughout the country then we learn of the systematic breaking up of families starvation and senseless murders by the organization my issues were it didn't always sound like it came from a seven year old that's okay it was deep but that conflict bothered me her vocabulary was astounding for example as well there wasn't much character interaction there was but there wasn't the girl raami was pretty much self contained and in a sort of bubble she worships a father who sacrifices himself for his family which is beautifully explained but there was a connection to the outer world that was missing perhaps this was because at that age she didn't have it there was some tangible quality that was missing however","1334":"this book moved me to tears several times and i can't remember the last time a book was so emotionally engaging","1335":"hoo boy as a recounting of the horrors the author experienced as a child and as a tribute to her father the book is well done as historical fiction also good as something enjoyable to read not so much","1336":"i didn't know anything about cambodia in the 1970's and found this book interesting and disheartening at the same time humanity without respect for humanity communism never works because humans are imperfect and greedy","1337":" if i could give this book more than five stars i would it is exquisitely written vaddey ratner gripped and surprised me with her magical weaving of words her ability to offer beauty humanity and hope even in the midst of ugliness inhumanity and despair even when her story provoked tears and sobbing and outrage she has achieved something quite amazing using her own lived experience woven with fiction she has lifted a curtain to show us not only the horrific suffering inflicted during the khmer rouge regime but also the wonder of human resilience the power of love and the miracle of the human imagination and the stories that keep us alive","1338":"very well done although this sort of fanciful writing style is a little lost on me hence the 3 stars instead of 4","1339":"this book is amazing exquisitely written evocative heartwrenching full of unspeakable horrors viewed through the prism of an innocent child a must read","1340":"absolutely beautifully written account of the khmer rouge regime and what they did to cambodia the tale of the little girl and her family was compelling and moving amazed at what the human spirit can endure and break free of","1341":"beautifully written absolutely transcendent a must read here are a few of my favorite lines ...stories are like footpaths of the gods they lead us back and forth across time and space and connect us to the entire universe to people and beings we never see but who we feel exist had i owned the words i would've told him what my heart intuited that joy and sorrow often travel the same road and sometimes whether by grace or misfortune they meet and become each other's companion","1342":"this was a beautifully written book thats contains horrific scenes of human suffering none of which were exaggerated we owe it to those that died to look upon this and not forget what happens when any ideology becomes radicalized the story is not all bleak though there is a catharsis of sorts they were the lucky ones","1343":"one of the best books if not the best i've read all year it tells the story of a seven year old girl and her experiences living in cambodia during pol pot's regime and the genocide that happened from 1975 79 based heavily on the author's own experiences as she lived through it from ages 5 9 despite the very heavy subject matter and difficult content the book was incredibly inspiring and beautifully written it's not a fast light or an easy read rather it's the type of book that leaves you chewing on each poetic phrase that lets you get inside the experiences and imagine what life must have been like for these people all the while showing a story not telling it's that vivid of the potential and power of humanity to find good in horrific things beautiful book i cannot recommend it highly enough","1344":" 3 5 stars this is a novel about the khmer rouge takeover in cambodia as written by a survivor who experienced the events as a five year old child she says in an interview following the story that she at first wanted to write a memoir but ended up writing a novel instead and this leads to the main problem with the book although the book is narrated by a seven year old it's written in an adult voice and this leads to a often present disconnect no seven year old would describe things as lyrically and with the adult reason present in her supposed narrative having an adult narrate the book might have been a better choice for that reason although i wouldn't read this book again it's a compelling and at times beautifully written book that lays bare some of the horrors of a civil war that is often forgotten in western history the family bonds and emotions of the characters in the story ring true and this lends a power to the book even with the too old narrative voice if you can emotionally handle a book on this subject matter i would probably recommend it","1345":"what a fantastic book wow","1346":" in 1975 the khmer rouge came to power in cambodia along with this power shift the entire population was forced to leave the cities to live as peasants but this regime was as brutal as its politics was wrong the author vaddey ratner was a young five year old girl from a noble family during this time in the shadow of the banyan is her story in novel form i'm sure i won't be the first to compare this book to first they killed my father by loung ung while the ung book is a harrowing memoir ratner's book takes us to another plane for despite the horror little raami's father the tiger prince attempts to soften these blows with love beauty and hope \"perhaps it's natural for a father for every parent to see in his child all that's unspoiled and good but if you can raami i want you to see it in yourself no matter what ugliness and destruction you may witness around you i want you always to believe that the tiniest glimpse of beauty here and there is a reflection of god's abode it is real raami there exists such a place such sacred space you have only to envision it to dare to dream it it is within you within all of us \" i was so touched by her characters and by their story it's not only a notable work for the history it portrays but more importantly it tells the story of humanity in the midst of cruelty and that hope is the wings that lifts us above despair","1347":"rereading this didn't detract from the beauty of the novel","1348":"an interesting story based on the author's own life experience but i found the writing style stilted and it failed to really engage me","1349":"extremely well written enjoyed the book very much even though it's a very sad story","1350":"i got in the shadow of the banyan as a first reads book it is an account from a child's eyes and in a chld's voice of the time period between the coming to power of the khmer rouge and the liberation of cambodia the accounts of cruel and or irrational acts are unflinching the reader will sympathize with the child's difficulty in learning the expected behavior required to survive and the difficulty in learning teh choices made by some of the adults she loves there are also accounts of the good people who helped each other when adn as best they could the story as told by the child contains always at least a some love and hope sometimes less and sometimes more that helps balance the cruelty and despair although this is fiction and not an autobiography it is based at least in part on the author's own experiences and journey during that time period","1351":" i have no original insight to add to the many reviews already posted here i agree that the writing is lyrical and beautiful although my generation is the one that fought and protested the war of the 60's i had never read a detailed account fiction or not of life in cambodia in that time it was not at all surprising to me that the book is a fictionalized telling of the author's own experiences i understand the frequently stated criticism that the writing and level of detail are not consistent with a 5 7 year old girl's ability to observe comprehend and catalogue such horrific persecution but i'm not sure i agree what seems less credible to me is that a child who experienced these horrors could mature into an adult who could compose such a beautiful and gripping work that decribes them","1352":"this was a beautifully written powerful book of surviving in a horrible situation well done","1353":"based on the author's experiences as a young child in the khmer rouge's cambodia in the 1970's this novel contrasts the worst in human behavior with the astonishing ability to dream of better times despite loss and starvation forced labor and wanton cruelty young raami never gives up her belief in the power of stories to save us the power of words as wings one thought and i wonder if any other readers had this reaction i really enjoyed reading this book although enjoyed is not quite the right word more accurately i appreciated reading it but i kept wondering about the author's decision to tell the entire story from the first person point of view of a child on the one hand the child's innocence balances the horror of the facts on the other hand i craved a more layered perspective a more complex telling i kept wishing odd as it may sound for a glimpse into the inner world of one of the khmer rouge organization believers but that's just me i guess i keep going back and forth between three stars and four three and a half","1354":" i feel like all i should say is read this book this is what i like to call an autobiographical work of fiction vaddey ratner is telling the story of a young girl in cambodia from 1975 1979 when the revolutionary khmer rouge takes over the country committing unimaginable acts of what basically resulted in genocide before reading this i had a very basic idea of what took place in cambodia after the u s 's portion of the war in vietnam i actually had no idea what truly happened ratner is telling much of the story of her family and what they went through at the hands of the organization using fictional characters and fictional prose but the experiences are very real it is hard to believe that these atrocities happened in my lifetime i never wanted to put this book down it tore my heart out many times reducing me to tears ratner's use of poetry prose and imagery are like music please get this book read it devour it learn from it","1355":"raami is just 7 years old when the horror that was the khmer rouge begins in her homeland cambodia when it ends she is barely 11 years old physically but years older emotionally raami's family is distantly related to the cambodian royal family which makes them instant targets of the regime as she watches her beloved family be obliterated raami has to find a way to stay alive and keep her soul intact","1356":"i loved this book it's absolutely heart breaking and beautiful at the same time","1357":"this is a beautifully written book fiction but based on the author's personal experience 4 1 2 it's lyrical even poetic at times it's about an 8 year old girl who is cambodian royalty but forced from her home as a result of the khmer rouge in the mid 70's she loses her security home way of life members of her family and comes to realize her strength","1358":"absolutely compelling ms ratner captures the voice of raami the young girl who is a heroine in every sense that common culture fails to recognize beautiful book has stayed with me","1359":"heartbreaking and beautiful this was a difficult but important read that will stay with me this 'biographical novel' is an amazing testament to the importance of bearing witness and giving voice to atrocity it is also a testimony to the unbelievable power of love and hope in the midst of unimaginable human suffering unflinching and lyrical stories within stories within stories","1360":"i love reading stories that bring to life countries u0026amp conflict within them i always learn something new about our world when i read these","1361":" for once the reviews on the book jacket are not overblown this really is an incredibly beautiful and moving book it tells the painful story of the khmer rouge genocide of the educated class in cambodia from the eyes of a young girl through her you experience the beauty and mystery of cambodia before everything fell apart and the descent into a living hell for her and her family it is often painful to read but it is also a story of the resilience of the human spirit and the importance of the love of family even when much of the family is gone i can't wait to read another book by ratner","1362":"one of the best books i have read i didn't know a thing about cambodian history could not put it down it is not an easy read because of the atrocities committed but it is really well written i highly recommend it","1363":"this book took me a really long time to get through because it's one of the most emotionally difficult reads i've ever attempted the two main reasons i continued on was the writing which was just heartbreakingly beautiful and haunting and just as the author wanted to give a voice to all those silenced by the khmer rouge regime i felt it important to bear witness to this part of history which i didn't know much about","1364":"this was not an easy read although it is fiction the story about the killing fields of cambodia is basically the author's own it is beautifully written","1365":"i so wanted to not like this book i wasn't mentally ready for another sob story of war and whining but despite myself or perhaps because it was exactly what i needed to put an end to my own sob story of household woe i loved it though a common complaint of the book was that the language was too flowery and too much for a 7 year old point of view i read it as a well educated royal with a poetically verbose voice overall it worked for me and i learned a lot about the khmer rouge movement in cambodia a war i'd not heard of before all in all it was great and helped me focus on the fact that my current set of problems really aren't","1366":"interesting to read about this period in cambodian history as i knew very little about it i found the novel a bit too poetic and overly filled with imagery for my personal reading preference but i could appreciate the art of capturing beauty in such ugly and horrible circumstances","1367":"for a child to experience such a horrible brutal situation is almost unimaginable i can see why the author chose to write it as fiction rather than autobiography it allowed her a little distance but the book never felt impersonal she does a great job of portraying the inner thoughts of the main character and her relationships with all the people she encounters as with other accounts of the horrors in cambodia this really made me curious about how one moves on with life afterwards","1368":"heart breaking beautiful story","1369":"beautifully written and a heart breaking story i enjoyed it but often found it difficult to stay with it","1370":" so i hate to not give this book a great review and i didn't even finish the book needed to be returned to the library and there are so many people in line to read it that i couldn't renew that being said i have no urge to run out and buy the book i am very interested in the subject matter when i was five years old my family took in a sixteen year old cambodian refugee his entire family had been killed and i couldn't begin to comprehend that as a kindergartener the subject matter is of course intense but i just didn't think it was a particularly well written book this is worth reading for the topic but not on literary merit alone","1371":"my book club loved this book i found it wordy in parts but a good read","1372":"really enjoyed this book what an incredible story of survival in cambodia during the reign of the khmer rouge","1373":"it had beautiful passages and was deeply tragic but overall there was something off in the pacing","1374":"very good book about cambodia","1375":"truly a heartwarming story of how a young girl survives loss and tragedy and through her father's stories discovers the value and meaning of life it is well written and an enjoyable read the story unfolds gently and unhurried the author did an amazing job of telling a depressing story and not depressing the reader","1376":" there will remain only so many of us as rest in the shadow of a banyan tree vaddey ratner chose to share the loss of her family and the torturous survival of her mother and herself through historical fiction rather than a memoir i did not realize this until i ended the book and read the authors note but as i was reading the novel a voice kept telling me this was written by someone who had experienced the heartbreak and terror shared in the novel this is not an easy book to read nor a happy book to read just as novels about the holocaust it reveals another holocaust that occurred in cambodia it also reveals the strength of the human spirit and its ability to triumph over unimaginable cruelty and still survive and flourish as ms ratner has i am amazed at her strength and accomplishments after such a tragic childhood","1377":" in the shadow of the banyan is a heartbreaking story of a minor royal cambodian family caught up the disastrous social engineering of the khmer rogue in the mid 1970's based partially on the experiences of ratner herself being only five years old at the time when the khmer rogue came to power this fictionalized account of the aristocracies and utter devastation of the cambodian people have suffered through is beyond understanding ratner has done a wonderful job of breathing life into a period of cambodia's darkest period chronicled from the perspective of a seven year old girl whose family is violently uprooted from their city home and forced to work in the country as part of the idealized agrarian society the regime believes will return cambodia back onto the right path she gives first hand account of the struggle to adapt to ever changing whims of \"organization \" the lose of a beloved father the separation of families starvation forced labor and what it's like living knowing that one step out of line the organization's ever changing rules results in torture in death the tension knowing that at any moment the life you have built and rebuilt could be destroyed because you are today's enemy must have been overwhelming and for much of the story there isn't a way out for this girl's family dark corrupt reality where death is all around them but the overwhelming will to survive for her and her mother if not for themselves than for all that they lost gives them a chance a to triumph over extreme adversity and make their escape ratner uses lines of poetry and flowery prose to create a serene atmosphere that is completely counter to devastation of the events taking place in the story this gives the story a real sense of buddhism a peacefulness that's hard to describe concerting the topic it can be surreal at times another thing i liked is the narrator a child is not the typical precocious child wise bound her years instead her account reads like that of a child forced to grow up by her circumstances it is a more adult like voice but i think this only adds to her lose of innocence and her childhood this is a beautifully written and heartbreaking account of the ugliness we humans can inflict on one another","1378":"evocative and sorrowful images of loss are juxtaposed with manifestations of hope in the form of spiritual connection folklore filial lessons and the love of a young child for her loss kin this powerful story is a testament to the wisdom of children children understand more than we know vaddey ratner shows the reader that children such as the protagonist that served as her proxy in this story have spiritual lives that thrive with profound vitality especially in times of great challenge and strife the resilience of memory remains even as great evil threatens to extinguish her physical and cognitive life her hope fashioner for her an upward trajectory even as her body wasted away in the oppressive environment of the khmer rouge regime in the shadow of the banyan is truly a transcendent and powerful tale","1379":"this book is a story of loss and hope although it is a fiction novel the events are based on history the author draws on personal experience it's an emotional journey but one worth taking","1380":"for seven year old raami the shattering end of childhood begins with the footsteps of her father returning home in the early dawn hours bringing details of the civil war that has overwhelmed the streets of phnom penh cambodia's capital soon the family's world of carefully guarded royal privilege is swept up in the chaos of revolution and forced exodus i highly recommend in spite of the horrors of war raami's love for and faith in her father keeps her always looking up","1381":"unbelievable that these things happen and we know so little about them very interesting story about cambodia","1382":"was an interesting read author's own experience during the khmer rouge brings out the pain of the characters","1383":"raami is a seven year old when the civil war which has overwhelmed the streets of phnom penh cambodia's capital infiltrates into her safe family life and her aristocratic world falls apart as her family struggle to stay together in a world gone mad raami is forced to witness to some of the worst atrocities and hardship for the most part raami's narrative is quite unemotional which somehow makes the violence and slaughter even harder to bear and yet there is an undeniable lyricism as she describes what is happening to those around her based on vaddey ratners own life this is not an easy book to read and i can't say i enjoyed it but what i can acknowledge is the author's undeniable skill in exposing a life made raw by violence and despair and yet revealing the magic that comes from poetry and legend i didn't know much about this troubled period in cambodia's history and though i have some recollection of the khmer rouge as perpetrators of great wrongdoing i was quite simply unprepared for the emotional effect that this story would have on me horrific in places and overwhelmingly sad this story takes some telling and yet in places the writing is so beautiful that for a brief moment the horror is overshadowed and the beauty of the human spirit shines brightly","1384":"beautifully written and a sad story told through the eyes of a young girl with hope underlying all","1385":"this is one of those books that you don't want to read but can't put down it's hard reading about people being treated so badly but i kept wanting to know how it's going to end i didn't realize until i finished the book that is was based on the author's true life story but she wrote it in fiction the author has a really nice writing syle even though she's writing about pain and injustice she has a calmness about her glad i read the book","1386":"in honor of international day of peace we're reviewing in the shadow of the banyon by vaddey ratner the atrocities committed by the khmer rouge in cambodia were not the first instance of man's inhumanity to man and sadly they haven't been the last that's why this semi autobiographical novel seems like such an appropriate choice for international day of peace it's the story of one family as seen through the eyes of a very special child it's a story of inhumanity but also the story of human beings' strength and determination even when faced with the worst adversity imaginable","1387":"this book does a good job of showing the struggle to live in the worst of situations seen from a child's point of view you never feel she lost some of the innocence of being a child it is a hard read though as many of the khamar rouge stories are","1388":" wow i am struck that this occurred while i was in jr high and high school and i really knew nothing about it and all i had to worry about was grades having a boyfriend and if i'd be voted a homecoming queen boy was i self centered we are really spoiled in america this book brings this home to me time and time again it reminded me a little of the good earth i like that the author chose historical fiction to share her story it is really horrific what happened to her and others just like sand castle girls this is another reminder of the cruelty of man against man","1389":"beautifully written","1390":"another one i'd award 4 5 stars if 5 stars were available beautifully written story about a little girl raami who lives in cambodia in the 1970s she is a princess her father is a prince of the royal family within the first chapter the khmer rouge takeover begins and it's not long before raami and her family are affected and on the run going in i knew this would not be a light hearted happy read and it's not but there are moments of joy and happiness in spite of terrible tragedy and sorrow the story follows what i have read about the cambodia genocide and raami's voice even as a child adds a perspective that made it hard to put this down be sure to read the author's note at the end","1391":"i loved this story sad as it is that it is based on the author's life why must these tragedies continue to happen","1392":"an absolutely gorgeous novel that reads like poetry about the communist revolution in cambodia during the late 70's the novel is written by a survivor of the violent revolution but it is not memoir although it parallels her story almost completely the descriptions of cambodia are incredibly rich and detailed painted a stunning picture especially against the backdrop of the senseless violence and tearing apart of families","1393":"i really wanted to like this book maybe it would have gotten better if i could have gotten through it it was painfully slow for me and after two weeks and only 80 pages i decided to move on to another book","1394":" told in simple direct language from the viewpoint of a young girl caught in the brutal chaos of the khmer rouge takeover of cambodia and loosely based on the author's own experience this book is a hauntingly beautiful tribute to the triumph of the human spirit against all odds reading it is not easy there are passages of such horrific atrocities that the images they invoked were seared into my mind and they are profoundly uncomfortable to have witnessed even through a story however this story is not only tragic but also a testimony to the resilience of the human spirit that love between parent and child between friends and even between strangers thrown together under cataclysmic events can engender","1395":"at the heart of this story its genocide committed by the khmer rouge between the years 1975 1979 through the eyes of a child the book had a spiritual feeling to it credit goes to the author by sharing the child's powerful connection she felt for her dad the dad's words lived as a part of the child's soul another book to read another time another war that i'd also recommend the sandcastle girls alappo syria 1915 its a page turning historical novel","1396":"i really like this book very different and a compelling and gripping story of true events parts were alittle slow but maybe just because of the continual hardships faced in the story worth the read for sure and great for book group","1397":" a depressing heart wrenching book about an organization the khmer rouge that ranks among the nazis soviet nkvd and chinese red guard in the most evil oppressive quasi state institutions of all time like the biography of anne frank this book does a great job of describing a sweeping horror through a very personal lens from which the reader can empathize interestingly although today pol pot shoulders most of the blame for the cambodian genocide his name is not even mentioned in this book rightly so probably given that the tale is told through the eyes of a 7 year old girl who wouldn't even know his name","1398":" this was quite reminiscent of first they killed my father another book about the khmer rouge and their reign of terror in cambodia also told from the perspective of a child that one is memoir this one as the author admits in her afterward is a memoir thinly disguised as fiction this was better but in some ways still doesn't really capture the brutalities of the regime in the telling her language is beautiful still i wish i was able to read a memoir of this time told from the perspective of an adult which would add more layers and complexities","1399":" this novel based on true events of the author's life is poetic stirring emotional deeply disturbing and beautiful it tells the story of raami who is 7 years old and part of a royal family in cambodia when the khmer rouge take over the country through the novel we descend with her into the hell on earth created by the khmer rouge between 1977 and 1979 her perseverance and the unbelievable strength of her mother are inspirational their experiences are helped ably by vaddey ratner's gorgeous writing i don't think i've ever highlighted as many passages in a novel as i have with this one for someone who didn't learn english until she was 11 she has a command of the language that other writers should envy be sure to read the afterword u0026amp to visit the author's website for more insight on her life after you read the novel you won't be disappointed with this one","1400":"beautiful writing and i like that there is so much of kindness and love amidst such horrible evil in this telling","1401":"beautifully lyrical fictional retelling of the author's experience during the reign of terror unleashed on cambodia by the kymer rouge at one point i thought to myself this book is just a little slow but found myself weeping fewer than five minutes later riveting horrible beautiful best book of the year for me","1402":"this book deals with a very sad maddening and important topic it opened my eyes to many of the horrors of the khmer rouge the author takes an interesting approach by describing the horrors through the eyes of a 7 year old girl which she modeled on herself the writing often gets to flowery and artistic for my liking also the story also has a lot of slow parts only to speed through things that feel more important","1403":"right now i'm naturally drawn to all things cambodian as my sister is living there so i added a few books about the time of the khmer rouge this book is very poetic and gives a little insight into buddhism as the story is told from the point of view of a 7 9 year old an air of innocence is added to the story along with the idea that the events and killing occurring during the time of the khmer rouge just didn't make any sense","1404":"very eye opening story created by author who experienced herself the genocide in cambodia during the revolution led by the khmer rouge in cambodia from 1975 1979 family love and faith is the major theme as we are transported to the horrors of war i was not aware of the deaths of 1 2 million cambodians during the horrific takeover of this regime the author escaped herself as a child and was a refugee landing in the usa in 1981 this is her amazing first novel","1405":"a bit slow to begin with however a poignant story of a horrific history some lovely and important passages highlight function utilised despite that not being something i do","1406":"excellent book a captivating although sad story well written","1407":"beautiful fictionalized account of the a khmer rouge's reign i've read several memoirs so i knew what was going to happen however the first half if the book is a mythical dream like journey through cambodia and then half way through the real violence hits and it's written just as jarringly a very effective and lovingly crafted book","1408":" the author of this book was five when the revolution broke out in cambodia and this is a book based on some of her experiences from the perspective of a seven year old girl it didn't explain or dive into the mentality revolution or explain why the soldiers were doing what they were doing but as long as you knew the gist of the revolution you came to understand through the actions of the soldiers and people it's crazy how easy it can be for soldiers to threaten people with guns tell people nothing or lie and make people do what they want leading them blindly to their deaths i can't imagine what i would do in that type of situation their were a lot of instances in the book that made me think about the hard choices you would make in life or death situations i also learned different things about the cambodian culture if you want to learn details about the revolution i read most of a book called a cambodian odyssey that was really good here are some of the passages i marked page 125 knowing comes from learning finding from seeking page 145 do you know why monks and nuns shave their heads if one begs the gods for a miracle one should do it with humility stripped of any human pride vanity big uncle page 165 an old man carves a small wooden calf necklace for a cow that had lost its calf to give shape to her sorrow page 199 mama to raami words they are our rise and our fall raami perphaps this is why i prefer not to say too much page 212 white is the color of mourningpage 215 story of luring a cobra into a pot of boiled water where her baby egg was page 254 because i couldn't keep a child alive the gods have taken away my ability to bear one there are no gods if they were the ones who gave life created it they'd know its value there are no gods only senselessness page 202 papa explaining raami's polio and limp for everything taken away something even more special is given back","1409":"raami is seven years old when the khmer rouge come to power in cambodia and her life is changed forever her family was one of royalty with servants several large homes jewelry and privilege she is particularly close to her father an enlightened royal and poet who tells her stories to help her lead a good life the family is relocated to a increasingly more difficult refugee camps the story is strongly autobiographical although i know the outline of the cambodian war this story gave me a more personal knowledge of what happened there how quickly we forget it was a good reminder","1410":"after reading all the reviews this book had i must say i was hesitant to read it i have never attempted reading books based on atrocities or horror so i thought i should give it a try to test myself to see how emotional i am and what good can i make of this book this book is written from the perspective of a seven year old girl i personally think a seven year old would not be able to understand the chain of events that happened with such maturity the author did manage to successfully bring out the innocence and confusion every now and then but does not manage to sustain it either the book should have been completely written with a seven year old's perspective or the perspective of mature adult who has been through this ordeal also i felt this book was more about the author's familys' journey during these troubled times i cried many times while imagining the sadness this book contains it is very sad and unfortunate to read what the people of cambodia had to face during this genocide my favorite characters were raami and her dad spoiler alert the bonding they shared was so real that the uncertainty of her father's life leaves me feeling queasy that i felt was the saddest part of this book overall a great read there is sorrow but there is also a child who could see rice paddies with knee high stalks as supple as baby's hair and myriad other beautiful things in mother nature it is not a life changing read but an inspiring read it motivates one to be positive and makes us realize that there is misery but there is also hope","1411":"i wish they had 1 2 ratings this was more of a 3 1 2 very moving story based on the author's real life experiences","1412":"beautiful moving and powerful that a little girl could actually live through these atrocities and later recount her journey i couldn't imagine","1413":"heartbreaking inspirational well written","1414":"$5 while we were on vacation last week i wasn't able to put it down this is the story of a 7 year old little girl during the communist revolution in cambodia in 1975 her family is royal elite until the organization takes over and everything changes she and her family are shipped from one work camp to another each one getting more barbaric and further and further away from the life they once led she faces the deaths of her family members exe i picked up this book at books a million for $5 while we were on vacation last week i wasn't able to put it down this is the story of a 7 year old little girl during the communist revolution in cambodia in 1975 her family is royal elite until the organization takes over and everything changes she and her family are shipped from one work camp to another each one getting more barbaric and further and further away from the life they once led she faces the deaths of her family members executions of total strangers starvation she is repeatedly stripped of people and things that she loves but manages to stay alive remembering her father's stories and plans for her life early in the book raami's aunt says the problem with being seven i remember myself at that age is that you're aware of so much and yet you understand so little so you imagine the worst in raami's case unfortunately she understands the hunger death destruction and chaos around her and it is the worst she doesn't understand the revolution or the organization but even many adults did not know what was going on but even still she has the will to fight to live this story parallels the author's own experience in cambodia as a child she did make small changes and combine her own family members to create characters in the book but in essence this is her story it hooks you tugs at your heart and makes you want to scoop raami out of the horror she finds herself in like i said i have not been able to put it down it was a fabulous read and i definitely recommend it","1415":"moving i was part way through this book on kindle no back cover to read before i realised that it was semi autobiographical knowing this made it so much more powerful it is a story of amazing courage and determination to live the author was only 5 years old in 1975 when the change in regime that resulted in the atrocities of the killing fields of cambodia occurred the narrator of this novel is seven at the start she is from a wealthy family related to the king and has never known any hardship as news filters through of the khmer rouge's uprising in the town the adults realise that their lives could be changed as a result but no one could have had any inkling of the serious nature of this change the 'organisation's' method of control was to instil fear and panic separating family groups and forcing everyone to work at a punishing rate on megre rations all this is recorded historically but the strength of this book was the incidious way that things seemed to get gradually worse and worse along with the telling of events with the naiivity of a seven year old for someone who didn't speak a word of english until she was eleven years old vaddey ratner's descriptions are wonderful the whole house was hot and stuffy like the inside of a balloon and pok looked at me silence seemed to have overtaken him again then his face broke open like the morning sun there is an author's note at the back of the book explaining how she came to write it and how difficult it was to relive these events i sincerely hope it was theraputic for her an excellent if harrowing read highly recommended also read with my ratings stay alive my son by pin yathay 5 stars the disappeared by kim echlin 4 stars","1416":"such a tragic but a beautifully written story this book is about a family in cambodia during the revolution and takeover of the country by the khmer rouge in the mid 70's a must read for anyone who lives in a free country when you read about people who have had freedom stripped from them it will make you appreciate the ability to choose the course of your life","1417":"hauntingly beautiful story told from the eyes of a young girl in wore torn cambodia","1418":"this is without a doubt one of the most beautifully written books i have ever read in my life the pictures this author's words create in your mind is achingly haunting i will be thinking of sentences and scenes from this story for weeks","1419":"beautifully written heartbreaking","1420":"heartbreaking reminiscent of life is beautiful a film i will only see once and a book i will not re read not because i didn't love it but because i don't think i could handle it again emotionally the language and the visual images were stunning","1421":"so far amazing i cannot put it down","1422":"this has got to be the most beautifully written book i have read in quite awhile the story is so very tragic but so well written although fictional it is largely based on the authors own personal experience writing must have been very therapeutic for her i think one of the reasons it is so beautifully written is because of her pouring her heart and soul into this story i highly recommend it","1423":"i start from a strange place a review of barbara kingsolver's 'poisonwood bible' in the new republic it has stayed with me for a long time as an appropriate critique of a strain of contemporary fiction unfortunately upon googling it i see the review was written by lee siegel and so is tainted tnr sweet and low march 1999 maybe the same is true of this review maybe it is crabbed and mean and useless siegel argued that kingsolver set her books above criticism by choosing protagonists who were themselves above criticism he wrote i am not talking about hypocrisy i am talking about the mere appearance of goodness as a substitute for honest art that feels like a good description of this book the author states that the story is basically her own though she has modified it to make a better tale and so labels it fiction james frey take note you too stephen glass former wunderkind of the new republic ratner survived the cambodian killing fields escaped to america when she was still a child became a high school valedictorian and graduated from columbia university i could only dream of going to college in a foreign land let alone a prestigious one and still more unlikely writing a book in that country's language that was nominated for a prestigious award in this case the pen hemingway let alone doing all of this after surviving one of the most insane political groups in the history of the universe pol pt's khmer rouge by what write do i criticize this book written by a woman who has done all of of this so that she could spread to the world the news of her childhood and the resiliency of her and the human spirit i can't answer that except to say that this book never fulfills its artistic promise the book is ok in that it is readable and i certainly cruised through it quickly if you like the usual bestsellers offered at target where i found this you will find the book fulfilling i suspect ratner can write she can tell a story better than i ever will i freely admit this but the book is just not that good it is the tale of a girl and mother who survive the khmer rouge revolution in cambodia but it never rises above that basic sketch as readers we have no doubt the girl will survive but there is nothing here tat really changes her ratner makes the point that the girl like her has suffered from polio but the only upshot of this is that she loses her leg supports she never draws out the implications of this loss just as she rarely draws out the implications of her family being undernourished instead the story is told almost on a completely metaphorical or as the reviews and publicity has it a lyrical level her father who sacrifices himself is a saint for writing poetry about the common man her effervescent mother a butterfly in the book's imagery is reduced to mere mortality i marked this book as a 'school house classic' in my idiosyncratic classification system because i can see it becoming a good high school text it expands even the new canon to include cambodia and there are plenty of literary techniques to study the sister's death is clearly foretold the whole book indeed is straight forward to straight forward and easily integrated into the high school english curriculum but for those of us who have learned these elements it is too basic there is also the problem of the novel's voice it is told from the point of view of a seven year old who others note really doesn't know everything but really the narrator is too perspicacious this is not seven year old but an adult the overly lyrical language further undermines the point that this book is told by a seven year old the author never fails to find three similes or metaphors where one will due i had hoped for something more not that i want an apologia for the khmer rouge but i wanted something that touched on the complexity of cambodian society during the 1970s instead ratner although acknowledging the necessity in the paratext never questions her own privilege she was the child of a prince and so lived a life of luxury is it any wonder that the poor would rebel instead of exploring the reasons for this making the bad guys explicable if not worth rooting for she makes the rural poor who were not part of the khmer rouge a symbol of volkisch dignity that absence the absence of an understandable bad guy makes the book too pat similar themes southeast asia the importance of stories are better articulated in mischa berlinski's field notes","1424":" once in a journey's dream i came upon a child bearing my soul once in a journey's dream i came upon a reflection of myself the beauty of this book is in the relationship between the father and his daughter the narrator and their conversations of the heart often spoken in words that a poet would choose but what makes this relationship even more lovely is revealed in the author's notes where she discloses that this is a semi autobiographical novel about the political struggle that tore apart her country and her family","1425":"the story of the atrocities of the khmer rouge from the voice of a young child i wanted to give this one a five because it opened my world experiences up to a regime i know nothing about strike that i know about pol pot from eddie izzard's routine otherwise this is a part of history that no one ever taught me or that i even would have known to look up i'm glad that elizabeth brought this one to the book exchange as it has changed the way i see the world i was disappointed with some bits so it stays at four stars in the interview at the back ratner says the trip across the border could be another whole book i wish she'd included it here as is it invokes the end of the sound of music with the ascending a mountain top to freedom it takes something away but i can't put my finger on what that something is i love the poetic quality of the writing including the poetry and myths ratner infuses throughout the novel i feel like i'm not just getting her story but that of a culture and its demise through ignorance i found i was angry most of the book at just how easily the educated can rally the ignorant arm them and then set them loose on an entire population having members of the same royal family who share ideals come to such vastly different conclusions about how their society should work is breath taking and scary is this the armed populace that our country wants i can't help but think of the ignorance of so many armed buffoons in our own country and what could happen if they came storming the castle and went after the teachers the gap between wealth and poverty grows larger and larger in the u s daily with rage flung around on all sides we have a leg up with free public education i suppose let's place our hope in trying to help kids before they give up and start fighting","1426":"raami is a child living in phnom penh cambodia when the khmer rouge come to power the khmer rouge goal was to strip all individual identity hardship incredible loss and the will to survive a very difficult read but left a lasting impression","1427":"this is sort of narrative non fiction in that the story happened to the author but she collapsed some events changed some names altered the timeline a little awesome but tough to stomach story of cambodia under the khmer rouge","1428":"has there ever been a more beautifully written story about such a horrific subject ratner depicts beauty in places most would never think to look as the story and the atrocities progress the beauty fades along with the characters","1429":"beautiful beautiful book worth it even though you know the pain the characters will endure uplifting","1430":"lyrical harrowing but ultimately life affirming just beautiful","1431":"yeah wow i finished the last third of in the shadow of the banyan in one sitting this evening it is possibly one of the most beautiful and most difficult books i have read some parts were especially hard as a father of four i finished it went and got a beer drank it in a few swallows drank another one and i'm still not sure where i'll land emotionally and to think this novel is to a great extent autobiographical","1432":"very moving and full of lessons about the horrors every communist revolution has brought everywhere it has happened it is untrue to believe the ideals were noble but spoiled by those who implemented them those so called ideals could only lead to blood and mass murders however maybe a memoir would have been better still","1433":"wow just finished this and it is an amazing story of about a child's survival through camodia during the terror of the khmer rouge exceptionally well written with moving passages and beautiful prose","1434":"i really liked this book cambodia my first journey into this country through historical fiction it's shocking how people have been treated throughout history may we please learn","1435":"excellent book i did not know much about the cambodian regime before and learned so much about the history of the region the characters were well developed and the details were beautifully written especially in the jungle as a historical fiction lover wonderful book","1436":"i absolutely loved this book an autobiograpical account of a girl's time in cambodian during the khmer rouge takeover a heart warming and heart wrenching story of love and loss written beautifully and when i finished i came to find that the author lives right here in maryland","1437":"this is the most beautiful book i have ever read in my entire life and no other book i have read has surpassed it's greatness truly an amazing read","1438":" there is a review on the back cover of the book that completely sums up how i felt while reading this novel so yes i'm totally stealing it but i give credit to robert glen rutler who actually wrote the review vaddey ratner's novel is revitalizing in its ability to humanize and personalize the cambodian genocide of the 1970s she makes us look unflinchingly at the evil that humankind is capable of but she gives us a child to hold our hand and achingly believable child so that we won't be overwhelmed definitely would re read this definitely would love to own it","1439":" this was an incredibly powerful story there were some things reading this book that did distract me the heavy use of similes and metaphors in the first chapter really threw me a little when i started reading but they tapered off quickly i also often found raami's voice not quite believable for a seven year old at times she has many grown up thoughts and uses words that she would have no way of knowing yet her actions always felt consistent for a young child so i always felt like it was more of an adult raami remembering her past even if it wasn't written this way and yet this wasn't really the point of the book raami is the vehicle to tell this story and it is a very moving story vaddey ratner does an incredibly job showing the reading everything that is going on and wonderfully describes the scenes and environments i would often get lost in her cambodia and found it difficult to pull myself out","1440":"incredible story of the khmer rouge period in cambodia from the author detail parts of it are based on truth the story is told from the eyes of an 8 year old girl and children are very adaptable however she seemed incredibly philosophical for one so young perhaps more of an adult perspective was needed or the narrator needed to think more age appropriate","1441":"wow a stunning book written from the voice of a 7 year old princess but the language of the adult author of whose story it represents the horror of the khmer rouge is portrayed with out graphic detail but so much more powerful for not going that route the authors note at the end is such a great way to finish this wonderfully lyrical novel of survival and family love and hope","1442":"this is a very good rich well written novel vaddey ratner mastered the enviable skill of telling an historical story in a way that the reader isn't even aware of how much she he is learning vaddey ratner's story is her own told through a fictional narrator it's a fascinating accounting of the khmer rouge's brutal and disturbing rise to power very good story","1443":"the beautiful but airy and ethereal writing of this fictionalized memoir fortunately puts some distance between the reader and the gut wrenching loss and emotional weight of the story","1444":" surprisingly i don't have a whole lot to say about this book yes i liked it i liked the characters the stories and fables that were woven into the pages that guided raami and gave her strength maybe i'm just a bit jaded but the characters i wanted to get to know the most were the ones who were absent for the majority of the story it's great that this was told through the incredibly adult voice of seven year old raami but having the story told through her viewpoint skewed a lot of information and history of the family i saw that the author loosely based this novel on her own life experience and i get that this was probably cathartic for her using raami as a vehicle to speak on the tragedy of the revolution in cambodia on the loss she and her family suffered and on the things she witnessed and endured during that four year period but i really wanted to know more about the adults i wanted to hear more poetry and to know what was going on in the minds of the two adult males it would have been nice to have a fictionalized account of what was discussed and decided between brothers what plans and contingencies were made between husband and wife my heart did end up breaking a few times throughout the story reading of the losses that raami had to survive through maybe i just read this too soon after reading unbroken there was enough depravity of the human soul and mind in that book to overwhelm a reader and maybe after reading all that i was a bit inured to what raami and her family went through it was terrible war always is my heart hurt for what they and the people they encountered endured and i silently cheered for any small miracle and story of survival and growth but unfortunately these kinds of stories are everywhere in our history the history of people not americans alone and while fear and loss are rampant in them all i prefer to focus on the stories of strength and triumph this book may not have had focused on any of the good that came about after the war ended but i was glad to see that there was extra information in the form of a reading group guide that provided a bit more insight into the author's life and her decisions to write this story","1445":"a book that has you asking how people can be so cruel and inhumane to other people the book details through fiction based on fact the horrors of war and man's inhumanity towards man","1446":" the author of this novel was 5 years old the daughter of a poet and descendant of cambodian royalty when the khmer rouge began its reign of terror in cambodia although the novel is essentially her story narrated by a girl who is 7 years old rather than 5 probably to give her a more viable voice she decided to tell her family's story as a novel rather than as a memoir it's a story of starvation terror death and general suffering but told always with a glimmer of hope and an appreciation for the natural beauty of her native country and for its spiritual traditions related in sometimes lyrical prose and sometimes a little over the top it was obviously a labor of love and its authenticity and humanity shine through the darkness","1447":"a literary work of poetic lyrical beauty this novel is based on the real experiences of the writer as a child living through the time of the khmer rouge in cambodia i was overwhelmed by the beauty of the writing the author's use of poetic words and descriptions to tell this story of survival loss and emotion","1448":"this is interesting and somewhat informative as a semi autobiographical narrative of living through the khmer rouge takeover of cambodia in the 70's as a novel it doesn't fare so well i found myself skimming most chapters to extract an ok story from a swamp of flowery prose the content to fluff ratio is about 1 3 most of the time with occasional stretches of more focused story telling it's not bad fluff as the stuff goes and if it's your kind of thing then it may heighten your appreciation for the book the only other downside is the dubious perspective that it's natural and right for royalty to be elevated above and fawned over by a population this is likely an unconscious slip since the author makes a couple overt attempts to promote the opposite idea those scenes are not convincing and the undercurrent running through the book as a whole undermines them it's also a little awkward at the end when the author parades her own position as royalty under the guise of honoring her father a slain prince if there were half stars this would be 1 5 material","1449":" this was an absolutely fantastic book not just because of the information about the country's history but because of the beautiful story and language that vaddey uses to tell her story vaddey ratner lived the life of the story's narrator a little girl named raami raami came from a wealthy family who was related to royalty through her paternal grandmother they were well off and it seemed that most of her family was well meaning everything in her life was beautiful bright delicious and magical then one day everything began to change as the khmer rouge began its descent upon the capital of cambodia this group came down hard on all the wealthy people of cambodia and began to dispersing the people of the capital all over the country for years raami was moved from one camp to another each time losing more of her relatives she lost her father early on when he sacrificed himself to spare his family the pain and suffering that they had witnessed so many other families endure but losing her father was only the beginning of the torture raami would go on to experience vaddey fills the pages with raami's imaginary friends who are gods and goddesses of cambodia culture raami's innocent perspective and active imagination adds so much power to the tragedies that unfold around her combined with the the breathtaking descriptions of her home country vaddey's story has become one of my favorites","1450":"sad story but beautifully crafted through the eyes of a seven year who sees and experiences but only understands through the lenses of her father's stories","1451":" i received this book from the goodreads book giveaway this book was written by a member of the royal family in cambodia the story takes place during the vietnam war era the writer has written the story as a fictional story but i believe a lot of what happens and the characters involved are based on actual events this book was difficult for me to read because of the atrocities taking place the story was also uplifting because of the strength of the characters and what they had to go through to survive i would recommend this book to just about anyone to read although i think for the ya audience it might be a good book to read in an english class with a teacher who can help the ya reader understand what was going on both in the book and in the world at the time","1452":" i am about 1 2 through this book which sort of meanders along like a slow moving river it's very poetically written and so far despite the family being slowly split up it doesn't seem too scary khemer rouge being a scary name just the mention of it and i picture pol pot and mountains of skulls so far the book is about relocation splitting up of families seen through the eyes of a child who is seven she had a very close relationship with her writer father seeing the world through his eyes of poetry","1453":"this was a good book i'm not quite sure why i didn't get super invested in it especially because as i kept reading i couldn't believe some of the atrocities that happened","1454":"lyrical writing of a harrowing time the author uses her own background of her experiences beginning at age 5 of the revolution in cambodia under the khmer rouge she was born into royalty and her family was punished for their social standing as were many others as the author uses this novel to depict what she witnessed","1455":"lucidly narrated without veering into pointless exoticism it is a harrowing tale but i wonder if history disguised as fiction especially semi authobiographic in nature writes itself as a good tale due to the strangeness of the experience as well as the foreignness of the locale does it make one more forgiving of the quality of the writing when it is not as polished","1456":"absolutely beautifully written vaddey ratner is a master of metaphor and simile a virtual artist with the written word","1457":"i enjoyed reading this book i knew of the killing fields in cambodia this story describes some of the events through the eyes of a very young girl wonderful tribute to vaddey ratner's father","1458":"i'm glad i read this book it taught me something about a part of world history that i knew nothing about i feel for vaddey ratner and her family with what they went through i cannot begin to imagine then to learn that hundreds of thousands possibly millions of people of cambodia were murdered it is very tragic this story left me constantly thinking about raami and her family long after the book was finished as a side note i asked my dad if he knew anything about cambodia he said he did i told him i was reading this book set in cambodia in the late 70s his reply was oh sh he told me it was terrible what was done he was stationed in thailand during the vietnam war he said one day they were instructed to go into their chow hall and not talk to the foreigners that were in there they were told to eat and get out so as he sat to eat he overheard these foreigners speaking in a broken french he said they were not french so since my dad speaks french he asked them who they were their reply we are khmer not khmer rouge we are khmer white he asked them why they were speaking french and was told that they have different dialects in their villages in cambodia and can't understand each native language but they all spoke a little french my dad then asked what they were doing and they told him they could not tell him so he finished eating and left after my dad told me this i then told him he has to read this book thanks for writing such a terrific and heartbreaking story","1459":"i didn't know much about the history of khmer rouge time period and tragedy in cambodia before reading this book i found it horrific and depressing but the story and perspective of raami also hopeful","1460":"when the khmer rouge oust the ruling monarchy in cambodia in 1975 a four year long struggle ensues for its citizens among them is seven year old raami herself of royal descent raami's life dramatically changes when a soldier asks her family to leave their home along with the rest of cambodia from there raami is taken to different villages and towns forced to work and witness horrors and along the way loose many family members this was the first i've learned of cambodia's genocide and it was enlightening what was masked a revolution or re building really was an extermination of what the khmer rouge deemed was the enemy this included anyone with royal connections teachers writers engineers and so on later this was widened to include the way a person looked like or how they talked raami as the narrator was a great way to convey the hurt and fear of the time her plight reflects the plight of many to learn that the story is a close parallel to the author's life added depth to the narrative while the story is filled with tragedy and pain it also contains love and hope in the shadow of the banyan is a poignant and worthwhile read","1461":" i will admit to having a limited knowledge of the genocide campaign in cambodia by the khmer rouge prior to reading this book the author is herself a survivor of the war waged in her country and the story is told through the eyes of a 7 9 year old girl as her family is displaced from their home sent on a journey that results in separation loss and tragedy all along the way after finishing the book i did some research on the killing fields it was a horrible time in human history i would recommend this book but know that it is not a light easy read it is heart wrenching and there are moments you may need to close the cover and walk away","1462":" any review that i write cannot do this book justice heart breaking but powerful a beautifully written story based on the life on the author in cambodia she is 7 years old when the khmer rouge destroy her entire world living as a princess in a magical world with a poet father she and her family are thrown into chaos as they are stripped of their comfortable city life and forced to labor and survive in the countryside the utter senselessness of what she and millions went through is not comprehensible this book is sad yes but the it also has many moments of beauty as she is taught the poetry of life by her father how to see beauty even in misery and how to transcend the suffering around her many times i caught myself re reading it's almost lyrical at times and ultimately she has the triumph of survival definitely a 5 well deserving of it's 4 avg rating","1463":" a beautifully written and sorrowful read i love reading historical fiction - especially when done well - as it immerses you in a time and place you wouldn't otherwise experience there is so much suffering in the world around us even in our own country and the words phrases and poetry ratner weaves together in the form of a story give light to the soul and strength of humanity even in the worst of times \"i told you stories to give you wings raami so that you would never be trapped by anything - your name your title the limits of your body this world's suffering \"","1464":" in the shadow of the banyan is definitely one of the best books i have read although it is historical fiction the author states at the end that the novel tells her life story as well during her childhood in cambodia the novel is set in cambodia between 1975 and 1979 when the khmer rouge took over cambodia and destroyed villages driving people from their homes killing nearly a million people in the process the novel centers around a a young girl raami and what she experiences during this period of time at the beginning of the novel she is 7 years old with a younger sister a father who is a royal prince mother a grandmother who is a royal queen and other extended family raami and her family along with nearly everyone in their village are driven out of their homes by the khmer rouge who take over in a revolution through the experiences of raami and her family the author vividly portrays the brutality and tragedies the people of cambodia experienced during this period of time before the khmer rouge were defeated however the author has also beautifully portrayed the folklore traditions and stories passed from family to family which gave the people hope in the darkest times raami's father was a great poet and he left her a legacy to uplift her soul even when her physical body was nearly broken truly an awesome book","1465":"gut wrenching stunning fabulous read reading this through the eyes of a child is a brilliant literary device through the horrors remained a spirit that only a child possesses","1466":"a touching and tragic story beautifully written about a family struggling to survive the cambodian genocide all told through the perspective of a young girl who survived polio as a toddler ratner's writing brings the countryside off the page and touches your heart with her words time and time again ratner shows us the horror of the cambodian genocide and when you think there is nothing good left she offers you a little piece of hope and love giving you the strength to hold on and the hope of a better tomorrow","1467":"this account told through the eyes of a seven year old is very powerful the power of human nature to survive is evident on every page evil and goodness battled constantly a book that that will linger a long time in my mind","1468":" wow great book this fictionalized memoir of a little girl who somehow manages to survive the khmer rouge is beautiful and harrowing at the same time i appreciated that so much of the story's is told through the poetry and fables the family members share with each other it's how they teach they cope they mourn and they pray and gave great insight into the culture that was being destroyed by the organization this wasn't an easy read because of the subject matter we know before raami just how awful things will get for her and her family but i couldn't put it down i highly recommend it","1469":"this is another fiction book that reads as a memoir in fact the author said that it mirrors her life it takes place in cambodia in the 70s when the khmer rouge liberates its citizens by forcing them to move out of their homes and to where ever the organization wanted them to live it is scary and depressing but really interesting if you haven't looked into cambodia's history before the problem for me was that the author lingered on spiritual and poetic writings and ideas so much that the story seemed to stand still for a while add that to all the sadness from losing loved ones the organization needed to start over fresh and killed everyone who had been influential in any way to the existing culture and it was very hard to complete this book","1470":"harrowing yet lyrical novel of the khmer rouge genocide in cambodia from the perspective of a young girl many similarities to eli wiesel's night comes to mind a heartbeaking and unforgettable story","1471":" i was most appreciative of the author's discussion of how difficult this was to remember and write there was so much tragedy and so much death it astounds me that a human especially a child could survive and function having this as the backdrop during their impressionable years the foundation her father established was instrumental in saving her spirit going forward and it could not be rocked even in the most dire of desperate scenarios that is the fascinating part how that foundation was developed in just five years of life and how it carried her through adulthood she is an amazing person and sharing her story has made me again grateful for life itself","1472":"haunting read through the eyes of a child to think this is some what autobiographical sends shivers down my spine beautiful prose","1473":"wonderful well written tale of tragedy heartbreak this is never right in your face but a compelling telling of a horrific tale of the unravelling of a country and all it's people full of violence and genocide of the khmer rouge","1474":"i feel heartbroken after reading this story especially knowing it was based on the author's own experiences as a child i don't understand the cruelty people can inflict on one another but understand more than ever how lucky we are to be living in this time and place so beautifully written","1475":"i rarely feel as strongly as i do after reading this it is truly a book everyone needs to must read beautifully poetic heartbreaking and unimaginably sad the author wove together a story about stories one that quietly resembles not only her own but that which is similar to many of those who have struggled under oppression and yet given the horror of it all the story that remains is incredibly beautiful and moving again a must read","1476":"i give this book an unreserved full 5 stars on the cover one reviewer is quoted as describing the story as utterly heart breaking and impossibly beautiful i couldn't say it any better the story is about the khmer rouge period in cambodia as experienced by a small girl and her family the story is frightening horrifying beautiful and eloquent","1477":" the biggest problem in in the shadow of the banyan is the seven year old girl raami narrating a story in the words of an adult woman raami is consistently viewing the world through an adult's eyes verbalizing observations that go well beyond a child's level of understanding it's not that she necessarily realizes things that a child wouldn't be aware of rather that she describes them so specifically spelling them out for the reader it's a tactic that is both condescending for a mature reader who were the scenes properly written would be able to see everything through subtlety but also completely and totally contradictory to raami's age ratner has raami describe and interpret everything which kills any possibility of subtlety and further emphasizes the age discrepancy it's clumsy writing it is so focused on being richly written and vivid and beautiful that it fails to scale the simplest heights the novel is overwritten it's overwritten for its narrator but it's also overwritten in that the sentences drag creating overly elaborate imagery that ultimately leads nowhere the plot pacing is equally frustrating the core story is fascinating how could it not be this is recent history displaying humanity at its worst but beyond this core it isn't particularly interesting ratner's tendency to overwrite means that this novel feels bloated and long it didn't take too long for me to get tired of the many descriptions of this exotic locale or talk of jasmine and butterflies and other repetitive descriptions used to give the story what i can only imagine was meant to be flavor i was supposed to feel attached to these characters supposed to care about their lives and their world and their reality i wasn't","1478":" the heartbreaking and vivid balance of lyrical poetic prose blocking the horrors of this semi autobiographical novel reaccounting one small girl's will to survive in the face of the khmer rouge tragedy created a moving story of more than just suffering at its most intensity but a work of art at its finest slow moving and smothered in flowery imagery this out of the many books i have read set in cambodia was my best portal to this exotic world of beauty hidden beneath the years of recent genocide and war and into the mind of a grieving child that pushes on under circumstances i cannot even begin to imagine although the action pauses for pages at a time closing this book i left this world with a heavy weight of the pains not only raami had to endure but any cambodian and any child forced to grow up before their time when confronted head on with death that shatters their wall of innocence a child deserves to grow up under i left this world with an understanding of what the will to survival really implies and how much people that arrive as refugees in our country do to sustain their lives how much a triumph it is just to live the fact that the true warriors in our world are those not only in arms but those in our neighborhoods and communities that go unnoticed whose act of survival is their mark of a fighter leaving this book i have only just begun to understand the full capacity of their grief everything i have taken for granted and been ignorant of growing up as a modern american i left the room expecting to see the father of raami's i could so deeply envision through his eloquent words of wisdom her tender mother who expressed her love through her determination for raami to survive raami herself lost in the world of her parents' stories and surrounded by the love of those who left her behind to live as if they are people i know dear to my heart most of all i saw the bright future of cambodia's people despite the tragedies they have faced i saw a cambodia not just of corpses and blood but a cambodia and a world of hope and to still hope after what they endured and still suffer from today in itself is a remarkable thing","1479":" i wasn't sure what i would think of this book i heard that this book was about the cambodian massacre that happened in the early 1970s by a group called khmer rouge this time period was also featured in the movie the killing fields i was very surprised by this book and liked it a lot true it is about the massacre and about all of the horrible things that happen in times of war but this book is also about family love sacrifice and courage and that is what made this book so good the main character is 7 years old when the khmer rouge storm her home and force all of the inhabitants of the cities go travel to the country and become essentially slave labor her parents give her the only thing that they can love and stories of a better life and they make great sacrifices to help their family much is out of their control and much horror and hardship takes place but in the end the love and memory of a loving family prevails this book demonstrates that children if given love and courage can survive horrific experiences and can go on to a better life my book club is reading this book this month and i look forward to hearing what the group thought of it","1480":"elegant prose and a gentle start belie the brutality of the khmer rouge in this story of cambodia's royal family during the 1975 uprising the story was incredibly sad but demonstrated the power of the human spirit to continue i loved this novel which was based on the real experience of the author","1481":"3 1 2 stars won this book from the first reads giveaways what i liked about this book is that it made me aware of something that i was pretty ignorant about before the civil war in cambodia in the 1970s however the reason i didn't give it a higher rating is that i never felt completely connected to the main character s","1482":"having read this book after i read never fall down i found this one to be slower and less graphic the plight of the people is not to be undermined by those words though the book was descriptive of the country the camps and the experiences of the people the author does a good job of telling the family's story through the eyes of a child probably because she had endured much of the same growing up during those years","1483":"amazing book heart wrenching and deep account of the khmer rouge in cambodia","1484":"excellent book i enjoyed listening to it ratner has the gift of painting the scenery with her words alongside sharing how a child takes in and understands a troubled world","1485":"wow this is a very powerful book i really had a hardtime putting it down the book is beautifully written i did not know about the struggles within cambodia we are very lucky to be living our lifes i highly recommend","1486":"holy cow this was a good book absolutely beautifully written very lush descriptive and gorgeous prose violent but never gratuitously so it's written from the eyes of a child and ratner captures the voice perfectly whew so good","1487":" the author describes a world that is hard to fathom but really existed in cambodia where families were torn apart for no good reason and extreme violence and abuse were part of everyday life her use of poetry and stories helps to get you through this but is a tough read i had to stop several times to take a break because it is pretty emotionally draining at times definitely recommend though it's a well written story that helps you believe some good came out of the terrible experiences that happened to the author","1488":"this has now become my favorite book review to come","1489":" it is a great book it taught me a lot about cambodia i really didn't know much before especially about the genocide the revolution brought up this is a fantastically written book and it is loosely based on the author's life which makes it so personal and so profoundly touching i got lost a little bit at the beginning with the bhuddist terminology and kherm terms used but got into it eventually great historical fiction book huge admiration for vaddey ratner who has given me such a great example of survival determination and the strength of the human spirit","1490":"i loved this it's a sad vivid book about the khmer rouge take over and genocide in cambodia and it manages to be really real without being super gross the writing seemed overladen and purple to me at first so so so many metaphors but after a while i actually appreciated the way it made the landscape and culture come to life i'm hoping vaddey ratner writes a book about the rest of her journeys and her settling in america because i would read it in an instant","1491":"a very moving book about a young girl and her family set in cambodia during the revolution there particularly moving because while a novel it is based on her experiences during that terrible time","1492":"achingly beautiful and heartbreaking that it is based in historical events of a genocide masked as a revolution and loosely based on the author's own tragic experiences makes it all the more captivating her survival is truly astounding and puts our modern life into great perspective highly recommend this gripping novel","1493":"coming of age survival story of one girl during the time of the khmer rouge unsettling and heartbreaking but still beautiful","1494":"i visited cambodia several years ago and went to the site of a mass grave that is now memorialized with a transparent moment with numerous levels filled with the skulls of people massacred in the late 70's by the khmer rouge one third of the cambodian population was murdered between 1 2 million people over the course of a few years this book gives voice to those who suffered it is beautifully written inspiring and heartbreaking","1495":" this was very interesting i'm glad i read it because i was initially reluctant because it was described as harrowing it is a fictionalized account of the real life experience of a woman who was 5 years old when her family endured the khmer rouge genocide and psychotic rulership of cambodia from 1975 to 1979 good thing it didn't last longer because they wiped out nearly a third of the cambodian population it is a very interesting account of what she went through from being an actual princess to nearly starving to death in the killing fields has an upbeat hopeful ending because she obviously did survive barely","1496":"this is a hauntingly beautiful novel a life changing experience in fact for me it's on the same level with the unbroken by laura hillenbrand as it is a true account of what the author had endured it blows my mind away that vaddey ratner is the same age as i but she had experienced these unimaginable events and lived to tell about them i will definitely purchase this book after having read a library copy i hope the author will continue with a second book about her post escape life","1497":"\"war entered my childhood world not with the blasts of rockets and bombs but with my father's footsteps as he walked through the hallway passing my bedroom toward his \" so begins the tale of raami a seven year old girl belonging to the cambodian royal family when the communist regime known as the khmer rouge seizes power raami and her family are forced out of their family home and into labour camps where starvation and death are rampant the book closely mirrors the experiences of the author herself for like raami vaddey ratner belonged to the cambodian royal family and experienced the khmer rouge killing fields when she was just five years old despite the depressing subject matter of the novel one of the most surprising things about in the shadow of the banyan is the sense of beauty and hope that are evoked through the writing in fact i think the only words to describe ratner's style of writing is the often cliched phrase \"hauntingly beautiful \" there were countless times where i found myself stopping and re reading a sentence over and over again just to enjoy its artistry i especially enjoyed ratner's use of legends and folktales throughout the novel to demonstrate the ability of stories to give hope and strength in a world that is quickly falling to pieces the love that flows from this book is also extremely moving and will surely pull at any reader's heartstrings the relationship between raami and her father for example though only briefly displayed in the story left such a deep impression on me that it still consumes my thoughts days after finishing the novel i think it is raami's perspective as a child that allows this sense of love to permeate the story rather than the anger and hatred one would typically feel in such a tragic situation in writing in the shadow of the banyan ratner has not only created a beautiful remembrance for the victims of the khmer rouge but a masterpiece that will surely stand the tests of time overall i was extremely moved by raami's story and in absolute awe of ratner's writing a moving debut novel in the shadow of the banyon is a must read for adult fiction readers","1498":"this is an exquisitely beautiful heartbreaking story of an articulate very aware young girl and what happens in her world as the khmer rouge come to power in cambodia in the 1970s vaddey ratner has greatly honored her father the tiger prince the life he led and the values he imparted by putting this story to paper","1499":"i enjoyed ratner's writing from the beginning her story told through the eyes of a young girl was vivid in the details of a child and pulled me in to the warmth of parental love loss of family and her struggle alone i wanted to meet this woman and hear more of her experiences","1500":"such beautiful descriptive writing but a much more depressing story than i anticipated","1501":"ratner has a very lyrical writing style but the story is incredibly depressing as the tale of the pol pot regime would be","1502":"exquisite lyrical stops just short of heartbreaking","1503":"heart wrenching honestly i don't know what else to say about this book or about the story it tells gripping so astounding that this happened in my lifetime","1504":"wow i adore this book it's writen in beautiful prose that sweeps you through an increasingly terrifying landscape the characters are whole and you love and fear for them the setting is rich in detail and full of love of nature it's based on historical events and teaches the truth of them better than a few cheap paragraphs in a textbook possibly could read it","1505":"beautiful words to tell a heart wrenching story of loss suffered when the khmer rouge seized power in cambodia raami is 7 when her life is irrevocably altered as her family is forced from their home sent to work camps she suffers the loss of many of her relatives while enduring starvation and torture the stories her papa told give her wings to bear these injustices as the revolutionaries try to erase all sense of individualism of identity","1506":"i rarely give 5 stars the author's note and interview were just the final touches on what was an amazing memorable beautiful book i feel enlightened privileged and inspired after reading it thank you ms ratner and i hope you continue to write additional novels","1507":" ratner tells us in her author's note that her novel chronicles her childhood experiences in cambodia through the character of raami during the years of terror 1975 1979 raami and her extended family face the unspeakable cruelty of having their lives uprooted and destroyed by the revolutionary inhumanity of the khmer rouge regime raami's family is driven from their home in phnom penh herded onto trucks to relocate in the country coerced into separation and installed in the rice fields to carry out forced labor in the process many disappear and perish told through the tender and innocent perspective of raami the story takes on an added degree of pain and loss as we understand her family is a microcosm of the widespread devastation of what the khmer rouge did to countless families this is a sad heartbreaking story but by acting as witness to the past ratner essentially confronts the executioners and gives voice to the thousands who did not survive in exposing the crimes of the khmer rouge ratner amazingly remains temperate and never resorts to a vindictive tone raami's tale focuses on memory both of what she endured and of what she preserves as recollections of her beloved family members who did not make it in doing so the novel ultimately serves as a testament of resilience and triumph with her voice ratner assures that the victims are not forgotten told in steady elegant prose this story never waves with emotion however the only criticism i have is that the pacing plods a bit and some of the chapters feel extended with unnecessary detail","1508":" so many stories of loss and of sufferings so terrible one wouldn't wish upon anyone in this world yet over and over again life repeats tales of human atrocities of acts of mindless cruelty forcing one to question our ability to discern between what keeps us human and what makes us inhuman and then yet again in these very extremities blossom stories of resilience which in so many words simply means the capacity of human beings to value and be grateful for the things that make the struggle for living worthwhile more importantly it is about the human capacity to remember love experienced in any of its varied forms this far outweighs the pains of life and encourages one to push on to survive and live to see a better day at times too beautiful to stop the tears from coming forth this one is a sad happy tale that grows on you quietly","1509":" this novel essentially a fictionalized memoir of ratner's childhood experiences under the khmer rouge in cambodia in the 1970's was somewhat unexpected both in its simplicity and in its tone one expects when dealing with this type of subject matter to be bombarded by atrocity after atrocity ratner takes a completely different approach telling her story through the voice of 7 year old raami ratner crafts a lovely and believable child voice for her story and raami's innocence and grace for much of the book present the horrors that are occurring with a veneer uniquely possible with a child's voice we feel the general tension that pervades the situation and we know that there are unspeakable things happening often somewhere just beyond our field of vision what ratner's work accomplishes especially well however is to convey the extraordinary ability of people in unimaginable circumstances to build community and maintain humanity it is difficult to write an objective review of a work that contains so much of an author's true experience as ridiculous as it sounds i found myself wishing at times for an account that captured more of the visceral nature of this experience the child's voice while beautiful at times seems to mute some of the violent nature of life under these circumstances then again having had no experience of anything like the horrors that ratner must have witnessed as a child i have no way of determining how a child would experience or process the unimaginable atrocities of genocide starvation and the surprising depths of the human capacity for evil as ratner explains in her author's note the book's plot follows her family's experience rather closely balancing out her account of what happened which is presented in a rather straight forward manner ratner emphasizes raami's relationship with her father whose name and story are those of ratner's real life father this relationship follows one of the book's important threads the importance of stories and the power of words to unite and inspire faced with a regime whose object is to stomp out all remnants of an educated populace including all ties to religion and community raami and her family turn to the power of stories to keep their traditions alive this is one aspect of ratner's book that truly shines her language surrounding story and knowledge conjures some of her most elegant prose while ratner's book may not be completely successful on all counts it is truly remarkable as a narrative of human experience and survival it is also worthwhile for its treatment of a period in that is history somewhat under represented in popular fiction according to my admittedly limited knowledge the story of the khmer rouge regime in cambodia under which estimates indicate millions of people were killed has become a horror story of which many people who are not students of history are vaguely aware but widespread understanding of this period seems still to be lacking ratner's valuable personal narrative is a rich effective contribution to the human history of these years the book which one can only imagine to have been extraordinarily difficult to write is a rewarding read that emphasizes the power of the human spirit and the power of a shared history and culture to keep community alive in even the most heartbreaking of circumstances thanks to goodreads and simon u0026amp schuster for the advanced reader's copy","1510":"an unforgettable story of a family's attempt to survive during a total breakdown of society as seen through the eyes of the young daughter","1511":"touching sad and hopeful beautiful writing and imagery","1512":" a heart breakingly sad and moving account of one family's experiences of the atrocities committed under the khmer rouge regime in cambodia between the years 1975 and 1979 vaddey ratner has fictionalized her own family's history telling it through the eyes of seven year old raami daughter of one of the royal families of cambodia coming of age in a time of turmoil and chaos the trouble with being seven is that you're aware of so much and yet you understand so little raami's relationship with her father the tiger prince is so beautiful and special it is impossible not to fall in love with the man his folktale stories and his poetry they say mine is a ravaged land scarred and broken by hate on a path to self extermination yet no other placeso resembles my dream of heaven the lotus fields that cradle my homeeach flower a reincarnated spirit or perhaps like me a child who wishes to be rebornshould dreams become possible again it's true mine is a life of povertymy home a half built thatched hutits walls the winds and rains a beautifully written novel that i highly recommend 4 5 stars","1513":" i travelled to cambodia a few years ago if thailand is the land of smiles cambodia is the land of smiles that are twice as wide but the country's recent history - a third of the population obliterated by the khmer rouge - is still very near the surface this wonderful book tells the little told story in a way that's accessible to fiction readers but is really a fictionalised memoir of the author's own early life i have to say it absolutely blew me away raami is seven living in phnom penh with her aristrocratic family when the khmer rouge gain precedence so begins the family's forced migration from place to place with brutal conditions contrasted with moments of real human kindness the detail is horrifying - the inhuman cruelty the daily struggle for food that makes a water beetle a real prize the backbreaking work on building a barrier to hold back the monsoon waters the repeated denial of self to secure simple survival the writing style is matter of fact and unemotional writing from raami's limited viewpoint really worked for me - but also lyrical and descriptive with scenes of incredible beauty the mist in the temple before her father's departure will stay with me for a long time as horror follows horror the simple factual observation and unemotional telling just increase the impact on the reader everyone should read this book it's really well overdue for cambodia to get some of the spotlight - this was the 1970s and we shamefully know so little but it's also a wonderful piece of writing at its heart is a confused and frightened child trying to make sense of the inexplicable and just wanting the stability and security of her family very highly recommended and will stay with me for a long time","1514":"3 5 stars this book is beautifully written almost poetical i really could picture in my mind what she was describing so easily i loved the stories the father told his daughter i could read about them all day the only thing that made me drop half a star was that it was a little slow moving for me but beautiful writing anyway","1515":"i loved this book it was the first time i've read anything about these years in cambodia and this couldn't have been a better way to dive in lyrical comes to mind when i try to describe ratner's writing style i loved the way she wrapped the stories and mysticism of her youth around the heartbreaking story","1516":"beautifully written","1517":" this lyrical novel recounts the khmer rouge's revolution and victory and the impact on the educated class of cambodia rami is only five when she and her family of royal ancestory are loaded onto trucks and taken to the countryside where they are forced to work as field hands and are terrorized daily the author said she was inspired by elie wiesel's night and that is easy to see the story is based on the author's own experience a beautifully written book about a very horrid chapter in history","1518":" i won this book in a firstreads giveaway over a year ago but hadn't gotten around to it until now i picked it up to take on vacation not expecting much i was completely blown away by this book it is a beautiful beautiful story bound together by interesting characters and a heartbreaking plot i had not known much about the khmer rouge before reading this but am now full of curiosity a captivating story it becomes even more so knowing that it is based on the author's life i found myself writing down numerous quotes from the pages a gem of recently published fiction this story is going to stay with me for a long time","1519":"this novel is essentially a memoir of a 5 year old and told through the voice of a 7 year old i just found this a really strange way to tell a story and could not appreciate the blend of fiction vs nonfiction i really didn't know anything about the khmer rouge so despite the 2 star rating i am glad i read the book as always when i read about such atrocities i am left with a feeling of utter awe that i am lucky enough to be born to where i am","1520":"vaddey ratner has the gift of poetic vision her story is simultaneously heart wrenching in its honest display of brutality and transcendent in its sensitive observation of everyday beauty ms ratner thank you for sharing your gift your story and your family with us","1521":"beautifully written shows that horror and cruelty can exist in a place that looks like paradise this is to a large extent autobiographical an adult author wrote it from the perspective of a 7 year old some might argue that a 7 year old could never be so perceptive etc i thought about it and i think she does a good job it is an adult writing about what she saw at age 7 either way great read you will cry and cry and cry","1522":"i felt like this novel was important to read because you learn a lot of factual information on the cambodian civil war without the dry and boring style of nonfiction books for the most part the book was interesting and exciting but has certain parts that are hard to read because of the upsetting subject matter and bits of unnecessary fluff i really enjoyed how the story went into details on cambodian religious beliefs custom and topography i felt like i learned a lot about the country the book was written in a more eastern style than many books i have read in the past which i thought made the story seem more like a first person account i would recommend this to history buffs or those interested in southeast asia but prepare to shed a tear or two","1523":"although this is an odyssey through countless atrocities committed during the cambodian revolution vaddey ratner's use of her childhood perspective and her almost magical connection to the beauty of the land makes the book more bearable it is a beautiful book and a refresher on the trouble with revolution","1524":"one of the better books i've read this year with a subject i knew little about good characters felt like i really knew the family","1525":"beautifully written she has certainly inherited her father's poetic talent","1526":"this is one of the most beautiful books i have read i have just finished it and need to think about how to articulate my thoughts","1527":"amazingly written incredibly sad based on a true story about a girl and her family in the communist revolution in cambodia definitely recommended","1528":"not a lot of laughs that's for sure while slow at times this book was often lyrical and moving an important read","1529":"3 stars for this historical novel about life in cambodia under the khmer rouge sp while this story was fascinating and hearbreaking i found the writing to be a bit too lyrical and metaphorical for my tastes i did finish it and did find it to be beautifully written but i also felt the main characters voice was unrealistically mature for her age as written overall a mixed bag for that i did like but would recommend with reservations","1530":" in the shadow of the banyan by vaddey ratner was a wonderful read yes it is a khmer rouge book so it covers some heavy material but since raami was only 7 when her family was turned out of their home in phnom pen she sees things fall into madness through the eyes of a confused viewer who doesn't understand all of the depravities surrounding her this point of view actually made the story more accessible to me since it focused more on the human rather than political situation in the region the reader is given a story of great hardship but also hope horrible abuses of power but also kindness betrayal but also honor in the author's note at the end of the book we find out that banyan tree was very closely based on ratner's own life story she combined some family members into single characters adjusted her true age from 5 to 7 mixed both her memory of events with that of other family members but essentially this is an authentic memoir of the life a girl growing up in khmer controlled cambodia it was a wonderful story that i am grateful she shared with the world","1531":"this was my preparation context read for traveling to cambodia it is a fine piece of storytelling i'm looking forward to vaddy ratner's next book already and it comes from a very true and heartbreaking place whether you're interested in cambodian history the khmer rouge or just plain excellent writing novels give this one a try","1532":"absolutely amazing stunning although the setting is the revolution in cambodia in 1975 1979 and there are horrible atrocities hope and love are the threads that course throughout the story the author was five years old in 1975 so it is based on real events but as vaddey ratner said in an interview she wanted to write on the universal desire to live the very desire for life itself i have this book from the library but it is one i want to own and read again","1533":"this was a hard read an intense read but so beautifully written i did find it a bit slow going but more due to the intensity than anything else","1534":"i did enjoy this book even if the subject matter the reign of pol pot and his cronies in late 70s cambodia is not exactly enjoyable very well written even if a bit too tidy with its ending the interesting bit is that the book is really based on the author's own experiences which were far from tidy until at least the early 80s in the us","1535":"rich and lyrical and wonderful historical fiction that pulls you into the cambodia during the rise of the khmer rogue and makes it feel real","1536":"somehow i managed to miss a lot of knowledge of cambodia's history yikes this is a great book ironically i'm moving on to another book on cambodia","1537":"probably the best book i've ever felt the need to abandon in the shadow of the banyan is set in cambodia a new regime is taking over it keeps the population off centre by constantly displacing it families are uprooted from their homes at regular intervals and resettled friends and neighbours are torn apart people are 'lost' massacres are a part of the landscape the narrator is a young girl of noble birth not such a good thing in times like these i'm not averse to reading books about depressing subjects i often gravitate towards the horror of war because it makes for such an intense and visceral reading experience the issue that i had with this book was that it was too dilute telling this story through the eyes of a young child could have been a masterstroke providing an intense juxtaposition between innocence and evil i think that's what the author was going for but for me it came across as saccharine one of the books on my favorites list is beneath the lion's gaze it had a similar feel to it but got progressively darker and more intense as it unfolded one scene graphically depicting the torture of a young boy will stay with me forever i'm not saying it was a pleasant read but it was definitely powerful i stopped reading in the shadow of the banyan at a pivotal point in the story line one that should have devastated me it didn't i found myself admiring the writing rather than picking myself back up off the floor i'm absolutely positive that many other people would respond to the tone of this novel better than i did someone reading this review right now is probably thinking that i'm totally callous for not having responded to the tragedy of a child separated from her roots i can understand why it's received a lot of acclaim it just wasn't right for me","1538":"this books just grabs you and draws you into the story in a heartwrenching way i can't even imagine what this period in history was like for so many people well written book i definitely recommend to my goodreads friends","1539":"like ender's game this book was worth reading just for the author's note at the end ratner's writing is lyrical and a little slow paced her story is tragic it's amazing that this story is semi autobiographical i hope to be able to hear the author speak at the gaithersburg book festival http gaithersburgbookfestival org f","1540":" cambodia often gets lost in world history the violence and mass homicides are over shadowed by vietnam stalin hitler rwanda and other african and asian nations however cambodia shares a dark history from 1975 to 1979 a \"socialist\" regime overthrew the monarchy and threw the country into chaos as the regime become more paranoid more violent and went away from their founding ideals it is estimated that between one and two million people died about a third of the population from starvation execution and disease tvaddey ratner the author of in the shadow of the banyan lived through the upheaval and destruction her life as a young girl in a privileged royal family is fictionalized in this novel ratner elegantly simultaneously portrays the beauty of the cambodian culture and the sorrow of the khmer rouge it is a very elegant and beautiful story and it is worth reading so that the memories and lives of the cambodians are not forgotten that being said in the shadow of the banyan does not rise above the other countless tales of war torn countries it is a good story but not one in a million","1541":"i did enjoy this book the prose was beautiful and the story heartwrenching two things that i didn't like it was in first person and the narrator was 7 at the start of the story the narrator's age was unbelievable","1542":"really beautiful writing made every experience simply gorgeous no matter how horrible loved the journey aspect to the story and the glimpse into khomer rouge cambodia","1543":"this was a great book just not a great book for a light summer vacation read it is unfathomable to me that this horrific revolution in cambodia occurred during my lifetime and although this story is fictional is is based on the author's real experience as a young child i couldn't sleep one night and just prayed for the people in cambodia for their healing for forgiveness for peace in the shadow of the banyon is one of those books which will definitely leave a haunting impression","1544":"what a wonderful book this was with so much despair and violence in this family well written and very descriptive","1545":"while very well written the story didn't appeal to me","1546":"this was a difficult and painful book to read especially knowing that it was essentially autobiography well written and worth reading despite the sadness it's also something i didn't know as much about as i guess i should have","1547":"a fictionalized account of the author's experience in cambodia when the khmer rouge came to power by her account in the book's afterward anywhere between one and two million people died during a four year period she was five when the purge began her entire family except for her mother died sad haunting poetic narrative","1548":"amazing vaddey ratner has done her father proud","1549":"the author writes in a very poetic way about the horrors and the stupidity of the khmer rouge regime the story is based on her experience i found it very interesting both on the historical level and simply as a very well written captivating story a very good book","1550":"i liked it in the way that i liked little bee not a pleasant book to read but a lingering one for sure","1551":"great book about the time of the khmer rouge i really had only an inkling of the extent of the misery there this book was an excellent read an i thoroughly enjoyed it","1552":"loved this book it took a bit to get going for me but eventually i could not put it down","1553":"such a beautifully written story following one family during the khmer rouge's takeover of cambodia written from the perspective of the 7year old daughter who is older and wiser than her years it is basically the story of the author's life raami's father is a poet and throughout the story she is able to conjure up the words from his poems to find the beauty in the sadness and tragedy around her i thought it was amazing","1554":"i knew nothing of the revolution in cambodia and the rise of the khmer rouge this book educated me on that period and the author also developed a strong well drawn main character in raami who is really the author herself","1555":"this story is a first person glimpse at the actions of the khmer rouge in cambodia through the eyes of a 7 year old she grieves the loss of much of her family her lifestyle and her health with poetic prose and imagery it was a lovely yet difficult book","1556":" this was a difficult topic to read about since i vaguely remembered hearing about it toward the end of the vietnam war what struck me most was the terror inflicted on civilians by cruel soldiers and children who became soldiers because it was easier to hold a gun than a plow the cruelty and the indiscriminate killing was reminiscent of the nazis the author has a seven year old child as the narrator of the story unfortunately the narrator sounds like an adult and that throws the entire story off kilter it would have been much better had she written the book as a memoir","1557":" what a sad and heartbreaking book well written but so sad i do not know much about cambodia and this book covered the khmer rouge refime in 1975 1979 the family in this story was torn apart and treated miserably as were most people during this time when i read about the author and learned that she had experienced this personally it really hit home especially since she is about my age having graduated from high school in 1990 i am so glad she escaped survived and was able to write so hauntingly about this period of cambodian history november 2013 this book caught my eye at the library again so i picked it up not realizing i had already read it read it again and broke my hear all over again was struck this time by the fact that both the author and her sister had polio a disease most americans have been vaccinated against and don't have to worry about made me so sad to read how her sister died of polio again so glad she escaped and the fact that the author is close to my age made it all so real and yet unbelievable with all that she experienced in her life compared to my life so sad and i hope she has found happiness and family at last","1558":"beautifully written book about terrible events in cambodia","1559":"just finished and am speechless reading this book is a history lesson we all need","1560":" 1975 and the khmer rouge storm into phenom penh cambodia's capital city and this author's world changes forever using the medium of fiction she traces her family's journey set in the context of actual historical events you will be hooked into their lives sorrows and pain this book will take you into this war torn country and a little girl trying tomake sense of what's happen to her world her family and life as she knew it you are given an insider's view into the most complete social transformations in modern history","1561":"story written as fiction but based on the author's life as a child in cambodia during the brutal takeover by the khmer rouge and years of genocide and suffering of the cambodian people well written but not an easy subject matter a lot of foreshadowing so the book didn't have that can't put it down feel to it","1562":" i found it very difficult to get into the story the characters were hard to like and care about it's probably the writing style it felt removed from emotion in a way i was surprised to read at the end of the book that it was semi autobiographical i would have thought the emotion in the words would have been far greater than it was i knew some about the cambodian civil wars khmer rouge i'm sorry to say i enjoyed reading more about the history on wikipedia than in the pages of this book just not to my liking","1563":"not an easy book to read but i think an important one vaddey wants those gone to not be forgotten she does a lovely job of immortalizing the father in her story what i found most compelling is how she represented the indomitable human spirit i understand that this is based on her personal experience not a book for everyone but well written","1564":"this book will grab you right away and not let go taking you back to the horrors in cambodia under the khmer rouge based on ratner's own experiences the story of raami and her family is one of desperation horror and hope she brings the atrocities carried out by pol pot and the khmer rouge to vivid life her writing is honest beautiful and believable you will be moved from the revulsion of the horrors of political unrest to the glory of hope this debut should be on many top 10 lists come the end of 2012","1565":"a gripping account of the atrocities of the khmer rouge in cambodia through the eyes of a child intense well written story","1566":" \"for all the loss and tragedy i have known my life has taught me that the human spirit like the lifted hands of the blind will rise above chaos and destruction as wings in flight\"excerpt from ratner vaddey \"in the shadow of the banyan \" simon u0026amp schuster ibooks amazing just amazing this is the story of a little girl in cambodia in the mid 70's as the khmer rouge overtake her country raami is 7 years old and a member of the cambodian royal family her beloved father is \"his highness prince sisowath ayuravann which makes raami a princess the author vaddey ratner is the true daughter of prince sisowath in reality she was 5 when the khmer rouge came to power this is her story told through the eyes of her 'fictional' character 'raami' of her entire extended family grandmother aunts uncles cousins only raami and her mother are left alive and escape to a un refugee camp in thailand this is her account of the horrors of the time man's inhumanity to man yet it is told through the uplifting spirit of the will to survive the unbreakable love of family and the connection of humanity itself this definitely goes on the all time favorites list","1567":"difficult to read because of the subject matter but written like poetry it is about love and resiliance in the face of atrocity highly autobiographical the author must be an amazing person","1568":"spoilers ahead powerful very well informative prior to reading in the shadow of the banyan i naively thought of cambodia as nothing but a huge buddhist temple their flag but i now realized that it is something one of the most emotionally arousing novels i have ever read but the novel's pace of events seems out of order the writer emphasized the daily routine in the fields describing every single minor detail yet chapter 21 started with radana died it could have been a lot more dramatic the ending is just another example everything happened way too fast some people died on the way overall i loved it but it could have been shorter","1569":" as i got into the book i wondered where was i and what was i doing when all this was going on i guess just living life and raising 4 kids i had no idea this was going on but then i'm sure lots is going on that i'm unaware of in this world right now i enjoyed this book for the knowledge that it gave me it was very sad hard to believe that a 7 year old could be so grown up think so much like an adult but in circumstances such that she went through who knows how a person would feel or respond this is a don't read if you are tender hearted or if you don't like sadness this book is full of it","1570":" a hauntingly beautiful book set in cambodia during the khmer rouge regime and genocide told through the eyes of raani a 7 year old child as one reviewer said because we are seeing the events unfold through the eyes and within the heart of a seven year old girl we are twisted and wrenched by a child's vulnerability and hope but spared the most gruesome details of torture and obliteration in many ways this is a grace for it allows us to focus on the child's small world of her privileged family and their servants without being overwhelmed by the incomprehensible horror of cambodia's civil war but it also renders some characters shadowy and incomplete and glosses over context that would have helped create a firmer narrative the book is all the more haunting when you realize ti is based on the author's story i am still thinking about this book weeks later","1571":" i started this book and had the chance to visit cambodia while halfway through reading it what transpired in the book and linking it to my whole experience in cambodia the place the people the culture the sights and smells made it a whole different experience seeing how the country has gone through so much and only now it was picking itself up rebuilding one person at a time i have never read a book this emotionally charged before the pages filled with literary lust a mix of both despair and hope throughout a fantastically written memoir and to write it from the innocence of a child combining it with the brutality and lies that goes in a war together with the sense of detail of what went through the dark years of cambodia really makes the book alive","1572":" this novel was slow going for me this was a story the author admits is pretty much her own of a childhood derailed and torn apart by the revolution in cambodia in the 1970s as a sheltered and privileged child she and her family are particularly vulnerable and very much unaware of what is brewing around them as they are evacuated from phnom penh and sent off to become farm laborers maybe it's just that she writes it a little too carefully hanging on to people and moments a beat too long fleshing them out with a little too much poetry but i found her voice to be much more mature than seemed possible for a child narrator even one who had to grow up fast in a matter of months so as fascinating as i found the story to be i wish the child had told the story as a child or that the adult that child became had told it from a more mature point of view but i was grateful to read this story this inside view of a place and time where idealism and reality showed different faces and very little of it seeped out into the world until long after so much damage was done and so many lives were lost","1573":"haunting beautifully told based on the author's own experiences under the khmer rouge in cambodia in the mid to late 1970s well worth a read","1574":"the core of this story is very moving but it is layered in so much flowery language and imagery that i just couldn't rate it higher","1575":"fantastic book amazing u0026amp heartbreaking story of the events in cambodia between 1974 and 1979 told from the point of view of a 7 year old girl you won't soon forget this book","1576":"a mark of a good book for me is if it entices me to learn more about the subject this book certainly achieved that as i know very little of the khmer rouge as upsetting and devastating as the story is i never cried which is perplexing given the horrors","1577":" whether you know a little or a lot about the khmer rouge of cambodia this is a must read it is so provocative in a way that is no unsettling but reminds us of the fragility of life and the resistance of children in particular it is also beautifully written a prose that is both lithe visual and absolutely heartbreaking told through the eyes basically of the author as a child of 7 though fiction it is the author's story and just like malala's the life of malala current best seller is a critical story to tell so is this the atrocities suffered by the cambodian people are portrayed so personally it is books like this when i ask myself how can this happen that i am reminded it happens all the time all over the world and there seems no end for the maniacal quest for political power i highly recommend this book which is the reason for the 5 star","1578":"in the shadow of the banyan is a soul wrenching story written with such beauty and intensity that i was carried along to the end transfixed this period of history should never be forgotten and hopefully never ever repeated thank you vaddney for bringing it alive in your amazing book","1579":"i learned so much about cambodia and the khmer rouge sad but hopeful story very poetic and well written i loved the spirit of the main character","1580":"incredibly sad but this book is so full of beautiful stories and poetry it moved me deeply as did this tragic period of history in cambodia","1581":"this is such a heart wrenching overwhelming and at the same time inspiring book it was so hard for me to believe that this author's mind survived such horrific atrocities it is a sometimes difficult book to read but i am glad that i did","1582":" a really compelling use of historical fiction this book allowed the author to tell the essence of her family's story in a very compelling narrative sometimes the main character's insights she's a young girl seem a little far fetched and the writing can get a bit too metaphorical a bit too beautiful however i thought that unlike many authors who try to balance the need to tell the historical story alongside the character narrative that the combination really worked in this book it certainly provided new insights into cambodian history and culture","1583":"this was an excellent story of how civilians were affected by the invasion it has beautiful language wonderful descriptions of the surroundings and some very real characters","1584":"it took me a little while to get into this book it's not the most uplifting tale but life isn't all rainbows and fairy farts the story is an important one for perspective and renewal of thankfulness for the many things we take for granted all the time some passages in this book that are stunningly written they capture dreams in words and immerse the reader fully","1585":" i probably shouldn't admit that i know next to nothing about what the khmer rouge did in cambodia in the 1970s i know a lot more now and it's devastating told through 7 year old raami's perspective the reader learns how the khmer rouge yanked families from their homes tore them apart then tortured starved and killed them all in the name of communism the writing is beautiful and palpably evokes the sweet tender bond between raami and her father the relationship with her mother is more complicated yet ultimately understandable and eventually sweet and tender in its own way the author's true story is as heartbreaking and redemptive as her fictionalized account of it this is one worth reading","1586":"after high expactaions this book is disappointing","1587":"after all the rave reviews i was expecting to be blown away by this the first 20 pages really drew me in but once things started happening outside of the family home it started to move really slowly there were also too many little mythical stories sprinkled around that imo didn't add to the story glad i'm finished it","1588":"inspiring story well worth the read","1589":" this work walks the line between fiction and autobiography the author really is a descendant of king sisowath and her family did live through the events that raami's family endure in the book i can't say much in the way of criticism since the book is so deeply personal because the narrator of the book is a child readers are spared a lot of the horror that an adult narrator would have described that being said there are plenty of examples of brutality and depravity that she is aware of so it's not as if the book is full of fluff there is a theme of lyricism and poetry through the book which some people might find off putting but i didn't mind it","1590":"the author was the only surviving family member in the cambodian khmer rouge tragedy this account based on her experience is an homage to her father","1591":"one of the saddest most beautifully written and compelling books that i have read in a long time it's not an easy read and the story is gut renching at times takes place in the 1970s during the khmer rouge era in cambodia but gave me a whole new understanding of what this country went through and how their citizens suffered at the hands of their peers definitely add it to your list","1592":" \"they say mine is a ravaged land scarred and broken by hate on a path to self extermination yet no other placeso resembles my dream of heaven the lotus fields that cradle my home each flower a reincarnated spirit or perhaps like me a child who wishes to be rebornshould dreams become possible again it's true mine is a life of povertymy home a half built thatched hut its walls the winds and rains \"in the shadow of the banyan is a remarkable work of fiction based on the author's real life experiences and family members it takes place in cambodia during the reign of the khmer rouge born in phnom penh the author's father was a member of nobility and an intellectual while they questioned the inequity of their culture the coup of 1970 developed into an equally corrupt system people were forced into labor camps starved and executed families separated the vision of a socialist utopia had turned in to a form of genocide anyone perceived as an enemy of the state was systematically removed overthrown by the vietnamese in 1979 an estimated third of the population had died vaddey ratner worked such a significant number of parallels into her novel that in my humble opinion it is more a memoir she suffered from polio and lost her father among other things without giving away the story a reader should be prepared for the brutality and loss the main character raami survives in part through the transforming nature of her father's poetry and stories and ratner's writing is as lyrical and laden with metaphors when her father's royal status is discovered he basically sacrifices himself to their captors in trying to explain to his daughter why he's leaving he says \"i told you stories to give you wings raami so that you would never be trapped by anything - your name your title the limits of your body this world's suffering yes its true everywhere you look there is suffering - an old man has disappeared a baby died and his coffin is a desk we live in the classrooms haunted by ghosts this sacred ground is stained with the blood of murdered monks my greatest desire is to see you live if i must suffer so that you can live then i will gladly give up life for you just as i once gave up everything to see you walk \"in my first years teaching in mn in the mid 70's i lived in an old 3 story six plex whose bottom apartments were rented by a local church to house the cambodians they sponsored the family who lived underneath me had a little girl about raami's age i remember with horror the stories they told about losing all they owned in the revolution the forced labor the beatings escaping through the rice paddies at night threats of cutting off fingers when the khmer rouge couldn't get rings off months and years in refugee camps this book brought back lots of memories","1593":"1 3 of the entire population during that time they trampled on the culture and traditions of an ancient society and plunged the country into utter chaos it was one the most misguided revolutions ever ratner tells the story from in the shadow of the banyanthough ratner's book is fictional it is closely based on her life ratner was a privileged child an actual princess when the khmer rouge descended upon cambodia unleashing four years of murder horror and brutality killing as many as  1\/4  1 3 of the entire population during that time they trampled on the culture and traditions of an ancient society and plunged the country into utter chaos it was one the most misguided revolutions ever ratner tells the story from the perspective of a child and since ratner actually writes the novel as an adult her main character raami has a sensitivity and sophistication well beyond her years this contrast was at times difficult to reconcile however ratner's poetic style and ability to see beauty and hope where others in her circumstances would see only despair make this ultimately an uplifting book it amazes me that this bleak time in cambodia's history has not featured more in the public consciousness ratner's book brings the reality home","1594":"beautifully written","1595":" based loosely on the author's own experiences during the war in cambodia this novel is told from the perspective of 7 year old raami who witnesses the horrors that her family is put through after the khmer rouge take over it is of course a haunting story and the fact that it is told from the perspective of a child means you are brought into this world without understanding what is really happening or why it would have been antithetical to the point of this decision to make the child the only narrator but i would have liked to have more inclusion of the actual war and what was driving the different factions particularly the khmer rouge it's entirely my own fault that my knowledge about this period in cambodian history is sketchy at best but i felt like it was difficult for me to truly understand what was happening as the khmer rouge often felt like nameless faceless evildoers i suppose this is the same place that the child in the book was coming from though and perhaps many adults in the country as well","1596":"told in a narrative style mixing with traditional cambodian stories and poems this book tells the story of the cambodian genocide raami is a young girl growing up during the 1970's her entire country is in turmoil and she is forced to deal with the loss of her family little by little you can feel her sorrow it's palpable the writing is really good it reminded me of a memoir i read in college it is astonishing that groups all over the world commit these kinds of atrocities and they are happening even now","1597":" 31 in the shadow of the banyanby vaddey ratner5 starspp 322question mark and the mysterians sang 99 tears and barbra streisand \"cry me a river\" i don't know about the number for sure and i don't know if it will make a river but i do know while reading in the shadow of the banyan any person who is not heavily anesthetized will cry buckets of tears years ago i had read the killing fields as well as an illustrated national geographic article about the khmer rouge so i was prepared for something harrowing in the shadow of the banyan tree is a novelization of vaddey ratners early years and her and her families experience during the years when the organization or known in the west as the khmer rouge were in power we know that millions died during their reign but seeing it through the eyes of a child is a powerful image ratner wanted to highlight the human desire for survival but i was so impressed with the way she did it which showed such a tremendous amount of grace dignity and love vaddey's family was royalty her father was a poet and a prince he longed for a more democratic society his thoughts and poetry were profound and he almost existed on another plain but he wanted to impart himself and his great love of his country and his culture to his young daughter who had suffered from polio in her early years in the beginning of the story we are imbued with the sense of love closeness and grace which existed in the young raami's household and which she was cocooned in poetry is like that papa said it can move to you in an intake of breath vanish again in the blink of an eye and first all you have is ta line weaving through your minetlike the tail of a childs kitetunfettered by reason or rhyme then he said comes the rest the kite the story itself a complete entity t the branches of the banyan tree in the middle of the courtyard stirred and the leaves danced some of the branches were so long they reached all the way to the balcony the shadow of their leaves covering my body like patches of silk i twirled arms stretched out mumbling an skinny one plump one incantation to myself call forth the tevodas \"and then suddenly the khmer rouge enters phnom penh and the whole population of the city is forced to leave ratner's telling of her story is gifted the reader is left with the sense a sense of the deep family identity while the reader senses how precarious her families position is as both royalty wealthy and intellectual one also feels how cocoon the children are in their love and caring and careful guidance what follows is a story both beautiful and horrific beyond belief","1598":"one of the most beautiful books i've read in a very long time so much so that i made my husband read portions of it and we now refer to things almost as beautiful as the banyan book","1599":"excellent book this book tells the story of the atrocities committed by the khmer rouge regime in cambodia between 1975 and 1979 for seven year old raami the shattering end of childhood begins with the footsteps of her father returning home and bring details of the civil war in phnom penh cambodia's capital this is a story of her survival and the details of those years of struggle","1600":" i'd like to give this book 3 3 stars i know that a lot of people find it really well written but i found it to be compellingly written without being especially well written there were passages that were overwritten especially when you consider that the narrative voice is supposed to be that of a 7 year old in the end i found the general structure and scope of the story to be quite wonderful in much the same way that cat's table by michael ondaatje told the story of a voyage not about what happens after the young travels arrive at their destination so this story was not about life after the khmer rouge regime but all about the period of life lived while subject to their insane brand of torture violence and cruelty at first the novel struck me as having a decidedly underwhelming scope and a lack of historical context facts but in the end what emerged was a heartbreaking version of what a young child experienced and could barely comprehend the child's point of view didn't really always ring true but the leisurely narrative pace enables the reader to feel somewhat present in the various camps villages and oxcarts that little raami passes through","1601":" raami is an eight year old girl who adapts to and barely survives the revolutionary coup of the khmer rouge based upon author vaddey rattner's childhood experience she adopts the voice of her royal father an intellectual storyteller and poet to recount the horrors that befall cambodia and her family as they are stripped of their home their wealth and position and each other her father sacrifices his own life with the hope that raami as well as her sister mother and extended family might survive his sacrifice fails to save most of his family who one by one perish from starvation disease execution or self defeat but raami's strength of spirit allows her and her mother to overcome those who killed her family and her fellow citizens and destroyed her homeland the despair of the events recounted is counterbalanced by raami's search for beauty in the landscape and in the people she loves","1602":" what beautiful language the author uses to write about an atrocious experience as she tells about her experiences as a child during the cambodian vietnamese war in a fictionalized account i was touched deeply with the horror of living through such a holocaust contrasted with the deep love and sensitivity of her family this story deserves more than one read but how could one bear reading of these atrocities more than once even my worst nightmares seem mild compared to what this family and their countrymen experienced i was struck by a number of things among them the writer's use of language is pristine and rings like crystal an oppressed people may rise up with drastic and cruel methods when they feel they are pounded to the ground those who carry out war do not always know why or how many innocent people are struck down when war erupts some parents are wise and noble even under the direst of circumstances love is often misunderstood more than once i thought of the wars currently raging in the middle east and wondered what i misunderstood in my mass mentality modeas i read i came to think of ratner's account as a diary her detail of daily life is great but no where did it seem excessive i understand this is a debut novel i hope vaddey ratner writes more reading her fluid language is such a pleasure her wisdom is beyond the norm for those who enjoy reading the reviews of others be sure to search banyon as well as banyan there are other reviews under the banyon misspelling","1603":"a thoughtful and strangely beautiful account of the horrifying cambodian revolution of the late 70s as seen through the questioning and innocent eyes of a child for young raami inspirational and insightful stories told to her by her poet father help her to endure the brutal horror of genocide and human suffering and rise above the atrocities to soar on the wings of her father's dreams for her future i especially enjoyed the wise and enlightening buddhist philosophy that is so lyrically woven into the narrative i felt myself learning and growing alongside raami as the lessons and imagery of her father's stories battle the ruthless despair of the killing fields and triumph highly recommended","1604":" this semi autobiographical novel is based on the invasion of the khmer rough in cambodia during the 1970's although it contains beautifully graphic descriptions of scenery and the cambodian folklore i really struggled to connect with this book the story was told mainly in metaphorical flowery prose by a narrator whose voice didn't ring true no 7 year old child no matter how precocious could remember so much detail or draw such poignant connections and observations of her surroundings perhaps if the book was written in the form of an adult looking back it would have felt more authentic i did however enjoy the author's note at the end of the book about her actual experience during this horrific time it outlined what the khmer rouge occupation which made me understand the severity of the situation i am still trying to figure out exactly why i did not enjoy this book besides the issues i had about the narrator this past year or two i have been fascinated and drawn to books exactly like this but for some reason it never captured my attention even though i so desperately wanted to love this book","1605":"a book rich in description and meaning not the easiest read in the world because it is such a difficult topic but having been to cambodia i appreciated the authors story this story is both depressing and inspiring it's haunting how a group of people could try and wipe out an entire population yet the will of the human spirit can survive despite the atrocities","1606":"i remember the first time i heard and saw pictures coming out of cambodia what the khmer rouge regime did to their own was chilling this book took me thru what a child endured to get out i loved the author's notes and the last line about giving voice to all those who were silenced not a bio but the essence of what took place very much worth reading every word","1607":"this book may be stronger than 3 stars i learned a lot from it about the killing fields years in cambodia in the 1970's a lot about the life and customs and habits of different classes of cambodian people and i developed a deep sense of empathy for the narrator and main character who is a thinly veiled version of the author however the book did not touch me as i hoped it would nevertheless i recommend it it is a well told very sad story","1608":"incredible true story novel by first time author vaddy ratner of her life and exodus from war torn cambodia it will make you wept to read of the suffering but the amazing drive to live and love","1609":"the perspective in which the story is told from the eyes of a 7 year old girl make the horrific story about the khmer rouge regime in cambodia palatable a gripping and beautifully told historical fiction piece based on the author's real life story","1610":"the story of modern cambodia is filled with such sadness and horror that it must be almost impossible for these who live through it to be able to tell their story who would believe that such a thing could happen and has happened again several times since i think the reader gets off lightly in this book as tragic as the events in this book are the true extent of the cambodia genocide will haunt you when you hear the full story","1611":" this is a semi autobiographical novel by a woman who endured a horrible childhood at the hands of the khmer rouge she was one of a dozen cambodian royal family members outed by the khmer rouge and unfortunately only she and her mother surived the others were brutally murdered she and her mother exhibit a phenomenal will to live what makes the book readable is the author describes beauty and ugliness on the same pages of the novel she has an eye for detail and the for the loveliness of nature in her homeland","1612":"this was a brilliant disturbing book it is fitting that i finished it on sept 11 in that it tells the story of the khmer rouge in cambodia through a child's eyes beautifully written","1613":"an absolutely beautifully written novel of unspeakable tragedy the author is a survivor of cambodia's killing fields and wrote a novel about her experiences","1614":" i read in the shadow of the banyan at the beginning of the month it took me three and a half days to read but then plunged me into a week worth of thought we're nearing the close of the month of may and i still can't get this book off my mind i figure my reading for the month of may was all worth it because i had the pleasure of experiencing my second 5 star book of the year 2014 now if you've been following me here or over at frenchiedee you know that i absolutely don't have a habit of giving out 5 star ratings in the shadow of the banyan is the fictionalised story of vaddey ratner's four year ordeal living through the genocide that took place in cambodia once the khmer rouge took over in 1975 the main character is called raami and she is seven years old when the story begins the first few chapters we are introduced to her family and their lifestyle they are a wealthy and privileged family they are a royal family in cambodia and her father is a poet as well soon there after we learn that the khmer rouge have taken over the country and are driving the population from the city to the countryside there they are made to work in the rice paddies surviving on little food the khmer rouge are enforcing marxist philosophy on the population and forcing them to forget life as it was before people of privilege professors scientists teachers artists musicians etc are hunted down and killed they are perceived as enemies to the organization this story is more than just a retelling of a historical event and of ratner's experience it is a story of human survival one wonders how they would behave if they had to go through such a situation i thought through it so much and feel as though i would have caved in and hoped for a swift death ratner shows the limits of human beings and how survival is not necessarily dictated by what one may think raami thinks a lot of her father the things she remembers that he said to her and of his poetry sometimes it's the simplest things that can help someone to survive the writing in in the shadow of the banyan is absolutely beautiful that ratner could write such beautiful prose about such a blight on cambodian history and on her family is remarkable since we see this story through the eyes of a seven year old things are recounted with much detail this detail may be perceived as wordy but i assure you that it is not the case the descriptions are there so that we as readers are literally transported to cambodia we see feel and taste what raami describes there were passages that were difficult to read but ratner's writing becomes a metaphor for the insidious behaviour of the khmer rouge in the beginning the people don't understand what is happening to them but quickly things change and they realise they are trapped in horror even raami develops over the 410 pages tremendously in the beginning she is naive young and joyful despite her handicap but her character development is portrayed with the right flow of the story another interesting aspect of this story is the relationship between mother and daughter in such a traumatic life death event their relationship at the beginning of the story seems fairly undefined but thrown into the uncertainty of this historical event mother and daughter learn a lot about each other and marvel over each others' strengths this is one of the most touching parts of the story i just can't gush enough over this novel it's a must read pick this one up because you won't regret it","1615":"i enjoyed it it is similar books i have read about the overthrow of traditional governments the question i continue to ask myself is whether it was the depth of the oppression and the divide between the haves and the have nots that cause such a violent reaction my thought is that the outcome is not just rooted in the ideology of the revolutionary forces but in the suffering by the old regime i use the french revolution as my guide the united states has never suffered such a gulf between the haves and have nots and so it is hard to judge these issues as a book it was well written full of heroic and good people","1616":"great history on the cambodian war","1617":"an incredibly beautiful book it is prose that sounds and flows like poetry the messages contained therein are the sort that you can carry with you and reference in times of turmoil and struggle the fullness of the love between the father and his daughter is the kind we should all strive to emulate","1618":"this novel reminds of just how sheltered my life growing up in the united states has been each time i read a novel with such atrocities committed against others set during my lifetime i feel we haven't made much progress at all in equitable relations keeping hope alive during a revolution and a refugee experience such as this puts my whining to shame","1619":"what a beautifully written book although i think the level of maturity and complexity of thoughts expressed were a bit of a stretch for a 7 year old it is hard to say how quickly children mature in war torn areas i really loved it","1620":"heartbreaking poetic powerful life affirming in the midst of evil","1621":"this book was really good worth picking up i found i really felt i was with raami experiencing her childhood in cambodia before reading this book i was not fully aware of what happened in cambodia it's was truly upsetting and eye opening a great read","1622":" this novel told from the perspective of a 7 year old girl and based on the author's life experiences tells the horrific story of a family torn from its privileged intellectual life in phnom penn and brutalized by khmer rouge communists in cambodia in the late 1970s the story is poignant from the perspective of the girl's relationship to her mother father and sister and the backdrop of cambodian buddhist spiritual values as well as the socio political perspective the beauty and the brutality of the family's situation are dramatically set side by side beautifully written too","1623":"i love the theme of why do we tell stories this shows the importance of hope through the realities of life and death powerful","1624":"in the shadow of the banyan is a beautifully written story about a terrible period in the history of cambodia the author tells the story of a young girl and her family during the revolution in cambodia the book is in fact mostly her own story even though it is a tale of sorrow and suffering the mood is never suffocatingly sad due to beautiful descriptions throughout after reading this i found myself missing and thinking of the characters i always take that as the sign of a good book","1625":"this is a novelized memoir of ms ratner recollections of surviving the khymer rouge in cambodia she was a princess aged 5 when her world toppled this can be a tough read because of so much experienced loss exposure of a child to horrors however it really is an amazing story of survival under the wretched circumstances an additional positive the reader is exposed to some of the cultural spirituality of the cambodian people partly thru the soulful poetic writing","1626":"beautifully inspirational and heartbreaking","1627":"this is an exquisite piece of literature ratner's exceptional use of imagery and language makes this beautiful interesting and informative story come to life i highly recommend this book","1628":" i was really disappointed in this novel had read so many reviews that made it sound so breathtaking and it was just not in a writing style i could get into i was sooooo bored throughout most of the book there was just to much descriptive writing for me towards the end it finally started to hold my interest but we're talking the last few chapters so yes this is a beautiful book with an account of a historical time that is heartrending and if you like this style of writing you will love it if like me you don't you will find yourself taking forever to read it","1629":"this was a beautifully written book and deeply touching i enjoyed the way the author described everything in such lovely wording it was very gripping and easy to listen to it gave a glimpse into the change in culture in a country taken over by war","1630":"it is a story about a vietnamese family who suffer deprivations and poverty after the takeover by the khymer rouge the novel is told from the point of view of a child it is gripping in parts but there's way too much description however i do recommend it","1631":"this is a book i have wanted to read for some time but it keeps slipping past my radar when i go to look for a book i am so glad that i took the time to read it though it is the powerful story of a family living in cambodia at the time of the khmer rouge takeover and what they are put through during this horrific time i don't recall this getting much press here in america and i think it's another time period and event that we need to be aware of","1632":"i loved this book i loved this book i loved this book it is definitely in my top 10 i loved the writing the story the characters it all worked for me i will be ordering my own copy on amazon so that i can read it again and again i was completely attached to the characters they weren't overly sappy or down it felt like the right mix i loved the father what a good and wise dad i also felt for the mother the descriptive strokes were elevated in such a vivid and understandable way i think that is my favorite part","1633":"one of the best novels i have read in ages the heartbreaking story of a well to do family in cambodia under the control of the khmer rouge in the late 20th century i cannot recommend this book strongly enough","1634":"this gave me night mares i read more than half the book and could read no more it was just to sad","1635":" wow hauntingly beautiful sad where do i start i knew about the atrocities committed by the khmer rouge but this book really made it personal at first i thought it was a little implausible that the protagonist is supposed to be 7 years old yet is so mature and learned this coming from someone who also had her nose in a book all the time at 7 years old but i was reading nancy drew not my country's national literature however as the story moved along the author managed to make it work she conveys how devastating the situation was but somehow manages to make it bearable to turn the next page not an easy task with such horrifying conditions i highly recommend this to anyone who wants to know about the personal aspects and not dry statistics","1636":"this is a beautifully written book about a tragic period of time in cambodia beside the killing fields i really did not know much about the cambodian revolution vaddey ratner happens to be a friend and neighbor iurge everyone to read this work of fiction but is aslo based on her and her family's experience to as never to forget what the horror that the cambodian people lived through","1637":"in the shadow of the banyan is based on the authors life when the khmer rouge cameto power and killed at least 2 million of their own people

thank you leslie for recommending an extraordinary book","1638":"i enjoyed the writing and wouldn't mind reading a follow up if the author were to write one","1639":"i know nothing of cambodia and only a smattering about the khmer rouge but so i found this to be a very interesting gripping tender but ultimately triumphant read this semi autobiographical novel demonstrates the overwhelming preservation instinct we all possess","1640":"this book moved me i highly recommend","1641":"a heartbreaking but ultimately hopeful story of survival during the cambodian holocaust under the reign of the khmer rouge based on the experiences of the author as a young girl beautifully written","1642":"i thoroughly enjoy historical fiction and vividly remember the horrors committed by the khmer rouge while the story is clearly fiction the author has used her own life experiences to tell her story an excellent read that tells a truly tragic story definitely worth reading and ideal for book clubs","1643":"beautifully written story about the cambodian war highly recommend","1644":" the novel in a shadow of the banyan by vaddey ratner was highly recommended by simon u0026amp schuster in their september newsletter i also had a connection to this novel from the past synopsis raami and her family begin their story in their home in phnom phenh they are a branch of the royal family there has been much war and conflict in cambodia during the years of 1970 1975 one day raami's father comes home and says the war has ended what started as optimism after the war's end quickly changes when the khmer rouge comes to power everyone is asked to exit the city because the americans will bomb it there is no choice but to leave or die raami and her family think this is a short term effect but is it really will the family be able to stay together my thoughts this novel interested me because in high school i was part of a drama club that performed the play to destroy you is no loss so to prepare for this review i watched the killing fields which i also saw in high school i also researched who the khmer rouge was i was dismayed to learn that even after their reign ended in 1979 they maintained some power i know that this novel had to be therapeutic for the author who is also a survivor of the khmer rouge period the author vaddey ratner was a princess in the cambodia royal family she had to hide this fact during her time under the khmer rouge or risk being shot i found this story heart breaking and had a hard time reading about the deaths in this book do you think you could survive something like this","1645":"remarkable story telling and more this is a story of a young girl in cambodia when revolutionaries overtook the country creating chaos fear displacing millions from their homes separating families forcing the population to work like slaves starving and killing people for the slightest infraction or just because under the worst possible cruel conditions could there possibly be a reason to keep on living i almost didn't read this book knowing that it would be sad and it was but it was also deep profound touching and unforgettable","1646":"a historical fiction of a true travesty told from the perspective of a young girl that is tragically based on fact","1647":"this was a 3 5 for me but when i read the author's notes and how it was based on her personal story i gladly give it a 4 this was the first book i've ever read about cambodia's history and their revolution in the 70's terrible democracy is imperfect but still the best","1648":"this book is beautifully written and absolutely heartbreaking the atrocities of the cambodian killing fields are portrayed so personally but balanced with finding good and beauty in the world all through the eyes of a seven year old girl the story is a fictionalized memoir and the author states that nothing happened in the book that she didn't experience herself i highly recommend this book i know it will stay with me for a very long time","1649":"rdcover|isbn 978 1 4516 5770 8you are about to read an extraordinary story it will take you to the very depths of despair and show you unspeakable horrors it will reveal a gorgeously rich culture struggling to survive through a furtive bow a hidden ankle bracelet fragments of remembered poetry it will ensure that the world never forgets the atrocities committed by the khmer rouge regime in cambodia between 1975 and 1979 when an estimated two million people lost their lives it will give you hope and it will confirm the power of storytelling to lift us up and help us not only survive but transcend suffering cruelty and loss for seven year old raami the shattering end of childhood begins with the footsteps of her father returning home in the early dawn hours bringing details of the civil war that has overwhelmed the streets of phnom penh cambodia's capital soon the family's world of carefully guarded royal privilege is swept up in the chaos of revolution and forced exodus raami clings to the only remaining vestige of her childhood - the mythical legends and poems told to her by her father in a climate of systematic violence where memory is sickness and justification for execution raami fights for her improbable survival displaying the author's extraordinary gift for language in the shadow of the banyan is a brilliantly wrought tale of human resilience my review the utter horror raami lived through is truly heartbreaking especially for a young girl of seven raami is a strong girl who possesses more strength and courage than i've seen in kids twice her age and moreraami was only five years old when the khmer rouge overtook her home in cambodia between 1975 and 1979 she was immediately thrust into a world of cruelty poverty hunger and starvation her beloved father a royal was imprisoned and she never saw him again his book of poetry he had written is what she remembers and it helps keep her moving forward raami her mother and baby sister were able to stay together while her uncle and cousins were sent to die in labour camps and raami's baby sister is stricken with malaria this was truly a heart wrenching story where it has been estimated that the cambodian genocide was responsible for the deaths of some 1 7 million people a huge proportionate of the entire population of the entire country the story is written in the first person and told through the eyes of raami the words are so beautifully written a real talent for a first time author an extraordinary story that takes you to the impossible highs and lows of what human beings can do in this life both on the good side and the bad this is a story that will reach deep inside your soul and leave you shivering i would highly recommend this book to anyone and believe it needs to be read for the sake of the people who died and those still living that suffered through this terrible tragedy","1650":"having taught 20th century world history cambodia in the 1970's is always one of the weirdest evilest saddest stories out there from a group of revolutionaries who believe or at least said that you can re shape what makes us human just because they say so comes the disaster of the rule of the khmer rouge in reading about them after the book shame on any country or organization that actually recognized their rule the author is a descendant of the pre revolutionary royal family her story is classified as fiction but is based on many of her real life experiences very worthy of a read","1651":"amazing book about the cambodian killing fields of the khmer rouge told by a 7 10 year old girl who went through it with her family this book is devastating even though it is a fictionalized account","1652":"this is a story of the khmer rouge's atrocities between 1975 and 1979 it is fiction based on the real life story of a royal family it's a heartbreaking and yet inspiring story of the human spirit and its desire to survive in order to honor those that haven't beautifully written and edited at times seeming poetic and with a heavy reliance on allegory","1653":"a wonderfully written novel based on the author's real life experiences growing up under the khmer route regime in cambodia","1654":"a vivid and so devastating tale of life and death under the khmer rouge tender painful dreadful and unforgettable","1655":"to think that someone could live through such an ordeal and not only survive but go on to great things i knew nothing about cambodia and learned a lot","1656":"this book i loved the writing the story telling such a heartbreaking story yet so full of love and beautiful things still and the writing oh my the writing ","1657":"i hadn't planned to read this book as the location historical connection didn't interest me at all but i found that part fascinating since i obviously knew very little about the place and the revolution that happened for a book that had a lot of bad stuff in it it didn't move me much not sure why obviously i'm in the minority as many claim it brought them to tears maybe the good times and there were a few were emphasized as much as the bad times","1658":"very very did i say very sad but so beautifully written and i learned so much definitely recommend this","1659":"this book was okay although listed as a novel the author does state at the end of the book that she lived through this terrible four years of being routed from her home at age five and moved from one town to another as she lost one family member after another and the khmer rouge murderded thousands for their cause they were trying to destroy the aristocracy","1660":"while fiction the story parallels the childhood of the author she grew up in cambodia in the early 70s during the war her family was royalty but that didn't matter chilling and sad story about love family and endurance","1661":"a constant battle between poetry and prose nonetheless powerful and horrific","1662":" a beautifully written story of raami and her mother's survival in the first few years of the khmer rouge's harsh reign of terror in mid 1970's cambodia the poetic language of ratner's writing is in perfect juxtaposition to the brutal horror of the story as raami loses most of her family including her beloved papa an educated prince who teaches her that despite her polio she has strength to endure and wings to fly the author's note at the end of the book explains that reaami's story is largely the author's own my favorite characters were mae and pok am elderly peasant couple assigned to house raami her mother and her sister radana mae welcomes them as the daughters she never had and pok is a humble gentle presence who carves a calf as a gift for a cow to give shape to sorrow and teaches raami to swim","1663":"this book resonated for me especially because it is largely autobiographical not historical fiction based on research the little girl seemed so poetic and eloquent throughout the horrible events of the khmer rouge brutally taking over cambodia if the story hadn't been based on personal experiences i would have wondered more about its authenticity","1664":"i received this book for free as part of the first reads program on good reads in this heart wrenching novel ratner fictionalized her own experiences as a young girl caught up in the genocide f the khmer rouge in cambodia books about war and genocide are never fun to read but they are necessary for us to realize the horrors that happen in the world and to spur us to action against the tragedies that continue to terrorize civilians around he world this novel explains that even in the midst of unimaginable violence love hope and family can help one survive please read this book it's a good one","1665":"a semi autobiographical novel of a cambodian girl u0026amp her family enduring the horrors of the khmer rouge considering the author's real life plight--forced labor near starvation her family slaughtered she escaped to the us as a refugee--you don't want to be insensitive to the subject matter it's her powerful story she can tell it as she likes in this case it's with a mix of brutality a kind of lyrical buddhist idealism u0026amp ultimately a triumph of sorts honest sincere if not overly compelling there are shocking moments but not many surprising ones","1666":"unable to put it down even though i found it painful to read i cried at least three times and i mean bawled full of sadness and cambodian history don't miss this one","1667":"i think this may have been the saddest book that i have ever read it is about a cambodian family during the khmer rouge period in the seventies i keep thinking that all this was going on when i was in high school and i was totally oblivious to it","1668":"what i really like about this book is that the author has created a 7 year old narrator who sounds like a 7 year old not a 50 year old pretending to see the world through a child's eyes at the same time we are able to follow the action of the story and understand the events as they occur it is a rare talent and greatly appreciated by the reader raami the fictional 7 year old vietnamese girl who narrates the story is based on the real life memories of the author who was actually 5 years old in 1975 when these events occurred she had the misfortune to live at a time when the khmer rouge killed an estimated two million people in cambodia and the good fortune to survive the atrocities the story is both incredible and very believable at the same time i am always astounded when i read about communist leaders who try to root out all evil by killing intellectuals and closing schools and burning books whether in china or vietnam the results are always the same the inmates running the institution destroy it completely by their barbaric ignorance what's wrong with those people this is a sad but very moving and interesting piece of history which i can't say i enjoyed but i am glad i read it and i do recommend it","1669":"beautifully written although at times the many allusions to buddhist stories and concepts were a bit confusing after i looked back or wiki ed the stories related well to the novel towards the end was really heart wrenching and the very end seemed a bit rushed however still good","1670":" unbelievable book one of the best i've ever read suggested grade l b1 in 1975 the khmer rouge swept into power and turned five year old raami and her royal family's life upside down along with millions of other cambodians they were thrown out of their homes and herded into work camps in the countryside over the next four years raami experienced untold suffering as she witnessed her family along with millions of other cambodians starving dying of treatable illnesses or being executed by the increasingly paranoid regime this is a terrible tale of unspeakable cruelty and unthinkable suffering from which there are many lessons to learn in the worst of circumstances the ratner family demonstrated how to bear the most terrible suffering with dignity and heroism that few could imitate","1671":"this book was one that i've chosen not to give away as it is a gem the author's story is so compelling and heart wrenching yet so beautiful and uplifting i couldn't put it down and i haven't cried or felt such an emotional investment in the people or narrative of a book for a long time i think that everyone should own a copy of this book if only to remind oneself and be grateful for all the small and seemingly insignificant aspects of our daily lives","1672":"read my review on my blog http www 50ayear com 2012 07 31 20","1673":"i really liked this book giving the reader an insight as to what went on from 1973 1979 through the cambodian angle what these people endured we can never hope to find out for ourselves","1674":"interesting book gives a glimpse of a very different culture and yet some of the challenges that we all encounter i read it just before i decided to downsize my life after reading this book i knew that my decision was right less is more","1675":"truly riveting gloriously beautiful and devastating i was deeply moved by this fictional based on factual portrait it was life changing","1676":"if you don't know what happened in cambodia in the mid to late 70s please read this book what struck me the most is that in 1976 i was learning all 11 verses of yankee doodle dandy and riding around town on my new red white and blue bike another 7 to 9 year old was across the globe suffering so completely and grew up to write this fictionalized but based on her family story account of a completely different life than my own there but for the grace of geography go i vietnam got a lot of the world's attention but the misguided khmer rouge seemed to have carte blanche to terrorize their own citizens with barely a reaction from the world it reminds me a little bit of the present nigerian school girl kidnappings our book club didn't necessarily love the book and it probably could have been structured differently but i think it is worth the read","1677":" this time it was the kmer rouge killing their countrymen because they were not 'pure' enough to be part of the new government a young girl tells the tale from the view of her expereinces in 1975 in cambodia she loses everything but her hope which her father instilled in her through stories he told her the author was herself involved in such happenings so she brings extreme realism to the atrocities and experiences the story does notbecome maudlin it holds the reader's attention and keeps moving","1678":"this is really quite well written and emotionally touching it's interesting how she weaved together her own memories traditional khmer storytelling and added in enough historical context of the khmer rouge period to give readers a deeper sense of the whole as she admits in her notes she wrote it this way to layer her story and the fact that she was really too young to remember everything and write it simply as a memoir she is a little overindulgent in some of her language but it is really nothing too much to take away from what is a very good book it's a poignant testament to what a person can go through and somehow survive and not to forget the atrocities humans can do to each other and that many did not survive","1679":" t read in november 2013this is a heart breaking mostly true story of a little girl and her family caught up in the revolution in cambodia around 1975 they are part of the extended royal family and are targeted by the khymer rouge revolutionaries terrorists the systematic uprooting of people and separating family members was one tactic used to gain power brutality was rampant citizens faced terrible living situations forced labor starvation and execution for trivial reasons there are upllifting aspects however cambodia is descrbed as a breathtakingly beautiful country the heroine's father teaches her to appreciate the beauty around her even in dire cirumstances people manage to find quiet moments and to forge relationshipe even if they are fleeting also the story has a hopeful end people do survive and the khymer rouge are forced to run this story would be unbelievable if it weren't true less flagcomment * see review","1680":"heartbreaking and exquisite","1681":"i thought this was a very powerful and hypnotic story it has been a long time since i saw the killing fields but this book made me want to see it again to get a fuller sense of what happened in cambodia with the khmer rouge i think i was a little too young to appreciate the full horror of the cambodian genocide when i saw the movie the first time it's hard to believe that pol pot and co thought the best way to a better society was to flush people out the cities kill the intellectuals and go back to a purely agrarian society fascinating and horrifying how this could happen and this book gives a very visceral sense of how that could have happened i accidentally bought an extra copy of this book when i ordered a copy for my aunt but it was a happy accident because i had a hard time putting this book down for a couple of days there good read","1682":"a profoundly moving story of the attrocities of cambodia's kmer rouge and the reslience of the human spirit told through the eyes of a child it is a work of fiction however the book is closely based on the author's own experience while beautifully written the content is often difficult to read so much sadness so much struggle sometimes it is just all too much especially when you stop to think this really happened the cambodian genocide of 1975 1979 was a slow motion crime people were moved from place to place and elimiated slowly through famine disease and execution i knew very little about the kmer rouge before reading the book the book gives a clear picture of what went on the characters are so real so alive and personal that you want to stop reading because it is so painful yet the writing is so beautiful and poetic that it brings hope and beauty to the never ending sadness the characters have to endure my book is filled with underlines and dog ears i will refer back to many of the beautifully poetic lines in the future my favorite being this one which sums up my feelings of this story stories are like footpaths of the gods they lead us back and forth in time and space and connect us to the entire universe to people and beings we never see but who we feel exist","1683":"beautifully written book about a very tragic time in cambodian history brought me to tears on several occasions haunting","1684":" i finished this last night yes it was well done probably the reason i liked it was that it is based on the author's experiences from which she has crafted her novel i thought the end was better than the beginning the end very well depicted the horrors and the supreme idiocy of the khmer rouge regime the tamer beginning reflects the innocence of the young girl which is not inappropriate she was at the beginning only seven in reality the author was only five the traditional cambodian culture and buddhist beliefs are adroitly interwoven into the events there are beautiful stories told all part of the native culture this book can more accurately be described as a story about the author's father seen through the eyes of his beloved child the author his name is not changed in the novel he was a cambodian prince a man of of high ideals a poet and man of much wisdom his wisdom is not based on merely book knowledge but rather a deep morally sound understanding of people this is both a philosophical novel remember those stories and a historical novel the narrator greta lee easily read both the untranslated native language and english the young daughter is telling of her experiences from 1975 through to 1979 when the vietnamese entered the country squashing the khmer rouge freeing the cambodians the narrator does sound like a young girl not an easy task when describing such horrendous events perpetrated by the revolutionary soldiers this is the book to choose if you want to read about the khmer rouge and what they did 1975 1979 well done a splendid mix of a moving story that will pull your heart strings and give you the historical details too oh and there is a good author's note at the end","1685":"beautifully written story about how a practice of noticing beauty everywhere in our surroundings and in other people can keep your soul from being extinguished by hate","1686":"the author has beautifully narrated a touching story must read","1687":" one of the most beautiful books i've ever had the pleasure to read raami a seven year old daughter of a prince finds herself amidst revolution in cambodia where the khmer rouge destroyed a third of a nation raami's family is systematically ripped from her over a two year period each page is written with a surreal poetic dream like eloquence that makes this book no matter how brutal its topic is beautiful well deserved of the awards its won and startling to believe that vaddey ratner is raami and this is an almost true story exceptional read it if you enjoyed wild swans and a fine balance","1688":"beautifully written marvelous descriptions fabulous imagery horrible sadness","1689":"beautiful and stirring ratner's language seemed more like poetry than prose i went into this book feeling a little skeptical i'm not normally a fan of the trendy war child sub genre but knowing that the author was drawing from her own refugee experience gave me hope but after fifty pages fell in love the unique style drew me in but the characters captured me the evolution of raami her mother and big uncle were brilliant i loved the tone shifts as raami grows and becomes disillusioned and hopeless then later as she returns to herself battered and bruised but not broken the only thing that kept me from giving this book five stars was the ending it wasn't bad but it seemed rather rushed almost clumsy compared to the rest of the book however all in all it was wonderful they critics aren't lying when they call it a must read","1690":"a tough read about cambodian genocide took me two weeks to get through this one","1691":"this was a truely amazing book it was a sad but it was an inspiring and life changing story","1692":"this book is beautifully written and the story is incredible man's inhumanity to man has never ceased to amaze me and this is a story of how deep it can go","1693":"this novel was based on historical events in cambodia between 1975 and 1979 it is told from the point of view of a 7 year old girl i highly recommend it although it embodies much tragedy and horror","1694":"i read this book while i was in cambodia as it was one of the few books by cambodian authors in english that i could find i was hesitant everyone reads first they killed my father but aren't there books about cambodia that aren't about the genocide perpetuated by the khmer rouge isn't there more to cambodian culture and life but you have to let people speak for themselves i read this book anyway a fictionalized account of the authors real experiences as a little girl who survives the four year terror of the khmer rouge against all odds i cried most of the way through ratner's protagnist seven year old raami relies on the stories she learned from her father and other people in her family to find the strength beauty and hope she needs to survive the horror of her daily life i felt like these stories gave some insight into cambodian culture and ways of thinking but also made it impossible to fall back on any distance between the reader and raami to pretend like her suffering couldn't be ours ratner's world is very real as your reading the book and you can't pull yourself out of it and pretend like everything is okay it's terrifying and hard to read but just like raami you find little moments of hope or beauty like stepping stones through a lava river and you can rest for a moment and unlike raami you have the consolation of knowing she survives i read some of the material in the back of the book first specifically the interview with vaddey ratner and i felt like that gave me some very useful context for reading the book a similar interview talk is available on youtube if you look for vaddey ratner","1695":" a heart breaking and heart warming story about a 7 year old and her family who are caught in the rise to power of the khmer rouge in cambodia in the mid 1970's because it is told through the eyes of a young girl we are spared the graphic details of all that occurred there i loved the innocence through which she looks at being relocated multiple times and being separated from members of her family and yet as the novel continues and she becomes more aware of what's happening around her her innocence is whittled away the way she tells the story becomes less dreamy and poetic and more realistic this story is made even more heart breaking when we learn at the end of the novel that this is the author's story i can't even imagine worth reading to learn the strength of the human spirit to survive and learn to love again","1696":"really good book loved it","1697":"beautifully written although i was initailly hesitant to read because of the history i knew the author's experiences were shared through the eyes of a child albeit disturbing and violent at times it was not gratuitous and revealed events through poetical language and imagery","1698":"what a lovely beautifully narrated book written through the eyes of a child whose father was a poet i loved the incorporation of fictional stories and metaphors to explain life","1699":" in the shadow of the banyan is the slightly fictionalized account of the author's life as a young child caught in the atrocities of the civil war between the u s backed cambodian government and the khmer rouge revolutionaries that climaxed during the years 1975 1979 that the story is told through the voice of a child witnessing the unimaginable horrors adds to the power of the commentary it is beautifully and hauntingly written poetic at times it is an unforgettable tribute both to the estimated 1 2 million who died as well as to the indomitable spirit of those who survived the intent behind the book in ms ratner's words as my father's only surviving child it is my endeavor to honor his spirit this story is born of my desire to give voice to his memory and the memories of all those silenced in my estimation that desire has been fulfilled in this writing","1700":"bored with the writing put it down after about 100 pages","1701":"a thought provoking courageous read it's fiction but everything the 7 year old raami experiences has been experienced for real by the author now looking back at those years in cambodia when everything changed and what she and her family lived through before finding their way out my full review on word by word here","1702":"beautifully tragic","1703":"deeply moving the juxtaposition of war and this child's poetic spirituality is amazing","1704":"i knew only an overview of this period of asian history i feel like this is such an important book because it made me want to learn more about this culture not just what happened from 1975 79 what an absolutely horrible event that not only killed over a million mostly highly educated people but almost wiped out a very rich culture","1705":"how many times can my heart break during a single book so very many this book was riveting and moving terrible and beautiful","1706":"a graphic and yet beautifully written book about the cambodian war seen through the eyes of a young girl one of those books that will both haunt me and that i will remember for a long period of time","1707":"it took me a very long time to get through this because the story is so heavy i cannot say that i enjoyed it as the subject matter is depressing but it did move me and the writing was beautiful","1708":"breathtaking a book to read again and one that inspires more reading on its topic","1709":"part history part memoir and laced with fantasy in the shadow of the banyan is the work of vaddey ratner who was a small child during the khmer rouge period this story told of war and brutality is as sensual and delicate as the loveliest poetry the perfect descriptions bombard the senses leaving you catching the faint scent of frangipani and tasting hunger an ache remains after reading this and it will be the book you are proud to recommend to a friend or a book club this was given to me as a first reads selection and i am very glad it was by far the best book i have read in a long time","1710":"i won an arc of this book in a goodreads giveaway this is a heartbreaking novel of cambodian genocide told through the eyes of a child who has to grow much older in years in a short time the author has a beautiful way with words and will be recommending to those who aren't afraid to read something heartwrenching","1711":"try as i might over the semester break i had to make myself continue reading until about 1 3 of the way through the book i gave up i felt disconnected by the style of writing which left me feeling like an onlooker from a distance rather than intimately engaged with the story","1712":" the main character in this book is the spoiled seven year old daughter of a prince in a cambodia poised on the brink of four horrifying years under the khmer rouge she and her family are immediately caught up in the vortex and her life becomes something she couldn't have imagined in her worst nightmares the magic of the story though is really how beautiful it is written her father has given her an imagination drawn from wonderful literary poetic and religious tradition the images from his stories and poems both hide and eludicate what is happening as cambodia disintegrates shown through the eyes of this young girl and her family's travails it is clear that cambodia's abject poverty and social inequity did indeed exist and needed to change but it is astounding the level of inhumanity perpetrated by the khmer rouge in the name of improving society as a young girl i lived through this period of time albeit from afar and well removed in the united states it is a sobering thought that i was so oblivious to this tragedy and makes me wonder what will come out of what is currently happening in syria despite how sad it was just like the characters in the book i held my emotions at bay until the story ended some things are so terrible that tears become almost irrelevant and certainly feel self indulgent it is especially poignant because it is auto biographical when done i looked at the author's picture anew now in awe of tbe strength and intelligence which created something so beautiful from something so horrible","1713":"this was a painfully beautiful tale of war told from the point of view of an 8 year old girl in cambodia at the start of the khmer rouge revolution the story is lyrically told which in many ways makes it even more tragic because the beauty of the words is in dark contrast to the inhumanity being described","1714":"a lovely story albeit sad told with raw details defining an unfortunate event in cambodia's history what torturous and despicable atrocities performed by the kmer rouge i was not aware of the extreme starvation that the cambodian people went through a wonderful testament to the power of parent child relationships sacrifice and psychological resilience some parts were very difficult to read and i was almost sobbing at the end and while reading the author's note","1715":"i really wanted to love this book i love the story and the characters but found the book slow it was definitely a beautifully written book the story is so interesting and horrifying it is about a time that i never studied because i was growing up during it too soon for the history books i do enjoy a book that makes me run to google to find out more when i am done","1716":"this was a nice novel but i never found myself very emotionally involved with the characters for me the writing style oscillated too much between how a child would endure this situation and relate it to the myths legends and religion of her people and how an adult reminiscing and evaluating the situation would describe events the novel would have been more successful to my own tastes if the author had wholeheartedly embraced one perspective or the other rather than mixing both","1717":" this is a fiction account that is based on the authors life in cambodia this takes place between 1975 1979 seen through the eyes of a seven year old girl who sees her life turned upside down when revolutionaries take over the country the family is taken from their homes and marched through out cambodia it is revealed the girl's father was a prince raami is the seven year old she is the oldest of four children there are twin boys and a toddler sister raami witnesses many horrors watching villagers being killed her own family gets separated she is forced into labor some of her family members die at the end the remaining family make it to thailand don't want to give spoilers by revealing too much although fiction this is based on vaddey's ratner's real life and experiences i was horrified by what the people of cambodia experienced i appreciated the chance to read about what happened to the people in this country this would actually be fiction historical","1718":"an amazing recount of a five year old's life in cambodia during the khmer rouge's reign of terror","1719":"this book was well written but dark and terribly sad i know that life is often sad especially during wartime but this book didn't have those little bits of hope and inspiration often used to sugarcoat horrible life events that being said it was still a good story and well written and i applaud the author for writing about what it was like to live in communist times a topic rarely made into a novel","1720":"a bit of a slow start but then utterly compelling the story of a camodian family displaced along with hundreds of thousands of others by the khmer rouge told from the perspective of a six year old girl heart wrenching","1721":" part autobiography this book was a very powerful story of such a harrowing time in history that i was almost entirely unaware of before reading this book in april 1975 the khmer rouge stormed cambodia's capital city and declared a new government i found the writing very descriptive and liked that the author did not shy away from taking the time to paint clear pictures of both the places people and terrain the fact that this is told through the eyes ears and heart of a young girl can not fail to move you there were a few none dry eye moments throughout reading this book what a truly beautiful tribute to the author's father this book is","1722":"this is a story about the turbulent time of the communist revolution in cambodia it is told through the eyes of a child a young princess whose life was ripped away from her it is an emotional story made all the more horrifying when you realize it is based on the author's real life experience the story is interesting if depressing and the author engages a poetic style typical in asian literature however it is not a book that pulls the reader in my final thought is that this book is just okay","1723":"set in the same time place as the killing fields this book is a good reminder of the atrocities humans commit against one another in the name of country it's an even better reminder of the resiliancy that can come from survival i enjoyed the glimpses of buddhist lore and culture seen through the family's stories told to a little girl","1724":"in the shadow of the banyan is tough to read it's poetic and beautiful and absolutely heartbreaking the story is about a young girl and her family's experiences at the hands of the khmer rouge in cambodia so going into it you have to know there will be unbelievable cruelty and hardship and starvation and death but somehow vaddey ratner who wrote the novel based upon her own childhood experiences finds a way to keep the reader engaged i think the secret is the magical language in which the story is told not for the faint of heart but your reward is the knowledge that amid great evil there is hope and love","1725":"this was a well written autobiography of the author's horrific life experiences during the revolution of the khmer rouge toward the educated upper and middle class citizens of their own country though the author was but a small child at the time of these experiences she was able to capture some ofthe events and the effects it had on her and her family i'm not sure most of us knew of the atrocities that occurred at this time other than the cambodian killing fields we had little knowledge that people were moved from place to place so that they were unable to form relationships with others tho' it was well written particularly from an author with english as a second language it was a hard read at times there was so much descriptive narrative of the area the situation etc that you felt frustrated in not moving on to see what happened next to this family as they tried to survive the unthinkable so many of the violent acts and horrific situations became a very dark read i found that i had to put it down at times because i found it so troubling getting bogged down in descriptive passages lessened my rating for the novel we are very aware of the holocaust of wwii but we know so little of this time when millions of cambodians were uprooted and eventually killed in the name of revolution many of the killers were mere boys who followed orders without questioning the atrocities they were committing that whole generation had to be impacted by this war the author survived by clinging to the gifts of poetry and imagination left to her by her father who was one of the first victims of this seige it is remarkable that she did survive and was able to come to the us and fulfill her life and write this novel","1726":"this was a new and beautiful reading experience for me i had to put the book down and think about what she was writing and how i could apply it to my life and beliefs thank you vaddey","1727":" somewhere between 4 and 5 stars but decided to go with 5 heartbreaking and beautiful at the same time i knew so little about these events before reading this book i'm glad this story could give a voice to the people who lost their lives their families everything her writing was so vivid and descriptive sometimes i caught myself skimming a bit because it was a little wordy but when i went back and refocused i was glad i did because it seemed like there was so much thought put into every word","1728":"disappointed as the story jumps around and the author does not do a good job of placing events into historical context","1729":" i'm impressed when an author seems to be able to transcend the traumas in their lives to write their own stories as fiction how to you gain the perspective to tell your story while removing yourself from it this book is basically vaddey ratner's story she lost almost her entire family and everything she knew as a small child during the khmer rouge take overs in cambodia somehow i didn't love it the story is told from the perspective of raami a 7 year old girl who had polio when very young she is royalty her family is loving and generous and she is baffled when they are forced to leave their homes raami's 7 year old perspective and description helps to prevent everything from spiraling fully into a depressing book of despair but it still gets close there are little moments of joy the discovery of crayfish in rice paddies but mostly loss starvation torture and death not my favorite","1730":"we have all read and heard about the khmer rouge murdering ways but this book talks about something just as violent and gut wrenching the separating of families ratner so eloquently tells this story as only someone who experienced it could i wa spellbound by the ruthlessness of the kymer rouge but totally amazed by the strength people can muster in the pursuit of freedom","1731":"i thought the beginning of the book was very strong and thought i'd really like it but i lost interest about half way through","1732":"i appreciated the book for the personal perspective on the cambodian genocide and learning of one family's experiences including the many dislocations and encounters it is a very sad story yet told in a way that has grace that said i have to agree with an earlier reviewer that i did not find the child's narration to be convincing the thoughts and language were that of an adult and i thought it would have been more effective had it established the narration as that of an adult looking back on her childhood which of course is what is was i also would have liked more depth into both cambodian culture and the larger politics that were shaping her experience","1733":"this book was so horrifying yet so beautiful at the same time i leave it haunted but certainly inspired to live every day with gratitude and love great book i highly recommend it","1734":"although a little slow in places and difficult to begin in the shadow of the banyan was a lovely story and a wonderfully written glimpse of the cambodian experience of revolution in the 1970s","1735":"beautifully written novel memoir that was heartbreaking yet full of hope this one stayed with me and is a real gem","1736":"this book is beautifully written it is heartbreaking i now have my daughter and husband reading it this story is based on a true story and is written about a period and place that has endured many sad stories","1737":" i cried enough to fill the mekong river when i read this book when words fill you with waves till your being overflows you live a little more yet die a little bit inside at the same time i decided to read this book in preparation for a trip to cambodia recently to give me a feel of the land where sighs are still heard when the wind blows where rains are reminders of the tears of its people whose ghosts hover and would not go away with night i could not have made a better choice i am honoured to have read this incredibly beautifully written book","1738":"definitely left an impression with me","1739":"after visiting cambodia i wanted to know more of its past this work of fiction contained too much flowery prose and i found it hard to believe the narrator was only a 7 year old child i enjoyed moments of it though and i will read some of the non fiction books about the cambodian revolution","1740":"well written story of the killing fields of cambodia though it's fiction it's almost a memoir sad and shocking the auther helps you understand the emotions of the characters all too well","1741":"a beautiful devastating look into the civil war of cambodia it the true account of the royal family and how the civil war affected their family it is written by the daughter of the king and queen","1742":"what a heartbreaking beautiful tale of a very courageous little soul during the cambodian war","1743":"vaddey ratner's fictional account of surviving the atrocities of the khmer rouge regime of the mid 70's in cambodia is a hauntingly beautiful yet challenging novel even as ratner testifies to the horrors of the regime her young protagonist's fierce voice and resilient spirit testify to the perseverance of the human spirit to overcome death with hope and love ultimately a beautiful narrative worth the effort","1744":" a semi memoir this is book presents the best and worse of the human spirit when faced with a cambodia gone mad our 7 year narrator survives through hanging onto the beauty of nature her father's poetry and buddhist stories these aspects were beautifully written and had a gentle wisdom well worth reading the book for but the book was much more it takes us into the chaos when a country's leader wants to totally change the way the citizens live by dragging them back into feudalism and blind obedience the tides of change wash its human jetsam back and forth through luck and resilience some survive unfortunately so many died for no reason quite an unforgettable book","1745":" the brutality of the khmer rouge regime led by pol pot in cambodia is something hard to fathom i remember as a teenager seeing their killing and mass destruction exemplified in the news by piles of skulls that a teenager in a far distant country would take note and not forget such brutality speaks to their extremism few survived to tell the story from the victim's perspective but this book does just that i am always amazed at what people can survive and on the other hand how brutal people can be to each other this book provides plenty of examples of both","1746":"a moving work of historical fiction brings to life the unspeakable human cost of two of the darkest words in modern political history khmer rouge","1747":"this is a very beautiful narrative of a very painful slice of the history in cambodia written from a child's point of view the cruelty of many events and the useless suffering are evident although slightly disguised by an innocence that makes them bearable the book is wonderfully written and will make you want to learn more about this episode in history","1748":"i read the first 3rd of this book and liked it ok but kind of slow then it was coming due at the library and i scanned the rest of the book in a day or so i just seemed ok i didn't love the ending","1749":"intense and heart rending a great read","1750":"a poignant and heartbreaking story but one filled with love and hope the author's lyrical style coupled with the stories told to her by her father present a poetic and philosophical view of life love and hope giving her the strength to grow wings and fly","1751":"a powerful story of strength hope and courage a thought provoking well written novel the chaos and terror of the revolution came through clearly in the writing i understand the writers purpose for writing the story from the perspective of a royal child it highlighted how much was lost by that social class but i wished for a deeper look into the social inequity that spurred the revolution at times i found it hard to truly empathize with these former royals a fantastic book though","1752":"this is one of the most beautiful books i have ever read the author manages to take one of the most horrific events and still create a story of hope and love my experience reading this book may be different from others as i have been to cambodia and spoken to people who lived through the evacuation of phnom penh i had a good understanding of what i was about to read and commenced with some trepidation i am so glad i read it through the eyes of a child we are able to grasp an understanding of what was being done without been subjected to constant detail of the atrocities that is not to say that there aren't some very distressing parts this book is not only an education in the genocide in cambodia but a beautiful story full of elegant prose imagery and human endurance","1753":" i received this debut via firstreads and i'm excited to have gotten it it's an excellent debut on a fascinating topic it suffers from the typical debut novelist's tendency to overstate and overexplain themes and what they mean instead of trusting the reader to be smart and ready closely but i can't complain too much about this as most debut novelists do this the most impressive thing to me about this novel is the way the content eases into being horrific very gradually moving from displacement to loss of autonomy to murder and starvation so slowly that both reader and characters adjust to each new stage before the next starts it's an effective literary device and it's also a potent clue as to how an organization like the khmer rouge can gain control i also truly enjoyed the stories religious tales folklore and poetry woven into the novel these things provided an authentic environment as well as a real and sympathetic voice for raami my biggest concern or dislike about the novel is the muddling of raami's child voice with the older and wiser narrator much is explained by the narrator throughout the book but a lot remains unclear especially early in the book before child raami can understand what's happening that is not commented on by the narrator also occasionally the novel reads as though young raami is understanding something that really it is the narrator understanding later this muddled ness makes it difficult to ever really be clear on what young raami understands and realizes and what knowledge came only later ultimately this is an excellent read accessible to those unfamiliar with cambodian history and the khmer rouge and succeeds in giving voice to the victims themes cambodia killing fields khmer rouge communism tragedy class hunger family love childhood death","1754":"beautiful yet sad book","1755":"very heartbreaking tale of the communist takeover in cambodia written from someone who experienced it first hand a hard read but a necessary one real life history my kind of book i'm especially wowed by vaddey's command of the language as she only learned english at the age of eleven","1756":"although somewhat depressing at times this novel provides a fascinating insight into the period of the khmer rouge's rule over cambodia a brutal regime which i previously knew nothing about narrated by a young girl it's even more interesting after reading the note from the author at the end","1757":" i had a really hard time rating this book i want to give the author 5 stars for her incredible true story but i really had a hard time getting through it i felt that for a 7 year old narrator the writing was way too verbose and fluffy and it would have maybe been better had it been set up as an adult looking back at her experiences this was a slow going book for me it actually reminded me a lot of a long way gone by ismael beah overall i am happy to have read it i knew almost nothing about the khymer rouge era in cambodia and this book was an eye opener for sure","1758":"amazing beautiful and heartwrenching story of a young girl whose family is driven from their home during the invasion of the khmer rouge revolution the author has written this fictional novel based upon her own personal life and events she suffered at the mercy of the khmer rouge she tells the story through the voice and eyes of a young seven yr old girl who was the daughter of a prince at the time of the genocides in cambodia i cannot say enough about this book as it truly touched me and i cried many times reading it it was very descriptive and although heatbreaking and difficult emotionally to read it was also beautiful and haunting and the stories told to the daughter by her father whom she loved so much were beautiful beyond words i learned so much about the revolution of the khmer rouge in cambodia which occurred in the late 1970s it is believed over 2 million cambodians were killed in a 4 yr span under the khmer rouge i did not realize until i had finished the book that the author was telling the story based upon herself which made it even more amazing this is one of those must read books it will stay with you forever trust me i rate this a 5 star plus","1759":"very emotive book about the rise of the khmer rouge regime in cambodia and how it affected one branch of the royal family very well written historical fiction engaging characters","1760":"another 4 5 for me not perfect but close the story was horrific yet beautifully told i loved how the author brought in buddhism and poetry i had never read anything about cambodia so it was interesting to learn more about this terrible time","1761":"bought @ costco colorado trip reading aaaaahhhhthis was an eloquently written story the imagery is fantastic the author was young when the khmer rouge took over her family and others lost so much but she maintains her hope by remembering lessons from her father mother and other family members she's a survivor and sings the sweetest song on the pages enjoy","1762":" one of those novels that is simultaneously lovely and horror filled all the more so because the events in the novel come directly from the author's childhood experiences in cambodia under the khmer rouge her prose is highly descriptive with heavy use of storytelling within a story and poetry such that the point of view while that of a child sounds much older this is not a fast read it's not a page turner it's an immersive experience the words and the events they describe are to be absorbed rather than digested","1763":"very moving tale that resonates more due to knowing the author only fictionalized her own harrowing experiences","1764":"a harrowing tale of the khmer rouge regime in 1970s cambodia raami the narrator enjoys a life of privilege and luxury as the daughter of a royal prince until the abrupt communist takeover and ensuing chaos forced out of the cities separated from family members and closely monitored in forced labor camps raami struggles to survive in a world that increasingly makes little sense and follows few rules a good book and one that has inspired me to learn more about cambodia's history","1765":"so glad i finished this book on the way to cambodia this is historical fiction but really very much based on the author's real life events about the cambodian revolution in the 70s i didn't know anything about cambodia's history it is horrifying it is heartbreaking it gave added context to my visit while i was there and the country has come so far since the 70s i am astounded by the author her writing is gorgeous and her story is powerful this was a great read","1766":"beautiful historical fiction novel about the khmer rouge uprising in cambodia in the early 1970's based on the authors childhood experience i definitely learned things i knew nothing about by reading this book","1767":" this story of historical fiction told through the eyes of a seven year old traces the takeover of cambodia by the khmer rouge between 1975 through 1979 while intellectually i knew this happened i had no true understanding of how brutal the atrocities committed were over a protracted period of time two million people were gradually tortured starved and killed and yet a young girl raami and her mother somehow survived while the rest of the family was lost the story parallels the life of the author who was five years old when the khmer rouge took over phnom penh the book is well written and so very thought provoking","1768":"loved the history behind the book really liked the first 1 3 and the last 1 3 but the middle section was quite slow and a little hard going in places","1769":"this was the latest book chosen for my book club and i hadn't even heard of it shame on me vaddey ratner shares the frightening life altering experience of raami a young child in cambodia during the takeover of the communist party known as the khmer rouge although the book is categorized as fiction the story is hugely comprised of ratner's personal experience this is a story of human survival and the will to live when life just doesn't even seem worth living what's truly amazing is that ratner writes with such a beautiful poetic style and you would never guess that she didn't even learn english until the age of 11 she has a way with words that will have you re reading sections of the book wondering how did she come up with that what a beautiful way to describe something as simple as the shadow of a banyan tree","1770":"september 2014 book club it is based on the author's life during the war in cambodia in the 1970's the writing makes you feel like you are 7 year old raami experiencing all of the heartache and confusion and inhumanity of war and of her world turned upside down a tough and beautiful read","1771":" this book came to me quite by accident and i am so grateful that it did if like me you are reading these reviews wondering if this is a book you might enjoy you will notice as i did that one word stands out and is used in many exquisite rightfully so this is the most beautiful piece of work i've read in a long time every word like a brushstroke in a beautiful painting the scene in that painting could not be more grotesque however in the shadow of the banyan is the tale of raami a young girl who is just seven when the khmer rouge take control of cambodia and impose their revolutionary ways often with tragic consequences through raami's eyes we witness atrocities no one should have to bear let alone a child the fact that this tale is based on the author's own life experiences makes it all the more poignant the child narrator allows the author to explain cambodian traditions words and even the political situation in a very simplistic way meaning that even though a history lesson in itself it is much less hard going than other historical fiction might be i knew very little about cambodia or the khmer rouge before but i am inspired to find out more since reading this work the idea that this went on when i was a child is beyond horrific the stand out character for me was mama raami's mother at times i wanted to shake her others comfort her all testament to the power of this author's writing oftentimes she made me hold my own children that bit closer this hauntingly beautiful story will stay with me for a long time to come it had everything that i look for in a book an education with lessons learned beautiful writing and powerful emotions it moved me to tears more than once","1772":" vaddey ratner's fictional narrative is a well written story drawn from 1970s cambodia with khmer folk tales and traditions expertly woven together for an american audience as an american born woman who heard many of these stories as a teen over the years i've scooped up as many narratives as possible of this time and place in my attempt to better understand my adopted family's experiences there this novel rang true my aunties' tales about their lost loved ones about the work detail they suffered and yes even the dim hopes these were all in ratner's book her narrative retrieved those mid 1980s stories from my buried past and buffed them till they shone i could see my aunties uncles boyfriend cousins and mother in love just as they were those many years ago new to this country with the raw wounds of war reading ratner helped me to once again honor their suffering and rejoice in their spirit highly recommended for all who are curious about 1970s cambodia and human responses to the concentration camp conditions but especially for those who know khmer rouge survivors yet still yearn to understand their experiences from that dark time","1773":"i'm still thinking about all that i read this book is poetically descriptive and tells the tale of the khmer rouge regime through the voice of a little girl it's heavy and it is sad but it is also resilient","1774":"wonderful book thoroughly recommend cambodia khmer rouge horrors kindly told","1775":"an novelist's account of the terror of the khmer rouge in cambodia by a member of the former royal family author","1776":"a very moving and eye opening story of cambodian refugees in the 1970's extremely well written and easy to read a story full of hope","1777":"this was a difficult book to read and even more difficult to put down i don't know a lot about buddhism so some of that was lost on me and i think that i could have enjoyed the book a lot more if i did i am still giving it five stars because it was so well written","1778":"i really had no idea how the cambodian people suffered under the khmer rouge the is a beautifully written

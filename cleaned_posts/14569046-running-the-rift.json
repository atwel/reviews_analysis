love this book how about you","2":"i really enjoyed this novel benaron did an excellent job of building a novel around a devastating moment in recent history being true both to the history and to her story her character development is strong and i was quickly drawn into the story and into the lives of the characters especially jean patrick she deftly depicts a rwanda that is both brutal and beautiful she excels at taking this huge event and showing its effects at a personal level the novel is at once about the genocide and not about it a difficult feat","3":"overall an interesting and enjoyable make not quite the right word since it's about genocide and everything read but spoiler ish i was really dissatisfied with the hollywood style ending maybe my sensibilities are just too dark but the concluding chapters were really bizarre to me","4":"this book was quite an emotional rollercoaster love and hate joy and grief hope and despair... witnessing j p 's coming of age and his constant struggle i became fond of his character and hoped he would not be ill fated since the novel was set in the time of the rwandan genocide the characterization was excellent the imagery of rwanda vivid and provided a great cultural insight the focus was not that much on the atrocities of the genocide but more on how it affected jean patrick and his loved ones he was hurt physically and mentally and consequently had to give up his greatest passion--running it makes you think how much potential and how many innocent lives were lost at that time...after the plot revealed that j p survived it was foreseeable that he would be reunited with bea thus giving the story a happy yet bitter ending i really enjoyed reading this book it did read like a ya at times--as many have already pointed out--but that did not bother me at all definitely a good read","5":"i liked this book very much the story was fascinating and very real i honestly believed this was a true story and am certain that there are thousands of stories that could be told from this terrible time naomi's choice of story is truly compelling i didn't always like the author's style which seemed to vacillate between young adult and adult fiction but i found tears streaming down my face as i read of the horrendous things that neighbors did to neighbors in rwanda during the genocide","6":" i have to wonder if i would have enjoyed this more if i was reading it and not listening to it it's not that the narrator did a poor job but he contributed to the feeling or created it that the writing was choppy i thought the author threw a thought or idea out there and then just didn't finish it there were places where i thought there should have been another sentence or two there if the subject of the novel had been anything other than the rwandan genocide i probably would not have finished it the first half of the novel would have earned it 2 stars and it didn't pick up until book 3 to be honest part of the problem was that i didn't like the main character his naivete which was sweet when he was younger was simply infuriating as he got older and i felt like the author brushed over some of the loss scenes the main character's father then beloved sister dies and the novel moves on in my opinion without the main character grieving the scene where the main character is on the phone with his mentor and a school full of refugees as the army is barging on the door to kill them all is tear jerking but when jean patrick gets off the phone there's nothing no shock no horror no grief just the next scene and then towards the end all but one brother is killed his whole family is murdered and it felt to me like the effect that would have on a person was brushed over on the other hand i believed in the connection between jean patrick and bea and as i finished the book two days ago i do still find myself thinking about it haunting is an apt description of this novel overall i think it had a lot more potential and fell short in several areas yet the story has stayed with me","7":"sorry i was bored for 3 4 of book much preferred the true stories about rawanda","8":"intense and heart wrenching especially in the context of the current news coming out of nigeria a tale about the brutality of living as a tutsi in the time of the hutu tutsi conflict in rwanda brightened by one's passion for running and the escape it provides","9":"interesting story of conflict in rwanda as backdrop for story of a young runner","10":"okay i knew this would be tough going because you know rwanda and all but the running hooked me in and damn a beautiful story of a horrible true story somehow just wow","11":"prior to reading this book i didn't really know about the 1994 rwanda genocides i would have been in fourth grade and maybe we discussed it at some point but i was basically naive to this history the only thing i had to compare it with was the jewish holocaust certain descriptions towards the end of this novel gave me that same sick hopeless angry feeling i got when i visited the holocaust museum in dc as a high school senior images from the room of shoes and my experience in the boxcar will stay with me forever images from this book will join them don't get me wrong the entire book is not some depressing look at how awful human beings are there is pervasive racism and brutality but it doesn't get truly terrible for too long there is still hope and humor among the words the true weight of the novel lies in the education of jean patrick as he comes of age as a tutsi in a pro hutu society he is blessed with the gift of running like an olympic athlete and training and racing become his focus we get to know his family friends and love interest which of course make the reality of what we know with dread will come to pass all that more difficult to swallow this had the best possible ending that a novel about such an atrocity as genocide can possibly have without being unrealistic this was a true gem of a book and thank you so much giveaways for delivering this to me for free","12":"another airport book this one grabbed me because of the running the protaganist is a rwandan 800 meter runner striving for the atlanta olympics while his country simmers then explodes the novel isn't about running though and although the author is a former ironman triathlete it bugged me that she had spent no time learning how half milers train i realize it's picky as hell but when that's the reason i picked up the book it grated on me that our hero was running olympic a standard times for his distance in the last of six training intervals the author did however know her stuff about the rwandan genocide it just seemed like the book could have been about 150 pages shorter than it was the genocide aspect was way more about the fuse than the explosion which was fine but i found myself skimming way too often due to the fuse's length","13":"a beautiful and important book benaron writes with the insight and cadence of a poet this is a story we all should make time for","14":"loved it really engaging story","15":"the rwanda massacres prevalent in news for the 90s is interwoven in this story of a boy who wants to run in the olympics starts picking up very quickly in the last section","16":"i should want to read more of this book and i feel bad for not sticking with it but there are two things putting me off first there's no surprise re what the characters are about to endure and in fact the first 100 pp began to feel predictable and the character a little too naive plus there is of course romance and star crossed lovers and much tragedy and i'm not minimizing the actual tragedy that occurred just saying that in the scope of this plot it feels that every event is foretold and the characters developed in what is almost a cliched way which leads me to my second hang up which is that on some level the writing and approach to the events in rwanda feels a little didactic like a children's novel you would read that introduces you to history through the lens of some made up young character there's simply some subtlety lacking in the writing and the approach overall it's a worthy book bringing attention to an atrocious time period in rwanda and i can see why it holds some appeal but if i am going to tackle a book on this subject i want it to be more challenging and nuanced and provocative this is going to be the once in a few years instance where i put a book down","17":"this is a really great read you can see how he attrocities during this genocide affected one family you can tell however that a non african wrote this book certain sayings and the ending are completly american in nature but i really liked the book","18":"a beautiful epic i would not have picked this up if it wasn't for a recent trip to rwanda but that would have been my loss it transported me back to the colours smells hopes of rwanda whilst dealing sensitively with its past stunning","19":"i didn't finish this book because i didn't find the beginning catchy at all and that is one main ingredient that a book needs for me to read it","20":"i loved this book it's the story of a young rwandan runner who has dreams of representing his country in the olympics politics and the collision of cultural upheaval in the country conspire to make this dream a difficult one to achieve it's a heartbreaking yet beautifully told story of a sordid point in rwandan history the clash between hutu and tutsi which is the backdrop for the whole book it was written in an incredibly sensitive manner i learned a lot and loved the book","21":"a reminder of the horror in rwanda is necessary but the writing itself was no great shakes","22":"this adult book with ya appeal shows an uncompromising look at genocide and ethnic relations in rwanda through the eyes of a gifted runner who dreams of being an olympic medalist some powerful sobering moments","23":"amazingly a story about the rawandan genocide that is not completely depressing it doesn't hold back but you do get a sense of people trying to find dignity amidst the chaos also amazing is the fact that the author is not rawandan nor african but she has worked with many refugees she clearly did her homework and you get a real sense of the region and the culture reading the book gave me a much better sense of the history leading up to the killing one thing for certain is that it should have taken no one paying attention by surprise you can consider it to be an historical fiction its not amongst the greats but it is very much worth reading oh and one of the secondary characters is a geologist","24":"a compelling story that brings to mind chimamanda ngozi adichie's half of a yellow sun yet less grim more hopeful","25":"such a tough book to read because of so much in the content but it was also hard to put down well written","26":"i really enjoyed this book","27":"fascinating story of a would be olympic marathoner but for rwanda not great writing but a great tale","28":"running the rift is an inside look at life in rwanda immediately before and during the genocide the main character is a runner hopeing to make it to the olympics one day if you've never read about this subject it is a good look at this horrible history although the book was a bit longer than it needed to be especially the first half","29":"i think benaron does a great job here of presenting rwanda's beauty and diversity not just in its topography but its people she also has subtle criticisms of the west for not intervening when rwanda's genocide was clearly taking place the story follows the coming of age of jean patrick he runs and is soon an olympic hopeful this dream fuels his desire to see rwanda as nothing less than perfect but rwanda is far from perfect jean patrick at times seems inexplicably naive but i think this is in part because he can not admit to the ugly brutality of his countrymen when things begin to happen jean patrick is torn between his dream of running for his country and surviving for the sake of his family a beautifully heartbreaking read one that has left me thinking far beyond the last page i will admit i tried reading a non fiction book on the same topic years ago and i just couldn't stomach the brutality of the killings although there is not vivid descriptions here of the violence taking place there is definitely a sinister undertone throughout benaron makes rwanda a place of beauty respect and humanity before she shows us the other side this makes you weep all the more for the loss of its heart and soul","30":"barb convinced me to give this a try this was not an easy book to read it's not possible to believe that the rwandan genocide actcually happened but this book makes it all too real combining the fictional story of jean patrick with the real history of the country forces the reader to live the truth of what happened in a way that devastates the author did an amazing job","31":"captures the moment a classic ust be read","32":"well written story of some of the horrors of the genocide in rwanda made personal through the lives of the characters in the story","33":"i was really not into this book i read it for a book club i found it to drag and the characters to be rather one dimensional and simplistic the first 3 4 of the book were very repetitive and it could have been shorter i also felt the reference to the mexico city olympics was unnecessary the situations were not in any way similar rwanda was dealing with genocide it seemed like the writers personal political statement i have read books on this subject that were far better","34":"it's taken me nearly a week to even mark this book as finished because i just couldn't face writing a review of this harrowing tale of life in the midst of genocide i was marginally aware of the hutus and the tutsis and that one group had killed the other or maybe they had killed one another and it was somewhere in africa but i wouldn't have been able to say where i now feel so incredibly ignorant and i wonder why i as a well educated american didn't have any grasp of the enormity of such a staggering series of ethnic atrocities that took place during my adult life i feel like it was almost a willful ignorance it wasn't americans who were being killed after all and the u s chose not to become involved so what did it have to do with me why was it necessary for me acquaint myself with murder on such a massive scale of common people going on government sponsored homicidal rampages and killing men women and children some of them strangers and others neighbors all in the name of preserving one's own identity at the mortal expense of another's i didn't consciously think these things i just didn't think about it at all this is a tale of heartbreak and bravery of ruthless power of love and of aspiration and dedication it's a story of profound injustice and incalculable loss of tragedy and triumph tainted by tragedy and ultimately of strength and of survival when so many did not i always wonder when reading holocaust literature how anybody had the will to endure such horrors and this brought up the same kinds of thoughts and self reflections could i i don't think so","35":"although this book is a novel about terrible historic events hutu tutsi rawanda i found that the author's writing could not get me emotionally involved it's about jean patrick a promising runner aiming for the upcoming olympics when history interceded there's a lot about ethnic food family structure the countryside there's a lot of proof that the author did her research but i just wanted to get the book finished for my seattle bookwomen discussion in coming weeks the book won a prize but i probably wouldn't read this author again","36":"the genocide which took place in rwanda is incredibly horrifying and graphic and yet naomi benaron has an incredible gift of being able to soften the blow by introducing us to characters and lives that keep us enthralled and disturbed all at the same time this book is riviting and it provides the reader an inside view of a country experiencing a volatile and heinous time yet all the while feeling deeply for the separation and anxiety that is caused merely by ones birthright","37":"i so wanted to love this book after seeing the goodreads rating but the story setting was very interesting but the main character felt flat when he should have made the book compelling i could have abandoned at almost any time because i didnt care enough but persevered the last quarter of the book was an improvement but too much of a struggle to rate a 3 a clear 2 1 2 i'd be quite hesitant to recommend","38":"this is a great book the kind i like to read highly recommended","39":"very good book i learned a lot","40":"heartrending story about a tutsi olympic hopeful training in rwanda during the early 1990s very inspiring tale for runners","41":"great story about endurance","42":"story of a rwandan boy's life and his dream of running in the olympics with a historical background","43":"i was awake very early this morning courtesy of my dog roxanne who needed to go outside around 5 00 a m at first i grumbled about it but then i realized that in fact she gave me the perfect opportunity to finish reading a riveting new book i'd picked up a couple of days ago called running the rift it's naomi benaron's bellwether prize winning debut novel set in rwanda in the 1990s i'd been reading it in 100 page chunks but i didn't want to push through to the end last night when i was so sleepy well it was a thoroughly engrossing read i'll need to mull it over a bit before posting a full review 'cause right now i'm still reeling from it it's one of those books where you know exactly what's going to be happen even if you don't know the particulars and the narrative tension builds both from within the story and from without based on your own knowledge of actual historical events like a novel that opens in honolulu in 1940 or one that features the warsaw ghetto in the late 1930s you know what you're gonna get with a book featuring rwanda of the early 1990s all i can say is read it the book releases in january from our good friends at algonquin and naomi benaron will be at the odyssey bookshop in south hadley ma on february 2 2012 for a reading and booksigning if you believe in the importance of literature in understanding the human condition and the role it plays in creating empathy u0026amp dispelling fear this is an event you should attend or perhaps one in your area as i know ms benaron will be touring","44":"i enjoyed the central characters of the novel and appreciated the basic storyline but the writing seemed off too flowery and overwrought at some points and too stilted and simplistic elsewhere i read a review that characterized it as a young adult novel although that's not how it has been marketed and that would explain some of my problems with her writing style and narrative and for a horrific tale of genocide it wraps up too neatly","45":"i liked this book but i didn't love it i applaud the author for tackling the subject matter the genocide took place in my teens but the book opened my eyes to the underlying causes that led to the violence on the other hand it was hard to connect to the main character unspeakable things happen around him but his voice remains distant even when witnessing such horror or losing someone close to him i just didn't feel it i agree with some reviewers that said it was at times more like a young adult novel","46":"a brilliant novel of love and hope in africatoday rwanda is one of the brightest lights in africa the economy is booming corruption is rare government delivers services the streets are clean it's even easy to open a business yet 20 years ago this tiny landlocked country tucked among uganda the democratic republic of congo burundi and tanzania suffered one of the most tragic events of the 20th century a genocidal murder spree by many of the country's hutu people against their traditional rivals the tutsi in 100 days they ended the lives of between 500 000 and 1 000 000 tutsis and moderate hutus as many as one in five of the country's people despite rwanda's impressive accomplishments since the insurgent tutsi leader paul kagame became president and virtual dictator in 2000 it is still the genocide that looms large in the world's perception of the country the rwanda genocide is the central event in running the rift a remarkable novel that tells the story of a young tutsi man nkuba jean patrick a supremely talented runner who aspires to compete in the 1996 olympics in atlanta the tale begins when jean patrick is a boy just beginning to detect his gift and it explores his life and the reality he experienced in the years of increasing violence in the late 1980s and early 1990s through the terrible trials of 1994 and for several years afterward in language enriched by a generous dollop of kinyarwanda the official language of rwanda terms and phrases we follow jean patrick's life through his interactions with his schoolteacher father his many brothers and sisters his few close friends the headmaster of his school his running coach and later his girlfriend and a young american couple who move to the country i can think of few more challenging tasks for a writer than to tell a story of love and hope against the background of such a terrible tragedy yet naomi benaron succeeds brilliantly barbara kingsolver who also has written about sub saharan africa agrees she awarded the first time novelist her bellwether prize for socially engaged fiction running the rift richly deserves that recognition amazingly given the credible language and circumstances of this extraordinary novel naomi benaron is an american who writes poetry and fiction i'd thought that surely the author was rwandan one connection between her life and this story is that she is a triathlete and marathon runner also as her publisher's author bio explains \"benaron first worked with genocide survivors in her hometown of tucson acting as an advocate and helping them to adjust to life in the united states she later attended a genocide conference and made several trips to rwanda 'i felt very connected to the story ' she says 'as my mother lost most of her family in the holocaust '\"","47":"would give this three and a half stars if i could i liked the story line but it kind of dragged along with the descriptions of the training runs rawanda stories just make me weep","48":"engrossing story of a young man's dreams and his determination set in rwanda during the 1990's the young man witnesses the development of the genocide and the horror of it as it unfolds the characters are engaging the story draws you in and the descriptions of rwanda are vivid the author has used credible sources for her discussions of the real events it is a book for those who study genocide and for those who know little about what happened in rwanda at the time","49":"running the rift follows the progress of jean patrick nkuba from the day he knows that running will be his life to the moment he must run to save his life a gifted athlete he sprints over the hills of rwanda and dreams of becoming his country's first track olympic medal winner but jean patrick is a tutsi in a world that has become restrictive and violent for his people as tensions mount between the hutu and tutsi he holds fast to his dream ok novel","50":"incredibly well written and engaging the subject is difficult to read about especially considering the fact that the rwandan genocide took place less than 20 years ago very sad but definitely recommend","51":"picked this book up in trade paper from the tattered cover denver ended up buying a second kindle version so i could continue reading it wherever i was an amazing story of perseverance and hope amidst terrible tragedy benaron did an amazing job developing the characters in this novel the story begins as the ethnic tensions between hutu and tutsi start boiling over into a violent uprising by the hutu power structures resulting in the genocide where thousands of tutsi were slaughtered all the while the western world stood by with hands folded the protagonist jean patrick nkuba grows up in a household where people aren't labeled by their ancestral connections rather they are all imana's god creation however jp is not immune to the racial tensions that exist and after a personal tragedy he is thrust into the every day reality of growing up tutsi in culture controlled a ruthless hutu government rtr weaves in a narrative that had me angry that i never knew the scope of what occurred during this terrible time that seemed more suited to the dark ages rather than just 20 years ago beautiful african culture and imagery romance competing allegiances competitive running what first attracted me to the book and hope amidst tragedy all make this book an incredible read that will stay with me for a long time to come","52":"such a sad story especially considering that these horrendous purgings are historical for this area","53":"nowadays we hear about so many tragedies on a daily basis that we have become almost inured to them modern life seems so rushed and pressurised that we don't have time to pause take a breath and express gratitude for what we have running the rift naomi benaron's first novel might very well have the power to stop you in your tracks against the backdrop of the rwandan genocide of 1994 the author has created a character driven story which somehow highlights the positive attributes of humans in the midst of appalling crimes against humanity the novel opens ten years before the genocide with a young tutsi boy jean patrick nkuba dreaming of being the first rwandan to run in the olympics jean patrick's parents have tried to shelter their children from rwanda's troubled history but it is soon impossible to ignore the ethnic divisions which are bubbling over into acts of violence and discrimination and having an impact on their daily lives jean patrick and his siblings have to secure the top marks in scholarship exams or they won't be allowed to attend the secondary school of their choice alongside the hutu majority as tensions run high jean patrick finds himself manipulated by the hutu led government - it enhances their human rights profile to have a tutsi child as an olympic hopeful providing a smoke screen for the increase in ethnic cleansing he wants to survive to win a gold medal but he might have to renounce his tutsi heritage to achieve his goal initially i was rather hesitant about reading this novel as i thought it would be emotionally draining but it turned out the opposite was true the portrayal of jean patrick and his extended family and indeed rwanda itself is engrossing we see the strength of family ties the bonds within communities where hutu and tutsi are friends and neighbours with the shared goal of scraping a living securing a future for their children yes there is the palpable tension that something evil is looming just on the horizon but still the start of the genocide comes as a total shock how folk could hack down their neighbours seems so unthinkable even as you are reading it in black and white yet it seemed to be a case of kill or be killed with a prevailing wind of bloodlust thrown in for good measure benaron treads a middle path in presenting the violence neither sugaring the pill nor salting the wound running the rift is an extremely readable story about a very difficult subject the rest of the world stood by and watched as 20% of the population of rwanda was annihilated in the space of 100 days here naomi benaron has opened a window on the lives of the ordinary flesh and blood folk showing us the human face behind the statistics - a compelling important accessible read - highly recommended","54":"i loved this book it's hard to read from the first page i rooted for jean patrick to fulfill his dream of being a runner at the olympics only to have the rwandan genocide get in the way the human atrocities will make your stomach turn but the juxtaposition of all that is beautiful in life and love make the story so heartening at the same time in the news the hutu and tutsi are at it again in burundi and rwanda i'm so lucky that i can't possibly understand that war so so sad","55":"i wasn't overly fond of this book but it did enlighten me on the genocide that went on in rwanda between the tutsi and hutu peoples","56":"very interesting story","57":"this is a piece of historical fiction that gives an accurate account of the rwandan genocide but i found the characterdevelopment and dialogue clumsy","58":"this book is about the early 90s genocide in rwanda i was just a teenager whenever it happened and i'm embarrassed to admit that i didn't know much about it i'm glad that i read this book to learn more about the rwandan ethnic history and the terrible conflict jean patrick was a likeable main character and i was cheering him along in his olympic pursuits but his naivety to his country's troubles annoyed me at times his love interest bea helped make up for his naivety with her wit and awareness overall i would recommend this book to anyone who enjoys reading about history and other cultures","59":"jean patrick's story is horrific and beautiful the rwandan genocide is the backdrop as this young man tries to fulfill an olympic dream while falling in love with the girl of his dreams although some parts were slow the book was well written and probably ranks among my faves","60":"really interesting read tough but not overwhelmingly depressing","61":"read this book the story gets off to a fine start and then gets slow ish and i found myself frustrated about what was the central story here jean patrick's running or the brewing rwandan genocide the genocide right the tutsi genocide why is jean patrick ignoring what's real is he blind and then i decided to be patient because i was reading about a boy a young boy this book unfolded easily once i decided to be patient and let it tell its story running the rift is horrifying hopeful and not quite forgiving","62":"man's inhumanity to man when does it stop a very compelling story of a young man with high aspirations who tries so hard to maintain normality in his life when there is little possibility of that this novel incorporates a moving story of this young man's life during the real life struggles of his country","63":"terrific book that centers on a young man vying to become an olympic runner representing rwanda as the tensions between tutsi and hutu grow and spill over into the rwandan genocide the story of the genocide is clearly not a happy one but the author writes beautifully evokes the physical beauty of the country and portrays the growing conflict from the eyes of those going about their daily lives in a way that allows you to experience that time in history in a different way","64":"this was an amazing book it follows a tutsi family right before the horrible genocide of 1994 the writing is beautiful and the story is amazing","65":"wow great book and story but incredibly sad","66":"i am not fond of the style but this book did get me interested in this subject and made me want to visit this country","67":"i was so excited to read a book about the genocide in rwanda and learn more about it however i was really disappointed in this book the characters were too flat to interest me the historical aspect of the book was hard to follow i'm hoping to find a different book about this horrible moment in history a book that can make the event come alive and enhance my understanding","68":"running the rift naomi benaron's first novel and winner of the bellwether prize for socially engaged fiction tells the story of the rwandan genocide in a very personal way although the story of jean patrick is fictional it is based on the events surrounding the killing of an estimated 800 000 people in rwanda in 1994 the facts alone make this one of the most horrendous heinous acts in recent history but by telling the story from the point of view of a particular person benaron reminds us that those who were murdered aren't just statistics-they were people with names and faces and lives and dreams just like the rest of us the only thing that made them different was the social construction of their ethnicity read my full review","69":"a very courageous book on a day to day basis i come into contact with displaced rwandans and yes we all know about the terrible genocide in that country but do we really take notice this book very much like poisonwood bible by barbara kingsolver has opened up my eyes and since reading this i am haunted by the pain i can now recognize in the eyes of those rwandans that cross my path after world war i and especially ii the world said a collective never again yet it is happening again and again in my beloved africa rwanda sudan etc etc when will we learn tolerance when will we say enough is enough i feel such anguish having read this and powerless","70":"running the rift by naomi benaron is a coming of age story about the genocide in rwanda the plot offers measured hope that hutu and tutsi's will learn to live together but it also calls upon readers to recognize the reality of inhumanity and act to curtail it benaron paints a vivid picture of the atrocity without making the book too horrendous to read \"wind rippled through the thick grass fertilized by the dead a sharp odor filled jean patrick's nostrils and he sniffed the air \"do you recognize it \"\"he did then \" yes it was the smell of death\" 350 nuances of meaning give the book many layers a rift is a weakened area a depression in geology along a fault line a place that is unstable the book is set in cyangugu a city and capital in western rwanda in the albertine rift a rift is also a break between friends or a difference in opinion interest or belief that causes a break the main character jean patrick nkuba like the author is a runner who hopes to become rwanda's first olympic medal winner in track he physically runs and he runs or moves among people with vulnerability or in a weakened way because he is tutsi not hutu and because his knowledge of his country's history is weak his father francois raised him without an understanding of the long standing enmity between the tribes or knowledge of prior genocides nkuba is in primary school when his father dies in a car accident and hutus first target him boys throwing rocks through the window of his house calling the family \"tutsi snakes\" 11 he learns about the 1973 hutu massacre of tutsi when he is ten from his uncle emmanuel who says \"they burned down our house killed your grandparents and you uncle our youngest brother ' you were named for him no one told you '\" 24 \"the hate runs too deep sooner or later the government will find it convenient to let it boil to the surface again\" 25 nkuba deals with many issues before the genocide one of his sisters dies he goes away to school and takes the first steps on his journey to the olympics under the direction of coach he becomes best friends with daniel another athlete and he falls in love with bea daughter of an activist and although no one knows until later a tutsi nkuba's brother roger joins the rwandan patriotic front rpf coach turns out to be a major in the hutu military who when the genocide occurs first tries to kill nkuba and then saves him nkuba survives and goes to america believing bea is dead but comes back to find her alive with a child possibly his an american geology professor jonathan and his photographer girlfriend suzanne help nkuba in america and in returning to rwanda","71":"this book really brought home to me the horrific tragedy that is the story of rwanda in 1994 and the uprising of the hutus against the minority tutsis naomi benaron has done a great job of perosnalising this horrific time through the main character jean patrick whose dream it is to represent his country at the atlanta olympics the events surrounding jean patrick's journey to hell and back is confronting reading and although on the surface benaron's novel could be mistaken as simplistic it is the underlying story that makes this book so powerful http www unitedhumanrights org geno","72":"in april 1994 i was in seventh grade and i don't recall knowing anything about the genocide that was taking place in a small african country called rwanda almost 20 years have passed and i consider myself fortunate to have learned something about those events with a tiny bit of context gleaned from several brief trips to africa most americans probably still know nothing about recent history in rwanda nor do they much care for most of us it seems distant underdevelopment is overwhelming and intangible but for some of us running the rift will be a wake up call this is the kind of book that can open someone's eyes to the complexity and injustice of the world around us can provoke an interest in trying to change that world for the better and can induce gratitude and or bewilderment at the incredible stroke of good fortune if you're born into a peaceful and wealthy society there are not many ambiguities or surprises in the book most characters are clearly good or bad with the exception of coach although i think he falls pretty squarely on one end of the spectrum the dramatic tension builds steadily chapter by chapter i kept hoping that there would be a twist of some sort and jean patrick would not experience the genocide no such luck even the ending has a readily anticipated reunion that i imagine comes as a surprise to no one but i still got goosebumps reading it so yes great story and an exciting read with carefully detailed people and places a wonderful introduction to a terrible and overlooked event that would serve well as required reading in high school or a book club selection as for me i need to break my habit of choosing books immersed in tragedy if you already know this tragedy is real it probably doesn't qualify as entertainment","73":"what a wonderful book a slow start but then i really got into the pace of the story a wonderful tribute to those affected in any way by the events in rwanda","74":"really enjoyed reading this book i think the author did a fantastic job by giving dimension to her characters especially with jp being a runner to me that gave the story more depth and in some fashion made it more real i am rather interested in making a trip to rwanda and burundi","75":"a beautifully written book about a horrfying and tragic situation","76":"the rwandan genocide of 1994 comes to life in \"running the rift \" by the time the slaughters have begun readers have grown to care for the tutsi people because of jean patrick and suffer all his losses with him benaron has done her research very carefully and exposes the horror of what happens when countrymen turn against each other in a mob mentality read the rest of my review at http shouldireaditornot wordpress c","77":"thanks to emily for a great book","78":"i adored this book a loving intimate fictional tale of the very real ethnic tensions and devastating violence that left painful scars in rwanda and continue to plague lives worldwide full of greatest satisfaction and joy deepest grief and sadness and humbling redemption once i had started i didn't want to put the book down","79":"good material slow for my taste if you really love reading about the rwandan genocide for 600 pages than you will love it","80":"benaron successfully crafted a story of the rwandan genocide that while still difficult to read is necessary to read \"you may choose to look the other way but you can never say again that you did not know \" william wilberforce","81":"i thought this was an interesting read learned a lot about the genocide in rwanda in the 90's thru the eyes of the main character a young man training to become an olympic runner","82":"i did not know this was a 1st novel until i finished the book it won the bellwether prize for socially engaged fiction i would not be surprised if it snags the nobel prize for literature it tells the story of the genocide in rwanda through the eyes of a boy who is being groomed as an olympic hopeful however he is tutsi in a nation where the hutu are in power he emerges scarred and maimed but finds that love is above all an important work that will hopefully fatally crack the wall of hate that mankind seems to be surrounded by","83":"this novel about tutsi jean patrick nkuba an olympic hopeful set during the rwandan genocide is moving and well written with complex characters any time i read a book about rwanda i know to steel myself against the heartbreak but this book had a lighter touch while still coming across as accurate","84":"before reading this book i thought i'd already exhausted the supply of reader friendly texts on rwanda clearly i was wrong this story is an incredibly moving look into one boy's experience during the rwandan genocide the way jean patrick holds onto a combination of innocence and denial until the absolute last possible moment is heartbreaking the strength of the characters' hope and raw humanity is profoundly touching the power of this book is that it takes the unimaginable magnitude of the horror and funnels it through the lens of just a few memorable characters thereby making it manageable for the reader whenever i read about rwanda i am always humbled to learn that this happened during my lifetime at a time when i was old enough to have known what was occurring but did not i am thankful for books such as this one for helping me remember","85":"though gripping i thought this was overly long and could have been judiciously cut the main character jean patrick was frustratingly stubborn which advanced the plot and put him in the midst of important events but grew aggravating after a while also the ending wasn't believable happy but really","86":"slow start with a hollow feel to it but eventually the story picks up and becomes impossible to put aside excellent portrayal of the hutu tutsi conflict genocide which i had never fully understood jean patrick's friend jonathon an american mirrors my own ethnocentric naivete o","87":"this was a hard read but i also couldn't put it down made me thank my lucky stars for all that i take for granted","88":"i really enjoyed this one","89":"this is a fictional account of the rwandan genocide from the point of view of an olympic class runner and geology student running the rift refers to the geologic formation as the continent of africa is pulling apart as well as the social rift between hutu and tutsi it is heartbreaking and moving and in an odd way uplifting but it doesn't offer much insight as to why there was so much anger and violence between the groups","90":"incredible heartwrenching without gratuitous violence just enough to know you are in rwanda and to feel for the characters without having to put it down","91":"story of the rwandan conflict between the hutu and tutsi sad dark but ultimately redemptive loved this book","92":"challenging book content but very informative","93":"naomi benaron's book about a young tutsi boy who grows up in rwanda with a hope of becoming his country's entrant as a runner in the olympics is a fascinating read she presents the people the country the culture with an underlying love and understanding and a talent for expressing it jean patricks' story is a tragic one in this terrible chapter of this country's history but it is also one of survival love and hope","94":"slowed down by all the foreign words descriptions and names i still enjoyed this work of fiction based on the genocide in rwanda in '95 jean patrick is a native distance runner who observes and is affected by the brutality in his country","95":"great book an insightful book about the a runner training for the olympics in rwanda before during and after the tutsi genocide really eye opening and the authors descriptions about running and the feelings of running are spot on and beautifully written plus the heartbreaking descriptions of the genocide in rwanda are gut wrenching highly recommend read this is less than a week","96":"this is the most recent winner of barbara kingsolver's bellwether award for fiction about the rwanda genocide it is told from the perspective of jean patrick nkuba a gifted tutsi boy who dreams of becoming rwanda's first olympic medal winner in track this book captures the horrors of what happened as well as capturing the culture","97":"this book is unbelievable my favorite in 2012","98":"ever since mudbound i always make time for barbara kingsolver's selections for the bellwether prize for socially engaged fiction unlike most reviewers i can't rave endlessly about this one but there are a number of positive things to say about this novel the author manages the difficult task of writing a story about the rwandan genocide that still captures the ordinary amidst all of the extraordinary violence people fall in love they celebrate holidays with their families they develop lifelong friendships a boy trains to be a world class runner in the hope of representing rwanda at the olympics the rwandan people and the rwandan landscape are painted with a surprising amount of compassion which contrasts somewhat inexplicably with the violence that these same people are then able to inflict on one another","99":"what a compelling story of a horrific situation hard to believe that this happened so recently character development is wonderful and challenges of living in a sinful world are shown clearly","100":"i really enjoyed this novel culturally astute and sensitive excellent characters and vivid depictions of genocide fear and violence and of course it made me want to get out and run i was a tad disappointed in the climax like the air had been let out of the story but overall this was an enjoyable read","101":"i was a bit torn whether to give this one 4 or 5 stars and went with 5 because well it's about africa and i tend to be biased anyway this was a really great read i didn't really want to stop reading it it's the story of the 10 years leading up to the rwandan genocide and a few years after through the story of a rwandan boy who dreams of being an olympic runner so it has a ton of elements that i love in a book sport passion africa the story was well told and heartbreaking once it got to the end and the actual atrocities it has a hopeful ending but not really a happy one which i appreciated since there weren't really any happy endings for most people at that time in rwanda it's really easy to read other than the fact that it's heavy stuff has a lot of factual stuff it wasn't exaggerated or made up real events were portrayed and woven into the characters lives take this as someone who knows a lot about many events in africa but is by no means an expert i'm not really sure what else to say about it but i really liked it it's a good book even if you're not really into africa or rwanda but take my review as someone who is biased toward books about the subject just look at my book lists","102":"beautiful and heartbreaking","103":"iam so glad i read this book genocide is a sad topic to read about but the book was also filled with hope and determination","104":"reading this book reminded me that it is easy to be completely oblivious to events in the world as i read the story i was struck by the fact that the main character jean patrick was only slightly older than i am the things he worried about in high school and college were the furthest things from my mind and the realization hit me hard we are truly privileged therefore i was especially interested interested in the interviews with the author that followed my copy of the book like me the author comes from a privileged western background and i can't help but wonder what it's like to dive into this world and create characters that go through this experience can we trust her voice does it matter as long as the story is told well be warned book club friends if this book is chosen i would love to hear what folks have to think about this kind of witness fiction","105":"an interesting tale of determination among despair","106":"an enthralling story good solid writing credible plot characters texture a little running and a little history thrown in","107":"i really enjoyed this book more so for the history that was told of the genocide in rwanda we americans were so far removed from these events that i really appreciated the details of what life was like for these people during those times i didn't really connect with the characters found them somewhat lacking in character for lack of a better word but everything else made me power through and i ended up enjoying the book very much despite my dislike of the main character","108":"a compelling story about a young tutsi boy aiming to run in the olympics specifically in the 800 meter race and growing up as a young man during the historical tragedy of the 1994 rwandan genocide beautiful and tender and sometimes complex are the descriptions of family relations and dear friendships and of the hopefulness for the future in naomi benaron's first novel be warned although there are no graphic details she does not pull any punches on the events and horrors from that tragedy through the horror the characters shine and truimph it's culturally rich storytelling i appreciated that she focused more on her story and characters than albeit mentioned briefly throughout the book the politics of the day if i wanted to read about the political details then i would have chosen something else to read","109":"read this for a book club engaging story that follows a boy in rwanda during the 1980's and 90's with the skills to eventually run in the olympics i have no background knowledge of rwanda so at times it was a lot of political stuff to sort out but ultimately the story sucked me in and i learned so much about rwanda the descriptions of the land and food make me want to visit one day","110":"it kind of feels like the author just tried to shove everything she knows about into one novel rwanda running geology it makes for a strange fit and a bit obvious and wordy at times but it also was pretty moving at times","111":"running the rift is a story of te rift of tutsi and hutu in rwanda jean patrick nkuba is the runner both in the sense of training for the olympics in high school and university and in the sense of running back u0026amp forth in his identity as a tutsi who sometimes takes on a hutu identity in order not to get killed i had no idea that the tall skinny people were classed as tutsi and the stocky people were considered hutu nor how horrible it was for those of one group who married someone from another group this story builds it gives us the view of houses without electricity that are small and those that are large it builds in us a sense of the scenery and people a family a coach a love tourists and killers it gives a sense of hope eternal wishing and working towards a goal of winning the olympics and the awful trama to be suffered in one's love of life i have not told the story others have for there are many reviews below if you take this and the film of hotel rwanda you have a fleshed out picture of what happened in the1990's in rwanda it surely is worth the prize it got","112":"a good book that follows a boy as he grows up during the buildup to the 1994 genocide in rwanda and what happens to him his family and friends it might be hard to imagine neighbors killing neighbors but that is exactly what did happen and the author captures the horror and heartbreak wish i could believe genocide would never happen again in real life","113":"amazing book through the eyes of jean patrick we are able to see as the events of the rwandan genocide unfold in an exiting way naomi benaron shows just how ethnic difference have no meaning to equality among people","114":"wow i put off reading this book because it seemed silly to write about a boy's quest for the olympics with the rwandan genocide but it works and the book focuses more on the genocide which is so frightening that it took place during my lifetime the book really starts to move along the second half","115":"sad story well written from the point of view of a tutsi in rwanda","116":"i won this book in a goodreads giveaway and will now make sure all my friends know about it knowing the tragic history of rwanda i found myself holding my breath on nearly every page running the rift is a wonderfully written book about a tutsi runner trying to achieve his olympic dreams in a country and a time where one day he might be a hero and the next day he might be murdered","117":"really liked it is certainly a misnomer for this particular 4 star rating how can i suggest that i liked the anxiety and tension that hung over me as i dreaded turning the pages of this novel the deceptiveness of chronicling jean patrick's emergence as a world class runner and his broadening relationships is exposed by the interspersed unrelentingly raw in your face reporting of the genocide that consumed rwandan society in the 90s how can i claim to have liked being brought to the point of being ashamed of being part of the human race so this 4 star rating would be better designated as really needed to be read benton's writing and characterizations are compelling and skillful the only thing that kept me reading to the end","118":"jean patrick a young rwandan lives through the horrific conflict between hutus and tutsis in the mid 1990's an aspiring runner he pushes himself to excel in school while his nation's political situation swirls around him conflict reaches a fever pitch and jean patrick flees his home and loses the life that he dreamt of if you aren't familiar with rwanda's recent history benaron does a fine job including historical details in the text a quick wikipedia read might be helpful in establishing context a few reviews commented that while this is a work is written at an adult level it has a bit of a ya feel the main character grows from a gangly teenager to college student this is a work that may also appeal to mature or politically interested high school or college students oh i read an arc of this book that was missing pages 151 182 ahh good thing i put this one off for a long time and found a new copy at my library","119":"this book grabbed me from the start and wouldn't let go i have been to rwanda and toured the genocide memorial in kigali so i'm sure that i am a bit biased with that said this story is very well written based on history and truth and will appeal to anyone who wants to understand more about international cultural conflicts and how easily it can flip someone's life completely upside down spiraling out of their control","120":"book

novel that i could read extremely quickly but i forced myself to take it slow and enjoy it to its entire potential if you like reading novels about what matters in the world then benaron's novel is perfect for you running the rift is another fabulous bellwether prize novel a pure gem","121":"this reminded me of a thousand splendid suns in that it used beautiful writing and an intimate personal story to portray horrific violence in this case the physical psychological individual and national violence of the rwandan genocide","122":"the amount of violence death and sadness there was in this poor young man's life is unfathomable a heartbreaking story","123":"http www thebookbag co uk reviews i","124":"by pure coincidence i finished this novel about a boy man training to be an 800 metre runner against the backdrop of civil unrest war and ultimately genocide in rwanda in the week that the olympics start in london and on the day that on channel 4 news there was a short piece about the struggle of two somali athletes who have trained and survived despite their own brutal civil war and have just arrived in london the duo have made it but one of their training group was sadly killed it has very much put this novel into perspective for me and made me head to wikipedia to find out more about rwanda its geography the period in question the genocide the aftermath and the current situation which remains precarious with the current rwandan president suspected of supporting war crimes suspects in the neighbouring democratic republic of congo interesting stuff and well worth a read before embarking on this novel as much of what the author covers is now historic fact so what about the novel then when the narrative opens it is 1984 and jean patrick nkuba is a 9 year old boy who just loves to run he is the narrator and the book quickly moves on to his mid teen years at senior school where he is spotted as a potential elite athlete his early years and time at school takes up about a third of the novel and at times is a bit slow but it paints the development of jean patrick as a person within a loving and large family as an athlete and as a minority tutsi against the canvas of growing ethnic tension and the threat and realisation of violence from the majority hutu people the pace picks up in 1993 when jean patrick at 18 goes to university in butare both in terms of his athletic training and his personal life as he falls in love but more fundamentally in terms of the deteriorating political situation and the gathering storm of the genocide that was to come in the following year at times jean patrick is just too naive for true credibility and that can be a little annoying but his naivete is a useful device to enable the author to explain to the reader what is going on in the run up to the bloody and shameful events of 1994 it is always difficult to describe mass killings and like many an author before her naomi benaron has skilfully personalised them without trivialising what happened she covers the mass killings touches on the gang rapes and neatly blends in the ineptitude of the un with its peacekeeping forces who were already in situ and could have stopped it happening as well as the self interest of western governments who only flew in troops to get the westerners out but just left the tutsi's to their desperate fate it is worth mentioning that it is estimated that up to 800 000 tutsis and sympathetic moderate hutus were slaughtered mostly with machetes and clubs perhaps a further 500 000 women and girls were sysematically and repeatedly gang raped it seems that any tutsi woman who was not killed suffered this fate and of these up to 70 per cent were consequently infected by hiv bill clinton has said that his failure to respond and send perhaps only the necessary 5 000 us troops was the biggest regret of his presidency the french however appear to be pretty unapologetic as with russia in the current syrian crisis france was arming the rwandan hutu government and the extremist militias whilst supporting them at the un plus ca change etc great book but i wish the slightly hollywood ending could have been avoided","125":"i enjoyed this book about one man's attempt at escaping the genocide between the hutus and tutsis in rwanada it was sad but hopeful however it left me shaking my head at the complete senselessness of the fighting and brutality in rwanda","126":"favorite quote you can outdistance that which is running after you but not what is running inside you","127":"a fabulous book about rwanda the story of a boy with hopes of running in the olympics during the tutsi and hutu wars","128":"jean patrick nkuba is a young talented tutsi boy living in rwanda when we first meet him running the rift tells his story as he follows his dreams of running in the olympics although running and training take up most of his time and energy jean patrick can't hold himself entirely apart from the atrocities that are taking place in his country as hostilities between two ethnic groups - tutsi and hutu - escalate jean patrick's coach is hutu but does his best to protect jean patrick from those who would harm him even obtains for him a hutu identity card jp follows his coach's instructions and is able to attend college and continue his training with his help there he meets the lovely bea with whom he becomes infatuated their love and jp's dream however are not enough to avert the tragedies that are to come to them and to their nation the audio edition is read by marcel davis whose interpretation of rwandan english accents really captures jean patrick's voice jp's lack of aggression and violent tendencies unlike many of his fellow rwandans were very refreshing he was focused on more important things and would not be swayed i was more interested in his potential as an olympic athlete than i was invested in his relationship with bea - which felt like an uncomfortable distraction he manages to survive the tutsi genocide and the war but at the price of his dream to which i was more attached than he seemed to be i hoped he would somehow overcome his injuries in the end but he was primarily interested in renewing his association with bea good story but i was personally disappointed by jp's choices","129":"running the rift by naomi benaron is an incredible tribute to all who perished in the rwanda genocide in the early 1990's while the world looked the other way i picked it up because of the wonderful cover u0026amp a quick peek at the book synopsis i read it basically in one sitting ok i was flat on my back sick and was blown away by the moving story of jean patrick and his coming of age during the upheaval and horror of rwanda his dream was to make the olympics his reality was to slowly confront the reality of his life amid the horror and somehow to continue to believe in the goodness of people and our ability to love other reviewers have said that it plods along in the beginning i totally disagree benaron's path makes us care about all the characters admire their strengths realize how beautiful a country rwanda is and set the stage for what's to come we watch jean patrick grow up we see that people who live in horrible by our standards circumstances actually sometimes have more than we do the love of family in forefront in this book regardless of the horrible things happening this book will be my standard for 2012 my only complaint is i couldn't figure our what rift stood for until i dug out my atlas and saw that it's a valley that runs through that part of the world if it was mentioned i missed it i highly recommend this book","130":"it's not hard to pull me into a book set in africa in the early 1990s however this is a great read for anyone it humanizes the rawanda tragedy and highlights the tenuous nature of peace when racial tensions tug constantly at the status quo whether in the developing world or in a hoodie phobic gated community in the u s","131":"this wrenching tale was so hard to read as one knows the violent genocide at the heart of the story but the warm relationship of the brothers and the extended family as well as the sense of place elevate this book above the horror it is too long for the story that is told and the middle is slow but is imminently readable nonetheless and overall it is a rewarding read","132":"i really loved this novel it tells the story of jean patrick and bea two rwandans caught in the midst of the genocide that was unleashed not all that long ago the author captures powerfully in the stories of the characters including the two main characters and their families the human costs and dramas that occur in the midst of such unimaginable suffering and pain jean patrick is preparing to run in the 800 meters in the olympics for rwanda those plans will face many obstacles the intertwining lines of the characters do honor to the complexity and the brutality of this horror","133":"if you want to know how civil wars happen it's pretty clear here","134":"a great way to learn history of central africa i think i would like to read an autobiography or memoir though","135":"excellent read moving unforgettable characters and story set in such a horrific time","136":"amidst the tragedy of the events of the rwandan genocide there is hope as a young man passionately follows his dreams while remaining faithful to his family and country the facts surrounding this fictional story are accurate","137":"heartbreaking and eye opening a wonderful telling of the history of hatred in rwanda and the genocide that claimed far too many lives in 1994 an absolute must read","138":"amazing book couldn't put it down drew you in to life in rwanda as the events of the genocide unfold makes you realize how much mending of hearts bodies and their country is needed pray for this country loved this book","139":"the book started out fairly slow and focused mostly on the main character and his drive to become an olympic runner for rwanda but then as the story progressed it started to bring in the story of the rwandan genocide which was very disturbing to read the stories of the violence make this a very powerful and eye awakening story","140":"wish i old give it five more stars what an amazing story about unspeakable tragedy and those who survive","141":"wow first this is my favorite genre so that's positive number one the way the author was able to take such a horrific event as the genocide and make it readable and educational was amazing the writing style was also a positive it was captivating from page one and was able to hold my attention this is a thick book but surprisingly a fast read this is a must have for everyone","142":"one of the best books i've read in a while brings the rwanda crisis to life tragic","143":"a work of fiction capturing the escalation between the hutus and tutsis in rwanda and the resulting genocide told from the viewpoint of a tutsi runner it is a disturbing look at one person family's journey and the tragedy of that time it is not a gleeful page turner it actually took me a long time to finish knowing what was coming and how it would surely affect this young man actually dread turning the pages beautifully written and winner of the bellwether prized for socially engaged fiction a book you should read even if you do not want to","144":"wow that was an incredible book","145":"i'm kind of torn on this book on one hand if i get really cerebral about it i'm quite likely to pick it apart and detail all the aspects of it that i didn't enjoy however overall i ended up really enjoying the experience so i suppose i can say that the parts of the book didn't take away from the whole something like that upfront i want to say that this book is not ya i don't know why so many reviewers are claiming that it's more ya than adult literature true the writing style is very simple clean and straightforward benaron doesn't play verbal gymnastics like so many 'adult' authors but the simplistic writing style is a stylistic choice and doesn't make this book any less 'adult' whatever that means the sheer emotional brutality of the story places it above and beyond ya lit that's not to say that ya lit doesn't deal with difficult themes and situations but running the rift is not one of them perhaps it's because the book doesn't delve very deeply into the historical or socio economic causes of the rwandan genocide personally i would have enjoyed a deeper analysis and understanding of the situations leading up to the event but there are other books out there that would fulfill that requirement running the rift doesn't aim to accomplish that so it doesn't fall flat it's a coming of age story that works largely on an emotional level much like the kite runner and in that vein it's successful i liked the opposing parallels in the book as the protagonist comes of age his world dissolves around him life among death and hope through despair are the overarching themes here and they are strong the book starts slow introducing the reader to the characters and getting to know them well so it'll be all the more painful later when everything is inevitably ripped apart yes the beginning is slower but benaron paints a lush emotionally charged picture of families and friends with full lives hopes and dreams so even with little action the story is not boring once the proverbial sh t hits the fan the book turns brutal it isn't overwhelmingly gory or morbid but the real horror is in the words that aren't said it's easy to read between the lines and use your own imagination the protagonist skims the surface of the conflict which may not be to everyone's liking but it's realistic he's not trying to analyze the genocide he's trying to survive it as i mentioned earlier there are quite a few things i disliked in this book the protagonist's naivete is frustrating his marked refusal to understand or accept what's going on in his country tried my patience the love story felt forced there was no chemistry between the characters insta love and i thought it detracted from the story i get the whole 'love conquers all' trope but it's tired and i would have preferred a story about familial love which benaron did much better than the weak romance it also really bothered me how convinced jean patrick was that bea would love him if he tried a little harder to convince her it was a minor thread in the book but it reeked of rape culture to me and was enough to turn me off the romance for good bea is a lot more forgiving than i am evidently there were a few occasions where benaron relied too heavily on coincidence overall though this book drew me in and wrecked me in the best of ways don't read it for romance or deep analysis of historical and political causes for the rwandan genocide read it for the clean clear writing the wonderful familial relationship and for the reminder that there is hope in the darkest of times if that's your thing","146":"found this fascinating and totally gripping enjoyed the fact that these events happened even though story was fictional scary for the people that lived through this and tragic for those that didn't and was tied to a great story","147":"loved this book bought it for my son for christmas it's a great story a story of character development quick plot and good historical context it's heartbreaking and powerful","148":"this book is sooooo good follows a young boy in rwanda who has a gift for running and is headed to the olympics when the hutu tutsi tensions explode and threaten to end all of his dreams very descriptive beautiful writing i find myself now researching rwanda to learn more","149":"good read sloooow start but worth it an education on rwandan culture and genocide so sad","150":"for some reason when i started reading this book i thought it was non fiction i was a ways in before i realized that it was in fact fiction i probably would have never taken up the book if i had known that it was fiction the subject matter is too intensely sad and disturbing for me to read it for pleasure in the way i approach a fiction novel i am giving this book four stars because it is well written though it had a bit of a ya feel to it that would normally be off putting but benaron is talented there were some beautifully written passages i imagine that her future novels will only get better","151":"pretty good","152":"running the rift was a powerful story of a rwandan track runner who finds love fights genocide in his home country and works to find his identity and honor his tutsi heritage an important piece of fiction which has shed light on the rwandan genocide for me","153":"absolutely stunning heart warming and heart wrenching the violence is there but not gratuitous a few pages were particularly difficult to read but still this book is about life and love and hope a must read","154":"jean patrick is a boy growing up in rwanda when his father a teacher dies in an accident the family moves in with jean patrick's uncle the children continue their education in the school their father taught at where jean patrick's unique talent as a runner is discovered from this point on he is groomed to eventually take part in the olympics and make rwanda proud but the aspiring athlete is flawed he's tutsi and in times of growing tension between the ethnic groups hutu and tutsi he faces threatening situations and even violence however protected by the president himself jean patrick pursues his dream of olympic gold but when the genocide erupts he realizes that he'll have to leave his country and even the woman he loves behind and run for his life gripping beautiful horrific haunting inspirational running the rift was highly emotional for me at first i found it difficult to get into the plot and keep up with all the different character names but that improved with every chapter apart from that the language takes a bit of getting used to it seems the author uses some kind of local slang for the dialogs along with lots of rwandan terms and words some of which are not explained and have to be deducted from context i was hoping to find a glossary at the end for reference but couldn't find any overall a terrific read though naomi benaron blends historical events realistic characters and colourful descriptions of culture and people into this well written novel spanning a decade of one of the darkest chapters in recent history","155":"i received this book from the goodreads giveaways it follows the story of one rwandan boy as he experiences the rwandan genocide and the lead up to it i found the story very interesting as well as shocking and the book was so beautifully written as i'm not familiar with the african terminology pronouncing the african words in my head was a struggle but each phrase was explained in english and the use of african made it seem more authentic and believable at times i had to remind myself that it was fiction","156":"this is a very well written book the setting is in rwandan our hero is a young tutsi boy who dreams he will run in the olympics someday as you read it you feel the growing threat for him his family and his friends the story gives you a personal stake in the violence and a better understanding of the injustices that were done to the tutsis","157":"this book personalizes the rwandan genocide of 1994 as much as 20% of the population died when reading accounts of the gruesome facts one becomes so overwhelmed by the scope of the tragedy that it is difficult to focus on the life of one person this book is set against that horrible backdrop but is the coming of age story of one young man his love of family his country and the love that holds people together it is wonderful it won the bellwether prize for socially engaged fiction established and funded by author barbara kingsolver","158":"having a dream in rwanda in the 90s was just about impossible a wonderful story that gave me a better awareness of the tutsi genocide","159":"this is one of those books where the setting is probably more important than the characters and plot it's why i picked up the book in the first place and i was not disappointed in the portrayal of rwanda during the time of the genocide it didn't go into a lot of the history behind the genocide but it did show the way things led up to it and the attitudes of the people it was interesting to see how things went from the bullying of tutsis to outright genocide having read this i have become more interested in learning about the history and facts the premise of the novel is a good one an aspiring runner trains for his olympic bid in the midst of the racial tensions in rwanda it's definitely a book for adults but it reads like a young adult novel with a quick moving plot and not a lot of description or character details i also felt like the very end wrapped things up pretty abruptly to me these things are not deal breakers and i still found it to be a very good read i had enough investment in the characters that the losses were strongly felt i was angry for jean patrick when he was mistreated happy for him when he succeeded and afraid for him when he faced unknown dangers definitely recommended especially for people like i was who are unfamiliar with the rwandan genocide","160":"this is a well written fictional account of the rwanda genocide that occurred in the 1990's it is shameful how this was handled by the un usa uk etc any nation of wealth and power i was frequently reminded of the non fiction book written by a tutsi survivor of the genocide left to tell by imaculee ilibagiza she spoke at our church in maryland and her strength courage and faith in god were absolutely incredible as far as running the rift i would have given it 5 stars if the author had covered more of the genocide it is only covered by about 50 75 pages i say this not because i want to read more gore and violence but because the american public should be educated on the genocide i bet a lot of americans don't even know it happened this was a holocaust in modern times there is a line in the book that describes the genocide well god help us we have descended into hell","161":"almost never do i stop reading a book but this book i laid down after about 100 pages the writing is plain bad and distracts me from the story plus i did not enjoy 1 page of it and 1 4th into the book did not care about the characters or the story not sure how this is getting rave reviews","162":"i give this book 5 stars because i found it so engaging and the strong family ties and relationships were very endearing it was also however a horrific and sad story about needlessly shattered families and lives during the rwandan genocide in 1994 i found myself often angry about the problems and pain that power causes in our world often exacerbated by past colonization present occupation efforts by non indigenous people and lack of education in areas where that causes greater disparity i was also deeply saddened by how we humans are so quick to objectify other humans that we 'perceive as a threat or lesser' it happens everywhere africa the middle east europe the us the far east and even in america's ever growing political fiasco corporate power problem and inner city gangs it is perhaps most evident by the increasing number of holy wars around the world this book could be a great eye opening to the world about how actual people and families are affected by our collective ignorance and 'blindness' to the plight of 'others' and the horrible outcome if reason isn't maintained but if they aren't getting the message from 24 7 news coverage and awakening from that then this book probably wouldn't get through either it would just be filed as the problems 'those people' have never any introspection sad beyond the message i took away from the book the story and characters really came alive and the author did an amazing job of capturing the life of someone from a different culture and gender an amazing job actually","163":"i really wanted to give this four and a half stars and it really deserves that extra half star i've read a lot about the 1994 genocide in rwanda including dallaire's shake hands with the devil so i thought the emotional punch had been pretty well delivered before i picked up benaron's running the rift i was wrong while this is a fictionalized account of the genocide it provides perhaps the most accurate picture of the years leading up to it most books even the nonfiction accounts like shake hands focus on the year leading up to the 100 days of massacre that began in april 1994 what sets benaron's novel apart and and in my opinion makes it so powerful is that her novel starts in 1984 rather than painting the genocide as something that happened all of a sudden readers watch the momentum build for ten long years through the eyes of our tutsi narrator jean patrick like those living in rwanda readers see all the warning signs starting nearly a decade before the killing begins but again like those in rwanda we also see how easy it is to ignore those warning signs and still be caught completely off gaurd when the killing begins i couldn't put this down and flew through it tragic but hopefuly at the same time it was well worth the read","164":"a thought provoking story that gave a lot of insight into the tutsi and hutu conflict in rwanda i thought the story stalled about 2 3 way through and the ending was a little disappointing","165":"a powerful story of the hutu and tutsi conflicts as it applies to family and love relationships","166":"a bit boring and no real character growth","167":"benaron has created a rare and important novel in running the rift one that does what the best novels should in terms of making the character feel like a member of your family but by setting this tender portrait of the young runner jean patrick against the dark realities of the rwandan genocide the novel does what few nonfiction books on the topic can do deliver the human dimension behind the faceless statistics psychological fiction is made to cross the gulfs of scale and trauma and in benaron's hands you'll feel more immediacy to genocide than your comfortable with and here is where the reader's duty to be enlightened comes into play it all works because the characters are complex and nuanced i was gripped by every appearance of the the sinister yet fatherly coach rutembeza for example and because the book is so fully researched in every dimension a very compelling read","168":"really enjoyed this book of jp who has a talent for running and his aims to be at the altanta games the novel is based in rwanda and has the genocides as the backdrop and the novels shows some of the things which happened","169":"i wanted to love this book i am very interested in running and in long distance runners from africa however this book could easily have been 100 pages shorter it really dragged at times also as a runner i didn't really enjoy the part of the story about the actual running very much it was just kind of vague and struck me as unrealistic at times","170":"beautiful story of love passion terror and senseless violence benaron has written a story that shows resilience in the time of brutality jean patrick is a character i will remember always 365 pages2012 total pages 4375","171":"this book is beautifully written and speaks to the dark heart of tragedy genocide in rwanda while managing to capture true love in all it's glory from the moment the main character's father is killed the protagonist is thrust into an increasingly dangerous world seeking solace in his own talent running fast hoping to make it to the olympics the plot races along while the character seeks to save his family himself and his love from death it manages to walk a fine line between dark and light and does so beautifully a lovely engrossing read that both entertains and educates i can't think of anyone who wouldn't love this book unless you only read science fiction or non fiction","172":"what an incredible book very moving","173":"full review here http blog schoollibraryjournal com","174":"this is a very good debut novel every time i read a book about the rwandan genocide i turn the last page with a new awareness that good can come from evil hope from despair and joy from unspeakable pain","175":"a lovely beautifully written heart wrenching book on the genocide in rwanda","176":"this is a fictional account of the rwandan genocide of the 90's told by the main character a tutsi boy who chooses to become a runner the boy is naive and simply fails to recognize the politics and danger surrounding his life until it's too late for many of his friends and family and almost too late for himself many reviewers don't like this aspect of the main character from what i've been reading on this site but i think it sets a very proper tone most people simply want to get on with their lives thinking they are in control trusting their friends coaches etc and are unwilling or perhaps unable to see the larger picture i see this in today's america i read a number of accounts of this period in rwanda it is difficult to fully understand how these events could have transpired fictionalizing the account making it about one person and his family and friends helps us understand the insidious nature of politicized hate and how individuals can turn a blind eye for so long my daughter has good friends from burundi who have experienced a similar situation in their country i believe that this narrative has helped me understand their lives better as well","177":"the appeal to me was in the history of the turmoil in rwanda the characters in this story bring to life the horror of living through that time","178":"naomi benaron weaves powerful story of hope and endurance love and the ties that bind family and friends against a backdrop of the horrors of genocide how much will you bet me roger said that if we looked hard enough we could find our souls seared into the tree roger is the brother of jean patrick nkuba the gifted runner at the heart of this deeply moving beautifully crafted novel set in rwanda the tree has just been hit by lightning a metaphor if ever there was one for the devastation wrought of tribal warfare and the venomous lies it gives rise to it is a tree that jean patrick will find his way back to later in the novel but not before coming to grips with all that's been lost and what there is still to recover","179":"i really enjoyed this book but i think it helps if you already have some prior knowledge of the genocide in rwanda","180":"this novel manages to strike the balance between gentle and harrowing in its account of the rwandan genocide as seen through the eyes of a young man whose life is derailed by war through the creation of believable vivid characters naomi benaron gives the news reports a face that drives home the human cost of the horror definitely not lite reading but definitely recommended and definitely deserving of the bellwether prize awarded to fiction that calls for social change","181":"one of the best fiction books i've read in a long time to me the mark of a good book is that it makes me want to learn more about a particular subject while i already knew a little about the genocide in rwanda i found myself googling to find out more while reading this book what a horrifying and devastating event in our lives even though the genocide is part of the backdrop of this story it is not the main focus without giving too much away running the rift is a moving but also uplifting story so do not be turned off by the fact that it takes place around the time of the horror i recommend watching the pbs documentary called ghosts of rwanda for first hand accounts of the events in 1994 i watched it on youtube","182":"an up close and personal view of the rwandan genocide deftly told","183":"wonderful story even though it is set in the sad time of the rowanda genocide our shared humanity just shines through the whole book","184":"this sad sad tale really showed what happened during rwwanda's tragic history of genocide good writing learned a lot more about the whole time period","185":"an important piece of literature that brings home the cruelty and arbitrary nature of genocide","186":"the sense of foreboding that permeates this novel about a tutsi runner in genocidal rwanda is hard to deal with and yet it is so well written it kept me involved throughout no easy answers lots of questions about 'when would i have fled ' timely as a friend of my daughter's is now working in rwanda teaching english there would want to know the scars that remain","187":"i have to go against the stream here as many reviewers have given glowing recommendations of this book it is about the tragic events in rwanda in 1994 the book describes through the characters the fuse that led to the genocide one does feel the tension and the animosities between the two groups tutsi and hutu but the author does well to portray that not all partook of this hatred the main character is jean patrick who is a tutsi and a talented runner who starts training for the olympics he is caught between his obsession to train and run and being a tutsi the story is event driven but the characters jean patrick his coach beatrice jean patrick girlfriend and several more are all somewhat superficial there are long descriptions of loving family relationships which became monotonous except for the relationship between jean patrick and his coach their interactions were cloying and made the book plodding for me this book was not a page turner in fact it kind of lingered as i found excuses not to continue reading and the continuity of reality can be exasperating view spoiler for example at the end when jean patrick is reunited with beatrice she has a child which we are never introduced to - and as they spend much time together this child conveniently disappears so the question becomes who is looking after this child while jean patrick and beatrice travel about and rekindle their relationship hide spoiler this novel - given the cataclysm of rwanda - was somewhat devoid of impact it read like someone writing from a distance - almost like rwanda 101 it would definitely be better to read the books cited by the author at the end i would recommend shake hands with the devil the failure of humanity in rwanda by romeo dallaire all in all for me this was not really convincing","188":"very powerful book about the rwanda culture and the genocide that took place in 1994","189":"benaron's writing is stunning her words immerse the reader in life in rwanda the individual homes markets cafes and landscapes her words evoke textures colors sights smells one can feel the lush damp of the rainy season and envision the deep color of lake kivu against a backdrop of green hills knowing the book is about rwanda one expects tragedy the book would be false if this were not woven into the story through benaron's characters she shares the humanity of the people of rwanda along with the hatred she reminds that there are no winners in a war she shows that life goes on in the midst of extreme circumstances despite checkpoints and curfews people continue to live and love to appreciate what they have instead of dwelling on what is lost at the end of the story i had to remind myself that benaron herself is not rwandan she writes as an outsider looking in her acknowledgements credit a host of people whose stories are remembered in ways through the book it is their voices that bring the story to life","190":"this one is going to be with me for awhile","191":"my actual enjoyment level of this book was a 3 5 however i had to rate it higher because the book raised my social consciousness of a historical event that i didn't know much about there needs to be more literature that addresses serious international issues the genocide in rwanda was horrific and i'm ashamed to admit that i didn't know that these events took place the issues i have with the book are from a personal preference perspective nice alliteration huh the novel's protagonist jean patrick is an aspiring 800 meter olympian from a small rwandan village tensions run high between the tutsi and hutu people these tensions coupled with the unstable government lead to the book's volatile and horrific ending but before the story explodes in anarchy and violence the reader gets to witness jean patrick's development as a runner and college student and more importantly his heightened awareness of the escalating tensions that surround him on a personal level i was disappointed that there wasn't more running in the story but that's just because i'm a runner i wanted running to figure more prominently in the story and really see jean patrick's development as a championship runner i wanted running to transcend the political turmoil in rwanda and provide a hero that i could cheer for however running just seemed to be a way for jean patrick to interact with the various other characters in the novel and didn't seem to figure very prominently in the more important events in the story i also didn't emotionally attach to jean patrick when you don't relate to the main character it's difficult to really invest into the novel i found jean patrick annoyingly naive it seemed as if all the other characters were constantly protecting him it also seemed that jean patrick felt that his running would somehow protect him from the dangerous political climate that he couldn't be touched because after all he was mr olympics there were other characters with stronger core convictions whether they be good or bad that i found much more intriguing i especially liked jean patrick's coach his dual nature was an enigma that i kept trying to figure out as i read i also liked jean patrick's love interest bea she seemed far too articulate principled and cosmopolitan to really match up with jean patrick however despite my personal dislikes in this book i appreciated the increased awareness of rwandan genocide that i received by reading it i like important literature and this book was carefully and thoughtfully written i could tell that this issue was very important to the writer i also appreciated that the author did not rely on graphically violent descriptions of the book's culminating events instead she emphasized the resilience of the rwandan people and the beauty of their personal relationships the book ended hopefully and i liked that","192":"found this really interesting although it's no literary masterpiece","193":"great perspective of events in rwanda during the 90s","194":"the rwandan genocide in the 1990's was an event i knew little of before reading this wonderful book the main character is easy to love and root for a beautiful ending","195":"probably the best book i have ever read this book brought forth the tragedy that occurred in rwanda and the reality that the world stood by and watched yet through it all love existed families endured and neighbors both betrayed and supported all of the characters were well developed and each one grew as the novel progressed i would recommend this book to anyone who is interested in trying to determine what it may have been like in rwanda as a hutu or a tutsi","196":"the beauty and the tragedy of rwanda in the 90s is told with tremendous heart this is the best novel based in reality i have read in a long while the writing is compelling and beautiful","197":"the choice to set a love story amid the genocide in rwanda does not immediately seem wise but naomi benaron handles this story with such tenderness and sincerity that she succeeds in creating something both beautiful and horrific jean patrick is a young tutsi man coming of age in a large loving family while poor in material wealth his natural talent and strong determination to become and olympic runner drive him toward success even in the face of utu discrimination i appreciate how jen patrick struggles with his ethnic identity like most young people with a dream the goal supersedes a political agenda he knows he is given opportunities and accommodations not normally afforded tutsi but he accepts them forcing himself to walk that moral tightrope this struggle lends tension to the novel and forces readers to confront our own best and worst instincts without really passing judgment the novel's ultimate hook is its love story once jean patrick lays eyes on bea a hutu girl with her own strong sense of moral justice all bets are off manhood seems suddenly upon him and now he must make life defining choices benaron's choice of running as an extended metaphor works beautifully as jean patrick struggles with ambition trust and pride benaron sets a strong pace and the novel's start and knows just when to make her surge hard to believe she is a first time author herself","198":"a compelling read loved all of the twists and turns could not put it down","199":"the entire time i was reading this book i thought it was non fiction at the end it seemed more like a novel so i checked it out and it was","200":"wonderful highly recommended to those interested in rwanda and world issues as well as those just looking for a good story","201":"i've read quite a bit of non fiction on the rwandan genocide and this just didn't have the same emotional impact as the factual accounts do for me i never really got invested in the characters the way i was expecting to and the actual part about the genocide was quite short compared to the i felt overly lengthy exposition it wasn't a bad read but it did not meet my expectation of greatness i wanted to love it","202":"heartbreaking and inspiring personal and in your face specific yet also careful to the many many many subtleties required to navigate the huge region country and worldwide issues that impacted the characters and rwanda scenes on running training family moments coaching and the zillion other 'small moments' illuminated beautifully how life insists on continuing no matter how hungry the surrounding or impending violence is this novel definitely places a majority of the blame on the hutus not each hutu but on those who took political power u0026amp i'm not sure from this book how the tsuti's past decisions political martial otherwise may or may not have exacerbated the situation but that's the point of this book to get the reader to learn more","203":"i say read this book my daughter high school should definitely read this book college students they all should read this book read know learn think feel this book for the political there is much to be interested in in running the rift for those who follow the olympics summer games there is much to be interested in for educators at every level who deal with the political sway of every budget cycle there is so much to be interested in in the story shared and the truths that took place within this book at the same time this is a beautiful book a page turner a well written story a fascinating array of characters a romance a history a spirit filled journey of hope but i say all of that with a caveat i've seen hotel rwanda that was both a positive to know that among the total terror and chaos and horror of that time there were still individuals few as they may have been who gave aid and tried to stop what was happening all around them at the same time i had those images in my head the visuals to go with what i was reading and sometimes that was a little too much all the same i loved it simple as that","204":"naomi benaron \"running the rift\" algonquin books of chapel hill n c copyright 2012 pp 360 this novel explores the development of a child in a rural area of rwanda his father is a teacher in the local school at school tutsi's like the main character must excel in order to move up in a hutu dominated society a talent for running becomes a passion as does studying the sciences discrimination against tutsi's exacerbates and causes friction and intense divisions in rwanda training for running becomes more serious and an olympic possibility looms beside the upcoming genocide","205":"couldn't finish this one which is kind of unprecedented for me as this is the first book on my newly created couldn't finish shelf i have stuck with books that i thought were somewhat poorly written because i was compelled to find out the often predictable ending like the proverbial train wreck i couldn't turn away but this book was so uninteresting to me i had no qualms whatsoever about putting it down i wasn't invested in the characters nor was i interested in the painfully slow story so seeing as i had gotten next to no enjoyment out of the first 100 pages i didn't suspect i would get any out of the next 250 pages time to move on to a better book","206":"somewhere in the story an uncle explains how the division between the hutus and tutsis began the occupying country belgium measured features length of nose size of torso length of limbs etc and pronounced them two different people thereby laying the groundwork for turning neighbor against neighbor friend against friend jean patrick and his family go to live with his mother's brother when his father a highly regarded educator dies in an auto accident without the support of the education community jean patrick and his siblings must adapt to a new way of life and work hard to rise above their poverty the palpable fear that his mother displays at the story's beginning grows into a tangible presence as jean patrick's siblings learn the hatred that lies beneath the smile sneer of a classmate jean patrick's running ability singles him out and gives him a fragile protection as the standing government seeks to show the world that they can embrace and promote even the lowest of classes near the end as hope from the modern world fades the author spells out why no one will save them rwanda has no oil fields no gold no diamonds nothing to attract the attention of a greedy world","207":"this is the best read i have had all summer i picked up the advance reading copy at the ala convention in june the cover promised great things won the bellwether prize positive review from barbara kingsolver so i anticipated a great read this did not disappoint i warn everyone that the novel concerns great tragedy but the ending presents hope i look forward to more stories from benaron","208":"jean patrick nkuba is a tutsi boy growing up in rural rwanda he is a bright student and a gifted runner fast enough to potentially qualify for the olympics he was named after an uncle who was killed in a 1973 massacre of the tutsi people but such violence between the hutu and tutsi peoples now seems long in the past the story takes place between 1984 and 1998 over the years the tension gradually builds between the two groups as the tutsi people become increasingly harrassed and the media inflames racial divisions jean patrick's brother joins the rpf a tutsi rebel group but jean patrick heads to university and trains to be an olympic runner he befriends an american geology professor and falls in love with a hutu girl sporadically violence against tutsis erupts but jean patrick chooses to believe that his high profile running talent and his well connected coach will protect him from persecution meanwhile we the reader have a sense of dread from the outset that grows ever stronger this book pulled me in immediately the sense of place is palpable you can almost feel smell and taste rwanda as you read it while it is fiction it feels so real that i found it hard to believe that this wasn't a true story and that benaron isn't rwandan she's not it takes you inside jean patrick's head and you can understand why he ignores so many warning signs and warnings from friends about the tensions that are building it's so much easier to stick to the beliefs that you were raised with even when the evidence against them is so overwhelming when the genocide comes some hutus turn on their friends and lovers but others will risk and even sacrifice their own lives to save their countrymen while this story is set against the build up to the genocide in rwanda it's very much the story of an individual rather than the conflict itself parts are very difficult to read but there is a sense of hope as well it's a very powerful story engrossing to read and hard to forget","209":"great book learned lots","210":"if you stretch a spring long enough far enough the metal will fail and the spring will snap the same with a human body the same with a human heart the same even with a country beautiful coming of age story about a young man who is determined to become an olympic runner for rwanda while the genocide erupts around him","211":"this novel took me forever to get through i had to check it out of the library twice the fault is not in the writing in the story but rather the subject matter the novel centers on the hutu and tutsi conflict genocide in rwanda which does not make for light reading i found myself inclined to set the book aside for more escapist choices i am glad i made it to the finish though the last chapters were explosive the protagonist of the story is jean patrick his father has died in an auto accident when we first meet him but he has the gift of being an olympic caliber runner which has the possibility to transform is life that is if he can survive the coming genocide jean is tutsi which is the ethnic minority in rwanda at first this just causes mild discomfort but as the conflict escalates it becomes very dangerous his coach secures him a hutu card so that he can be safe the hutu and tutsi look so much alike that they have to have identification cards to distinguish them apart it brings to mind the dr suess story about the sneetches who's only difference is that some have stars on their bellies and this sets up the social class eventually the sneetches without stars figure out to get them and then no one can tell the sneetches apart which brings me back to the point that no one can really tell the tutsi and hutu apart either the fact that they are so alike does nothing to stem the hate and the violence reaches the tipping point the descriptions of the massacre were some of the hardest pages to read even though jean patrick endures unimaginable loss and hardship life goes on even when it does not seem possible this book does not dissect the origin of the conflict instead it shows the unfolding horror through a group of characters that seem like they could be your next door neighbors i highly recommend running the rift to anyone interested in learning about the emotional impact of the rwanda genocide","212":"this book broke my heart it drew me in so that i finished in two readings all my work indoors and out went undone once i met this boy and his family i couldn't stop though i knew the horror that awaited them in part iii powerful story so beautifully told excellent writer","213":"this started out as a great story but as it progressed it became too religious and preachy for me","214":"i received this as a first read giveaway i wish this novel was based on a true story i suppose my major quibble with historical fiction is that i always think the story itself would be more interesting if it was actually based on a real person in many ways i wanted to know that the main character actually lived and this was his story before reading this novel my knowledge of the 1994 rwanda genocides was very limited while i have worked with rwandan refugees in schools i was not clear about why there were so many refugees and the problems that the country faced i thought benaron did a good job of describing the senseless killings and the terror that people felt one thing that really bugged me was the fact that i requested this book because i thought it was about an olympic runner yes the main character is training for the olympics but this is in the background of his life story i felt that the olympics should have been a bigger part of the story it was similar to a book that has a main character be a teacher but then only mention a few things about his life as a teacher as someone that has competed on a college level i can attest how training for the sport takes over your entire life training for the olympics would be even more so and yet it didn't seem to be a big thing in his life","215":"would make a good ya if it wasn't so damn long good grief snore","216":"amazing by far the best book i read this year","217":"500 000 people killed in 100 days in a country the size of belgium an estimated 800 000 people killed over the course of a year death at that magnitude seems too horrible to be real but those are the estimates from the 1994 genocide in rwanda according to human rights watch estimates it's hard to grasp numbers that large given the choice between learning about genocide or looking the other way the easier option is clear but without knowledge of what has occurred in the past we can do nothing to prevent similar things from happening in the present or the future by telling the story of the rwandan genocide through the eyes of a jean patrick nkumba a tutsi author naomi benaron makes learning about the genocide easier i really loved this book and would definitely recommend it you can read my ciomplete review on bookgeeks","218":"a very humane treatment of a difficult time and makes me want to know rwanda well worth reading","219":"a wrenching story about the demise of rwanda with thoughtful characters one can relate to devastating story as the reader watches the country and the characters slide into genocidal chaos","220":"enjoyed the book a bit slow at times","221":"this book was very well written and full of sensory details and cultural references and the author's passion for sharing rwandan history and culture was clear still it seemed like something was missing the protagonist in particular just seemed generic like a composite character","222":"you can read my review on my blog about this rwandan novel http gwynethscomingsandgoings blogs","223":"for a book chronicling genocide there is so much life really wonderful and while any discussion of such atrocities is bound to be tragic benaron manages to end her narrative on a hopeful note looking towards the future the love story between jean patrick and bea is just so sweet too it shows there are things worth living for","224":"full review http bookjunkiereview blogspot com 2013 10 review running rift by naomi benaron_11 htmlsince he was a boy jean patrick nkuba wants more than anything to become rwanda's first olympic medal winner for track as the years pass jean patrick runs when he can the dream of olympic glory as strong as his legs can carry but as he becomes older the fault lines of rwanda are slowly exposed the racial tension between the hutus and tutsis simmer as jean patrick moves closer to his dream in the fateful year of 1994 jean patrick will have to confront the horror that unravels before his eyes and the possibility of losing everything he loves dear for over seven years i have done extensive research about rwanda and the genocide in 1994 in where a little over a million rwandans mostly tutsis were killed in three months when one reads about the genocide you descend into the catacombs for evil horror and brutality naomi benaron has done plenty of research for the novel which is very accurate the story begins slowly but the momentum builds up at one point i couldn't put the book down and i could feel my whole body tense up the fear roaring through me knowing of the incoming horror that is about to befall on rwanda that being said i couldn't help but fall head over heels in love for jean patrick and the rest of his huge family and friends it seems as they were real people which shows to me the author's devotion to each of them by the end i was in tears when i first heard about the book and checked it out i had a very good feeling that this was going to be a book that i would love my instincts were on the dot \"running the rift\" is filled with horror and terror but also tenderness and hope it is a loving tribute to the people of rwanda not just to the dead but for the survivors whom refuse to give in to the painful past and in doing so carrying the nation forward towards a better tomorrow the resilience and determination of jean patrick will resonate with readers just like it did with me a valuable addition to the literature of rwanda naomi benaron has done justice for the people of rwanda and of our common humanity","225":"i read this book because my sister has been living in burundi for the last several years and i wanted to get a better idea of the history of the region i don't think i would have read it otherwise and i found it interesting enough but very tragic i still don't understand how people can go to war against their neighbor just because they look different than them","226":"this is beautiful heartbreaking story of a young man coming of age in the midst of the genocide in rwanda i couldn't put it down in the last half and the final chapters had me weeping with a mixture of sorrow and hope powerful doesn't begin to describe it this should be required reading for all westerners who are largely unaware of what happened in our lifetime","227":"the unimaginable horrors of rwandan genocide form the context for this coming of age novel about a tutsi boy and his family an outstanding runner jean patrick is destined for the olympics and determined to surmount every obstacle when history outpaces him a harrowing but moving story that conveys the beauties of africa and its tragedies","228":"excellent story of a young boy into a man who loves to run and becomes his countries first olympic athlete complicated by the war of the hutu and tutsi wars in africa","229":"beautiful and horrible what else to say somehow i expected a harsher book that would make me feel numb as a thousand splendid suns did but while telling a terrible story a note of gentleness carries this book i can't pinpoint exactly how it works maybe it's bea i didn't know much about the rwandan genocide and i'm grateful for benaron's thoughtful telling","230":"i was disappointed with this book it was one of three books my book club considered several months ago i voted for it but the others chose something else fortunately we didn't choose it the story wasn't captivating at all i thought i would never get through it the last 100 pages were the best","231":"riveting story of a goodhearted naive tutsi during the rwandan genocide","232":"this is one of the best books i have ever read jean patrick nkuba has a dream he wants to be the first rwandan to win an olympic gold medal unfortunately he has to survive a civil war and genocide to get there any book about rwanda has to talk about the war but this book is not about the war this book is about a boy with a dream marvelous and lyrical read this book to rejoice in the inimitable spirit of humanity","233":"this book was disappointing to me it was easy to read in the beginning but the pace was so slow i could skip chapters and i was still able to follow the plot i left with a much better understanding of africa and the issues that lead up to the genocide","234":"determined not to be wimp i read this book a fictional account of a young rwandan with aspirations of running in the olympics unfortunately for him he was in the start of his pre olympic training when the horrible events of april july 1994 came to pass the author seems to do a good job of presenting the ordinary rwandan life of a boy with extraordinary skill a first glance at a couple of bios indicated she is qualified to write about running but nothing about any experience with rwanda a third bio i read said that she worked with rwandan genocide survivors in her and my hometown of tucson and that she did actually go to rwanda i read warily through the first parts of the book dreading descriptions of the terrible scenes i knew would have to be included but it wasn't too bad however what happened during those 100 days in 1994 could not be mentioned lightly and i reached that part it fell very heavily on me a lot of it was related 2nd hand he hears a scream he hears a radio report and he sees dead bodies lots of them but that's plenty heartbreaking these days i often find myself wanting to hide in my beautiful and fun life away from the ugly parts of our world but when i picked up this book i was looking at man's inhumanity full on the saddest thing is the same things that caused that tragedy are going on today ps one little tidbit i learned they managed to kill perhaps 800 000 people in 3 months but they actually could have killed more and faster if bullets weren't so expensive when people argue that guns don't kill people people do they're forgetting how much more efficient firing arms are than bare hands or even machetes","235":"excellent book the relationships between jean patrick and his family friends are told in a beautiful manner it is chilling to read how the tutsi's live in a different world than the hutus or the americans he befriends","236":"good historical fiction on rwanda's genocide","237":"naomi benaron winning the bellwether prize for fiction in her debut novel writes convincingly about what it was like for a tutsi to grow up and live through the rwandan genocide of the 1990s i actually couldn't decide whether to give it 3 or 4 stars but then opted for 4 stars because i was continually sucked into the story i am also a runner and the protagonist jean patrik is training for the olympics with the rwandan political tensions as a backdrop great book to get a feel for rwanda as a country physically and to learn clearly about the genocide and how it tore a country apart","238":"loved this book intense and sad as expected but still maintained a sense of hope that made it tolerable i feel like i was able to learn about rwanda through these characters' experiences i refrained from rating a 5 because i usually save that for books i plan to read again and again the intensity of this book requires some emotional energy to undertake","239":"on the bright side not everyone dies at the end this was an interesting story about a young man hoping to become an olympic runner in rwanda during the time of the genocide a glossary of rwandan words would have been nice","240":"in the country so many of us were so ignorant of what was happening in rwanda i learned so much from this book i didn't love the writing style but i was riveted by the story of an love family politics the power of athletics to almost overcome the politics of a country as a jew we have learned about the holocaust to never forget but this was happening during our lifetime and the west simply did nothing to stop it","241":"moving novel about running and rwanda","242":"very interesting i didn't know much about the genocide and i learned a little but felt like it didn't explain enough i would like to have understood it all better the story was mostly just about jean patrick and his desire to run in the olympics i felt like the book should have spent less time developing that story line and more on the actual genocide i felt like the meatiest and hardest parts were rushed i wanted more details","243":"the book focuses on the life of jean patrick a young runner who wants to become rwanda's first olympic track medalist during a horribly turbulent divisive period in rwanda's history it's a wonderful story about courage determination family ties thanks to the good folks at park road books for suggesting this to me","244":"this was a pretty good novel about the rwandan genocide i enjoy stories about how quickly one's fate can change at times this story drug in a bit but overall the reader gets a clear picture of the deep ethnic divisions between rwandans","245":"it's been more than a dozen years since i waded through the utter incomprehensibility of the rwandan genocide with we wish to inform you that tomorrow we will be killed with our families that was non fiction but this fictional story of a tutsi young man is just as powerful and disturbing you feel the fear and the rage and the stolid hopelessness that the divided peoples feel or are they divided peoples there is talk that colonial belgium or power seeking politicians cooked up these ethnic distinctions this account is from the tutsi point of view but you get a powerful taste literally so much talk of food of how much all these people all love their country as literature there are too much of meal descriptions heroic survival and enduring love for my idea of a great book the subject matter however trumps those faults read this if you dare to be informed","246":"a beautiful book well deserving of the bellwether prize for socially engaged fiction the author tackled a very tough subject the bloody brutal conflict between the hutus and the tutsis in rwanda and intertwined it with an inspiring story of a young runner who beat the odds in both heartbreaking and triumphant ways","247":"i don't even know how to begin running the rift left me with so many different emotions tumbling around inside of me my only regret is that i really don't know much about the turmoil in rwanda in the 90's i wish i did because then i would have understood the political part of the book a lot better definatly worth reading","248":"an interesting read within the history of rwanda in mid 90s civil war main character is a young man dreaming of olympics but everything gets lost in horror of civil war","249":"an intense and moving story about a runner in rwanda","250":"i've been struggling to write a review for this book for weeks now here goes nothing the journey this book took me on was like no other i've ever experienced perhaps this is due in part to being the first work of historical fiction i've read which was set largely in rwanda a tumultuous and rather deadly arena to be sure especially given the time frame this novel depicts and perhaps it is equally due to the absolutely haunting writing of naomi benaron who clearly took herself to another level with this story for a writer to have studied immersed in and managed to weave a story of this magnitude was no doubt an emotional experience to be shadowed by no other as i followed the characters mainly jean patrick the main character and hopeful olympic athlete through this book i could feel myself being pulled magnetically to him in africa as well as wanting desperately to run and hide despite not being able to put the book down an urge to cover my eyes small child watching a horror movie style overcame me more often than i can accurately depict through vivid depictions of the physical backdrop of africa through heartbreaking losses triumphant accomplishments and overwhelming odds benaron takes the reader to a time and place where the questioning of motives becomes both imperative and yet beyond dangerous using a fearless and yet absolutely frightened voice this author both makes and breaks the story page by page leading us on an adventure we may sometimes wish we weren't a part of yet will never be the same once having finished","251":"i loved this book so much i almost feel personally insulted by low reviews i have read other books about the genocide in rwanda what made this one distinct to me was the perspective from a young boy as he grew up in the years before and as a college student during i didn't think it read like young adult literature but i suppose it has been years since i have read young adult literature so maybe it does but if so it wasn't a detriment to me it may also have been the running that kept me so pulled in but whatever it was i enjoyed this book i enjoyed the writing style and was definitely emotionally impacted by this intimate look of the tragedy and horror","252":"at first i did not think i would like this book but it was very interesting and engaging you get to know and feel for the characters i would highly recommend it","253":"having once been a serious runner i loved the story she choose to tell of the rawandan genocide","254":"one of the best books i've read in a long time i am going to recommend it for our book club this year","255":"while this book was interesting i had a hard time keep up with all the characters and the difficult african names this is probably not the authors fault but my lack of focus","256":"i would recommend this as a insightful ya read on the rwandan genocide of the 1990s especially with with main character so committed to being an olympic runner","257":"running the rift captures the story of a young rwandan boy named jean patrick with a bright future ahead of him one where he could be an olympic runner but as the political situation in rwanda turns deadly especially to his own tutsi people jean patrick's dreams of running for gold seem unrealistic when he has to run for his life love is what keeps jean patrick running until finally one day he can stop and live life again this is a heart wrenching story about a terribly tragic time in our recent history jean patrick's story while fictional represented so many who lost their lives u0026amp family members during the awful genocide of the 1990's it truly paints a picture of the nation u0026amp the turmoil of the people through jean patrick's life it's a fantastic book for anyone wanting to understand more about african history people and war i really enjoyed this book it moved quickly and was quite emotional the characters were compelling and i found myself caring for many of them it was a great read \"it is love the teeth told him that resurrects life from death leave us here turn your head to the living \" naomi benaron running the rift","258":"this is a good story but it could should have been refined it read like a rough draft the chapters did not blend well and the story line was rather confusing i loved the characters though and do recommend this book as a good introduction to a promising author","259":"an enjoyable book for a book club read the main character was extremely likeable and seemed very naive the way he looked at what was going on in his country and the trust he put in people was refreshing but scary you kept waiting for the inevitable bubble to be burst by a pin as to who would be the pin there was a long list jean patrick showed a resilience few have and a strength many would want whether running or in living life he went his own way and painted his own picture of independence and true faith i was glad the book ending was on a positive note allowing a bit of hope for so many losses and a new start","260":"running the rift was a well written but difficult novel to read the author did a fantastic job of recounting history and the years leading up to the horrific genocide of 1994 it's the story of a boy who aspires to run in the olympics while all around him the cancerous venom of hate spreads throughout his village and world it wasn't easy to read but it was well worth it","261":"heartbreaking story about a runner in rwanda during the genocide","262":"the subject matter is what saves this book the writing is clunky very dick and jane when i started this book i thought it was either true or based on a true story not just using real events when i realized it was a novel in my defense i was listening to this not reading a paper book i was very disappointed how could she create such a ridiculously naive character and the foreshadowing so blatant this is my second novel from the do good bellweather prize people with barbara kingsolver as it's proponent never again why reward someone just for writing socially responsible novels unless they can do a better job of course given how much i dislike kingsolver's work and politics this should be no surprise bring on the dead coyotes","263":"engrossing story about the racial tensions and genocide in rwanda in the 1990's a compelling main character and detailed relationships","264":"this was an excellent book i will never be the same after reading it as someone who must have her head buried in the sand i am happy to be educated about the world and the things that go on there but i will be forever sad about the tragic loss of life during that time period genocide really it is beyond horrible i am better educated now but definitely sadder read at your own risk","265":"i so much wanted to love this book but couldn't get more than a third of the way through having the same issue with life of pi which i'm trying to read now looking forward to picking up the middlesteins when they open the libraries back up","266":"great story but written like a hong adult novel","267":"amazing story which through an engaging coming of age tale has educated this american on the conflict in rwanda","268":"they banged along the muddy road bodies sprawled across it women naked from the waist down a man with a single shoe the other placed neatly beside him two small children curled in an embrace littered belongings scattered in the wind hung from tree limbs identity cards fluttered like dying butterflies this is a beautiful and touching book i absolutely loved the author's descriptions she paints extremely vivid pictures of places and people and even the characters with a very small part in the book became flesh and blood to me i thought her pacing throughout the book was also brilliantly done even though there's always an undertone of tension she tells her story using african time for me this also shows how even in the worst of times human beings crave normality we keep on living and focusing on the everyday things like falling in love even though it's obvious that life as we know it is doomed what always gets me about the rwandan genocide is that your neighbors people you've know your whole life were the ones that turned on you and ended up killing you and your family what goes wrong in a nation when people can allow themselves to hack close friends to death with a machete if we were authorized to kill would we also be so easily persuaded i also love the title of this book rift having more than one meaning 1 an opening made by splitting cleaving etc fissure cleft chink 2 an open space as in a forest or cloud mass or a clear interval 3 a break in friendly relations a rift between two people a rift between two nations 4 a difference in opinion belief or interest that causes such a break in friendly relations 5 geology a a fault and b a graben of regional extent naomi benaron addresses all these different rifts in her novel i highly recommend this harrowing novel with it's memorable characters to everyone the story jean patrick dreams of running in the olympics and with grueling training he soon beats a world qualifying time but his chances of success are threatened by the ethnic tensions erupting all around him when hutu violence against tutsi's finally crescendos and his homeland rwanda is wracked by unforgivable atrocities jean patrick a tutsi has no choice but to run for his life abandoning fatherland family and the woman he loves finding them again will be the race of his life","269":"i think the rating provides a good summary it was amazing beautifully written with three dimensional characters providing a detailed and heartbreaking view of the genocide in rwanda jean patrick is a rising star in the running world but has the misfortune of being a tutsi at a time when the hutu majority was planning and executing an ethnic cleansing of the country i think it's hard to put the genocide in perspective given the staggering loss of human life focusing on a single character and the impacts in his life is a great way to make it more understandable","270":"i was distinctly underwhelmed by this book which given the subject matter and some of the events it covers is a rather odd feeling the story itself is quite interesting and written well enough that you can get quite engrossed in it although it did feel overly simplistic at times the biggest issue was that i found the characters a little flat and one dimensional and jean patrick's naivete somewhat out of place and rather grating i found myself skimming sections as things got a little repetitive with the genocide events the only part of the story that really grabbed my attention as this is where the characters and author showed any kind of life that was actually convincing overall a bit of a disappointment for me","271":"incredibly powerful historical fiction following the lives a a tutsi family before during and after the rwandan genocide the main character is a late adolescent boy an extrememly talented runner for awhile he becomes a token for the hutu leaders who let him pass as they pin their hopes on him to be an olympic hopeful for the country showing the west how tolerant they are despite the emotionally difficult subject matter i highly recommend this book to everyone in fact since the main character is an adolescent coming of age i think it would be great required reading for high schoolers and college students to open up a discussion on human nature","272":"not as powerfully written as it could have been or should have been given the heartbreaking and horrific subject matter","273":"5 stars first book read in 2012 i am so glad that i won this book from first read this book was such a sad and beautiful story it taught me about a time in history i knew absolutely nothing about i slowed my reading just so i could make it last and take it all in it took its time to get going but in the best way possible i probably never would have gotten this book if not for goodreads first read but i am so glad i did","274":"there are books i like honest this just isn't one of them this book is ya masquerading as lit because it is about the rwandan genocide so we can't just write it off i get it but it reads like a writing assignment the author has started with a schoolboy hero who is so naive that everybody keeps having to explain things to him thus to us as well the dude kept getting his lunch money stolen too which kept driving me crazy 'cause i couldn't see the point and it takes 200 pages for anything of any interest to actually happen i guess we have to be thoroughly convinced that jean patrick only wants to run before we can venture out of his tiny little world then in the second half oh my god there's violence killing and suddenly everything feels like an epilogue this book doesn't have the depth or emotion that makes it real for me each character is a little one dimensional cardboard cutout if you want ya that draws you in and conveys real menace try the book thief if you don't want ya skip this book or at least if you must read it after the first 50 pages skip to the last 100 pages you won't have missed much of anything","275":"many of the reviews of this book refer to this being a 'young adult' read i'm not sure what makes this anything but an engaging and moving book it's certainly not of the harry potter order of things this books cleverly draws you in under the guise of an young rwandan with a dream of being an olympic runner it then slowly brings in the horrific genocide of the tutsi forcibly politicising our main protagonist the last third of the book is gripping and believably disturbing","276":"poignant story about a difficult and unfortunate time","277":"remember the episode of seinfeld where jerry gets in trouble with his parents because he and his girlfriend were spotted making out during a screening of schindler's list the inference being that the subject matter of the movie is too important to not be in reverent awe of the film itself i feel like the chastened jerry while i consider reviewing running the rift the subject of the rwandan genocide feels too important for me to dismiss this book out of hand but i didn't really love it i'll admit i also didn't love sarah's key and the cellist of sarajevo i didn't think any of these books was particularly well written but will concede that they are useful introductions to horrific acts whether the vel' d'hiv roundup the siege of sarajevo or the rwandan genocide that more people should be aware of to the extent that any book provokes empathy and a desire for further research into the rwandan genocide and running the rift did accomplish both of these with me i believe that it does have inherent value beyond its literary attributes i see a lot of readers are dismissing running the rift as a ya novel posing as literature but that's a curious charge to me i didn't find this book juvenile just not great it won the 2010 pen bellwether prize for socially engaged fiction awarded biennially to the author of a previously unpublished novel of high literary caliber that promotes fiction that addresses issues of social justice and the impact of culture and politics on human relationships a jury decided that this is a work of high literary caliber so i suppose that validates the opinions of those who would give running the rift five star ratings but i found this book to be flawed there were many clunky lines as unsophisticated as something i may have been impressed to have written in high school jean patrick gradually shook off his morning companion named misery or ...uneasiness crept from the mist to sit beside him in his rickety chair and many times jean patrick would make a decision and then change his mind in the next paragraph this didn't read to me like the character's hopeless indecision it was just annoying he had to flee...the thought sent a chill through his body but from this day forward the only way left to help those he loved was to save himself...he would leave in the morning...better to run like a dog than die like a dog but what if bea was pregnant he could not leave her unmarried carrying his child he would give it another day maybe two or three plot points i didn't like there was no point in getting jean patrick a hutu identity card if he is nearly immediately told not to use it and it never came in handy in the end there was no resolution with the scar faced albert who torments jean patrick throughout the book and promises to kill him eventually i did not believe that jean patrick would flee to save himself when bea ran back into her parents' house i did not believe that coach would kill himself i did not believe that bea would apologise for allowing herself to be raped especially after emphasising that she was from a modern family not one burdened with misogynistic cultural views and i did not believe or want the happy ending of the lovers finding each other against all odds but mostly i didn't like the completely one sided take on this horrific conflict like i said running the rift prompted me to research what happened in rwanda and it seems very simplistic to paint the hutus as a people who were riled up to the point of mass murder just by radical groups and media in no way am i denying the genocide or saying they had legitimate reasons for trying to wipe out the tutsis but the history of rwanda the long subjugation of the majority hutus by the tutsi monarchy the mishandling of everything by the departing belgians the 1972 genocide of the hutus the fear that the tutsis were set to rise again through their guerilla rfp and its prominence in neighbouring burundi etc meant that the hutus were poised for radicalisation in this book naomi benaron paints every tutsi as a peace loving victim and most hutus as vicious racists in one particularly jarring example valerie the young woman who had just days before carried a we are all one people banner at a rally protesting the persecution of the tutsis upon hearing of the death of daniel the young hutu man she had been flirting with says in a zombielike mantra he was icyitso traitor he deserved to die as do you i think it would have been more horrifying and more honest if there had been some insight into how formerly good hutu neighbours could pick up a club or machete and start indiscriminately massacring their former tutsi friends as a last complaint this book was missing heart somehow considering the nightmarish source material i was never brought to the brink of tears and when i am invested in characters that's not particularly hard to do there were things that i did like about running the rift i appreciated the use of words in the local dialect and the way that they were introduced and defined it was one of those strange occurrences the policeman said that revealed ikiganza cy'imana the hand of god this felt appropriate and much more reader friendly than footnotes or a glossary tucked in the back pages in the same vein i liked the descriptions of the everyday routines and customs of average people and what they eat and wear i think that benaron did a good job of describing the scenery of rwanda from the lakes to the hills to the sucking mud underfoot in the rainy season and for the most part i did enjoy the characters but wish that they showed more growth i like the characters of jonathan and susanne in particular as representatives of the oblivious west especially when susanne bemoans the poaching of dian fossey's mountain gorillas completely unaware of how offensive this is to bea who is concerned with the killing of actual people this notion of the oblivious west is perhaps the most fascinating to me as we consider the civil war in syria right now and whether this falls under the moral imperative of the responsibility to protect doctrine that was adopted by the un in the wake of the rwandan genocide it seems everywhere we intrude there are unintended consequences ie the cia training bin laden to get the ussr out of afghanistan do we oust assad from syria now and let the al qaeda tied rebels take over the government how many civilians must be murdered or displaced before intervention is unavoidable because running the rift has prompted me to look further into these issues and into the rwandan genocide itself i can only conclude that it likely deserved its pen bellwether prize it certainly shines a light on social justice and that is always a worthwhile endeavor","278":"wow was this a great book i felt a part of a history that i didn't even know much about prior to reading this story i know it was fiction but even so i learned so much about rwanda during the 90's and the civil wars going on there things sadly i should have been hearing about and learning about at that time since i was in high school and college but that we were apparently not given much information about during that time sad i know these characters were not real but i felt so close to them as i read this book i didn't want it to end congratulations to naomi benaron this book deserved the honor it has achieved and much more","279":"educational read should have been a much shorter book dragging plot and repetitive writing was a slog at times","280":"an incredible work of fiction about an olympic hopeful runner during the rwanda genocide i cried during the tragic parts and then i cried again when good things happened this book depicts the horrific devastation of genocide and of the senselessness of neighbor fighting neighbor but this book also chronicles the strength of genocide survivors and just because of that i will give this book 4 stars","281":"one of the best books i've read in quite a while","282":"absolutely heart breakingly beautiful i think benaron sums it up best in her piece on social responsibility and fiction that was included in the back of my edition with fiction we fall in love with a world and the characters that populate it and so despite the unspoken horror we keep reading there are many horrors in this book both written and unwritten but benaron weaves these stories together in such a beautiful way that rather than needing to put the book down or turn away i found myself needing to keep reading word after word and page after page even with tears in my eyes and a heavy heart i did not want this book to end","283":"i was lucky enough to get an advanced copy of this book the big publishing conference in nyc in late may and i urge people to read it when it comes out in january 2012 to read my full review please visit the blog entry i wrote it http sofia perez com p 923","284":"great story tucked inside a sad one the rwanda genocide","285":"i really liked this book maybe it was the running story but i felt very connected to jean patrick throughout the novel and there were several moments that made me teary spoiler alert like when matilde died or when bea sent him the follow up note that said yego yes please come and the image of the un troops escorting the westerners out of the country while rwandan women are thrusting their still suckling babies at them pleading with them to take their babies and bring them to safety i can still see in my mind's eye the brown haired pig tailed girl on the back of the un truck mouthing i'm sorry to jean patrick the story of the genocide in rwanda told through the third person eyes of jean patrick a tutsi runner who dreams of going to the olympics was a complex story about divided loyalties and the complex choices that face every person the characters were multi faceted and well drawn i especially liked the character of the coach who you knew was bad but who still helped jean patrick in the way that he could i love books that transport me somewhere and i love books that make me think and make me feel something this book did all three it made me a little ashamed about how little i knew how little i was horrified by the genocide in rwanda and how little i do or even stop to think about what people in darfur and sudan are living through the bit about suzanne jonathan's girlfriend fiance who is worried about the mountain gorillas at the same time that tutsi are being run into the same mountain forests and hunted down hit close to home i'm one for those catchy play on words newspaper headlines so the title of the book appeals to me and if there was ever a book that might make me an activist this might be it i am known to say that really good writers don't lecture they don't wag their finger at you and tell you what to do or feel and that's not entirely true in this book but i'm inclined to forgive a little bit of the message in this book because there was so much humanity and so much hope n the story from the last page second to last paragraph it is love the teeth told him that resurrects life from death leave us here turn your head to the living","286":"i liked this book but it was a slow read to me the characters were likable and the backdrop of rwanda in turmoil was frighteningly real and tragic i learned so much about the conflict in rwanda through this book i wish the main story had been edited down too much repetition in the middle but the beginning and end were well worth the read","287":"awesome a must read especially if you love books set in africa","288":"i actually enjoyed it alot maybe this is just not my kind of book but it was very emotional and i recommend it","289":"what a heartbreakingly wonderful novel it appears every decade seems to have a genocide attached to it and in the 1990's it was rwanda's turn with atrocities that are still mind boggling to fathom this story sets the stage for one of the worst 'civil' wars in history and how some rose above it to make a better life i shed quite a few tears over this story of man's inhumanity to his fellow man","290":"reading this book will make you laugh and cry think deeply and most of all make you thankful you have the life you have","291":"a coming of age novel with the politics of the olympics and of africa added to the mix although i am not a serious runner i was intrigued by the training regimen outlined and by the strength of the family bond","292":"gentle brilliance rich with culture and humanity","293":"jean patrick a rwandan runner dreams of competing in the olympics he's naive hard working and kind he gets a lot of shit for being tutsi he falls in love with bea a hutu running the rift is a slow moving book tension discrimination and violence builds up while jean patrick focuses on his training the subject of genocide made me borrow the book but the characters couldn't hold my interest i don't know how a book with this subject matter can be boring the love story wasn't engaging either i wanted to love the story but i struggled to finish it http catoverlord blogspot com 2015 https www facebook com catoverlordhttps twitter com thecatoverlord","294":"ya book about the rwandan genocide it was interesting and heartbreaking to read about the hutu tutsi conflict but i just couldn't get past the choppy sentences","295":"a decent read but very predictable it did provide a little more insight into the rwandan genocide but i felt the story was lacking in a lot few areas i liked some of the other novels i have read on this topic a little better","296":"beautiful tragic hopeful writing and i learned so much more about the rwandan genocide that i embarrassingly admit i knew very little about truly great although graphic at times read","297":"i enjoyed this book even thought it seemed like it took a year to finish it was a slow read for me it was a heart renching book about the genocide in rwanda and how a young olympic hopeful triumphed through a devastating situation i could only give it three stars because it just didn't captivate my interest enough","298":"i liked this book readable heartfelt some of the plot seemed awkward coach bea but still i enjoyed it","299":"dnf as others have said i wanted to like this book and learn more about rwandan history but ultimately lost interest in the characters when i'm reading a work of fiction and it starts feeling more like homework than choice i know it's time for me to stop","300":"amazing lyrical beauty set against a backdrop of horror i switched between audio and paper formats and enjoyed both","301":"this is the most recent winner of barbara kingsolver's bellwether award for fiction about social justice at first i was a bit leery of the topic the rwanda genocide of the early 1990's the author is not rwandan nor is she even from the african continent i questioned how she could give voice to what happened during that time but i was pleasantly surprised \"pleasantly\" is probably not the best word to use here i found myself very tense while reading the novel i know what happened in rwanda i did not want to get too close to any character knowing that there was a good chance if they were tutsi or hutu and a tutsi sympathizer that they were likely to suffer a horrible death before the end of the story this was a powerful novel from beginning to end and one that i would highly recommend i was impressed by the craft of the author in incorporating what she knows best when i read that she was a triathlete i wondered how that gave her the necessary skills to write this book but the main character is a runner hoping to be the first rwandan to win a medal in the olympics the author has degrees in earth science and oceanography and worked as a seismologist and geophysicist for multinational corporations another central character is a professor of geology and the main character is studying geology at the university he recites the names of rock formations as he runs to keep his mind off the pains in his legs and frequently the pain in his heart the author has worked extensively with refugees survivors from rwanda and seems to give a reliable voice to that incredible time of history once again a bellwether award winner does not disappoint the reader","302":"i picked this book up for two reasons first after reading the excellent strength in what remains a non fiction account of a survivor of the east african genocide in the 90s i was eager for more stories about that time and those events second the book's main character is a runner and one who wants to concentrate only on his running and finds the troubling politics of the time irritating as well as frightening for a while the book had me but it was too long too slow in getting to the ultimate climax several library due dates came and went and i still hadn't finished it forced to return it for a second time and only about halfway through it i decided it needed a harsher editor and moved on","303":"running the rift is one of the best books i've read in a long time it's evocative touching heartbreaking and enlightening there's much to love about this book the characters the main character jean patrick nbuka is a young man with a gift a gift for running he comes of age in a complicated time as a tutsi he is labeled and categorized by a line drawn in the sand decades before his birth the world around him is confusing but jean patrick blocks out most of it by focusing on his dream to become an olympian only when the harsh realities of the world around him impact his daily life does he force himself to try to understand what is going on as a reader i related to this frankly there were no rational explanations for what happened in rwanda during this time jean patrick's confusion was the perfect vehicle for me to see this conflict if you've read the power of one jean patrick reminded me of peekay his running is what allowed him to hold onto himself while his world shattered around him the writing the author of this book naomi benaron is an author with a gift a gift for story telling the language throughout this book is pitch perfect the rwandan setting and the scenes of hutu aggression against jean patrick let me know there would be tragedy coming and the writing helped build that tension i appreciated that as benaron told this very particular story she let her writing tell a much broader story certain sentences jumped out at me as holding truth far beyond their meaning for just this story the descriptions of african food smells and scenery were some of the best i've ever encountered i felt like i was there the story running the rift tells the story of the rwandan genocide beautifully and painfully like all of the best books the book thief this story reminds us that real life is about running the rift that space where pain and beauty meet this story is much more than the story of jean patrick it's the story of all young people who have a gift and how it feels to use that gift if you've ever been thankful for the way your morning run makes you feel alive read this book jean patrick speaks your language it's the story of a life that teeters between hope and despair it's the story of not knowing who to trust or how much to trust them the setting i knew little about the rwandan genocide before reading this book i'd seen hotel rwanda and read a few newsweek articles but not much more having now seen the world through jean patrick's eyes i will never again be confused about what hutu or tutsi mean my one suggestion have a map of rwanda nearby as you read i waited until i was finished to locate kigali cyangugu and butare on google maps but it might help you envision these places more easily if you do that earlier rather than later perhaps future editions of this book will include a map because surely there will be many editions to come if you're in the mood for a book that is bigger than your average read not in length but in depth read running the rift if your own life feels confusing overwhelming and out of kilter read this book to get some perspective if you're looking for the first great book of 2012 you'll find it in running the rift you'll never forget the story of jean patrick nbuka and the people of rwanda","304":"excellent novel set in rwanda in the years leading up to the 1994 genocide and just after although fiction the book is authentic and tracks closely with survivor and perpetrator eye witness accounts and histories that have been written","305":"i really liked this one it started a little slow for me both the story and the writing then somewhere in the middle it just totally clicked and then i was completely engrossed in the characters and the conflict between the hutu and tutsi that led to the horrific rwandan genocide of the 1990s told through the fictional story of a tutsi boy who dreams of becoming an olympic runner jean patrick comes of age during this unbelievable period of time in a place that sounds beautifully ugly i loved her descriptions of the country the interesting cast of characters and the peek at this gruesome conflict as much as one can love such a thing a story of family ties love dreams trust betrayal hatred war shattered dreams and the renewal of hope and goodness it haunted me for some time after i finished it","306":"although the subject was not the most pleasant the protagonist was very likable and the story overall had a more hopeful tone than i expected recommended","307":"one of the best books i've read in a long time beautifully written","308":"very unique events the chronological order of this book is totally blow off my imaginations it is rarely happened amazing but not awfully perfect it was a school son crusader heroine story different i might say' ^__^","309":"a young boy focusing on his goal to run in the olympics and not on the reality of the conflict going on in rwanda believing the government will make things better i enjoyed the story and was enlightened about the genocide","310":"i believe strongly in reading about genocides whether the victims are armenian jewish bosnian or rwandan in the end they are all the same mindless brutal and bestial and gruesome to read about this story of an olympic hopeful runner who has the incredible misfortune to be training at a time of the rwandan massacre is as horrific as it needs to be while offering insight and unexpected hope one gets the feeling that his experience was so traumatic that he lets it in only a little at a time which is merciful to the reader as well","311":"excellent account of the rwandan genocide","312":"powerful excellent book which brings the horror and realities of the genocide in rwanda to life in a very personal way through the characters in the story","313":"this book is a good read about the genocide in rwanda i still can't believe something like this happened in my lifetime the story of jean patrick nkuba a gifted runner helps you see how those in power used fear to create a tinder box just ready to be ignited jean patrick is a tutsi in a world where life has become restrictive and even violent for his people as tensions between the hutu and tutsi mount jean patrick uses his running as his hope to escape the violence and become rwanda's olympic medal winner but in the end jean patrick must run to save his life a compelling story that focuses more on the build up to the violence and how the tinder box of fear was ignited among the hutu people than the actual violence itself i liked the story but felt like it bogged down in the telling i found it interesting and enlightening","314":"i struggled with my rating for this book the first half is slow even dull there were nights i picked it up read 2 pages and then got distracted and set it aside to waste time on my phone or to read a magazine instead i nearly returned it to the library unfinished however i'm so glad i stuck with it it picks up considerably in the second half which i finished in just a couple of days barely able to put it down the book follows the story of jean patrick nkumba a young man looking to put rwanda on the map for running he is training for the 800 meter at the world championships with an eye on the olympics the rub is that jean patrick is a tutsi an ethnic group currently out of favor with the ruling hutus and faces threats discrimination and worse on a regular basis even as rwanda's president chooses him as a token to show the west that rwanda is a tolerant nation tensions simmer and his safety is threatened repeatedly the rwandan genocide was horrific in april 1994 tensions boiled over and for 100 days an estimated 500 000 1 million rwandans were killed 70% of the tutsi population and 20% of rwanda's population overall the violence described in the last third of the book is difficult to read and even more difficult to understand is how the west stood by and did nothing one of the more eye opening passages involves the sympathy a visiting american shows toward the gorillas killed in the congo while unknowingly surrounded by a table of people who are facing the same fate this along with some of the other passages in this book will stay with me for a long time","315":"while i thought the story and the history in this book important and one i need and want to learn more about i never really connected with the voice of the mc","316":"i wanted to feel more heart personalization about running by the main character","317":"this book is more about the harshness and reality of life than the novelty of running there were parts that will lifted my spirits and there were points where i felt so much agitation that there are people in the world still living in these situations this story serves as somewhat of a memoir of the rwandan genocide but makes apparent that there are people in the world who are still in poverty this book has inspired me to want to make a difference in other parts of the world","318":"this is a coming of age story at the time of the rwandan genocide i read it with a sense of dread knowing what awefulness was coming it was an example of how i seem to learn more about history through fiction than nonfiction","319":"beautifully passionate i loved the writing and the entire story is both heart warming and wrenching","320":"it was an interesting read covering a vastly terrible time in rwanda that no one wanted to think about then and even now i lived in kenya at the time it happened horrifying to be so close and worse still to see the global inaction reprehensible that no one intervened and it pointed to the utter ineffectiveness of the un a sad topic the terror of tribes not for those wanting a light read but at least a book set in africa not many of those","321":"jean patrick nkuba's wants to believe his father's words that hutu and tutsi can live in peace his father is a teacher a man who hopes for a bright future for his children death comes for his father unexpectedly leaving the family bereft in a climate of escalating tribal tensions with the dream of peace fading fast jean patrick wants to run he has legs that fly and hopes for olympic gold benaron has managed the formidable accomplishment of writing a beautiful haunting story of family of a young boy's coming of age of the power of striving to be the best and of redemption it is a hopeful story despite the rampaging grim reaper that defiled rwanda","322":"a face on rwandaa face on rwandaa must read for every citizen in the world that our false belief s can lead to such destruction another reason that violence e is never the answer","323":"brings to view the struggles between the hutu and tutsi during the rwanda genocide while sharing a fictionalized story of a rwandan olympic contender","324":"i'm sure listening to this was more vivid for me as i just returned from my rwanda trip in december such a difficult thing to think that this could happen in the not so distant past amazing the resiliency of the human spirit","325":"as this novel opens jean patrick is just a young tutsi boy in rwanda but running has already become an integral part of his life as he grows it becomes apparent that one day his athletic gift has the potential to take him to the olympics but as jean patrick matures the political situation in rwanda becomes more and more unstable jean patrick has little interest in politics but even he cannot help but become entangled in what ultimately becomes the rwandan genocide fascinating descriptions of rwandan geography and culture strong portrayals of family and friendship help to soften some of the most gruesome aspects of the story","326":"initially i wasn't super stoked about this book my library system had a bunch of copies and almost all of them were available not a good sign either everyone hated this book or it was the best kept secret the book follows jean patrick nkuba through various times in life as a young rwandan nkuba loves running but is constantly being beat by his older brother meeting an olympic runner changes his life and realizes his dream is to compete in the olympics this dream is challenged as nkuba is tutsi living in a country which becomes more restrictive and violent this book was really engaging it took me a bit to get into but once i did i found this an addictive read this book isn't weighted down with tons of history instead the author gives it to you in chunks the four stars is really for the ending which i found a little dramatic and overdone but i would recommend this book to others","327":"culturally rich shows the progress of jean patrick from the day he knows that running will be his life to the moment he must run to save his life he lives in a world rwanda that has become increasingly restrictive and violent for his people this book also reveals the causes and effects of rwanda's tragic history and more important to protray the resilience of the human spirit","328":"heartbreaking i cried at least three times there are thousands of stories that came out of the rwandan genocide and while this is a work of fiction the author spoke with numerous survivors to piece together this story it's both tragic and touching","329":"i couldn't put it down heartbreaking but uplifting story of survival","330":"i'm torn on this one i really enjoyed the coming of age story of jean patrick the main character but i had a little bit of a hard time connecting with many of the other characters i don't know if it is because this is a fictional account that is taking place during an actual historical event that made it a little harder to connect with them or not i kept waffling between 3 and 4 stars because i really enjoyed the beginning and also the ending of the book but i kind of had to muddle through parts in the middle i am still glad i read it but wonder if i would have enjoyed it more had it been a true story like left to tell","331":"i liked the unfolding of this book one young man's life during the buildup to the genocide terrifying and believable","332":"culturally rich and completely engrossing was barbara kingsolver's review and seeing that gave me all the confidence in the world that i would enjoy it when a friend also told me i would love it i was doubly convinced this is an excellent book that brings the politics of the hutu tutsi conflict and the rwandan genocide to life through a heart wrenching story through the eyes of a strong and brave young rwandan who dreams of running in the olympics it's hard to believe the genocide really occurred because it is so horrifying almost beyond belief but this book put me in the shoes of a persecuted tutsi i have read a few books about rwanda and this is by far the best it's also a good book for those that love to run one of my favorite quotes is how much this book of life changes and we are not the ones to write the pages 65","333":"really liked this book i don't know how accurate a picture of the genocide this gives and i know there have been some criticisms that it was written by a white woman not a rwandan but still i think she does an awesome job of building believable characters we care about a lot the writing is good the pacing good the ending a welcome relief from all that pain","334":"the attention to detail in this book is what makes it so great the care with which she studied the language customs and ways of rwanda as well as describing everyday interactions the scenery and day to day life was spectacular it's really not easy for a foreign writer especially writing about africa which can sometimes get overly sentimental simplistic white man's burden etc i found myself drawn further and further into the story until i couldn't put it down some of the scenes were truly heart wrenching and some were even the simple ones like passing a man being harassed in the marketplace she really did a wonderful job encapsulating such a traumatic time and putting it into perspective that it was carefully planned and not spontaneous the only thing i didn't like were some gaps in information that i found confusing and occasionally disjointed parts otherwise it was a fantastic read","335":"i loved this story i love historical fiction about more recent history and this was just that also the characters were easy to relate to and have empathy for i would recommend this book to anyone who wants a deeper more personal look at the rwandan genocide","336":"a bit slow at times but definitely a worthwhile read in order to better understand the horror of genocide in rwanda the beauty of the country and its people also shines through the fictionalized account of a young rwandan runner","337":"i was swept into the drama and culture of rwanda in the early 1990s through the main character who hopes and trains to fulfill his dream running in the olympics","338":"over the past year i have read several books concerning the ongoing civil wars in africa i am always shocked at how little i have been aware of the conflicts going on in the world during my lifetime particularly those going on in africa this book dealt with the conflict between the hutu and tutsi tribes during the early 1990's i find it interesting that i was aware of the conflict occurring in bosnia around the same time period but much less aware of the conflict addressed in this book often in the story it is mentioned that the tutsi people did not understand how the united nations were not coming to their rescue time and time again the u n intervened only enough to pluck citizens of other nations out of harm's way rather than offer the kind of support that would have ended the violence i found myself having a difficult time engaging with this book for the first 100 to 150 pages the pace is very slow and it feels that the author did that intentionally once i became used to the pacing however i found myself much more involved with the story the plot centers around a tutsi runner pursuing his dream of running track on an olympic level however the conflict interferes with those dreams and he is forced to question his identity and his loyalty the story becomes one of willpower and survival among insurmountable odds i would recommend this book to those who have an interest in global history it was a book that sent me looking for additional information and also increased my interest in gaining more understanding about a piece of history that occurred during my lifetime","339":"i won this as a goodreads first reads winner this book was a page turner it opens your eyes to a completely different life it was completely heart wrenching at times but it let's you in on a story a bravery and dedication like no other it gives hope when there seems there is none left a must read","340":"disturbing story of the affairs in rwanda through a tutsi boys' eyes the book starts off with the tragedy of jean patrick's father being killed in a accident that has nothing to do with politics their lives change but jean patrick continues to have opportunities based on his academic and running abilities he is a true olympic hopeful for rwanda he runs for himself his family and his people he becomes friends with an american professor and this is his salvation the end seems a bit far fetched nut brings the characters full circle it is at times hard to read due to having to slow down to read the african and get all the descriptive details the author describes the horrors of a civil war without battle scenes a beautifully written disturbing story","341":"while not capitalizing on the metaphorical power of her hero's olympic dream benaron's story of the rwandan genocide is nonetheless complicated and powerful i found myself detached from jean patrick something i didn't like much at first but appreciated towards the end definitely worth a read even through it wasn't the most resounding piece of fiction i've ever read","342":"what a wonderful terrible awesome horrendous inspiring depressing book genocide is unspeakable but jean patrick and bea give hope","343":"review to come","344":"gripping and beautifully written loved this book","345":"i actually only read about half of this book it sounded like it would be interesting tutsi boy looks like he is headed for the olympics in running but it never went anywhere","346":"amazing story and one which needs to be told about the rwanda genocide as much as i enjoyed this book i must say the first half was a bit plodding i was anxious for things to pick up and i felt confused by the age of the main character as she seldom updates his age over time i also found little things in her writing that i felt were way overused like the constant references to his roommate's tongue once you hit the second half it's difficult to put this book down or to get the story out of your mind it's frightening to think this all took place in the 1990s i highly recommend this book","347":"this novel is a good companion read to left to tell http www lefttotell com book index php and an ordinary man http www bookbrowse com reviews ind the main character jean patrick realizes at a young age he has a gift for running he wants to be in the olympics with the background of the rwanda genocide we see him grow to manhood and face challenges most of us will never face it is also a love story and celebration of the power of family it is still amazing to me that these events happened in my lifetime and i was not aware of them until much later where were the western governments when this war took place and could it happen again","348":"this novel is one i definitely would have put back on the shelf in the book store since i typically veer away from books of extreme violence against other human beings however i committed to reading it for book club and i finished it when i thought i might not about half way through i remember reading about the tutsi genocide and also seeing the movie the hotel rwanda so i was not ignorant of the slaughter benaron has captured the personal in sharing the love story of jean patrick and bea in a country ripped apart by war it brings the horror up close and personal i had the same feeling of despair and horror when i read the cellist of sarajevo by steven galloway it too focused on the lives of a few people who recreated 'the endurance of the human spirit and the subtle ways individuals reclaim their humanity in a city ravaged by war ' and another book whose title escapes me about ethnic cleansing in chechnya in all i am totally baffled by such hatred of one group of people toward another especially when they share the same geographic and social space however if i take one thing away from reading this book it is that we are not immune to actions like these that such danger already exists in our own country extremists seem to dominate the news hatred is rampant guns are readily available suspicions and fears are fueled by the media the ever present broadcasts by the rtlm radio that benaron includes in her novel are a reminder of our own 24 hour cable news networks i often think it's not a matter of 'if' but 'when' such horrific 'cleansing' breaks out in the us think ferguson mo i do have to add that as far as a story line i found highly unbelievable that bea survived and that jean patrick and she reunited seemed contrived with all the horror and indiscriminate killing that occurred","349":"this is a well written and harrowing account of the rwandan genocide the characters were all believable and engaging it conveyed the beauty and corruption of the country the terror of the genocide was described in an affecting way without being sensationalist or titillating i was exhausted at the end but would still recommend","350":"the book breaks my heart a swell of emotions was a frequent experience while reading this novel the murderous reign of the hutus against the tutsis in rwanda in the 1980s is the tough topic but told with humanity through the main character jean patrick a young tutsi man with his eye on running in the olympics for the country for those who like to learn through historical fiction also now i need to go back and watch hotel rwanda i think it will mean more after reading this book not a light read but a good novel that honors those that lost their lives and remembers those that lost their humanity in several months of total madness","351":"i was initially interested in this book because of its protagonist a runner but his running career is a minor part of the powerful novel about the rwanda genocide benaron does such a good job of exploring the horror and also the complexity of that time when neighbor turned against neighbor because of ethnicity hard to understand how such evil could exist in people but benaron also shows that evil might exist in even those who seem good and right that is in all of us an important novel hard to read but engrossing too","352":"it was very interesting to take a look into a time not that long ago yet so different from what i experienced it was heartbreaking at times but enjoyable","353":"great historical fiction about the rwanda genocide including likeable hutu and tutsi characters be prepared though given the topic the book can be quite sad for a few chapers but there are also inspirational moments very glad i read this","354":"this book succeeds on many levels i've been reading with rapt interest about the rwandan genocide for a few years now and this the first fictional work i've come across is probably the most informative work to date ms benaron clearly did her research her characters were lovable and her storytelling powerful she managed to capture the emotion as much as anyone possibly could no easy task obviously tears stung my eyes several times it was that powerful i particularly admired the author's audacity in inculpating the west in this horrendous atrocity the world ignored rwanda and for that we should all be sorry sure there were times when the writing bordered on cheesy but it wasn't bad enough to ruin the book for me i also guessed most of the plot points including the last couple of surprises but again not a big deal i'm just thrilled that a book with popular appeal may finally educate the world about what went wrong in rwanda so hopefully it never happens again","355":"the first half of the book plods along but when the characters finally meet disaster head on you won't be able to put this book down a remarkable look at the rwandan culture during the horrors of the 1993 4 genocide but naomi benaron also provides some hope at the end","356":"gives a good perspective of what the people have gone through in rwanda using a fictional character","357":"usually when i really like a book i can't put it down and finish it in 1 3 days that was not the case with this book it is due today at the library 3 week check out and i finished it last night the subject matter is about the rwandan massacre which was horrifying and beyond description my issue with the book was more in the character development and story line it just didn't work for me","358":"painful and beautiful","359":"story of jean patrick a young runner hoping to represent rawanda in the olympics in the 1990's as the rawanda genocide is unfolding","360":"i picked this book up because of what it's about an olympic bound runner in rwanda who lives through the 1994 genocide i don't know enough about rwanda or africa in general and i've sort of stupidly steered clear of a lot of the books written about the genocide in an attempt not to get incredibly angry and depressed but this book won the bellwether prize and it's about running and i really needed to pull my britches up and read something about this so it's a pretty long book and i guess my first feeling about it is that it could have used some editing in the first two thirds a lot of pages are given over to background and scene setting following the protagonist nkuba jean patrick through his childhood and early adulthood his early years starting to run and his more serious training as he gets older it's important stuff but it felt meander y to me and i had trouble keeping incidents and locations straight especially when they were referred to again later in the book i also felt like jean patrick never really came alive as a character he felt bland to me characterized mainly by a youthful conviction that he can win the olympics and by continual denial of the hutu hate speech and violence that's starting to escalate all around him another weak point i thought was his infatuation with beatrice a woman he meets accidentally while out running he falls in love with her instantly which is not a trope i enjoy as a reader because it usually results in telling us what's happening rather than showing us through the story there's also a fairly tedious period in which he mistakes her father for a husband which seems pointless particularly since it's obvious to the reader what the real relationship is beatrice too is a pretty flat character and this may be why their early relationship feels formulaic and rote where things really pick up is in the last third or so of the book when events escalate and there's genuine immediate danger when jean patrick has to flee for his life make impossible decisions about saving or abandoning others and encounter his former friends and colleagues in wretched new ways when he's in extremis then he feels much more compelling to me i think this means that there isn't enough pressure applied in the rest of the book and that the author is letting the characters off too easily i don't mean that the whole book should have been occupied with the explosion of the genocide but that i wanted the writing leading up to it to feel more fraught and more tightly connected to what was going to happen so on the sentence and scene levels the book didn't really grab me but after finishing it i've found myself thinking about it many times benaron has done a good job of opening up that unthinkable world in which people's entire families were slaughtered by their own neighbors she does a good job i think of showing the helplessness and indifference of westerners either well intentioned or not she shows something of what it might have been like to be rwandan during that time trapped in a horror film while the rest of the world carries on the details she draws the hutus killed trying to save their tutsi friends the endless awful vitriol on the propaganda radios the arrogant political posturing of the president helped me think more and differently about how these things gain momentum and feed on themselves and how they play out for ordinary people one scene in particular almost a throw away really resonated for me while the country is breaking apart jean patrick finds his way back to the college where he's studying and training as a runner he sees a tutsi woman he knows another college runner sprinting across the quad pursued by a crowd she escapes but when he finds and talks to her they both know that she probably won't live much longer on the same visit he runs into another woman who was an acquaintance and political dissident activist before things broke down now she's a hutu nationalist he greets her and she calmly tells him that he deserves to die around them the college is being looted and tutsi students are huddled in groups behind locked doors it's a completely horrifying situation and hard to stop seeing i might wish that jean patrick were a slightly more realized character but i'm grateful for scenes like this that seem to open the door at least a little to the things that we'd like to ignore","361":"the book was great although tragic it was me who had the problem i just had a really hard time getting thru it","362":"very powerful story couldn't put it down til i just finished it","363":"when i was in high school we had a required news program called channel one i remember watching it and seeing the updates on the rwandan genocide daily for weeks and then going home and not being able to find anything on the news about it had it not been for the movie hotel rwanda coming out a few years ago i probably would have thought i was just misremembering the horror of that time so when i saw that running the rift was about the genocide i knew it was a must read for me one of the things i liked best about this book is that it explains the history leading up to the genocide it manages to show the beauty of rwanda and it's people while intertwining the constant fear that the tutsi lived in that one day things were just going to get worse when that day does occur the author writes so well that you feel as if you are the one crawling through swamps trying to reach a safe place that you are the one watching as your friends and neighbors either die around you or are the ones who have suddenly turned and started killing the people they were friendly with the day before it is strange to describe a book about genocide as being beautiful but that is the only word i can think of to accurately describe this book it's heartbreaking nightmare inducing but ultimately beautiful and i truly believe it should be on everyone's must read shelf","364":"it seems ironic that a novel largely about running has a problem with pacing but that is what i found with running the rift it is a great story and the descriptions of rwandan culture and beauty transport the reader there seemingly without effort benaron also captures the unnecessary tragedy of the rwandan genocide and the sadness of neighbors and friends turning on each other when the world around them goes crazy but there are a few points where the story drags making the reader impatient but this is a novel very much worth reading especially if you are interested in african history","365":"great read lots of history that was gripping i have read a lot of non fiction and fiction about africa but this one was unexpectedly refreshing and took a whole new approach i like that the story of jean patricks running paralleled what was going on in rwanda made me cry glad i read it inspirational","366":"from books and breakfast at the library terrifying story of the deterioration in rwanda to total anarchy through the eyes of a young boy who's qualified to run in the olympics but the writing isn't terrific and much of the story isn't as smooth or gripping as it could be","367":"so moving i cried reading this story perhaps the first book i've read that is classified as 'fiction in support of social change' definitely has me interested in learning more about the rwandan genocide","368":"a great book about the life and aspirations of a runner","369":"the author did a spectacular job putting you in the shoes of a kenyan runner the story had depth and truth to it i'd recommend this book it is a bit long and you can't read it too quickly but it's worth it","370":"i would really give this book 4 1 2 stars i loved this book u0026amp cannot wait to share it with the store's book group all the characters are so lovingly conceived u0026amp cared for this book is heartbreaking u0026amp hopeful all at the same time and who knew that i could care so deeply about running if you like loved the invisible bridge or cutting for stone you will care deeply about this book too","371":"the historical aspect was compelling and important but the writing left the characters rather detached somehow although it kept me reading i didn't feel invested better after having read it than whilst reading","372":"i knew nothing about this book when it was recommended by a friend guess i thought it was a rags to riches thing with the poor african boy becoming a world famous runner and ultimately winning the olympics nothing of the sort though jean patrick's dream was to run and win the olympics rwandan history stood in his way the old enmity between the hutu and tutsi factions aided and abetted by the criminal government of the country sends the country into a violent bloodletting intermingled with the horror jean patrick experiences is a tender love story that ultimately waits for years to come to a conclusion good book","373":"barbara kingsolver recommended this book published in 2012 so i had to read it it tells the story of a tutsi boy in rwanda who dreams of olympic gold then tensions mount between the hutu and tutsi and civil war occurs it's a tale of what happens when people go crazy with hate and power it's a wonderful portrayl of family life there it's a love story that you hope isn't killed by war i thoroughly enjoyed reading this book","374":"it has been a long time since a book has caused me to shed tears but this one did i feel drained after reading this story of jean patrick and his family in rwanda during the time leading up to during and following the genocide i ask myself how could the united states and other countries have stood by without acting even though this is fiction benaron included facts about rwandan culture geography and government the love story of jean patrick and bea carried me along and helped me feel their happiness and pain i'll never forget this story","375":"the authors dwells on the details of the civil war genocide in rwanda a little too much and skimps on the character development internal struggle of the young runner","376":"naomi benaron author of running the rift takes the material of a beautiful country and a beautiful people to gradually lead the reader on a journey that encompasses the greatness that occurs in the simplest of acts alongside a descent into nearly unimaginable horror following the story of jean patrick nbuka the plot shifts step by step into rwanda and then in rim horrifying detail into the genocide that defines the country still recently listed as one of the top five novels that all runners should read by the guardian it works just as a novel about running jean patrick a young tutsi grows into rwanda's best hope for an olympic medal in the 800 meters for jean patrick this is not a revelation but the culmination of a dream that started in grade school when he raced his brother to the gates of gihundwe the hard work more than a decade of it comes later in the story woven in seamlessly with the greater story of the country the story of rwanda in the lead up to the dissolution of civilization and into the aftermath dominates the story benaron deftly builds the tension first with a rock throwing incident at gihundwe jean patrick's primary school then in the streets the sense of menace tracks the youth all the way to university his saving grace what keeps him safe is his ability to run like the wind to earn the nickname mr olympics in the midst of that benaron presents all the beauty of rwanda in the sights sounds in the simple descriptions of the food her writing is elegant and clean adding enough to bring you into rwanda to sit you at the table so you can listen to the babble of voices and taste the banana beer benaron applies that same skill to the blackness without resorting to the melodramatic letting the story follow the history with a sense of inevitableness that leaves the reader in fear for jean patrick and his love bea as the tipping point to chaos approaches the author also leaves the reader angry not just at the human cruelty but at the cowardliness of the rest of the world who looked to rwanda and looked away again while the tutsi were annihilated en masse and twenty percent of the hutu those sympathetic to national reconciliation were murdered as i mentioned above running the rift is just barely a novel of running the running is well done but it is the rest of the story beyond the cleanliness of pain that is the 800 meters that makes this into the powerful story that needs to be read","377":"here's one that was not on my list of about 70 books i want to read by the end of the year but john was reading it and kept reading parts to me so i had to pick it up there is a lot of action throughout the book lots of moving from place to place so description is not as rich as i would like it to be and was sometimes repetitive but i was totally invested in the people in the book and felt a searing empathetic response to the horrors that they suffered like egger's what is the what a story that follows one of the sudanese lost boys this book brings to life a world that is nearly impossible for westerners to imagine until it is fully realized as it is here","378":"this is the story of a tutsi runner who wants to enter the olympics for rwanda the book is woven with a love story and the history of the rwanda genocide i was hoping for a better understanding of the rwanda genocide but the story just drags i found it hard to muddle through the language and large amount of characters as well i think i would have appreciated this book more if i had reviewed the history of rwanda before reading","379":"i'm not sure why this book isn't getting more attention i thought it was great the last third stalled for me a little but overall i really enjoyed learning more about rwanda and of course enjoyed the parts about running","380":"i requested this book after reading about it but when it arrived and i realized the author was a white american woman i nearly didn't start it i know it's fiction but i wasn't in the mood for an inauthentic and uninformed telling of a real tragedy i'm glad i decided to give it a chance the author seems to have done an enormous amounts of research because the book was rich with cultural details i wanted to put it down 3 4 of the way through to suspend the characters in life but instead i cried my way through to the end of the book my husband observes my silent tears and asks why i keep reading such sad stories i don't have an answer but this was beautiful too despite the horror maybe that's why","381":"this is one chosen by one of the book clubs i belong to and isn't a book i would likely have picked up on my own it took me a while to settle in and 'buy in' to the story i don't really care for the writing a pragmatic straightforward style that feels unimaginative to me my impression changes as i move forward in the book and i can't say with any certainty if it is my engagement with the story that softens my harsh view 0r if the writing actually improves as i said the writing feels simple and very pragmatic there is little metaphor or anything lyrical about it except for one aspect which emerges that i really do enjoy that is how benaron uses some of the physics or geology terms like force stress resistance motion that jean patrick is learning in his university studies to describe both his running and the political situation in rwanda now that i am well into the book and am more engaged i am finding it more enjoyable and with the genocide in rwanda so much a part of 21st century history it is interesting to read more about the hutu and tutsi and now now that i am finished i'd say the story won me over and i can see why it became a popular novel that said i think if the writing had been mmmmm more mature more sophisticated i think it would have been popular on the level of something like the kite runner","382":"this book was ok i read it after reading left to tell which is a biograghy based on the rwandan genocide and after reading that this book paled in comparison this book is fiction so it is not the same genre but i also found the writing choppy and it just didn't seem to flow this book was a book i couldn't wait to finish so i would be done with it","383":"this book is a must read i stumbled onto it due to the running theme but found myself enjoying a very rich and intense story of a historical event that everyone should be intimately aware of the rwandan genocide it tore my heart out","384":"very good novel full of surprises things that i thought would happen became non issues the author built a believable story out of an unbelievable time","385":"i wasn't sure how easily i'd get into this book with its setting of rwanda during the genocide but it grabbed me from the very beginning i had a hard time putting it down such a wonderful story of human perseverance in the face of evil beautifully written this one will stay with me for a while","386":"the emotions are written extremely it was sad in a new way for me to read about a genocide that happened during my own lifetime","387":"beautifully written thoughtful and insightful i really enjoyed reading it but for some reason i always dreaded picking it up nonetheless a real eye opener","388":"i read this close on the heels of tracy kidder's strength in what remains and i recommend the pairing most highly kidder's is a nonfiction tale of deo a burundian medical student and benaron's a novel about jean patrick a university student and world class runner just over the border in rwanda the paths of these two tutsi boys one real one imagined seem to run parallel crossing the burundi rwanda border and back again the ghost boy of fiction nearly right alongside the real boy in deo as both crouch in marshes and jungles watching the machete men do their work for both and for those around them the genocide sneaks up almost imperceptible at first and then literally unbelievable from the ground from the view of daily life in either country how could anyone believe that what seemed like a band of unemployed young thugs with nothing better to do would grow into this unimaginable horror i remember reading madeleine albright's memoir and in it she expresses the universal regret of the west in the mid 90s that we didn't do enough soon enough in rwanda but albright writes that rwanda was just one on the long list of daily atrocities on her atrocities memos no one was aware of the true magnitude until it was too late no one would believe it a man you fished alongside pulling nets into your boat beside you would a month later be found hacking your little brother to pieces how could anyone believe that the gruesome intimacy required to kill someone a child a baby with a machete defies belief and when you knew that family sold them fruit at the market sent your kids to school with their kids how do you bypass all that common humanity and exterminate them like cockroaches i suppose that question is the next i'd like answered in my reading in both these books we follow tutsi who are being hunted like dogs who will explain for me the hutu power hunters who did the massacre we can all imagine ourselves as the hunted victims of circumstance running with our children and hiding in piles of bodies as sickening as it is and as sad and as gut wrenching as these stories are we can see ourselves running and trying to survive like these tutsi boys but who among us can imagine that we might have the capacity to cut up the neighbor's four year old and his mother a woman in kidder's book on the run like deo said i am a woman and a mother that is my tribe motherhood sometimes seems almost strong enough to insulate mothers from this kind of hatred at least it often seems to keep women from being able to harm someone whom she knows is another woman's child but that protective shield of motherhood is not universal given the right mixture of circumstances even a mother could do these things we are human before we are mothers and humans demonstrate this terrible capacity again and again who would believe himself capable of torture of daily mass murder for weeks and months on end and yet some of us are and not always the ones you might expect","389":"it was hard to believe this book wasn't a true story the author does a great job bringing her characters to life and giving the reader a feel for what life was like in rwanda before and during the genocide","390":"loved it great strory","391":"read this book because it was the 2013 selection for naperville reads the story is very interesting the characters are people you care about and the entire book teaches the reader about the horrible genocide in africa in the 1990s i would recommend reading this to anyone who is looking to learn more as they read fiction","392":"this book started off a little slowly but after 50 pages i really couldn't put it down it does all the things that a good book should do it transports you to a different place makes you care about the characters reveals something new to you about the world and just doesn't let you go important important subject that the author did an excellent job portraying","393":"started out great and i was hooked sad to say i'm a little disappointed in the ending i was very interested in the running aspect and was hoping for more of that but the ending didn't talk about running at all however i guess the point of the story was to tell about genocide not running overall a great read and highly recommended","394":"the author looks at the rwandan genocide of 1994 that left at least 800 000 people dead through the eyes of a young track star jean patrick nkuba it's also a coming age of age story although one in which the youth is literally faced with life and death issues not just teenage angst about popularity or homework jean patrick is a tutsi but until adolescence he had been unaware of the history of tension and violence between tutsis and hutus which eventually spiraled into the 1994 massacres a talented runner jean patrick has attracted the attention of a coach who trains and grooms him for an eventual shot at the olympics but even his status as a well known athlete can't protect him from insults threats and as the situation in the country escalates year by year from the prospect that he too could be among the victims of the ethnic killings against the backdrop of a country being torn apart jean patrick also goes through the normal rites of passage of a coming of age story education new friends falling in love however all of these everyday moments are tainted by the violence friends become enemies some teachers turn a blind eye to attacks on tutsi students while others try to protect them jean patrick's romance has a romeo and juliet aspect to it because his girlfriend is not only hutu but from a family of political activists the author manages to weave it all together but somehow it didn't quite work for me i can't put my finger on what i disliked whether it was a character some aspect of the plot perhaps the writing style but i just couldn't give it more than three stars it wasn't a bad book and i certainly don't regret reading it but i felt more like i was sitting through an earnest documentary than reading a gripping novel","395":"this book dramatically portrays the tragedy and suffering during the rwandan genocide it was well written and a good story but i preferred the non fiction book by tracy kidder strength in what remains for its hard truths and factual but dramatic portrayal of an individual life torn apart and then rebuilt","396":"probably a 3 5 it was slow at times and challenging at points but overall a moving story with a hint of happy ending","397":"beautiful and haunting all at once this is a very difficult book to read the genocide in rwanda is just beginning to come to light in the western part of the world and stories such as 'running the rift' are important tools in teaching us what happened during this terrible terrible time naomi benaron is a very talented writer who has brought to life characters that will stick with you for a very long time their stories will make you weep at the injustices that occurred for me as a runner i also enjoyed the parts of the book about running but they were truly a minor part of the much bigger story this is a must read and i highly recommend it","398":"intense and wonderful i could taste and smell rwanda along with the characters the buildup to the killings was almost too much to bear but a fitting if maybe a touch too contrived ending made me put the book down with a sigh of satisfaction","399":"first the book's synopsis is partially misleading second it is a difficult book for me to read knowing well enough what fate is in store for the characters and yet was forced to have emotional ties with them so i struggle to finish the book as opposed to the mumbai behind the beautiful forever where the book reads like a fiction though it is a non fiction this has an opposite effect on me being a book with such a dark theme i am glad that the author did not spend too large of a part on the violence and the gruesome ness of the situation instead i found that the slow pacing in the 2 3rd of the book's beginning when the event itself occurred i found it more emotionally effective","400":"a beautiful book about unbelievable horror hard to believe things like these happened the author tells the story such that i could imagine living in that world at least up to the point when things happened that no one could imagine actually coming to pass","401":"i listened to this as an audiobook i read this on the heels of reading left to tell discovering god amidst the rwandan holocaust by immaculee ilibagiza totally different books because one is fiction and one is nonfiction but if you're looking for a book on the rwandan holocaust i would go with left to tell running the rift is good but i feel like it glosses over a lot","402":"i admit i picked this book up from a library display because of the fine cover art and the word running in the title it seems audacious to write a novel based in a period of genocidal atrocities but this one succeeds the main characters are so charming you have to keep reading despite knowing that horrific events will ensue the author is a triathlete so she knows whereof she speaks when describing jean patrick's training and she does a good job of evoking the cuisine and flora of rwanda","403":"liked the story and historical perspective not the writing style and the ending","404":"at first i wondered if i'd wandered into the young adult section but i thought the writing slow and simple at the beginning reached a crescendo as the intensity of the political violence started to burn it was very effective i had only one criticism of this beautiful and moving story the emotional turmoil was powerfully expressed but some things were oversimplified how do the characters manage financially at the end maybe this pales next to the other challenges they face but surely it's part of the story","405":"i seem to be reading and liking but that seems wrong historical fiction books about horrific genocides lately like in the shadow of the banyan cambodia 1975 79 i really appreciated the rwandan context 1994 98 in this book as one of the characters in this story it reads a little like young adult fiction with a history lesson thrown in there but i like that too","406":"running the rift is the story of jean patrick a young rwandan who dreams of becoming his nation's first olympic runner but whose ambition and talent develops alongside the growing unease between hutu and tutsi people of rwanda in the decades before the rwandan genocide of 1994 we follow the story of jean patrick's life from a young boy running barefoot races against his elder brother around herds of their father's inyambo to a bright and determined college student with a gruff hardnosed coach to his falling in love with the beautiful activist daughter of a journalist behind a guileless story of challenges of life and love political agitations are stirring yet blinded by his single minded ambition to be a rwandan track star jean patrick unwittingly finds himself an inexperienced pawn in a game far more significant than the olympics and far more dangerous naomi benaron tells the story simply where others on this subject might be horrific and emotionally demanding told through jean patrick's naive perspective the mounting tensions seem trivial secondary to 'real life' that continues unheeding in the fields and universities of rwanda and inconceivable the atrocities that ultimately come to bear at times it's hard not to be frustrated by jean patrick's immaturity and inattention but conversely one must be mindful that no one in the world 'expects' genocide and this ending is known to the reader so we dig our heels in in vehement frustration at the decisions that lead him irretrievably towards the ending history has written ultimately it is a lightly written and enjoyable read about a terrible and heart breaking era in rwanda's history offering an insight into one life at that time the life of an extraordinary child living in extraordinary times","407":"this has been an awesome book about a young runner caught up in the conflict of his country while holding onto his dream of running in the olympics he knew he would always be a runner even as he ran for his life a totally believable character one can't help but love","408":"disturbing but compelling very well written","409":"good read and character development about a boy that has a knack for running and has dreams of going to the olympics late 80's through the 90's his and his families struggle with the major political unrest and genocide of rwanda during that time","410":"jean patrick is a tutsi boy who dreams of competing as a runner in the olympics taking him from his childhood home torn apart by personal tragedy to school and accompanying prejudices to the horrific slaughter during the rwanda's genocide is he presented as highly naive and myopic yes but the book does a good job of contrasting the joys and beauty of the country with its intermittent savagery","411":"fascinating more read for the history rather than the writing but nevertheless a compelling read about rwanada and the slip into a genocide","412":"excellent view of rwanda leading up to and during the genocide from the point of view of a boy who becomes a man during these events this is such a well written novel that it seems to be biographical even though it can't be i'd also recommend romeo dallaire's shake hands with the devil for a view of what the un's peacekeeping mission was up against as the united nations assistance mission for rwanda unamir is mentioned several times in this novel","413":"one of the most atrocious acts in all of contemporary history was the systematic genocide of one of two ethnic groups in rwanda - the tutsi by the hutu disturbingly the western world stood by and did nothing as the borders were closed and innocent people - even young babies were savagely killed by hate mongrels for...what naomi benaron's bellweather prize novel brings us up close and personal to this episode in history through jean patrick nkuba a tutsi teenager who is gifted through his running ability the president of rwanda quickly seizes upon jean patrick as a way to show the west that rwanda is a tolerant country jean patrick is given the life saving hutu id card \"today you are tutsi when you go to butare to train with your coach this weekend you will be hutu what a marvelous power you have now \" in the first half of the book benaron establishes jean patrick's life he loses his father at a tender age is embraced - with his siblings - into the home of his uncle and trains passionately and intensely for a shot at the olympics benaron has obviously done her homework and the sounds sights and smells of rwanda pervade these early chapters by skillfully rendering the bonds of family and the tenderness of community we get to know jean patrick and \"buy into\" his desire to achieve his goal of winning the gold and providing esteem again for the tutsi people and we root for him as he falls in love with a journalism student bea who captivates him at first sight but then the hutus and tutsi situation erupts into sheer hell in almost unbearable to read prose we - the readers - see what happens when \"no safe or sane place exists within the country \" borders are sealed off tutsis are hunted down in churches and schools one time neighbors dismiss tutsi friends as \"cockroaches\" and always always the voice of radio rwanda is in the background \"all tutsi will perish they will disappear from the earth we will kill them like rats \" those who live in the west - the same people who react passionately and rightfully when gorillas are exterminated do next to nothing this book is very difficult for me to rate there are the traditional problems of the debut writer in the first half authorial intrusion as the author tries to educate the reader about rwanda placing words inappropriately in the mouths of certain characters there are some traces of young adult writing and times when the metaphors become too standard if you asked me half way through i might have rated the book in the 3 5 to 4 star level the last half was so searing though that the images will be indelibly imprinted in my mind and the writing soars to 6 stars i felt i was \"twinned\" with jean patrick as he races with terror for his very life one of the most amazing parts of this book is that it offers love friendship and individual hope at the same time it explores inhumanity on an unimaginable scale benaron writes \"in the darkness men and women lay together and created new life this was the dance of rwanda jean patrick could not let himself believe that this dance as familiar as the beat of his heart could suddenly end \" one wishes - futilely - that the killing will never begin again...anywhere","414":"i was really touched by the last quarter of this book and that part probably earns six stars the first half drags and i almost stopped reading i don't like that the author used non english words without defining them i had trouble keeping track of whether many characters were hutu or tutsi and i can imagine that might be intentional but eventually it just got irritating the author does a great job of taking the reader on an emotional roller coaster with the characters it's not that you don't know where the story is going that keeps you engrossed it's the timing and rhythm of the story","415":"one of my favorite reads in 2013","416":"this book is one of the hardest i've ever had to read because of its subject matter it does not shy away from the genocide and violence that occurs and still occurs in rwanda and nearby countries i highly recommend it though it's very lyrical and it's so well written and even though i had tears in my eyes several times it was excellent","417":"this was the first book i read about rwanda i have been wanting to read one for a while and actually read the physical book since i got it for my birthday that was a treat i liked the story of the characters and the way she told it in context of the genocide of 1994","418":"this story is set against the horrific backdrop of the rwandan genocide in 1994 when gangs of hutus sponsored by the government murdered approximately 800 000 tutsis along with pro peace hutus labeled as traitors rwanda had previously been a belgian colony while there were some differences between the hutu and tutsi tribes prior to that the belgians exacerbated them by insisting on separate id cards and establishing a power divide between the tutsi who got most of the land and the power and the hutus many of whom were forced laborers the inequality and injustice helped create hatred between the tribes '...before the belgians ' one of the characters in the book explains 'distinctions were as fluid as the rivers determined by marriage convenience and status names of rivers changed but the water remained the same '\" all of that ended with colonization there had also been mass violence against the hutu by the tutsi in neighboring burundi the author in her meticulously accurate portrayal of the run up to and perpetration of the genocide in rwanda records how the country's media was critical in inciting ethnic hatred and the desire for revenge the government itself organized neighborhood militias to carry out the killings even importing a half a million machetes for the use of the hutu youth and alcohol also contributed rape was also used as a weapon in the attempt not only to punish and humiliate the tutsis but to impregnate the women with hutu children to some extent the effort backfired since some 70% of the assault victims were infected with hiv estimates on the number of women raped ranged from 250 000 to half a million hutu women who were considered \"moderates\" were also subject to rape the west did very little to respond to pleas for help except to remove their own white citizens and take them to safety one character making calls to influential people he knew found that in europe his contacts apologized and said there was nothing they could do they would keep trying but no one was listening rwanda had no oil or strategic interest no diamonds or gold \" in the u s the secretary of state under president clinton refused even to acknowledge that the systematic murder of the tutsis constituted \"genocide \" in march 1998 on a visit to rwanda u s president bill clinton said we come here today partly in recognition of the fact that we in the united states and the world community did not do as much as we could have and should have done to try to limit what occurred in rwanda \" he later stated that the biggest regret of his presidency was not acting decisively to stop the rwandan genocide in running the rift all these facts are intimately interwoven with the story of a boy jean patrick nkuba living in cyangugu rwanda who dreams of running in the olympics one day the story takes us from 1984 when he was 9 to 1998 when rwanda is at relative peace jean patrick was a tutsi but had never really understood the significance of the difference until the day a brick came crashing through their window with the word \"tutsi\" on it since the start of the war ethnicity grew around him like an extra layer of skin no matter how he tried he could not shed it \"as time went on during the buildup of ethnic hostilities jean patrick's dreams of olympic glory were increasingly threatened by his tutsi status hutus harassed him and even injured him jean patrick never felt any hatred himself his father had taught him all people were the same that it was impossible to quantify or label distinctions every morning fishermen went out to the lake and women and children went to the fields hutu or tutsi they fetched water gathered firewood balanced loads on their heads in the evening they padded along paths up the ridge or down into the valley with bare and dusty feet they cooked ate drank beer and scolded children in the darkness men and women lay together and created new life this was the dance of rwanda \"and when jean patrick meets a hutu girl bea augustin he falls deeply in love you can feel his frustration and sadness as he contemplates a future with her their lives were only starting how could they be wrenched apart how could any of them be picked up suddenly cast down somewhere else over mere nothings that had never before concerned them \"but then the killing begins and escape seems impossible jean patrick and bea both have to make choices whether to make an improbable attempt at getting away or to stay and share their fate with their families with whom they were each so close there was no way that anyone from rwanda would survive unscathed if they survived at all evaluation this is an excellent book and a very good way to learn about the rwandan genocide from the point of view of innocent citizens who got caught up in the maelstrom","419":"this is an emotional story of the rwanda genocide that occurred in the early 1990s jean patrick is a talented runner who dreams of representing his country in the olympics but he is tutsi and everyone and everything about the tutsi is hated by the hutu the eventual bloodbath is inevitable and horrific naomi benaron's writing is never the less beautiful this book is recommended to those readers who are interesting in recent world history","420":"an enlightening book about the rwandan genocide i would have rated this book higher if i didn't have an issue with all the foreign words used almost every page contained words that i didn't understand in the language s spoken in rwanda this was very distracting and diminished the impact of the story i wish the author had included a glossary","421":"the story was good but i didn't love the author's writing style it was lacking in some way i felt like there was a lot of repetition we were being told jean patrick's same feelings and thoughts repeatedly also my expectation of the book was that it was more of a sports story than a war genocide love story that is not the author's fault but i was still disappointed by the story of jean patrick's running career","422":"thank you emily for sending me this book and thank you to barbara kingsolver for awarding it the bellwether prize as we follow the story of a boy who dreams of becoming an olympic runner we learn of the depth of rwandan culture and the horrendous cost of the genocide the beauty of the landscape stands in stark contrast to the ugliness of senseless killing it is a beautiful and emotional read","423":"what's interesting in this novel which is about a young runner in rwanda with dreams of competing in the olympics is that it begins years before the genocide when the character is just a young boy he can't possibly imagine what is to come as he watches rwanda changing gripping and heart breaking but also hopeful","424":"did i need one more book about african genocide at first i did not think so but it was for a book group discussion and this one is worth reading it's fiction and the author uses the story to educate about the hutu tutsi conflict resulting in the tutsi genocide of the 1990's running the rift is a satisfying read that i could not put down","425":"surprisingly heartbreaking redemptive passionate and romantic running the rift tells the story of the inhumane rwandan genocide of 1994 through the eyes of a young athlete jean patrick nkuba this book despite the dark theme of racism and hatred managed to embody the strength of the human spirit and love for family friends neighbors and romantic interests this book is really worth reading","426":"i remember hearing on the news and reading in the papers about the genocide in rawanda the racial strife between the hutus and the tutsis but i really didn't understand what was going on and i forgot a very important thing until this courageous book with the wonderful characters of jean patrick and his family i didn't think about the people living there normal families with dreams and hopes living during this terrible time just trying to exist find love and take care of their own thanks to benaron i understand so much more but the story within the telling was very well written and heartfelt though horrible at times books like this make one think and that is a very good thing as i read this i felt angry sad appalled and at times even joyful and a writer that makes one feel all that is truly unique","427":"i am glad that i read this book when i started reading i did not know that the author was not a native rwandan i read it on my kindle and actually to me this did not matter as i was convinced by the authorial voice i found the first chapter or a so a little stilted and then the author found her rhythm and i was drawn into the story by the characters and the descriptions of the countryside i learned a lot about how things in rwanda escalated to such a horrific extent but i also learnt about rwandan food and customs and about the world of competitive running it made me think a lot about human relationships and morality if i have one criticism of the book it is that some people might find the ending too happy however after all the loss and destruction i felt like i needed that shred of hope resurrection otherwise i would have emerged from the reading experience feeling utterly desolate this is a book that should be read not just to learn about what happened but also it has valuable lessons to teach about how easily and insidiously hate can be spread i found it quite disturbing and it made me think about some recent events in our own country in a different way i know that there is an argument that the story should be told by a rwandan and rwandans have written non fiction accounts but would a rwandan want to write a novel about it would it even get published in rwanda and how many rwandan novels are translated into english","428":"beautifully written book introduced me to and fell in love with the countryside people and customs of rwanda told from the perspective of a tutsi training to run in the olympics a mass genocide of his people by fellow countrymen hutu interrupted his dream the horror of what human beings will do to one another when fueled by drummed up fears timely lesson","429":"if you can handle another story about rwanda this one is engaging and from a different perspective","430":"painful story beautifully told this is a juvenile fiction and it is handled appropriately for an older teen but there is nothing easy about the tale rwanda is a beautiful land torn asunder by genocide and misery but as in all things there are pockets of hope that continue to spring up i have pondered the many messages of this book for days glad i read it and grateful that my path hasn't been like this yet my heart is full of sorrow and helplessness for those whose life is like this every day my prayers go out","431":"couldn't finish it really seemed to drag on for me","432":"this was an achingly tragic and beautiful take of resilience in the wake of unspeakable horror it was a throughly well written book","433":"while fictional the author included a lot of the history of rwanda from belgian colonization which led to the original registering of hutus and tutsis as individual ethnicities to the genocide of the 90s and the plot is engaging characters endearing","434":"the rwandan genocide is horrific and a story that needs to be told again and again unfortunately this book means well but is very badly written it might be less clumsy if the author hadn't tried to put herself in the shoes and mind of a tutsi survivor it's an experiment that doesn't pay off i applaud the writer's intentions but better books abound","435":"a moving book with wonderful descriptions of time and place the culture land and especially the characters though it is set during the rwanda genocide the book is first and foremost a story of jean patrick and the many people who were about of his life each one special it their own way","436":"even the writer seems disinterested in the plot the pacing is frustratingly mind blowingly slow the characters are two dimensional and i fail to see any motivation for any of them doing anything","437":"chosen for barbara kingsolver's bellwether prize for socially relevant fiction naomi benaron's running the rift makes the political personal as the best of well written fiction can do the story is told from the perspective of rwandan teenager jean patrick a young man who wants nothing more than to represent his country as a runner in the olympics but what country jean patrick is tutsi and that ethnic label not only makes his dream particularly difficult to achieve but actually puts his life in danger even with losses too great to imagine jean patrick never loses his determination to live to love and to capture some hope for the future - for his beautiful broken country and for himself","438":"if you have read very little about the civil war and massacres in rwanda in the 1990s this novel is a simple introduction to that horrible time it follows the childhood and early adulthood of a boy who is talented at running and who aspires to make the olympics in the 800 meter race he comes of age both literally and in his training as the hutu take control and then kill tutsi throughout rwanda and his family and friends are predominantly tutsi as other reviewers of this book have written the characters are very one dimensional and i have to believe everyone stayed true to their type i enjoyed this book but would recommend it only as a light introduction to a very heavy and brutal time in history","439":"this is expert writing there is an underlining tension throughout which keeps you on tenterhooks because the danger is ever present the story is of jean patrick a rwandan runner at the beginning it is 1984 and he is a young boy his teacher father wishes him and his brothers and sisters goodbye before going on a journey where he inevitably dies in a car crash soon after the tensions between the rwandan ethnic groups hutu and oppressed tutsi of which jean patrick belongs are introduced as he grows up with stones and insults being thrown his way other times see his big brother roger and him having running races then a marathon runner who represented rwanda at the olympics visits his school and jean patrick shows promise so that the marathon runner tells him that one day you will need to run as much as you need to breathe these words prove to be prophetic as the deteriorating political picture takes shape around jean patrick who prefers to be oblivious to it as he concentrates on his running and schooling and he does very well making university in 1993 where he meets bea meaning blessed one who he falls in love with in the running he gets olympic qualifying times in the 800m leading to the nickname mr olympics through his running he even gets to meet the rwandan president habyarimana but tensions are brewing all around the media are spewing hate speech assassinations are happening to political leaders preparations are being made in every commune on every level teachers sector leaders burgomasters lists of tutsis and opposition hutu have been collected it's a plan for total annihilation then the president is killed and the annihilation plans are quickly put in place the un troops flee as the international community turns its back leaving rwanda to deal with its problems on its own the carefully orchestrated killings of tutsi happen names of people to kill are read out over the airwaves all tutsi will perish they will disappear from the earth jean patrick hears about the deaths of his best friend and others over the radio and keeps listening out for news of his family the radio keeps the killing fever to boiling point then as the hutu power led troops close in jean patrick has no choice but to run to run through the woods and marshes full of dead bodies past the people being killed to run alongside the orphans and the mothers carrying their dead babies one day you will need to run as much as you need to breathe that day is now brilliant book that masterfully brings alive through fiction what happened in rwanda in 1994","440":"running the rift follows the progress of jean patrick nkuba from the day he knows that running will be his life to the moment he must run to save his life divided into 5 parts going over 14 years the novel tells the story of jean patrick because of his running ability he has a chance to become educated and hopefully run in the olympics and become his country's first olympic medal winner in track but jean patrick is a tutsi in a c country that despises his origin as tensions mount between the hutu and tutsi he holds fast to his dream that running and finding the girl he loves might deliver him a very disturbing story of the rawandan genocide told from a personal point of view","441":"excellent well done i really enjoyed this book i know most people didn't have happy endings in their rwanda stories but this was a beautiful story of hope and will","442":"just realized that i read this awhile ago and never put up a review i didn't fall in love with it the way i thought i would but it was still a well written book that people should read if only to be reminded of the atrocities of genocide that continue to take place throughout the world","443":"this is an emotion packed book involving the struggles of a young rwandan facing genocide his race threatens to hinder his dreams of becoming an olympic runner i found this book to be inspiring and extremely powerful","444":"this was an intense book and i appreciated the rwanda history from a time when i was old enough to know something bad was going on but not old enough to understand the horrible genocide that occured the book got off to a slow start but the last third was very fast paced and heart stopping i'm glad the author didn't take the easy way out with who survived and who didn't which kept the action very real and scary","445":"this was an interesting easy to read book about the genocide in rwanda the use of easy to like fictional characters somehow made the horror of the war more vivid the beginning of the book read like a young adult novel and i thought it was somewhat simplistic but the last half of the book really pulled me in","446":"hard to read because it is so moving and so powerful a wonderful way to tell the story of a people whose pleas fell on deaf western ears beautiful elegant prose","447":"after enjoying the first hundred pages or so i grew bored with the reading nothing more seemed to grip me and it felt somewhow disjointed i found the writing style the choice of words and the placing of metaphors etc a bit higgledy pickledy despite that i think the author did a fair job of portraying aspects of another culture without being patronising or with an i'm an american on a mission mentality","448":"horrible and amazing i just noticed i was supposed to disclose that i got this book free from goodreads sorry oops","449":"http www dallasnews com entertainme running the riftnaomi benaron algonquin books $24 95 a young rwandan's dream of running in the olympics collides with his country's inescapable turmoil in naomi benaron's gripping first novel running the rift which won the bellwether prize for fiction addressing \"social justice \"some people might want to turn away after reading this set up which makes it sound like a novel that's more good for you than it is enjoyable but that isn't the case benaron casts the coming of age story of jean patrick nkuba against the build up to the rwandan genocide but through her protagonist's resilient and determined spirit she infuses the story with buoyancy and hope rich characterization and insights about rwandan culture make this book a pleasure to read and jean patrick impossible not to root for running the rift begins in 1984 when jean patrick named for \"the god who brings the thunder...nkuba lord of heaven the swift one \" is a skinny 9 year old always racing his older brother roger they live on a primary school's campus where their father a science scholar is the prefet in charge of teachers a car crash ends his life and although he \"always said that hutu and tutsi were one people living together in one country \" increasing episodes of hutu intimidation send jean patrick and his family who are tutsi to live with his mother's brother in cyangugu at the southern end of lake kivu benaron shows how the seeds for the 1994 genocide are planted over the 10 year span of the book during the years jean patrick trains \"forcing the cadence until he tasted tin on his tongue \" he's also exposed to sickening propaganda and violent rebels in time we know this will end in mass murder as hutus strike down their tutsi neighbors with machetes and clubs in 1985 what these developing tensions mean for jean patrick is that as a tutsi he must earn the best score on the national exams if he wants to attend secondary school he does and at his secondary school he meets the complicated and mysterious coach rutembeza a hutu who becomes his advocate mentor and nemesis and trains him as a runner through college where it's clear that jean patrick's preparations for the olympics will be interrupted benaron lives in tucson but has spent years working with genocide survivors in rwanda and has immersed herself in the country's culture folklore language and history she folds in this vast knowledge with a light touch for example in a paragraph about young jean patrick watching an olympic runner for the first time she also introduces one of rwanda's ethnic groups \"jean patrick had expected a big man but the runner stood not much taller than roger jean patrick wondered if he was umutwa one of the pygmy people who sold milk and butter in clay pots to families that didn't keep cows the momentary disappointment vanished as he watched the runner move flowing rather than walking from one place to the next as if his muscles were made of water he wore sunglasses his shirt snapped in the breeze zebras and lions racing across the shiny fabric \"jean patrick develops into a world class runner such as rwanda has never seen his gift sometimes saves him from his country's chaos but other times makes him stand out as a target for ire by the end you'll be rushing through the pages to see if he and any of his loved ones survive the terrible events of 1994 and if jean patrick will run again running the rift is a profound display imagination and empathy benaron writes like jean patrick runs with the heart of a lion jenny shank's first novel the ringer was a finalist for the mountains u0026amp plains independent booksellers association's reading the west award","450":"this is the kind of book you read that makes you appreciate the time and place you live and the freedom too many people seems to complain about this is the story of jean patrick from rwanda he is a young man growing up who has a talent for running his decadency is tutsi this book follows his life from 1984 to approximately 1995 his father was the prefit headmaster of the school he was planning to attend when he dies suddenly the family then moves in with his uncle's family and he focuses on his studies and his running with his eye on the olympics jean patrick does very well in school and moves to the university where he makes friends and by chance meets a young woman named bea which steals his heart his coach takes him under his wing as does geology professor jonathon and his wife suzanne the tribes of rwanda then begin to fight killing the tutsi descendants jean patrick continues to run and he seems to get a pass of the trouble due to his running and media coverage of his olympic hope but rwanda falls into marshal law and no tutsi is safe the remainder of the book follows jean patrick as he tries to help his family bea's family bea and himself i work with a diverse group and this story is not uncommon for many people who fled to the us this book is very powerful and is a must read","451":"i'm half way through but the narrator's attitude he does voices well but otherwise sounds like a disinterested bookstore story time conscript is too annoying so i'm going to switch to the written word version","452":"the novel begins with jean patrick and his brother roger racing through the fields as adolescent boys when the novel ends they are grown men who survived a terrifying journey jean patrick and roger are tutsi the book takes us through the years preceeding during and post the genocide in rwanda what the country goes through is not pleasant and raises the same hard questions that the holocast raised there is much more to this book it also a story of relationships and family love and loss grief and happiness once i started this book it was almost impossible to put it down it is well written and tells a story that has been repeated over and over during history the buring question it cannot answer but one that should needs to be continually asked and considered is why","453":"i just finished this book which made me realize yet again what a suburban bubble i truly live in in 1994 i was at home in southern california with my 3 and 4 year old children oblivious to the horrors that were happening on the other side of the world i entered into this book with a feeling of shock and guilt for my naivete at world situations since then i have traveled to kenya and uganda but have seen these countries through the viewpoint of a muzungu white person thus i know that my vision of what i was seeing was through the eyes of an american who has been fortunate to have never lived in a shack with a floor of red dirt who has always had food to eat and who has been truly blessed with an education that said it made the countryside images all the more real to me as well as the generosity of the people beautiful on both counts to be sure this story tackled a difficult time in rwanda's history where the two opposing groups the hutu and the tutsi tribes are at war with one another to say that you don't know who to trust is an understatement unfortunately it becomes commonplace to have acts of violence aimed at one of the tribes and people are fearful benaron often writes that you shouldn't use both eyes to sleep the author tells the story through the eyes of jean patrick nkuba as he grows up he is fortunate to be a strong student as he gains access even while being tutsi into a secondary school and into a university along with his gifted mind he is an even more gifted athlete with a drive to run like i can't even imagine he is rwanda's best hope for the olympic games and much of the story is devoted to his training and races it should be his ticket through the madness that is to come i actually loved his character he is a likeable kid who has a strong sense of innocence throughout the story some of this i felt was due to his age at first and then later because he was so intent on his training he almost blocked out real life at one point i felt that it does catch up with him and his bubble bursts with the realization of what is truly happening in his life benaron writes the story as if she went through the genocide herself she didn't but it is obvious that she has done her research and has been guided by people who have it is told from the view of insiders and with great compassion a wonderful although at times emotionally difficult read highly recommended","454":"heartbreaking and inspiring hard to put down and sometimes had to put down because it's so intense","455":"this is a coming of age story that focuses on the idealism that comes from childhood naivete and it happens to take place in rwanda in the 1990s benaron does a wonderful job painting a picture of the beauty of the country and culture without undermining the tragedy and challenge of simply staying alive","456":"this book was very good i recommend it to all i should only note that the five star rating was not reached because it won't be an all time favorite but i would go up to 4 5 stars if that were possible i am decidedly not a runner though even those parts of the story kept my attention i found it hard to put down in the second half knowing historically what was coming and slowly watching it unfold for the characters","457":"this book was a great combination of storytelling and recent history you could really see the world through jean patrick's eyes and it was beautifully written moreover it wove a love of running and a sense of place via geology and nature that gave it a very interesting and unique quality i highly recommend this book","458":"i should have liked this book it takes place during an interesting time in history and is about cultural conflict a topic i love to read about its well written too so what was the problem i don't know i stopped ready it about 3 4 through i just did not care about the characters i never felt that i knew them or their motivations beyond a superficial understanding oh well","459":"an emotional insight into a time when the world abandoned the country of rwanda jean patrick simply wants to run and run some more but the long simmering hatred of the hutu to the tutsi creates a world where running was how one stayed alive cultural and tribal traditions are well developed and explained by ms benaron her knowledge of the times and atrocities are well documented as is her passion for the people of rwanda","460":"beautiful very sad well written","461":"i found this book despite its ugly subject to be written very beautifully in conveying the dark horrors of genocide family friendship and a deep sense of community shined brightly in the book","462":"great book jean patrick is coming of age as a tutsi in rwanda in and around the 1994 genocide he is a talented runner and dreams of representing rwanda in the olympics","463":"this book has been on my to read list for a long time and i'm so glad i finally read it running the rift is a story of a boy chasing his dream to become an olympic runner within the horrifying backdrop of the rwandan genocide in the early 1990's the story follows jean patrick the protagonist from his childhood into his young adult years benaron gives this character a great voice and provides a great picture into rwanda leading up to the horrors of the genocide at times the story was predictable but i was so invested in the characters i didn't care i've seen a little bit of criticism for this book because of its simplicity in writing style but i don't see that as a negative quality benaraon wrote a beautiful and tragic story which also educates us about a terrible point in history for rwanda","464":"beautifully written story of a young boy caught in the political upheaval in rwanda the characters were well written the book was engrossing and emotional and conveyed the beauty and strength of the rwandan people even through the horrors of the unspeakable genocide the cultural references made the book so much richer and interesting and i learned a lot about rwanda a very rewarding read","465":"this was an eye opening tale about genocide in rwanda about a decade ago the description of the country and family life were beautiful but the horrific realities of war and genocide are sprung on the reader as on the main character in such a way that is somewhat overwhelming i'm glad to have read it but took a few days to digest the violence and am looking forward to a lighter read next in the line up","466":"the belgians used a divide and conquer strategy to rule rwanda first they favoured the tutsi minority and then the hutu majority their policies led to one of the most horrific massacres in history when in 1994 800 000 tutsis and hutu moderates were murdered 500 000 women raped and 400 000 children left orphans all in 100 days books like running the rift cannot be described as enjoyable reading but they serve to teach us not only about the worst of human behaviour but also the best they also help us to remember because if we forget then all those people died for nothing","467":"more about the genocide in rwanda than running this is a fine story and covers a topic i needed to be made aware of i just didn't click with the writing style","468":"i really tried to like this book but couldn't get past page 58 although the cultural and political matter was interesting i found the main character shallow and the writing simplistic","469":"i liked this book a lot though it is not without its flaws jean patrick nkuba the protagonist is rather naive and simple he makes a lot of stupid mistakes and assumptions that you would think someone smart enough to study physics would not fall prey to and in early chapters the style is a bit too ya for me a bit simple but the clear and homely metaphors the complicated life of rwandans expressed in terms of geology and physics worked very well for me i think it is hard to write about something as complex as the genocide in rwanda without falling back on stock characters the clueless well meaning mzungu the supportive family the evil policeman this book is best when the situations and characters are murkier and i think my favorite parts are the ones with jean patrick's coach who is simultaneously a force for good and for evil and one of the more shades of gray characters in the book i also appreciate that the ending is not pat nor easy the audio version was terrific and the narrator's voicing probably contributed a star to my overall impression","470":"an engrossing tale of a young boy jean patrick born into a well educated tutsi family in rwanda during the years prior to the genocide a story of enduring family ties that survive even death 800 meter races and tragedy as the tutsi hope for reconciliation and a government shared by both tutsi and hutu meanwhile tribal rage seethes beneath the surface pitting neighbor against neighbor and eventually launching the rwandan genocide that killed an estimated 80 thousand tutsi","471":"running the rift is an important read it chronicles in great detail one boy's experiences as a tutsi in the years leading up to and in the wake of the genocide in rwanda i could certainly understand why this book won the bellwether prize for fiction the story centres around jean patrick nkuba who knows from an early age that he wants to run he has the talent and the drive with the help of his coach a former hutu soldier j p plans to make it all the way to the olympics what results is a story of heartache and promise--a reflection of the time and place he lives in the prose is well written and there are numerous insertions of j p 's native tongue within the text english translations are included immediately after appreciated in spades by this monoglot the insertions don't interrupt the flow of the text and they are a reminder that this boy lives in a very different world from ours in reading this book i learned quite a bit about rwandan culture and the horrors that occurred in that country during the 1990s it is a tasteful retelling of events if such a thing can be called tasteful and does not overwhelm with gore the focus is always on j p and his personal experiences readers are dragged along with him on clandestine encounters with his soldier brother and experience with him his mistreatment at the hands of the hutu boys that live at his school i highly recommend this book it is well worth the read","472":"beautifully written definitely shines a light on life in rwanda leading up to and after mass genocide in the 90s as seen through the eyes of jean patrick as he grows from boy to man as a reader i felt as if i was in the thick of it all benaron is a gifted story teller so glad i stumbled onto this novel highly recommend","473":"against the backdrop of the events leading up to and around the rwandan genocide comes a beautifully written story with charming characters i loved it","474":"this moving novel tells the story of the rwandan genocide from the perspective of a young tutsi man training to represent his country in track and field at the 1984 olympics jean patrick love for his homeland his family and his sport are balanced against senseless ethnic hatred that tears his world apart","475":"this book about the hutus and tutsis will break your heart and uplift it it's odd to say that i loved this book about people trying to live their lives and in constant fear of losing them during the genocide but the main character is a boy who relies on running to save his life one of my favorite reads ever","476":"excellent fictional account of the rwandan genocides really gives some good personalized perspective on the horrific event in history","477":"i think part of the reason i gave this book all 5 stars is because i just went to rwanda last summer so i could picture a lot of the places mentioned in the book","478":"story of a young man's survival during the rwandan genocide the beauty of the african countryside as described by a young athlete who only wants to run is in stark contrast to the violence of a civil war","479":"any book about the rwandan genocide is going to be very hard to read but benaron manages to continually inject humanity in the face of such inhumanity just when you think it's not possible to read any more you're so caught up in the story that you have to keep going just like her characters i understand why this book won barbara kingsolver's bellwether prize for socially engaged fiction","480":"it was interesting to read a fiction novel about rwanda and the genocide in 1994 originally i chose the book because it combines running and rwanda two of my interests the author took care to dapple the book with all sides of the genocide she spoke at least briefly of every narrative of the genocide and the events leading to it for me this book was interesting because it was not entirely about the genocide most of the book took place in the months beforehand the story of jean patrick's olympic goals and his story with his sweet heart was interspersed with the moments that lead to the eruption of the war i found this a different perspective because it allowed me to see how normal life continued even as the rumblings of genocide began as americans i think we sometimes don't understand how people didn't see it coming but this book showed how jean patrick understood rwandan politics were not quite right yet he pushed it to his back of his mind as he continued to train i think most people would respond the same way","481":"very well written tough book to read takes place in rwanda during the genocide jean patrick is a tutsi he is on his way to being an olympic runner and then felt that i was reading a memoir life situations and the surroundings were described so well","482":"even though the subject matter rwanda massacre is horribly depressing the book is uplifting and beautiful truly a must read for anyone interested in how people survive nightmarish situations","483":"this book was amazing it really gave you a glimpse into life in rwanda through the eyes of an innocent young man living in the war torn 90's where they were judged simply based on their race","484":"i read this book immediately before reading romeo dallaire's _shake hands with the devil_ the two books complement one another nicely in painting a fictional but personalized and factual account of the rwandan genocide respectively","485":"since it's clear this is a book about the genocide in rwanda i don't think it's a spoiler to say that the flavor of this book is dark heavy and sad i wanted to go into that space because it's been on my mind and in my heart with all the recent events in the world of how people kill each other all around the world and it's just so sad but the book won a prize from barbara kingsolver so that's some street cred i cried a few times while reading it a beautiful heart rending story about family and hope and love and dreams i didn't record any quotes but by the end i feel very attached to the characters and tender and solemn about the reality of genocide in our world and its impact on all of us","486":"my favorite book by far","487":"an amazing story set during the genocide in rwanda it is amazing how one group of people can dehumanise another group of people in order to achieve their political aims and genocide a story of community that survives a book with heart and soul","488":" i really liked this book but for some reason i think i expected something a bit different i did think it was a tad bit long but then the ending seemed a bit too what's the word convenient and predictable i am glad that the author did give us some insight about the rwanda politics at the time though but my problem was that for some reason please don't hate me i didn't love jean patrick i think his naivety and overconfidence just made me not feel sympathetic for him at all my heart did ache for his family and friends though who were the victims of the genocide because for some reason it made me think of all the others who actually were victims of this brutal massacre i mainly got this book for one thing and that was because i really wanted to read anything to do with rwanda and this fulfilled that requirement even if it is a work of fiction benaron is a terrific author though i am not complaining just on jp but also like i said the ending it seemed far too rushed at just the end when the author was steadily going over details and stuff throughout the entire story i knew bea wasn't dead but wow the daughter at the end seriously some of the dialogues between bea and jean patrick seems so mushy like a cliched love story that it made my stomach turn had to sort of skim skip that part and i personally think it would be fantastic if there was a map of africa or at least rwanda in the beginning or something to give us the geography and a slightly better perception of time distance etc bc there seems to be a lot of traveling in the book but before i know it bam jp is at another destination or on his way to another place faster than you know it and then i get slightly lost and confused i guess i am just the type of reader to like to visualize things in my head what the characters are doing and if they're doing some traveling i'd like to know how far the destinations are in relation to the story i guess i am weird that way haha anyways still a pretty good read","489":"just an overall beautifully written book","490":"highly recommend this book definitely one of the best reads of 2012","491":"this story reveals the realities of living through a genocide like no other i have read it is both eye and heart opening and helps you answer the question of how did that happen in a new way not that anything can explain genocide but benaron's story helped me see the situation in it's complexity and more from the ground perspective a must read for anyone planning on a trip to rwanda","492":"absolutely beautiful the first book i have read since kite runner and a thousand splendid suns that left me feeling this way an eye opener into the devastation in rawanda an education in the genocide of these people a story about the possibility of forgiveness and keeping hope alive despite all the odds jean patrick is a runner who uses his determination and skill to survive he is a strong but vulnerable seen real life nightmares but is still innocent in many ways he is sincere and compassionate i just loved his character my heart cried out for him this is the kind of book that is going to stay with me a very long time","493":"beautifully written novel of the genocide in rwanda through the eyes of an aspiring olympic runner who is the wrong ethnicity a world gone wild","494":"this was a very difficult read knowing that at some point the rwandan genocide was going to take place i finished it last night and think it is going to be haunting me for a while still a little early to sort my thoughts out","495":"i wouldn't have read this if it wasn't a book club choice because who does that to themselves but i'm glad i did it is beautifully written and i recommend it maybe not on a week already filled to the brim with trauma but maybe even then for the perspective on our lives","496":"this is an excellent read it is both an indictment of colonialism and a cautionary tale about the state sponsored erosion of civil rights that resulted in the genocide in rwanda it tells the story of a tutsi runner whose focus is on the olympics and his hutu coach it highlights the willingness of both tutsi and hutu to elevate sport above the political and social crisis that is unfolding around them and the political convenience of sport at play in the olympics","497":"unfortunately i found the novel rather poorly written it is well documented but feels didactic it has good material but the pace is uneven much if not most of the secondary characters are underdeveloped it is linear and so it is an easy read and gives a realistic account of the rwandan genocide without stressing the gruesomeness of the event","498":"i was prepared for the worst the long build to the genocide was for me as a reader by turns ominous and boring and ultimately not as traumatic as expected although certainly horrifying the author did a fine job of showing us the human experience of trying to live with the escalating violence the denial frustration and fear she did not succeed as well in humanizing the hutu or helping the reader understand how they could turn on their neighbors although the pervasive brainwashing radio must've been part of the explanation possibly the book was less convincing to me because the characters did not become fully real to me i found the language to be forced i was aware of the author working and not always effectively","499":"when a book wins an award for promoting social justice -- in this case the bellwether prize established by writer barbara kingsolver -- one might expect it to be heavy handed or preachy \"running the rift\" is neither of those it's a nuanced complex portrait of people in a nation riven by conflict when a book is set during genocide -- in this case the rwandan genocide of the 1990s -- one might expect it to be irredeemably depressing \"running the rift\" is unsparing in its depiction of the hatred and violence but doesn't let that crowd out the goodness of family and friendship and the power of hope the book isn't a war story it's the story of a boy growing up in africa a boy who can run very fast fast enough to dream of olympic gold jean patrick nkuba the runner is a tutsi a distinction that shouldn't matter but does because of who he is his path is set in ways he can't control because people are focused on the distinction between hutu and tutsi and are willing to kill because of it his country is forever changed as a boy jean patrick loses his father not to war but to a car accident he and his family leave their home at the school where his father taught to move in with an uncle but because jean patrick is a skilled student as well as a gifted athlete he is able to continue his schooling and he has the love and support of his extended family in doing so as he pursues higher education -- and moves up the ladder of competitive track -- he becomes more aware of the tenuous political situation in rwanda he watches with alarm as longstanding tensions flare between tutsi and hutu he must tolerate the casual slur of \"cockroach\" applied to all tutsi and he must make a difficult choice when an opportunity presents itself should he take a hutu id card to ease his way as jean patrick closes in on his goal of the olympics he realizes that there is far more to it than winning a medal for himself \"run as if your life depended on it \" a friend's father tells him \"as if all our lives depended on it \"\"running the rift\" does not spare readers the horrors of the violence in rwanda but never loses sight of the beauty -- the love and yes the hope -- that persists even amid such a desperate situation","500":"i know i shouldn't rely on fiction to educate me about genocide in rawanda but i felt like this book opened my eyes to to world events that i knew little about very well written story","501":"beautifully written i found it hard to believe that it was not memoir the details and description were so evocative that it seemed like it could have only come from the recollection of someone's real life","502":"received as a first reads giveaway this was a quick and compelling read good character development it was nice to have a story involving individual perspectives on the rwandan genocide as opposed to a broad overview of the groups involved it's easy to forget that people still had day to day lives to lead and dreams to pursue even in the midst of tragedy it also did a good job of evaluating social conflicts and the ripple effects that stem from them this would be a great book club book providing for a lot of discussion","503":"absolutely amazing one of the best books i've read in a long time really recommend","504":"i loved this book the author grapples with the very difficult subject of the rwandan genocide of the 1990's by weaving a tale though the lives of her characters i found the book very engaging as a story and it made me think more about the personal lives of the individuals who live in a country where this type of thing is occurring the quote below that begins the book is a very apt description of the focus the author provides a genocide is a poisonous bush that grows not from two or three roots but from a whole tangle that has moldered underground without anyone noticing ~claudine genocide survivor from life laid bare by jean hatfield","505":"one early description of what we now call genocide was simply believe the unbelievable i thought of that phrase time after time while reading this book","506":"powerful story i had to read it due to life's responsibilities in spurts and it felt like it took a while to build to the horrifying climax however the story was so intense that when i arrived at that point i put aside some of life's responsibilities because i couldn't put it down i would definitely recommend it","507":"imagine being talented enough to have a realistic dream of competing in the olympics imagine spending 10 years pursuing that dream as you grow up and overcome the obstacles put in your way because you live in africa making that dream a little harder to realize then imagine you are a tutsi in rwanda in the time leading up to the rwandan genocide then watch as your world completely explodes and you lose virtually everything but your life even though the details of the novel sound as if it would be depressing the book is a beautifully written and engaging story of a resilient young man the descriptions of the africa he lives in are vivid the characters ring so true to life it seems like you could be reading a biography because of jean patrick's talent for running his life is a little different than some others in his situation would be as such the descriptions of what happens to others around him including some family give a foreshadowing of what is to come even with that it is a shock to see how he goes from being celebrated as a hero to being hunted as a member of a hated ethnic group by various acquaintices this book was the latest winner of the bellwether prize for literary fiction that address social justice and responsibility issues it never hammers you over the head with its message but is a poignant reminder of the cost of war and hatred in this world","508":"some parts of this book were lovely and touching some heartbreaking and horrifying it wasn't perfectly written but it captured a time not to be forgotten through memorable characters","509":"yikes this book is one of those tear your heart out and stomp all over it kind that makes you stop and think about how little you know about world politics and vow to read the paper more often absolutely devastating rwandan stand out runner jean patrick wants nothing more than to run in the olympics someday he doesn't want to have anything to do with politics and wants only to run but unfortunately as a tutsi in rwanda of the 90's he gets sucked in powerful story get out the hankies and the newspaper in advance give to readers who like world fiction stories about runners and for those that care about human rights this should pretty much be everyone right","510":"s l o wa disappointing read periodically something of apparent significance would occur making me think here we go now but to no avail don't know that better editing could have helped certainly could improve flow u0026amp remove excessive african words that appeared throughout without references","511":"fascinating topic but i expected more given the ratings","512":"fairly good novel during a tragic and confusing time in rwandan history","513":"this was a first reads good reads giveaway i loved the book as i love differant cultures and it tells the story of a young man from childhood into manhood as he learns of the hatred and rath that comes from just being who he is a tutsi the genocide goes on in rwanda and no nations come to their aide as the tutsi are murdered simply for being who they are by birthright it was a fascinating read and i couldn't put it down once i got into it","514":"as with much great writing this is powerful affecting and thought provoking and you don't finish reading' it you 'emerge' from it head coming up for air taking a deep breath and reflecting on how it has changed you as a person i know that the fictional bea and jean patrick and more importantly the very real genocides in rwanda will be all i can think about for the next few days a tension filled gripping and important novel and a brilliant read","515":"it is a difficult feat well accomplished to write an interesting well told tale based on a true story of genocide benaron has more than accomplished the task her necessarily naive hero jean patrick and his family and friends make the horrific true facts of the tragedy in rwanda very real through this fictional account jean patrick and his olympic dreams his love for bea and his clear affection for his friends makes the inevitable seem inconceivable his uncle and brother roger understand more clearly the history of rwanda and past hutu tutsi clashes but jean patrick does not heed their dire predictions and out right warnings of what is to come the book is a well written story of a country told through complex relationships between very likeable believable characters most of the book is set before the genocide this fact allows the story to be bittersweet and tolerable this fictional account caused me to seek out non fiction about the genocide in part because i liked these characters so much that i wanted a greater understanding of rwandans and their history until now the genocide was a subject i avoided as unpleasant and far away so why dwell on it the suffering of the tutsis while the world did nothing is a story that like the holocaust must be told i disagree with the perjorative young adult label that some reviewers have placed on this book","516":"i wanted to love this book but i didn't a story of rwanda as it falls into genocide filtered through the viewpoint of a tutsi the oppressed young man who aspires to be a world class runner and represent rwanda in the olympics should have been illuminating and wrenching but the viewpoint jean patrick is both dense and one dimensional and i found after a while that i simply did not care what happened to him while the ever louder intimations of the horrors coming made me not want to read at all socially conscious fiction still ought to have interesting empathetic characters read for my book club","517":"ok i must admit i really struggled with this book until i got to the last 75 pages then wow","518":"great characters well written account of the rwandan genocide of 1994 the world needs to be reminded of ethnic cleansing such as still is occurring in syria iraq myanmar etc we all need to get along and celebrate our differences i really enjoyed this book","519":"a riveting powerful story that propels you steadily through the years of growing distrust and bias that eventually ignites into rwanda's nightmarish genocide","520":"beautiful story i fell in love with the characters","521":"one of the best books i've read in a long time immediately after i finished i went back and read the last 25 pages again because i didn't want it to end","522":"loved it very well written and chosen for the lake oswego good reads book i is amazing how the media contributed to all the hate and killing it fueled it all along with the government playing both sides i can't imagine living in a country like that and fearing for my life","523":"what an amazing story of dedication love of country love of family and racial strife in rwanda naomi brings africa with all it's beauty and people to life and shows the good in people even during a time of such hatred a very moving book that you won't want to put down","524":"bellwether prize winner for socially engaged fiction just added that as a shelf catagory nominated by barbara kingsolver need i say more ok a heartwarming tender and gripping story about a young tutsi rwandan a world class runner coming of age during the unimaginable time of genocide it's about family and community and terror","525":"reading about the rwandan genocide is important humbling difficult and horrifying this book though fiction was a very worthwhile read as it gave years of context and didnt just describe 1994 another reviewer said she preferred nonfiction regarding this story and i agree however the more information books stories about events outside the u s that help us learn about others the better","526":"winner of the bellweather prize for socially engaged fiction given by barbara kingsolver this is a coming of age story concerning jean patrick a gifted athlete who dreams of becoming rwanda's first olympic medal winner in track this beautifully written novel set prior to and during the rwandan genocide is a story on two levels one level deals with reality the scientific world of physics and geology life and death the other deals with the world of the heart and spirit this is a crucifixion story full of spiritual metaphors i did not expect to like this novel set in the bloodbath of rawanda but its indomitable message of human resiliency made it one of my favorite books of the year it has heartstrings","527":"it was movingly written though the end felt pat","528":"i prefer to learn my history from novels and this is a beautiful though painful way to learn more about the rwandan genocide i teach adults from rwanda and burundi and my heart really hurt while i was reading this thinking about what they must have been through","529":"now i know something about rwanda","530":"wrote a short review on http mybrainonkids net","531":"gripping at times naive and frustrating at others less than satisfactory in the end","532":"very compelling but tragic","533":"reading about genocide is not easy but my feeling is that i have a commitment to understand this devastating part of our not so distant history many of us live in our safe little bubbles this book burst my bubble","534":"this book is filled with pain i found it difficult to get into the first half the time jumps disrupted the congruity of the story for me it picked up when the genocide began of course but was so filled with horror that it was still difficult to read i also continually found myself ticked off at jean patrick for not taking the threat seriously and doing what he could to save his family but i suppose it's like the passage towards the end of the book where jean patrick is eating on the bus and the other passengers excuse him from social custom because he is little more than a boy perhaps we must also excuse his naivety about the danger because he is little more than a boy over all this certainly is a beautifully written book and it made an event half a world away feel like it was inside of me the love story feels authentic but so much pain horrific leisurely paced strong sense of place lots of cultural details","535":"did you ever read a book enjoy it but continue to think about it more and more long after you've read the last page that's how i have responded to running the rift the story echoes and touches on my thoughts frequently though it's back on my bookshelf the unspeakable tragedy of genocide in rwanda 1994 is the primary thread of the novel but love humor and precious family connections hold their own right on the back of despair if anyone assumes that one part of the world holocaust europe is where real genocide happened then running the rift will educate and inform this book really does make one consider social justice and how each of us has a responsibility to speak up","536":"a riveting tale about nkuba jean patrick a bright trusting rwandan boy a tutsi his dream is to represent rwanda and medal at the olympics in track jean patrick does not care for politics and does not understand the tensions between the tutsi and hutu to him they are all rwandan as he is preparing for the olympics the tensions between tutsi and hutu explode jean patrick must literally run for his life he is confused and confounded by those he considered friends he is unsure who to trust through jean patrick's eyes benaron makes the reader feel the tension and see the horror that was rwanda in 1993 - 94","537":"this is a difficult history and subject in which to put a fictional character because of that i really hate to be critical on a positive note the writing style is somewhat simplistic and seemed geared for young people who need to learn about genocide and particularly this genocide","538":"touching and sometimes graphic story about the tutsi genocide in rwanda in the 1990's i have read the histories of many refugees from this area in my job and this story made them come to life for me many of the faces this novel evoked for me were those of my patients' past and present all i can say is wow god save us all","539":"what a tragic story the tutsi genocide in rwanda that barely crossed the radar here why is it that we sent send troops to the middle east for years when this happens and we do nothing sadly another case of 'follow the money' i didn't understand what caused the hutu tutsi wars but the focus of the novel is that when people stop seeing each other's humanity the cause doesn't enter into it much the characters were well developed and believable the writing powerful this is one that will stay with me for a long time","540":"how does a woman who is not from africa write the story of a rwandan tutsi boy whose only dream is to run for his country in a time when the genocide took place she must have done her research well the book is divided up into sections and it was only the last one where i felt cheated because the ending was a bit disney ish otherwise she makes the politics personal so the reader understands at least something of what the rwandans went through and how the survivors felt afterwards i couldn't put it down one of those books that remind you of the randomness of the situations we are born into","541":"excellent book set in rwanda immediately before during and after the rwandan genocide the main character is jean patrick a talented tutsi who is a contender for the rwandan olympic team the difficult thing about this book that because it is historical fiction the reader pretty much knows what is going to happen i spent much of the first 2 3 of the book holding my breath and dreading reading about what would soon face these beloved characters the great thing about it being fiction though is that i could actually finish it although what happens in the book is horrific it is not spelled out in lots of bloody detail and so much of the story is about the main character himself he is a multi dimensional character not just a pawn in a story to tell the world how horrible this event was he drew me into the story which helped me learn a lot more about the background and details of the situation that led up to the genocide i felt i learned more than from non fiction books like we wish to inform you that tomorrow we will be killed with our families as good as that book was because i felt invested in the story not just horrified by it my only criticism is that i felt the ending was a little too pat without giving too much away i know it was supposed to be hopeful but there are so many challenges facing the people left and i don't see how they could successfully remain together without someone giving up a lot but that would be a book in and of itself i would love to see the next edition come with a map and some basic background maybe as a foreword or author's note on the historical events depicted in the book i was a young adult during the time period depicted in the book but i think the book will appeal to high school and college students who will have no personal memories of the time period sadly our children learn almost nothing about the african continent in school so they may very likely lack the background to put this book in context knowing a little of the context before starting to read will make it that much more meaningful","542":"i think i would actually give this book a 4 5 but it is definitely a book i will rave about the writing is excellent and so vivid as the reader i experienced this story as if it were nonfiction combine that with an interest in this area of africa and books about self discovery and social justice and i found the book fascinating i knocked off an imaginary half star because there were points when the narrative got lengthy and i lost track of what was going on but it didn't detract from the book as a whole","543":"everyone needs to read this book while dealing with the horrible genocide in rwanda the author still manages to put together a stunningly beautiful story of love and family i could not put this book down","544":"i didn't know when i picked this book up that it's apparently a ya novel which wouldn't have necessarily been a bad thing but it's an incredibly poorly written and bland ya novel and the author manages to take one of the most complex and passionate periods of the late 20th century and turn it into cardboard to say this book was a slog would be an understatement","545":"i found this book to be a very good read it could also be considered a young adult novel but that does not at all take away from the message of this book or the enjoyment of reading it it takes you through the school and university years of jean patrick as he dedicates himself to becoming an olympic runner as his country rwanda is experiencing devastating prejudice and violence towards his tutsi heritage jean patrick remains optimistic that rwanda will come to it senses and see that it is one country and not divided by tribes as the story moves onto the genocide that we know historically took place we can see the horror of that happening we can also see how people who without a lot of material things have such wonderful family friends and community bonds and strength of character my local independent bookstore harleysville books had a skype with the author and what a wonderful person she is naomi enlightened us with her stories of rwanda and who she based her characters on she was very open and shared parts of her life delightful evening with the author","546":"a well written book about how the political upheaval in rwanda intruded even on those who wanted nothing to do with it the focus on jean patrick who just wants to run and train for the olympics is a refreshing perspective considering how so many books with mention of the rwandan genocide focus heavily on the political and military elements it's a solid story with ups and downs and while i don't think it's a life changer or particularly profound it's very enjoyable and worth a read","547":"simply captivating and amazing do read","548":"fictional tutsi account of rwandan holocaust reminded me of accounts given by austrian jews before hitler i got teary it's beautiful and chilling","549":"the news yesterday was full of images from nigeria where people were marking the sad anniversary of the kidnapping of 132 girls and young women by boko haram a year ago what is going on with fundamentalist groups is extremely hard for me to understand the bbc recently did a piece on the nigerian group which gives some context the aim is a caliphate where sharia law rules it seems everything western should be forbidden but muslims are not the only terrorists in the world as witness uganda's lord's resistance army a rebel group operating on borders separating uganda sudan the central african republic and the democratic republic of congo ostensibly motivated by christian revelations it uses child soldiers with impunity inter ethnic violence also is a curse and probably to date conflicts like those which have pitted hutus against tutsis in rwanda and burundi have killed and displaced more than the muslim groups have how did things come to this two novels i read recently give a little insight the first is running the rift by naomi benaron it tells the story of jean patrick nkuba a tutsi in rwanda who wants to run he has a chance to represent his country in the olympics but is caught up in the 1994 genocide much of his family is wiped out but he escapes the frenzy that led up to killing spree estimates are that at least 500 000 people were killed in three months is portrayed in terrifying detail the story is not all horror though because it ends with a certain hopefulness that forgiveness is possible the subtext is that competition for land can be manipulated to profit the self interest of individuals and that vestges of colonial domination have exacerbated things the second is three weeks in december by audrey schulman takes place in rwanda and kenya there actually are two three weeks the first at the end of the 19th century and the other at the beginning of the 21st in alternating sections schulman tells the story of an engineer from maine who heads up the team building of a railroad from mombasa on the indian ocean coast to what would become nairobi and of a brilliant woman ethnobotanist who has asperger's syndrome and who is searching for a medicinal plant in the mountains where the last mountain gorillas live there's an o henry like ending that ties things up which i won't spoil but i think it's fair to say the two stories point out what colonialism has done to the people and ecosystems of africa the dignified wise hunter gatherers of the first period contrast drastically with the drugged children's army the kuti that shulman has invented who thrash about trying to recreate a pre colonial state similarly the starving lions who ravage the railroad workers in the first story presage the sorry state of the gorillas that the ethnobotanist hopes to protect both novels are good reads running the rift does perhaps suffer from a happy ending and from the amount of space given to how to run but both features probably mean that people who wouldn't necessarily read a novel about genocide will read this one that's all to the good and probably why the book one the bellwether prize for social engaged fiction","550":"this is probably one of the best books i've read in a long time this was a romantic novel but not in the traditional sense it was jean patrick's love of family country running and bea with love comes heartache what an eye opening story it shows that history does repeat itself however more people need to be vocal so it doesn't happen again","551":"it made me cry that's how much i came to love this story i don't cry often at books i've read other books about rwanda and this is one of the ones that really gives you a sense of place and culture i could smell the food and feel the heat an entrancing story","552":"powerful book that inspired me to learn more about rwanda's history and present struggles wonderfully written i especially loved the bird imagery that prevailed throughout the book simply excellent","553":"i received this book for free through a goodreads first reads giveaway this is a love story born amongst and despite the genocide of rwanda benaron's descriptions are so vivid that you can hear the laughter and feel the heartache i could see the land in my mind's eye i could feel the children's innocence and fear an excellent book truly","554":"i read the dust jacket blurb when i picked this off of the library shelf it talked a lot about running and i am not a runner and could not imagine that reading about running would be at all interesting and yet i checked out the book and i read it and i am so pleased that i did my point is this this book can absolutely be read and appreciated by an american white non runner because all it requires is that you have a soul i think readers that like this book may also like the power of one by bryce courtenay","555":"ok hard to read at times hard to believe this horrid event could happen","556":"running the rift follows jean patrick an olympic hopeful coming of age in rwanda in the years leading up to the 1994 genocide it's told in three parts the first two of which are slow and a little dry as the characters and situation are introduced many of the characters themselves are fairly superficial though benaron does well in her portrayal that not all hutu in rwanda took part in the killing and hatred of tutsi in part three the tension between the hutu and the tutsi erupts into pure hell and if the entire book had been as good as the last three parts the book would have easily gotten 4 or 5 stars it was almost painful to read as thousands of people are hunted down and killed while the rest of the world stands by and does nothing this book was heartbreaking vivid and enlightening i feel like it could have gotten into the history behind the hutu tutsi conflict a little better i had to stop and do some research part way through but the horror of the genocide itself was riveting","557":"i really enjoyed the play of the geological rift and the rift between the hutu u0026amp the tutsi i had a hard time getting into it but once i did found it fascinating i think she didn't excellent job of telling a simple story complicated by historical facts one thing i didn't enjoy was the complex words although i know what know what limn u0026amp runnel mean i felt that the complex words detracted from the simple story all in all it was a good read and a great book club discussion","558":"young jean patrick is a very gifted runner he dreams to run the 800 in the olympics it is rowanda this is a beautifully written story of hope in the midst of the tragedy i was moved throughout this whole novel i felt the love the fear no terror in this story with each word and phrase a book that will change you","559":"outstanding a novel of rwanda and what happens to families during the unrest of the 1990's well written likeable characters great scenes of beauty and of tragedy","560":"words cannot truly explain how beautiful this book is how much it spoke to my heart and soul my own heart aches for the pain and joy and tragedy of the lives detailed here madame benaron takes such a recent tragedy and weaves it into a beautiful masterpiece tender and joyful speaking of hope and life among the death since the age of 12 the story of rwanda has struck a chord in my heart and this admirable and courageous work of fiction does a tremendous job of telling the world the story it needs to hear truly everyone should read this book take its messages to heart laugh and cry and dance and grieve along with the characters inside and know that even in the darkest of times in places of the world where the sun has set a tomorrow will come do not give up hope on the world walk in unity walk in love walk in light and wisdom","561":"didn't love it as much as barbara kingsolver but thought the author was able to effectively illustrate the horror and heartbreak of this dark time in rwanda through the characters and story","562":"enjoyed this book it had some great detail about rwanda and the personal stories behind the genocide i wish the author would have gone into more detail about the history of events leading up to the conflict the only reason i didn't give this book 4 stars was because her writing style was very obvious almost written in young adult style the book didn't make me think much to digest it but it did make me reflect upon the genocide and how the rest of the world stood by watching","563":"so glad i read this book especially at this time april being the 20 year anniversary of the rwandan genocide i knew far too little about this atrocious chapter in human history i finished this book grateful for the insight but still wishing it had illuminated a bit more i still have so many questions i know it's not the role of fiction to convey history and certainly not historical fact but where historical fiction leaves those gaps it hopefully makes up for in story and character the story and the characters were lovely in this book but i felt the author took some safe and expected paths in her plot and character developments in the end i'm very glad i read it but it left just a little something to be desired","564":"it feels wrong to say this story was wonderful because of the pain suffered by all involved hope believing in a dream love and people sooo much that the craziness of life doesn't take it away is so powerful ecclesiastes 9 10","565":"insight into rwanda's horrific internal war between the tutsi's and hutu's","566":"such an amazing story the descriptions and details the author used made me feel like i was watching a movie a was so enthralled in the story and learned a ton this book will stick with me","567":"i originally picked this book up because it referenced running on the cover when i turned it over to read the book jacket i learned that it was a story about the rwandan genocide that took place in the 1990s this subject is intriguing to me because i was alive then but remember only hearing a little bit about it in the news i wanted to read the book to learn more and i was not disappointed this book is simultaneously great and really hard to read i became very attached to the characters and their dreams hopes and struggles of life in a country very different from america it was difficult to read about the carelessness with which life is regarded during the few months of the genocide in which over 500 000 people were murdered due to their race i believe that it is important to read books like this to learn how these types of atrocities happen and what events lead up to them i liked how running was included as part of the storyline i would have liked to have seen the main character go on to do great things in running the 800m olympic event but i think the story was told well as obviously the devastation in his country was of higher importance than a track meet overall this book is educational and well worth reading","568":"this was a great book reading it you would never know that it is a fictional character the author does a great depiction of what happened in rwanda the sentiments before and after the genocide all while nicely developing jean patrick's character and those around him","569":"i'm torn about a rating for this novel which started slowly for me midway through it definitely became gripping and parts of the final segments had me utterly gripped benaron does an admirable job of creating the sense of increasing tension and horror that take hold in jean patrick's rwanda and her attention to detail results in some near cinematic reading too many threads in the narrative though tug in too many directions without sufficient resolution 3 5","570":"this book is about rwanda's tragic history i have read a number of books on the subject this was the first novel and it was excellent it appears that seemly average folks so easily turn on their neighbors become so senseless and evil it is beyond my understanding","571":"this book jogged on and on and on and on and then all the stuff you'd been waiting for happened in a jumble in the last few pages i think she tried to pace herself too well writing this one","572":"i'll be posting a full review in my blog soon at juanraderbas blogspot com but for now let me say naomi's novel is moving educating encapdulating and needed to be written great stuff i'll be reading her upcoming works for sure","573":"i am so thankful i came across this book i've always been interested horrified by what happened in rwanda in the nineties this was a wonderful book which also contained a lot of facts about the civil uprising i highly recommend this book to anyone who can handle it","574":"heartbreaking","575":"i received this book through the goodreads first reads program this book gave me a new appreciation for what happened in rwanda it has given me a desire to know more about the genocides and what has been done since them family values are strong and well described the characters are likeable the one thing i disliked about the book was that i felt the denouement was a little slow","576":"i won this book from the goodreads giveaways this is an eye opening story and brings to light the genocide that has taken place in rwanda it is hard to imagine having your neighbors be so kind one minute and the next they are shouting hateful words to you the author does a great job of really putting the reader in the character's shoes and feel what he experienced","577":"asked what running the rift is about it would be too easy to say it is about the rwandan genocide you could also say it's about an olympic runner both of these are correct but neither really describe what this book is about at its core i'd say more than anything else benaron's novel is about character it asks tough questions about morality courage honesty and integrity given the subject matter i was hesitant to read this novel i've read plenty of novels filled with the most horrific scenes pulled from history but something about the genocide in rwanda hit me hard perhaps it's because it happened in my lifetime perhaps my guilt for all my inaction toward issues of social justice is personified in the western world's reaction to rwanda regardless i was hesitant to begin this novel but i did and i'm glad i made it over that initial fear despite the horrifying events which take place in running the rift benaron somehow manages to keep the novel light she doesn't do this by ignoring what happened or sugar coating it it seems she does this purely by giving the reader just enough information to know what is going on and peopling the book with characters who make it worth continuing on this line benaron walks so carefully displays her natural talents in this novel about character characters are the novel's best quality and its biggest downfall the characters we meet in running the rift are wonderful i loved them i loved them i wanted to shoot the breeze with jean patrick i wanted to be daniel's best friend i wanted to join sides with roger and i was all about asking bea out for a date these people are lovable and i wanted to know more about them than this story allowed at the same time the characters were perhaps a little too lovable the faults they had--which were very few--could be justified given the time and place the \"good guys\" were good the \"bad guys\" were bad i'd have loved to have seen more dynamic characters and some shifting loyalties running the rift is a spectacular novel it is filled with gorgeous language and an unforgettable cast of characters in spite of the graphic war scenes it is a clean novel a rare example of how grittiness can be portrayed accurately without an r rating it is a surprisingly enjoyable read and worthy winner of the bellwether prize i present running the rift with the best book of 2012 so far award","578":"tough to review would give it 2 5 stars i was very interested to learn about rwanda and this is the first book i've read focused on the ethnic warfare between hutus and tutsis jean patric a tutsi is a phenomenal runner who dreams of running in the olympics the book follows him from about aged 10 or 11 to college as the warfare between the two groups intensifies it is a fictional account but mirrors much of what i recall reading in the news devastating and horrific crimes against people jean patrick's story seemed a bit flat to me but overall found it informative","579":"captivating and depressing and motivating wow great book","580":"i'm lost for words i'm glad naomi benaron wasn't how much this book of life changes and we are not the ones to write the pages p65 loss tugged at his heart he could have fallen to his kneews with the weight of all that was gone p354 it is love that resurrects life from death turn your head to the living p362","581":"a magnificent story beautifully written an outstanding mix of keen knowledge about the physical and emotional world of distance running on the one hand and a deep sensitivity to the agony and ecstasy of love devotion and community against the backdrop of cruel hatred and violence benaron's well crafted work guided me as closely through the hills of rwanda as it did through the tortured lives of its people amidst the genocide they perpetrated and endured a tremendously inspiring read in the context of preparing for my third boston marathon praying through holy week and continuing to mature and grow in my own friendships","582":"a fictional account set in a historical state~beautiful characters contrasted with the genocide in rwanda a tough read yet thought provoking","583":"this is one the best books i have read in a long time it's a masterful fiction story with the back drop of a very real and scary time in rwanda's history the book leads you through the life of young man who is a tutsi in the predominately hutu rwanda the hate against the tutsi people builds throughout the book until the story reaches 1994 and accumulates into the rwandan genocide a very powerful portrait of that sad and scary in time in rwanda","584":"i thought this book could have been so much better but the pace felt off and it didn't draw me in as others from similar genres","585":"naomi benaron's running the rift is an excellent but at times difficult read difficult in content not in execution it is the story of jean patrick a rwandan tutsi who is a runner and of his family and friends we first meet jean patrick when he is a boy when he learns of his father's death his father had always tried to believe that the peace between hutu and tutsi would last but that belief is not shared by his wife his brother in law or jean patrick's older brother roger we follow the progress of jean patrick's life from his waiting by the radio after taking national tests to see if he is top in his class so he can go to secondary school on scholarship government quota's limited how many tutsi's could continue schooling to his days as a runner training at university for the olympics throughout the novel the reader sees jean patrick's stubborn determination to be the best runner and to ignore the politics and the building tension around him we see how he is popular and how people make concessions because although he is tutsi he is a world class runner we also see the embedded hate simply because he is not the favored class of rwandan he tolerates being threatened beaten insulted and worse because he and others like him cannot fight back through jean patrick and his experiences we learn of the cultural and history of rwanda and we see the ever present bias that pits one group of people against another -- people who have been taught that despite their common language and culture -- that they are different and one is superior and the other is a threat jean patrick sees his running as something that can represent all of rwanda and he is encouraged by family and his coach to use that to his advantage and to do whatever is necessary even if it means denying his heritage it is his girlfriend bea however that pushes him to see more that is going on around him she is hutu but her father is a journalist and willing to defy those in power to let the world know of what is happening in rwanda what jean patrick tries to ignore the audience sees and the story pushes us to what we know will be the genocide a history we especially american's have often only have a vague sense of the novel's impact is that it is small story one boy from one family in one province of rwanda yet manages to show how the true horror of the rwandan genocide was not that it was perpetrated by a government that sent troops to round up and kill or by an invading force but by a minority of hardliners who convinced neighbors to turn on neighbors over the course of a few weeks an estimated million tutsi and hutu's who aided them or were seen as sympathizers were murdered by fellow rwandan's who used machete's clubs and knives far more than guns and grenades or camps benaron doesn't dwell on the violence but paints enough detail to leave the reader with a sense of horror at what happened and what the west didn't do while 'fictional' violence doesn't tend to impact me on a personal level knowing that what benaron shows the audience is only a sliver of the real violence of those months it is enough to leave me with bad dreams at the end however the audience is left knowing that while so few survived and lost everything they yet somehow retain hope even if that hope is slow in rising the title of benaron's novel refers to the geological feature of the area the tectonic rift formed by the violent upheaval of the earth's crust but also calls to mind the attempt of jean patrick to live and navigate between worlds that have a history of violent collision science physics and geological feature in the story and act as metaphors as does the sport of running in the notes the author says that she was a serious runner and it shows in the descriptions of runners and racing i'll note here that as a book written about such a complex situation by someone from outside of the culture there has been some accusations of cultural appropriation i think those are unfounded in this case and perhaps leveled by individuals who haven't read it because benaron has done her homework both learning the history of a nation and developing an understanding of a cultural that has seen tremendous upheaval and loss he characters are never stereotypes and are complex individuals i listened to parts of this on audiobook and it moves lyrically she has spent extended time in rwanda living with rwandans and her love of them and the country shows in her writing the audiobook gave me a sense of the language its metaphors and rhythms while her details gave me an sense of a culture i didn't know and made me cheer for characters i knew in my heart were doomed this book is likely to stick with me for a long time both negatively and positively benaron didn't write an unbelievable against the odds ending and i am thankful for that having read many articles and accounts of the genocide but it also wasn't a bleak ending a powerful story that should be read by those who like their fiction with a social consciousness","586":"benaron opens a window to the the horrific happenings of the attempted genocide of the tutsi people in rwanda although difficult to read the horror is conveyed with integrity and restraint the reader is allowed to enter the lives of the people of rwanda and with them watch the terror unfold the characters are complex one can't help but find many messages but never does the book become didactic","587":"this novel reads like a teen book it takes a while to get into it the genocide which took place in rwanda is incredibly horrifying and graphic naomi benaron introduces us to characters and lives that keep us enthralled and disturbed all at the same time the book provides the reader an inside view of a country experiencing a volatile time yet following the footsteps of jean patrick from barefoot to nike you feeling deeply for the violence and anxiety that surrounds them simply because of their birthright born as a tutsi make young students read novels like this to learn about our world","588":"i didn't rate this book well for the thrilling entertainment value i appreciated it because it provided valuable insight into a conflict and a country i had heard a lot about but had never taken time to understand terror and genocide doesn't end with the conflict the violence sends heart wrenching echoes into eternity and the suffering lives in the shadows of our hearts for a lifetime such a sad chapter in history","589":"this is an engaging story about the events leading up to and resulting from the rwandan genocide overall i was really moved by it the part about jp's childhood was entertaining and the events of the genocide were almost impossible to read which is how it should be i had a few problems with it there was a lot of usage of very obvious metaphors too many of the characters felt a little more like characterizations than real people and everything about the ending felt too easy and almost a little cheap but none of that takes away from the strengths of the story and how well produced it really is i received this free through goodreads first reads thanks","590":"good historical fiction last couple of chapters that were supposed to be the climax dragged","591":"loved this story of triumph in an impossible situation as a runner i totally related to jean patrick's training and racing so many promising lives lost to genocide","592":"almost five stars i liked this way more than i thought i would it took me a while to get into it due to the awkward to me conversational dialogue but of course it's probably appropriate based on translation feeling a bit silly u0026amp sheepish thankfully or not i was aware of the reality u0026amp heinousness of the rwandan genocide so that aspect was not shocking great story","593":"it feels a little bit like a young adult novel it's a little slow in the beginning and probably didn't need to be this long but overall good writing it tells an important heartbreaking and horrifying story yet leaves you with a feeling of hope","594":"almost a 4 star book an incredible story but very difficult to read","595":"this is a novel about a young man jean patrick who is a teenager and young college student in the years leading up to the rwandan genocide in rwanda the tribal classification imposed on the region by the belgiums has divided the region into two main groups the tsutsi's and the hutu's jean patrick is a tsutsi the group that has fallen out of political power and because of this tsutsi's face discrimination and harassment jean patrick manages to go to secondary school and college in part because he is a gifted runner his coach a hutu nationalist admires his ability and determination and despite his prejudice takes jean patrick under his wing and tries to protect him jean patrick's girl friend is hutu and his best friend too while jean patrick tries to navigate the hutu world his brother roger embraces the tsutsi cause and becomes a rebel while jean patrick's story is compelling i thought the writing was a bit stilted in some places and therefore i could not give it five stars this is a great book to recommend to high school students who may not be familar with the rwandan genocide and to adults who may have forgotten the power comes from the idea that this could happen any time and any place what can the world do to prevent such an event from ever occurring again it also makes clear that this type of civil war is a greater tragedy then facing an outside invader since neighbor turned against neighbor and people went along to spare their own lives survivors have a sense of relief and guilt this bellwether winning book is also a good choice for book clubs that like more serious reads","596":"after reading about 150 pages of this novel i wasn't sure if i wanted to continue or not it was good but a slow read for me and didn't pick up until a few pages later and at that point it was hard to put down jean patrick the runner bea his lover jonathan the american friend coach his trainer and roger his brother all victims and survivors simultaneously the strength of the rwandan people and the impetus to just put one foot in front of the other day to day is staggering jean patrick is an olympic hopeful coached by a man who also trains the militia to annihilate the tutsi neighbors hunt down their tutsi friends when violence escalates my favorite line in the book is you can outdistance that which is running after you but not what is running inside you i would think anyone that witnessed first hand this atrocity deals with this sentiment daily","597":"it was interesting but didn't hold my attention","598":"the rwandan genocide is only a dim part of my memory despite being an adult in my mid twenties in north america when it occurred this fictionalized account actuates what was before to me only sound bites and dry reports it is nestled in a story that is compelling and heartbreaking","599":"i wanted to love this book i really did the subject is important and well worth meaningful exploration but i couldn't finish this book it was a series of events loosely held together by a main character it felt choppy and slow","600":"this book is well written and has good character development the story is sad but enlightening a sad time in history","601":"this book is about one of the greatest tragedies humans have inflicted on one another however i believe it is done tastefully it is done with a fresh perspective and it is done with a good dose of hope to bring the readers out of the darkness into which this event usually drags us","602":"i loved this book jean patrick was so real to me and i was truly engaged with his path throughout the book i would have liked a little more in depth discussion of the tutsi hutu conflict but i understand why benaron wrote the story the way she did plus she does give a good reading list at the end to guide outside study i definitely recommend this book","603":"i read this last week and i'm still mulling over the story i haven't read many books on the rwandan genocide as it's such a brutal chapter in african history this story comes from the perspective of a young man who loves to run is talented and tutsi as he grows up he is given the opportunity to represent his country and he has his sights on the atlanta olympics competing in the 800m but in the background the nation is boiling over with political tensions and the massacres begin in earnest he escapes with his life but not much else the story is well told with enough emotional understanding of the conflict between tutsi and hutu for us to gain some insight and share some empathy with the main characters who come from both racial groups as i read i often recalled scenes from hotel rwanda which helped to reinforce the scenes played out in the book i recommend this book but be prepared for the hard hitting realities of a nation who tears itself apart in acts of genocide","604":"very moving reads like a biography taking place during the genocide in the 1990s and paints an accurate picture of rwandan culture throughout great armchair travel book and very informative a naomi benaron","605":"as any book about the rwandan genocide necessarily must be this one was immeasurably sad and disturbing but it also managed somehow to be light easy to listen to and life affirming it was interesting to read about the gradual development of the genocide from the perspective of a young tutsi rwandan although i have no way of knowing how realistic the story was the audiobook's narrator had a very genuine sounding accent although it sounded like southern african accents that i'm familiar with and i'm not sure what rwandan english accents sound like honestly i'm glad that this book is behind me now i've been seeing this around for a long time and knowing that i would need to read it at some point but putting it off until a time that i had the emotional strength to read about genocide when i read books about horrible and disturbing topics i do it out of a sense of duty because i feel that it's important to know about and to learn from other peoples' struggles modern day or historic i judge these books on the basis of whether i felt that they brought a fresh angle or viewpoint and whether i learned something from them if i didn't learn anything then i feel like a voyeur reading about other people's tragedies for the fun of it e g march by geraldine brooks this book like catch 22 and countless holocaust books which i've read did bring something new to the table for me so i can't say that these books are particularly fun to read but they are educational and important","606":"so good and such a breath of fresh air after all the ya i've been reading great characters compelling and tragic plot excellent weaving in of fact and historical context i'm not that into running and hate the 800m but i actually really enjoyed the detail about training for races and could empathize with jean patrick's need to just run to forget about all the political turmoil and ethnic cleansing ruining his beloved rwanda","607":"running the rift is a heartwrenching account of the 1994 rwandan genocide benaron does an outstanding job of weaving together fiction and fact to create a storyline that is both believable and entertaining the reader will feel as though they are in rwanda experiencing the hardships and turmoil endured by the tutsi in their efforts to survive as a people it is still unbelievable that this travesty occurred neighbor against neighbor friend against friend and sometimes even family member against family member i commend benaron for writing this fictional account of this very dark and sad time in africa's history","608":"i had a love hate relationship with this book story of jean patrick a ruwandan tutsi who is gifted in intellect and as an olympic runner i lived in the congo so was transported back experiencing the sights smells sounds language colors weather etc of that special time in my past so well written the heartbreak of this novel is of course the genocide and how it impacted jp his family friends and his country","609":"this is a beautiful touching terrifying heart rending story of a young rwandan man a tutsi who in the years leading up to the genocide of his people dreams of running in the olympics he's a man tied inextricably and lovingly to his family almost all of whom eventually fall victim to the genocide he's also a remarkably hopeful man in a world where hope is severely tested at every turn and he's a man of faith though it's not a major theme in the book and that faith too is severely tested by circumstances in a brilliant scene as he's on a plane on his way to the u s as a refugee he allows his bible to fall open as some people do in the faith that the passage their eye falls on will provide guidance for some difficult situation or decision the first time it falls open to a passage about forgiveness but he does it again and it's a passage about vengeance and so it goes back and forth as he does it again and again but in the end he decides to abide by a passage about love as the only reliable path to the future a winner of barbara kingsolver's bellwether prize for fiction in support of social change running the rift is more subtle than kingsolver's own recent fiction but compares favorably to her poisonwood bible","610":"highly recommend for reading groups","611":"i really liked this book it is filled with authentic detail about life in rwanda i recommend it for my sons who are both cross country runners and have been to east africa the story is uplifting and heartbreaking and tragic all at the same time very well written i especially like the many wonderful descriptive metaphors that the author uses","612":"i'd not read much on the genocide that occurred in rwanda in the early 1990's this is a well written novel based on that time period following jean patrick from boyhood to adulthood certainly not light reading","613":"i listened to the audio of this book it was fabulous and i enjoyed it all the story of the young male runner a tutsi in rwanda is a story of devastation and hope i normally cannot listen to depressing stories and the history of rwanda is just full of depressing i am acquainted with the history of the country so i was prepared to listen to one disk while driving and then stop but it was just the opposite jean patrick nkuba i thought his last name was of cuba all the time i was listening was they type of kid everyone wants to be he was smart and he was a fast runner he loved his family he was ambitious steadfast optimistic he pulled the story together had some hope maybe the ending was a little hard to believe but i did not care it was very satisfying end","614":"this book starts out slowly but it is worth sticking with it it takes place in rwanda and accurately depicts the hutu tutsi conflict that led to the rwandan genocide the story centers on a young boy whose dreams are to run in the olympics this book is well written and well researched","615":"in rwanda jean patrick has dreams of running in the olympics the year is 1994 and tension is mounting between the tutsis and the hutus jean patrick despite being a tutsi manages to get into a private boarding school and receives running instruction from the enigmatic coach when the tension finally erupts the horrific atrocities of the genocide have neighbors and friends butchering each other jean patrick must now run for his life agree with others that the first half of the book reads like a ya novel but i also happen to like ya novels it is a coming of age story though under the worst of times learned a lot about that rwandan era and feel thankful that i live where i do","616":"a great read so poignant mans inhumanity to man is so raw in this book yet the strength of the human spirit remains a recommended read","617":"this novel is about a boy growing up in rwanda and training to run in the olympics during a time of violence between the hutus and tutsis i thought it read like someone who speaks another language speaking simply in english which kind of added to the real feeling of the book it was an absorbing story and i was on the verge of tears during the final chapters i would recommend this to anyone who is trying to understand the reasons behind the fighting in africa in the 90s this book centers on rwanda but the discord throughout africa is all so complex i can't begin to understand who was fighting who or all the reasons which varied from region to region who can ever explain or justify genocide","618":"a well written very interesting book i remember the small amount of news we received never understood exactly what was happening a excellent story well told","619":"i have spent countless hours reading about rwanda's genocide however one of the most impactful books i have ever read about the subject is \"running the rift\" by naomi benadron before plunging into this book i was a bit apprehensive when i learned that the book was fiction all of the work that i have read about rwanda's genocide have been non fiction interestingly when perusing benadron's list of suggested readings i was quite exhausted to see her list closely resembled my library of works on the topic i then read the interview in the back of the novel which explains why benadron chose to write this story as fiction--she wanted to instill feelings of social activism in her readers in other words she created characters that would evoke an emotional connection in her readers so they would be driven to fight for social justice \"running the rift\" explores the process by which the genocide occurred including the historical tensions between the hutus and tutsis the role of the belgian colonial experience in creating the rift and the process by which tensions among neighbors were heightened prior to the genocide the hutu ten commandments a series of laws passed to exclude tutsis from rwandan society were used to heighten paranoia among the hutus furthermore the power of the propaganda played a pivotal role in creating an environment of hatred and benaron masterfully weaves these broadcasts into her story the examples she provides become more induced with hatred as the genocide nears benaron's writing places you in the minds of her characters her cast of characters include hutus who later become genocidaires and to those who fought against the genocide tutsis who believed tensions would die down and americans who came in hopes of providing education and relief efforts to rwanda the author does a fine job of developing the mounting tensions among rwanda's citizens many tutsis and hutus believed that the tension would lessen and life would go back to normal however the tensions only grew and nearly one million people lost their lives in the span of one hundred days where was the international community in all this madness i would recommend this book to anyone who wants to learn about rwanda's genocide benaron's novel is very well researched and seeks to offer perspectives of both the perpetrators of the genocide and the victims although the genocide is quite difficult to understand benaron does not simplify the topic she does not paint a picture of life in rwanda as 'happily ever after ' in fact her characters question the presence of god as they deal with the aftermath of the genocide survivors must come to terms with the fact that they were abandoned by the international community while the topic itself is quite difficult to grapple this novel is one of the most engaging reads i have encountered lately i read this book in less than a week i would recommend this book to anyone who not only wants to learn more about rwanda's genocide but also wants to delve into how human relationships changed before during and after the genocide it is of no surprise that this book comes with such high accolades","620":"i really felt educated as i was reading this book not just about genocide but about the choices we make and the complexity of identity","621":"powerful fiction written as a memoir of before and after the 1994 genocide in rwanda","622":"my husband read this book and really liked it but forewarned me that this was not an uplifting happy sort of story the main character is jean patrick who grows up in rwanda loves to run and has a goal of running in the olympics someday unfortunately it is a time of great tension conflict and violence between the hutu and the tutsi jean patrick is a tutsi and the hutu are in power in rwanda despite the depressing events of this story i loved this book it's very well written and the characters become people you know and care about in addition i learned some history and culture of rwanda and admire the resilient spirit of these people whose country i have never set foot in","623":"story detailing the genocide in rwanda through the eyes of olympic athlete jean patrick a tutsi boy who is helped to achieve his goal by a hutu coach in the capital city gives great insight into a period of history which in my opinion is on a par with the holocaust where literally hundreds of whole villages were slaughtered a very human story in part tragic but also uplifting","624":"heartwrenching and powerful","625":"fiction story based around an olympic hopeful training in the midst of conflict between hutu and tutsi in rwanda great characters great story a great read","626":"this is a powerful beautiful book","627":"http wordnerdy blogspot com 2012 01","628":"it was amazing to see the area through the words","629":"phenomenal read a beautiful story despite the rwanda genocide horrors it recounts a great way to get to know a little more about this part of history and the world","630":"thoroughly enjoyed it","631":"narrative tone is just right it really captures the character's voice and made me feel like i was in africa i felt the dread and oppression and hopelessness of the rwandan violence as it affected all the characters' lives yet it wasn't too graphic which i was worried about and which will always make me put a book down","632":"i learned a lot from this book about rwanda and its civil wars and genocide but tucked into the historical aspect of the novel was a touching story about a runner trying to better himself for his family and ultimately the woman he loves hard to put down during the last 60 pages would definitely recommend for people who like true to life fiction","633":"interesting historical novel about rwanda in the early 1990s","634":"i truly enjoyed this book even though it took me forever to finish it was a very emotional read hopes and dreams clashing against war and death","635":"i highly recommend this book i knew a little about the rwandan genocide but this story made it real as when i watched hotel rwanda i was ashamed by the west's reaction or lack thereof","636":"great book","637":"i want to like this book so much more than i do it has all the components for greatness a tragic story laced with hope likable and fierce characters an honorable quest but i just couldn't get into it i had to read it a bit disjointed which could be why but the writing just didn't capture me","638":"i am so glad that i won this book through the goodreads giveaway tragedy hardly covers what happened in rwanda in the early 1990s and naomi benaron was able to capture not only the horror and heartbreak of the genocide but the daily life of young people living through the political upheaval and actual killings and the resilience and hope of the survivors she really captured jean patrick's journey from an innocent idealistic child to a young man dealing with the realities of a horrific political situation her writing is really gorgeous i wanted to stop every few pages to write down a quote i hadn't heard of the bellwether prize before reading this book but i am now eager to seek out other winners of the prize as well as more of benaron's work i highly recommend this book especially for those interested in issues of social justice","639":"naomi benaron's recent historical fiction is so well researched that i felt like i was reading nkuba jean patrick's story as a memoir of life in rwanda during the height of its terrifying genocide in the 1990s benaron paints a vivid picture of the landscape its people and their culture and life as experienced through the eyes of a talented young runner whose heart and optimism buoy him despite being born a tutsi the current minority ethnicity this novel was sweeping beautiful tragic and full of hope","640":"this fabulous book is a fictionalized account of the rwandan genocide it is evident the naomi benaron did a tremendous amount of research and that what her characters experience is based in what the unfortunate citizens of rwanda had to endure she keeps you interested through the very last page i was sorry when the book ended","641":"this book is divided into five sections and from those five section i love the first section the most why because in that section the main character jean patrick is still an innocent kid lots of questions come through his mind mostly about injustice and it really breaks my heart then in the rest of the section jean patrick grow to be a golden boy like harry potter he is being life's favourite creatures it seems like the world revolves around him and his life is worth more than anyone else i don't like this idea i think it is injustice but despite of the main character i think this book is okay i like it it tells us the dark history of rwandan genocide with a sad but not sadistic way using flashback style to describe all the killing is really shrink the size of pain and terror for the reader i don't know if it is a good thing or not but this way this book is suitable for younger reader","642":"this book is a novel written based on the genocide in rwanda in 1994 95 it is a reminder of the fear that people in parts of the world live in well written and touching","643":"the african proverb 'the pillar of the world is hope' is a powerful phrase that encompasses astounding truth while reading running the rift by naomi benaron the word 'hope' persistently resounded in my spirit like the pulse of a beating heart this four letter word for generations was apart of the inner compass of those that survived injustice genocide and enslavement author benaron was superb in capturing the power of hope as well as the enduring strength of a destroyed country by a heinous genocide spanning 14 years running the rift portrays the remarkable tale of a young male whose insatiable passion for running with dreams of competing in the olympics and his ferocious will to survive the rwandan diaspora leaps from the page and will become a part of your thoughts long after the conclusion of the book i have written an extensive review for i believed that anything less would not do this book any justice the main character jean patrick nkuba is one i will recall for a lifetime born in kigali the capital and largest city of rwanda he was raised in a family rich in love and endearment his household was not one that held the discriminative beliefs in the division of ethnical origins within rwanda his parents francois and jurida believed in unity of all rwandans regardless of identity t\"his father had always said that hutu and tutsi were one people living together in one country after jean patrick first uttered the words i am tutsi papa had asked \"what does that mean can you tell me how we are different \" in rwanda the differences were divided into two ethnical groups which consisted of the hutu and the tutsi the hutu were recognized as lighter complexioned appeared shorter and broader in physical stature and historically apart of the bantu tribe the tutsi are apart of the niolotic people and were identified by their darker complexioned skin and rather tall and sleek frames unknowingly these differences would prove as life and death during the surge of the rwandan genocide although tutsi jean patrick's parents were of respectable status in the city with his father being the owner and one of the educators at a secondary school named gihundwe gleefully surrounded by his siblings jean patrick spent his early years carefree he also breezed through primary school with an innate intellect that he inherited from his father jean patrick was especially close to his older brother roger who played a significant role in developing his interest in running from their frequent and friendly competitive relay races against each together as a young boy who admired his older brother's strength and agility jean patrick inhabited an inextinguishable ambition to one day beat his brother in a race which soon formed a passion for running that eventually proved life changing a sudden and life altering event occurs to the nkuba family and they are forced to move with jurida's brother emmanuel and his family in cyangugu rwanda initially hesitant jean patrick eventually forms a strong bond with his uncle and his cousins whom he looks upon as a father figure and extension of his siblings within a short span of time jean patrick earns a scholarship and is able to attend secondary school at gihundwe which causes him to leave his extended family t\"he remembered the morning he first arrived how he and roger had stood on the hillside above the compound and quipped about uncle's family how much this book of life changes he thought and we are not the ones to write the pages\" jean patrick soon becomes familiar with unforeseen changes in his life while a student at gihundwe jean patrick fuels his desire for running by joining the school track team where he learns the fundamentals of track and field and meets two lifelong friends daniel and isaka \"one shot\" during his tenure at gihundwe rebel soldiers known as rwandan patriotic front rpf attack rwanda and were identified as tutsi overnight all tutsi were looked upon as icyitso traitors being tutsi jean patrick's life was forever changed for bearing an unpopular identity however regardless of his ethnical origin jean patrick cultivated his talent of running and became a formidable competitor which landed him a track and field scholarship to university in butare rwanda while in butare for college jean patrick is faced with the hard core and relentless teaching methods from his hutu coach rutembeza who bared an unapologetically aggressive countenance towards others especially to those who were tutsi although jean patrick's life evolved around school work and a challenging track schedule he meets a stunningly beautiful girl who immediately catches his eye and his heart beatrice \"bea\" whose names means 'the blessed one' is presented to readers as a strong willed young woman with an immensely caring heart and a passion for fighting against injustice jean patrick soon discovers his coach's strong dislike for all tutsi through a warning given from roger who has abandoned his education at a university to join forces with the rpf despite being given a stern warning against his coach and concerning the upcoming war jean patrick embodies a stubborn disposition which he eventually regrets during the climax of the book when the upheaval of the genocide occurs t\"only death is hungry now urupfu rurarya ntiruhaga death eats and is never full\" running the rift is a well crafted novel that is written with a finely detailed and intricate literary prose author naomi benaron shows remarkable knowledge of the rwandan culture and language by painting a vivid picture of the spirit of the country she brilliantly captures the pulse of rwanda by including the kinyarwanda language as well as the rwandan cuisine and music which provides the audience with an enthralling reading experience i have never been to rwanda however while reading the book i could feel the dense earth under my feet while reading about jean patrick during his runs both off and on the track i could distinctly smell the acrid aroma of rwandan cuisines of brochettes meat on a stick umutoke plantains and ugali corn flour mash i could also envision the sun setting above the beautiful landscapes in kigali i am not one to become emotional while reading a book however i felt a connection to the characters during the horrific scenes of the genocide there are an array of characters and events that i did not highlight in this review however i highly suggest this book to others to experience this auspicious debut novel","644":"excellent they story of the rwandan genocide told by a young man john patrick nkuba training to run in the 800 meters in the olympics he is tutsi and finds life more and more difficult because of the hutu's in power","645":"this book had me in tears at the end fiction yes but a heartwrenching account of something we know did happen and it is so tragic and bittersweet benaron's facility with language really caught me off guard sometimes i really enjoyed this book","646":"beautifully told story of an olympic caliber runner who got caught up in the ethnic wars in rwanda john patrick was a carefully drawn character who had his own dreams and talents but no easy path to fulfill them the realistic portrayal of the brutal genocides in rwanda caught you as a reader in its terrifying web whether you were hutsu or tutsi made all the difference families divided murdered reunited my only complaint was that i thought too many characters were introduced i had trouble keeping them all straight i thought the ending was extremely well crafted i found myself slowing down so that it wouldn't end before i was ready","647":"a fictional yet vivid and heart rending portrayal of events surrounding the 1994 genocide in rwanda wonderful character development and a good study in the absurdities of racism but also an enjoyable fascinating read","648":"liked this one very sad topic pg 279 states the sad truth rwanda had no oil or strategic interest no diamond or gold therefore other countries don't step in to stop the genocide","649":"not normally my cup of tea a fictional account of the hutu tutsi tensions in rwanda and the genocide that occurred there i kept with it because i felt it was important to read about that piece of history not so long ago really but history nonetheless the characters were well rounded and i felt like i walked that journey with them felt a bit more like non fiction than i normally like which is why only 2 stars","650":"this is one powerful story it's about a young boy named jean patrick and his coming of age story also his dreams to become a great runner it's also a story about the rwanda genocide which breaks my heart i actually was very ignorant about what went down during that time of horrific acts of death this story taught me much about loving and how bad people can hate each other the story is remarkable and the is country beautiful and the writer tells it with such elegance in a time so filled with ugliness she shows us complete beauty she is a great author and i did enjoy the book","651":"i keep going back and forth whether or not to give this book three or four stars i have read several nonfiction books on the rwandan genocide and i feel like that is getting in the way of my ability to evaluate this book as a work of fiction in my opinion the book reads a little dryly the author tries to situate a fictional story within an accurate historical setting and in my opinion this makes all of the characters a little on dimensional i think that it is hard to write fictional characters when the real stories of what happened to people in the genocide is so compelling everything in this book feels a little to forced nonetheless i really enjoyed reading this book but that could also be because i have spent so much time studying the rwandan genocide that i am compelled by the subject and not the book itself i like the main character in the book jean patrick but it is weird to remind yourself that this story is fictional because there are plenty of real people who actually suffered in the way that jean patrick did i don't know i guess i still come down on the idea that nonfiction books about the real people who suffered through the rwandan genocide are better than fictionalized accounts good fiction writing can't substitute for real emotions feelings and events as actually lived","652":"i was completely disappointed in benaron's account of the rwandan genocide i had heard such great things about this novel and i guess if you think the kite runner is a great piece of literature than you would find this to be compelling as well unfortunately i thought she dealt with a haunting subject not by capturing the human horror of it all but by utterly spoiling her intent by creating a story filled with unlikely occurrence after unlikely occurrence add in totally shallow character development and prose that was nothing more than meh and i say you can take a pass on this one","653":"i really am at a loss as to what to write here there were certainly parts of this book i enjoyed that said there were parts equally sweet endearing horrifying inspirational and profoundly sad emotional roller coaster is a bit of a cliche but the last 1 3 of the book was vastly different in tone to the first 2 3 but when the story is set against the backdrop of a genocide i suppose that is inevitable i was intrigued by the idea of an elite athlete attempting to make a national team amidst cultural rifts the concept of jean patrick being the face of hope for a nation through sport was interesting and inspiring but the over arching corruption greed and hate managed to stifle the athletic component of the book luckily the author manages to weave glimmers of hope throughout the novel and often uses running as the theme to fall back on to do it really not sure why i didn't like this book all that much i truly thought and hoped i would like it more perhaps i should re visit parts of it some time to give it another chance","654":"i don't give 5 stars to very many books but i really loved this one it evoked africa and rwanda so beautifully and painfully at times i felt like i was there the language was astonishingly lyrical such a pleasure to read despite the unhappy content i cannot believe this writer is not rwandan during the first two thirds of the book i felt an uneasy sense of foreshadowing readers know what is coming to jean patrick's world but he doesn't finally it all begins to happen the things we know from history did happen and then i just felt guilty instead guilt and disbelief that events like the ones in this novel happened in my lifetime i don't think i paid any attention at all when it was actually taking place obviously that's part of the terrible history that no one anywhere in the world paid as much attention as they should have and yet my guilt remains i was an adult in my 20s did i even read the newspaper articles even now all these years later until i picked up the book all i could have told you about rwanda was that there was a genocide i knew there were two tribes hutu and tutsi but i wouldn't have been able to tell you which was the one that nearly eradicated the other shameful a beautiful touching wonderful painful book","655":"excellent expose about the rwandan genocide educational u0026amp sad very well written i really enjoyed this book","656":"this book based in rwanda took me a while to get into i know the history of rwanda but only to a limited extent so it was interesting to read a fictional story about a character with the genocide as a backdrop i liked that it spanned for most of the character's life but found it sometimes difficult to push myself to want to read further my main problem was when they would speak in african based languages because i could never remember what the names or words referred to even though they had been previously mentioned anyway it was a pretty good book with a strong storyline that i would recommend to people who like historical fiction africa or want to read more about rwanda without actually reading about rwanda","657":"good story about the rwandan civil war genocide and running jean patrick wants to be an olympic athlete but his dreams are stalled by the rwandan civil war where his ethnicity tutsi is being hunted by the hutus it's a good look at a part of history that the us and the rest of the world basically ignored and thankfully it has a happy ending","658":"story of resilience","659":"the rwandan genocide erupted in april of 1994 and within three months somewhere between 500 000 to 1 million people were killed two things seems especially astounding about this first the rapidity of the killing it meant that killing had to be a national task second after almost 18 years how can we still not know how many people were killed most accounts now say 800 000 in partial answer to the second point there clearly is still a great deal of disagreement on many key issues who shot down habyarimana's plane why did neighbors kill neighbors and always how many people died benaron is especially skilled at skirting most of these issues she weaves the uncertainty into her book and uses it as a way to establish the general context of unrest that must have existed at the time she also makes excellent use of pieces of reality for example there really was a felicien gatabazi who was assassinated and benaron extends a very brief but well deserved homage to alison des forges one of the early voices who described the genocide another thing that i admire about her handling of the issue is her resisting any temptation to be too graphic by definition genocide is a horrific act benaron acknowledges this but does not focus her narrative on it instead the focus is on uncertainty characters are multi dimensional coach is an excellent example of this as is daniel rumors abound and jean patrick the main character often fails to put pieces of the puzzle together this is how benaron uses the ongoing debate over what happened as motivation all in all an excellent book there are only two things that i wish had been slightly different although i think benaron had sound reasons for making them work the way they did first jonathan for me is a metaphor for not only american inaction but western inaction in general he's amiable enough and he respects rwanda but in the end i wasn't convinced that he would risk his life america chose to leave quite early the american embassy was emptied by april 7 one day after the plane was shot down scott straus argues that western intervention could have made a major difference but only in the very early days of the genocide but of course jonathan is benaron's character and perhaps he was never intended to be that metaphor second there is that lingering question of why neighbor would turn against neighbor this is most awkward when jonathon meets valerie on the deserted campus soon after the violence has begun he remembers her from a jovial night with friends but when he sees her this time it's as if he has met a zombie this was truly the mental picture i formed without any apparent emotion she tells him that he also deserves to die but without at least hinting at some of the motivation this makes no sense scott straus 'the order of genocide' 2006 went beyond our assumptions of motivation interviewing genocidaires especially those in rural areas this doesn't do his argument justice at all but in general he found that for the majority of people radio rtlm wasn't a motivating factor nor did they hate or even dislike their tutsi neighbors what motivated them it was the genuine fear that the rpf had shot down the president's plane coupled with the war that had been going on since 1990 benaron includes roger as a member of the rpf which helps us to follow their movements to some degree but she does not illustrate the general sense of fear that the hutu had about the war this meant that when the extremists in power decided to use genocide as a weapon in order to maintain that power the population was ready straus also makes a convincing argument that it was the rpf who shot down the plane just imagine in what ways that changes what we think we know the narrative of the genocide is still being fought over for political and other reasons this is why we don't know more answers but westerners should be more aware of the way in which the genocide was a match which lit a world war in the congo zaire and benaron's book so well written should entice readers to want to know more","660":"i didn't know much about the genocide in rwanda but as i was reading the book the movie hotel rwanda came back to me in bits and pieces such horror these people had to survive or not jean patrick's character is complex yet naive which i found so frustrating he just refused to see the hate spreading around him so focused he was on his olympic dream solid characters that you can really feel for and a story that everyone should be somewhat familiar with","661":"won this book in a goodreads giveaway","662":"a really captivating and sad book about rwanda","663":"the window into rwanda in the late in 20th century makes this book worth reading it happens to be very well written too i highly recommend it","664":"pretty good","665":"i wanted this book to be better than it was worth reading for rwanda or burundi history people perspective but the writing is average","666":"stilted prose and dialog felt like important parts of the story were missing","667":"i really liked this book even though it is so depressing it is the story of a young boy in rwanda who is a gifted runner and is hoping to run in the olympics it is a novel and is well written i have a hard time undstanding how neighbors and good friends could turn on each other so quickly and violently","668":"although excited to read this book i was left disappointed somehow it felt like a soup that hadn't simmered long enough the flavor of the story was underdeveloped making characters and plot lines feel rushed and insipid","669":"beautiful and haunting","670":"i liked the beginning and the end but there was a lot of middle that dragged on and on for me the story was interesting and made me want to learn more but like i said the middle was slow","671":"i've read this twice","672":"my review free o' spoilers this book took me back to things fall apart by chinua achebe my first foray into african literature benaron really captures the landscape of rwanda as a reader you can see how the turbulent violent political upheaval contrasts with the beautiful majestic countryside jean patrick is a wonderful protagonist and benaron allows us to see rwanda through his eyes shifting from an apolitical olympic hopeful benaron's writing is both beautiful and compelling and she conveys a wealth of perspectives it's no wonder the novel won the bellwether prize for fiction the bottom line a deep engaging read with a lingering presence","673":"i really enjoyed this story the main characters are very well written the only problem i had is that there is a lot of characters so i had some trouble keeping everyone straight","674":"i'm not quite sure why my expectations were so high i think i was expecting cutting for stone meets tell the wolves i'm home but i was pretty bored throughout most of this book characters didn't feel real or compelling to me i guess i'm glad i stuck with it because i hate the feeling of not finishing and it did pick up a little bit in the last hundred or so pages glad to be finished","675":"i think i've just found another mentor benaron paired a well crafted romance and sports story within the context of the rwandan genocide and while the threat of genocide hangs over every sentence she counterbalances that threat with a tender portrayal of setting and culture through the character of 800m runner jean patrick nkuba our awareness of the impending genocide grows with nkuba as he ages from primary to secondary school and eventually to university he discovers his passion for running and this drive pushes him over and around some of the darkness that envelops his classmates and family members more quickly but eventually he cannot outrun the storm because it is fiction benaron has the option of creating a happy ending but even there she tempers that temptation with reality in a way that challenges the reader and her characters having worked briefly in rwanda it is additionally pleasing to recognize the kinyarwanda phrases and other cultural references that she has woven into the dialogue it is readily apparent that benaron took her time to get the details right even though it was only fiction this should not only be respected but admired this is a book going on my motivation to keep writing shelf she explains her commitment to social responsibility in this essay http naomibenaron com essays fictio","676":"excellent writing and view of rwanda through the eyes of an 800m runner this book was special warm and tragic all in the same it reads like a non fiction story or memoir","677":"amazing book full of hope and love in spite of the violence of rwanda's civil war","678":"while at times i felt i got lost in the details of the descriptions of dirt plants birds etc i later realized it all made up the patchwork of the most beautiful excruciating devastating quilt that represents the recent history of rwanda a beautiful terrible book all in one for anyone who loves running present company not included there is an added element of the protagonist being this amazingly gifted runner preparing for the olympics at the time that his country is on the brink or exploding","679":"it was extremely slow until the last 60 pages which kinda sucked i didn't really feel to attached to the characters and i feel that she could have described rwanda better i couldn't really visualize the setting that great it wasn't a book that i couldn't wait to pick up again and for that reason i gave it a 3","680":"a great story of tragedy spoken with a clear voice a voice that captures the beauty of a ravaged land a motivating story for myself reminding me that i have no excuse not to run and so i do","681":"this story has the potential to be 4 or 5 stars but the writing is stunted and drags a lot if it wasn't on the wannabee list i don't think i would have finished it i don't see students finishing it either","682":"running the riftby naomi benaron5 starspp 373there are two things about running the rift that drew me to it like a magnet it is a coming of age book which i dearly love reading and it is set in a country which was about to implode rwanda in this instance the orphan master's son by adam johnson and a constellation of vital phenomena by anthony marra were both highly rated by me while i don't see naomi benaron writing and execution of the plot on the level of either johnson's or marra's it is a book worthy of a 5 star rating and deserving of the bellwether prize for fiction tensions between rwanda's hutu and tutsi people are escalating during young jean patrick nkuba's life jean patrick is a serious young man who hopes use his skill as a runner to protect himself and his family benaron deftly shows how the tensions within the country escalate and its effect on the daily life of the people of the country the reader cannot help bot feel fearful for jean patrick and his family this was a book which i couldn't put down i really enjoyed the main character and look forward to reading more by naomi benaron i recommend this book with the warning that there are unsettling aspects in it and parts where a strong stomach is necessary","683":"while the subject matter could have been interesting i felt the novel was too long and rather repetitive the characters did not come alive for me i read this for a reading group and it will be interesting to see the discussion it generates","684":"a good book if a bit yeomanlike i didn't like it as much as we wish to inform you that tomorrow we will be killed with out families but i still think the book adds a valuable chapter to those trying to understand how the people of a nation could commit genocide against their own countrymen","685":"after i read this i googled memorial sites which was horrifying i still have a very difficult time comprehending that this actually happened unfathomable","686":"one of the most heartfelt culturally impacting books i've read this year harrowing the 1994 genocide in rwanda brutally so without question benaron doesn't sugarcoat or make light of the divisional hate driven civil unrest between the hutu and tutsi or the climatic terminating massacre of approximately 800 000 tutsi however this most excellent novel shines the brightest spotlight upon the god fearing peaceful hard working ever hopeful jean patrick who dreams only of becoming an eight hundred meter olympian runner against all odds the writing is crisp flawless humble yet extravagantly rich in substance and texture hopeful and long lingering 'running the rift' is a masterful gem","687":"many americans know little to nothing about the rwandan genocide that occurred over a few months in 1994 naomi benaron's novel \"running the rift \" does little to shed light on the historical economic and political factors that led rwandan hutus to kill 500 000 to 1 million tutsis and those sympathetic to them instead the book humanizes the conflict we are introduced and follow complex characters through a heart rending story the books protagonist is jean patrick nkuba a tutsi who strives to become an olympic runner in the 800 meters and perhaps even the first rwandan to earn a medal the book begins roughly a decade before rwanda's president is assassinated the event that catalyzed the killings jean patrick is a happy go lucky kid trying to understand the chaotic events he sees often applying the scientific principles he has read in his late father's journal or was taught in school one of those principles is \"a body in motion remains in motion \" by using that particular reference and similar ones we the reader gain an air of inevitability to the events despite this jean patrick and the other characters still have hope the united states or other western nations will step in and prevent the violence however we know better nothing is done while this story is set against the build up to the genocide in rwanda it's very much the story of an individual rather than the conflict itself parts are very difficult to read but there is a sense of hope as well it's a very powerful story engrossing to read and hard to forget","688":"i enjoyed this book although the relationship aspect seemed to overpower the hutu tutsi conflict i felt the main character kept blinders on throughout the novel it's definitely worth reading","689":"a moving book that follows a young tutsi in rwanda during the years leading up to and after the genocide a runner this boy grows into a young man at the university developing his skills as a runner while his understanding of the growing threat to all tutsis like him develops as well this was a well paced book with some strong character development and significant themes","690":"41 2 stars great book","691":"i absolutely love this book which follows the progress of jean patrick nkuba from the day he knows that running will be his life to the moment he must run to save his life a naturally gifted athlete he sprints over the thousand hills of rwanda and dreams of becoming his country's first olympic medal winner in track but in seems like as fast as jean patrick can run a lap around the track his world has violently changed jean patrick is a tutsi in a world that has become increasingly restrictive and violent for his people this is the story of jean patrick's narrow escape from the hutu rebel government and his journey in creating a new life in america knowing he is the sole survivor of his family and possibly his village i listened to this book on audio and the narration was beautiful","692":"well written moving novel of a genocide survivor","693":"such a great story that could have devolved into sentimentality","694":"absolutely loved this book there was obviously tons of research put into the historical accuracy of the story i didn't know much about the rwandan genocide before reading this but i feel like it gave me a really helpful and humanizing background the writing is beautiful and the characters are well developed","695":"loved this book","696":"superb telling of the genocide in rwanda through a young man who just wants to run for his country","697":"teton co call no f benaron n currently on the new bookshelf cayla's rating 4 stars a genocide is a poisonous bush that grows not from two or three roots but from a whole tangle that has moldered underground without anyone noticing ~claudine genocide survivorquoting from another book naomi benaron begins her own novel about a young boy who comes of age during the years leading up to the rwandan genocide of the mid 1990s jean patrick nkuba grows up with a dream of running in the olympics for his country and slowly realizes that his dream will be more difficult than simply having the fastest times on the track he along with the people he cares about the most must face bigotry and injustice from their closest neighbors as they try to live out their lives with some sense of normalcy don't let this negativity make you run the other direction from this book though jean patrick's seemingly endless store of hope is infectious even in the bleakest of moments he can find it in himself to believe that there is some good and sanity in his world that has gone mad the quote above without anyone noticing says a lot about how much i knew about rwanda and it's turbulent history not much i will most definitely be doing some more reading on this subject","698":"humbling heart wrenching and inspirational human strength and love works miracles","699":"i knew naomi from my mfa program at antioch university and was impressed with her personal style demeanor commitment passion all that impressed me about her in person came through in her book as well i was a bit wary about picking up a book recounting the rwandan genocide but naomi gets us so thoroughly into the heart of the main character and others besides before the violence begins that she creates a meaningful separation from the inhumanity and keeps us focused on the beautiful humanity of rwanda instead it's a coming of age story a love story a story of ambition set in a crazy awful time","700":"it took a long time for me to be brave enough to read this book because i knew it was not going to have an easy happy ending and i was right anything less than heart wrenching and painful would have done a grave injustice to the people who lived the reality of the actual events that said this is a well written story of the rwandan genocide and although there is tragedy there is also strength and even hope","701":"well written another kingsolver prize winner moving story and though you know the story of rwanda you probably do not know it like this must read for anyone who enjoys books that move us and make us more aware of how important not letting hate get the better of us is to world peace","702":"the beginning of the book was fairly slow paced but as you continue through the narrative you can understand why the book encompasses a large span of time in jean patrick's life without understanding his childhood it would be harder to appreciate what he goes through as he grows older the book was beautifully written and extremely inspiring","703":"the book was very interesting but all the way through it you kind of knew or dreaded what was to come still i thought the author took care to tie up loose ends and bring the book to a very satisfying end","704":"constantly people ask themselves why genocide has occurred and what they could have done to stop it if you read this book some of the answers might be found this story parallels history in a very uncomfortable way there is romance terror compassion ambition and yes despair rwanda has been painted so clearly i was almost there everyone should read this book","705":"a creative and artful approach to telling the horrific story of the genocide centering the story on a young boy as he grows up the reader has a sense of how rwanda got to the boiling point as much of a sense as anyone can possibly have and at the same time does not so directly confront the atrocities head on as in we wish to inform you well done and worth a read","706":"this book sucks you in and keeps the suspense building in a beautiful arc i loved every minute of reading it there were a few moments where it was not really believable to me based on my experience in east africa it was apparent that this was not an african author but the strong narrative allowed me to believe the story the ending was not my favorite part of the book but it was satisfying","707":"great book face paced gives such good insight into the problems in this area","708":"a powerful story about a rwandan boy who goes from chasing his olympic dream in track to being chased down by party extremists during the rwanda genocide in the 1990's the author does a remarkable job of describing the rwandan culture and the underlying themes of love community devotion to family forgiveness and redemption are beautiful amidst the extreme tragedy","709":"beautiful fearless and heartbreaking","710":"i found this story quite powerful in its telling of man's inhumanity to man neighbors killing neighbors just because one is from a different tribe as based on some meaurement of arm or leg or nose but this still continues in our world the character of jeam patrick left much to be desired he really had a one track mind to make the olympics roger seemed more realistic maybe that's how one would react if one had so little and was reaching for more better life","711":"testimonies historians novels movies documentaries and especially the distance of time have all given us all a limited appreciation of the horrors of the holocaust not being survivors how could we ever fully understand what it was like what about the more recent holocausts and genocides who is telling those stories who is attempting to make us more aware more understanding and more outraged about these atrocities one person is first time novelist naomibenaron in her bellwether prize winning book running the rift running the rift is the story of the rwandan genocide as seen through the eyes of a young athlete according to various human rights watchdog organizations an estimated 800 000 people were murdered during the rwandan genocide over the course of a year to say the least that is a daunting event to try and capture on paper it is 1985 and jean patrick nkuba is a young boy as running the rift begins his life has been happy he is part of a large close knit family his father is a respected teacher he is a gifted record breaking middle distance runner and dreams of going to the olympics jean patrick doesn't know this yet but there is a shadow already hanging over his life the nkuba are tutsi this heritage will put his family on a collision course with horror the sudden death of jean patrick's father coincides with the beginning of the hutus governments' more overt restrictions on the tutsis and the stepping up of resistance to the government by the rwandan patriotic force rpf a tutsi led rebel army over the course of the next ten years a civil war will tear away the nkubas security and their future one by one friends employers and neighbors turn away from the family because of their ethnicity jean patrick becomes a political pawn when the government wants to use him as a human rights poster child as the government sanctioned genocide accelerates not only is jean patrick's dreams of representing his country in the olympics on the failure track but as a tutsi his life is also endangered running the rift is an impressive novel benaron has done an incredible job of tracking the origins of the government approved interracial strife in rwanda and its drastic hastening into a holocaust in a situation where there is a crystal clear right and wrong she does not take the easy road and use cardboard characters to push her story forward and expose the villainy instead benaron allows us to experience jean patrick's journey from innocence to inhumanity to hope with his and every other character's flaws and strengths as they are tested the juxtaposition of this beautiful country and the citizens who strive for the betterment of their country and the other citizens who either participated in the genocide or looked the other way makes for a powerful story and naomi benaron captures it all","712":" i suppose if you read a lot of books centered on the 90's genocide in rwanda you would find a new and interesting perspective in this book the protagonist is not political opting for more of a head in the sand approach yet is surrounded by characters who are i kept waiting for him to wake up the way it was written it's almost like he never did even when he was bloodied and near death what did he do he just kept running it's popular to say that we each are obligated to fight the wrongs of the world apathy is how evil succeeds this book challenged that thinking is it any less noble to stay single minded in one's pursuit in the face of overwhelming injustice to show them that you won't give in won't give up that just doing what you've always done is the way to persevere an alternate perspective challenging popular beliefs happy ending these are things this book had going for it unfortunately it's rambling plot repetitive imagery and an interesting lack of passion given the setting ultimately equaled a 2 star it was okay rating for me bottom line i'm glad i read it if only to get a more firsthand account of the time but i wouldn't recommend it to anyone other than those specifically interested in that particular war and its experiences","713":"well written of an event that the rest of the world ignored","714":"this was a powerful story with wonderful characters and i loved all the rwandan history and mythology it did feel a bit abrupt at times though and it was painful to know what was coming once the chapter headings said 1994 an impressive debut overall and i can see why it won barbara kingsolver's literary prize","715":"a must read this is the story of a rwandan family before during and after the war in that country it is not just a tale of war however it is also a love story and this thread makes the atrocities being inflicted by one group on another seem that much more incomprehensible and senseless winner of the bellweather prize given by barbara kingsolver","716":"a very sad story of how hate of others consider less than can morph into unbelievable evil not for the faint of heart","717":"this book taught me so much about the genocide that took place in rawanda between the hutu and the tutsis for this reason i am giving it 4 stars but it needs a good editing too long in many places causing the story to slow and become bogged down the main character is an olympic hopeful in track who is anything but slow there is one scene that will forever haunt me between jean patrick and his coach i will not discuss it here for fear of giving away the story but suffice it to say that the image will come to me in nightmares","718":"naomi benaron takes on the formidable challenge of capturing the point of view of a character from a different culture and gender this is no small feat and by and large i got pulled into and convinced by the protagonist jean patrick i was also impressed by her pacing some other reviewers commented on how slowly the first two thirds felt but to me it felt as if the writer were pacing her readers so they could finish the race i consistently felt pulled along by the plot we need to learn about jean patrick's life and character--and the characters around him--in order to better understand everyone's fate in the end besides a novel is a marathon not a sprint ironically whereas benaron seems to have a natural aptitude for pacing her writing her character has trouble doing this as a racer this book is by no means a light read--but it's a very worthwhile one","719":"a heartbreaking yet beautiful portrayal of an olympic hopeful coming of age in rwanda before during and after the genocide","720":"interesting story but i agree with another reviewer it reads too much like a typing adult book","721":"i just finished reading this book it has great connections to africa and understanding the genocide in rwanda it combines the story of an olympic hopeful and his life and family struggles in the middle of the horrible conflict between the hutu and tutsi tribes","722":"a remarkable story set around the rwanda genocide the main character is a tutsi olympic hopeful he struggles to train and prepare for the 800 meter amidst the prejudice hatred and political turmoil in rwanda the war turns his friends his coach shopkeepers and farmers into ruthless killers despite the horror it does have a happy ending","723":"a little strange to read fiction about the rwandan genocide by someone not from that culture but the story was ok i liked the idea of the main character as an olympic hopeful but i wasn't really impressed by the story line some parts seemed a bit more developed than others and i thought running the rift wrapped up a little too neatly at the end with jean patrick coming to america and then finding his long lost first love bea alive in rwanda after several years missing","724":"the book is excellent because it describes genocide in an understandable way by personalizing it through its characters and it has a happy ending more or less","725":"the rwandan genocide in the hands of this author reads mostly peripherally a good technique i think for something so horrific the central character john patrick nkuba is a young tutsi in a world on the brink of atrocity and horror smart as a whip and as fast as the wind he has the makings of an olympic star in spite of his tutsi status in an ever threatening hutu world he's allowed to live and train even to the point of being received by the country's president sadly this apparent goodwill masks shrewdly devised propaganda they are using him to present a false front of peace and unity to the world eventually john patrick's entire life comes crashing down and all he holds dear is forever destroyed a story of human resilience in the face of the worst of human barbarism this is a compelling read the reason i only gave it three stars is because here and there in the text the author diluted the storyline with too many sub plotlines which petered out and went nowhere at those points the story totally lost its power most unfortunate","726":"i loved this book it was full of hope even in the midst of all the horrible things that happened during the rwandan genocide one of the best books i've read in awhile","727":"this book is an incredible read it would be five stars if the end struck me as a little contrived compared with the rest of the book even though it was a welcome change from the horrors that preceded it it follows the childhood and young adulthood of nkuba jean patrick a talented runner against the growing unrest and then the genocide in rwanda in the early to mid 1990s unlike some novels that attempt to educate about a particular horror though this novel explores the conflict between the tutsi and hutu from more than one angle and gives a lot of attention to jean patrick's struggle to attain greatness in running versus his feelings of obligation to his family and his tutsi ties it was particularly refreshing to find so many strong female characters in a book focusing on a young man the descriptions of violence are difficult to read but i highly recommend this book to anyone interested in africa in the rwandan genocide in particular to runners and to anyone who wants to continue to broaden their world view","728":"intense graphic heartwrenching","729":"this is a total divergence from most of the books i've read recently that and the bellwether prize for socially engaged fiction that naomi benaron won are what appealed to me the plot moves somewhat slowly at times but once the reality of the political upheaval and rwandan massacre enter the story it becomes a frightening story of survival","730":"great book regarding the rewandan genocide and a person's love for running","731":"grew to love the main character in this book and felt that it's an important story","732":"last week i was trying not to guffaw in public and this week i was trying not to cry this book is a beautiful love story of country running and family it's not the strongest 5 stars i've given but i was swayed by the running the setting and the connection to real life that's so shocking and sad the main character seems like someone i'd want to know and i appreciated his struggle","733":"a slight book given the gravity of the subject felt more like a ya joint","734":"i admit that the fact that this book won a prize for socially engaged fiction initially turned me off i was worried this meant it would be a good for you book rather than a good to read book worry not it is an engaging read with excellent characters the main character is in training for the 800m race at the olympics the portions of the book covering his running and life as a tutsi athlete were interesting even for a non runner the lessons he learns as a runner endurance pacing how to use strategy all carry over into his daily life as well books like this one where you already know the ending the rwandan genocide have a difficult task because the reader is always waiting for those events to begin the genocide takes up a very small portion of this book close to the end what this book does well is to cover the little indignities the tensions the brushed aside events that lead up to the genocide at the end you understand how the country was ready to explode but also how people were able to ignore the warning signs and hope pretend pray that everything was going to be fine philip gourevitch's book we wish to inform you that tomorrow we will be killed with our families still remains hands down the best non fiction book about rwanda","735":"many of my favorite books take a true event in history recent or decent past and explain via fictional characters i always feel like i learn so much more much like watching people at a train station or an airport everyone has a story that is based in non fiction this is one of those favorite books i've read a lot about rwanda even as it was really taking place and being angry with the clinton administration for not doing anything and i've seen hotel rwanda and other films about the massacre and genocide all very poignant this book ranks with all of them and there were moments when i had to put it aside to weep for the characters and the inhumanity of the human race i think this book provided history actual events people who were trying to make hinder the change and insight into the real events and it made me think about what would we americans do if we are ever faced with such events where we have to leave everything behind where our world would be turned upside down and you had to just run to save your life makes you think and appreciate what we have even more","736":"i read this book over a year ago and loved it it is about the genocide in rwanda but it is much more about life and love than it is about death this is a beautiful and important book","737":"beautiful story charachters that i can't get out of my mind i love the strong family bonds and love for life that the rwandan people have despite the nightmare they live through","738":"i read the dog stars just prior to this one while both excellent books taken together they have made me lose all faith in humanity i can't imagine the senseless killing is possible but knowing the little bit i do know of events in rwanda it is sadly possible this book should be required reading for every american now on to something a little lighter","739":"wonderful book highly recommend reading rwanda and genocide might turn some off but it is much more family friendship running dreams love","740":"keywords hutu tutsi rwanda rfp a runner with an olympic dream form the story a lady love enters the picture towards the end passable read","741":"i rate this 5 stars as the author provides a fictional account of a male rwandan tutsi youth who wants to be an 800m olympic runner covering the period leading up to and after the rwandan genocide so the story required a heap of research on a variety of topics covering race culture military arms athletic training religion within the historical facts of the rwandan nation the melding of these aspects the combination of a love story and a plot that simmers to the known outcome makes this a great story of a truly tragic tale","742":"i still don't really know how i feel about this book it was good it was heart wrenching and it is certainly a story that should be told for as many books as i've read on the holocaust i've never read anything about the rwanda genocide until now it's just so sad and depressing to see people fighting about skin color or nationality or ethnicity or tribal name or any number of other differences that keep us apart when in reality we are the same people it's a vivid picture of humanity at it's worse but also many moments of humanity at it's best too always entangled together despair and fear hope and faith","743":"an incredibly moving book i have seen the movie hotel rwanda but nothing prepared me for this fictional telling of the 1994 genocide and the events leading up to it jean patrick was a very authentic narrator it also made you feel disgusted about the lack of action from the un and the north american and european countries during such a tragedy","744":"this is a powerful story about life in rwanda leading up to and through the genocide of the '90s there were more pages dedicated to training main character is a runner with olympic potential than i appreciated but perhaps they helped to create reinforce the normalcy of daily life in juxtaposition to the atrocities to follow stressful to read but important to know about","745":"this book takes place during the genocide in rwanda it is told through the eyes of a young man training for the olympics the author captures the beauty of the country and culture while depicting the horror of the time","746":"engaging fiction about the very real genocide in rwanda attempts to illustrate how quickly this conflict become unstoppable and the human instinct to thrive despite great odds","747":"the story of a boy during the rwanda genocide depressing of course somehow i didn't feel very connected to the characters and didn't think the story moved along enough to keep my attention","748":"i was expecting to be blown away by this book when i saw the goodreads rating what happened in rwanda is an important and horrifying story but i felt the characters were not that interesting and the plot fumbled along","749":"i haven't read too many books with african settings and themes but when i do i always feel guilty that i don't know more than i do about the events that form the backdrop of the story i knew there was a civil war in rwanda and a genocide of one group by another but the details were and still are fuzzy even after reading running the rift by naomi benaron many of those details are still fuzzy and perhaps that is the point benaron isn't trying to make an argument she is just trying to point out the fears and choices that people made while trying to navigate the prelude to the horrors of the 100 days of the genocide of tutsi by hutu extremists as her main characters she uses jean patrick a tutsi who is training for the 1996 olympics his family and the moderate hutus that he befriends during the story we see the kind of attitudes that hutu had for the tutsi and because we know the ultimate outcome for about 70% of the tutsi population the suspense is wondering if jean patick and his family and friends will survive without giving away any of the ending benaron does leave us with some positive hope that rwanda has and can continue to survive one of the most gruesome events of human history","750":"at the time it occurred i was not intimately aware of the details of the day to day atrocities of the civil war between the tutsis and the hutu in rwanda while this book is fiction the author at the end in her qu0026amp a discussion speaks to the ability to offer this up as fiction and why it works first she approaches it from her strength as a writer of fiction yet she is able to capture the non fiction events of the country's civil war she talks about softening the edges of the brutalities if only to keep the reader engaged and continue on to really learn what happened i agree that had she written this as 100% non fiction what were already very tough passages to read throughout the book it might have prevented me and other readers from finishing it even in war time such as this individuals such as the main character jean patrick hold on to a dream for jean patrick it is his childhood dream he seeks to rise above all of what is happening in his native rwanda so he can run in the olympics amazing story of the rwandan people if you are a runner you will enjoy the continuous thread of his innate desire to run","751":"spectacular gripping horrifying","752":"i liked this story but it seemed to take me forever to get through relationships that the author spent so much time developing didn't seem to finish with the same care and as tragic as the situation in rawanda was is the ending was predictable and i am not talking about the genecide but it was still a good read to help you imagine what the tutsi went through","753":"in running the rift naomi benaron writes about jean patrick nkuba a young man who comes of age in the spring of 1994 during the rwandan genocide benaron begins with jean patrick's early childhood as he races with his older brother roger excelling in footraces he begins to dream of becoming an olympic champion especially after the olympic runner telesphore dusabe visits his school telesphore tells jean patrick someday you will need to run as much as you need to breath throughout the novel benaron immerses the reader in the political and cultural climate of rwanda after jean patrick's father is killed in a car accident some boys threw rocks through the windows of their home shouting tutsi snakes benaron writes before his first day in primary school jean patrick had not known what tutsi meant when the teacher said all tutsi stand jean patrick did not know that he was to rise from his seat and be counted and say his name jean patrick's father had been progressive a teacher and felt that all people were equal regardless or background or race so jean patrick comes to the knowledge slowly that being 'tutsi' is not always a good thing and more often than not is grounds for shaming or physical abuse beanaron creates a loving cast of characters the secondary characters are rich and complex the landscape is also beautifully described a character in the story as well benaron's prose is descriptive as well as poetic at times just like the colorful people that live within her story the poetic images she conjures move at will across the screen of the reader's mind here is a gorgeous passage they had walked a short distance when the sky ruptured thunder and lightning simultaneous the bark on the eucalyptus exploded shreds flying into the air the force knocked them to the ground smoke rose from the tree and jean patrick's skull rang like a struck bell roger lay on his back knapsack twisted to the side are you all right jean patrick's tongue was thick in his mouth he touched roger's shoulder and current sizzled in his fingers rain came down in a sheet such stupid little calves roger said lying in the dirt with our mouths open he helped jean patrick up and they abandoned themselves to laughter mama called to them her voice frantic how much will you bet me roger said that if we looked hard enough we could find our souls seared into the tree jean patrick glanced back in awe at the scarred trunk at christmas roger had still moved in the circle of family his identity merged with theirs today he had stepped from the circle he had taken jean patrick by the hand and walked with him to the edge of his new life but when roger left he would jump alone into its dizzying possibility soon enough jean patrick would follow his own path an oval tarmac four hundred meters around to wherever it took him until then jean patrick would have this tree as proof that this day had really happened he could put his hand against the bark and feel roger's soul his heart with its steady beat of love i love this passage benaron shows how the bonds of love in a family always has these points of connection even though they may be growing apart physically her approach is masterful and evocative at the end of the novel benaron's essay 'fiction and social responsibility where do they intersect ' sheds light on why she wrote this timely and haunting story","754":"i knew of the rwandan genocide but benaron took me deep into its darkness and into beauty amidst the darkness for me it is to rwanda what cry the beloved country is for south africa","755":" from the point of view of a tutsi teen we are drawn into the build up to the rwandan genocide heart wrenching and chilling yet not pointlessly gruesome we are shown how the violence and killings were orchestrated while on the one hand it seemed like a run away train bound to crash its predictable devastation begs the question where was the world it seems inconceivable that in our time murder on this scale could get to this point the book employs a clever juxtaposition of science faith culture and politics though the book describes rwanda well from a rwandan perspective it also sets up some predictable plot that at times seems to be written more for a hollywood screenplay than the reality for most rwandans i also at certain points question the western voice on this tragedy which writes a white american hero and and ending that resurrects a long lost love overall a great read that gives an emotional connection to the people of rwanda and also demonstrates the frightening potential for genocide to happen anywhere","756":"ok i feel kind of bad that i really didn't care for this book from the rave reviews as well as the author winning the bellwether price for fiction i felt pressure to really like and appreciate this novel both did not happen i felt the writing was rather stiff and predictable i did not feel that the characters were believable and or likeable i certainly don't think that i need to feel a connection with the characters to appreciate a book but

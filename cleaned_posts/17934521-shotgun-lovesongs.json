is a wonderful book full of characters you care about and hate to leave","2":"my only complaint about this very enjoyable and beautifully written book is that everyone is so good this is a love song to a dream like rural small town america one populated exclusively by good wholesome people with seemingly bottomless integrity","3":"there was substantial buzz about this book in our local press because author nickolas butler is a hometown eau claire wisconsin lad for me there was little to no risk in using a credit on shotgun lovesongs because i knew if nothing else it would be fun to read about the setting while comparing the novel's plot to facts about the life and times of justin vernon u0026amp co i wish i was impressed i wish i could buy fifty copies of this novel and send it to far flung friends and family who ask if i ever see bon iver like at target or something while i did enjoy the book's setting and local flavor i can't say it's anything dazzling but maybe that's fine butler writes well he's downright poetic at times but he's young and his characters are young and their problems and feelings are young and therefore the story seems to lack the depth or weight needed to engage anyone except his demographic or those hungry for more bon iver back story so there you have it shotgun lovesongs is a good solid effort if you enjoy the local scenery","4":"i kept waiting for something to happen really liked all of the characters but was bored","5":" i love the story telling in this book since the accidental juxtapositions of books in our lives sometimes offer insights i'll mention that i read this book after reading the emperor's children they're sort of the same thing 30 ish folks trying to grow up and make it in this world but man they're at opposite ends of that spectrum the emperor's children features women living in new york and faking their way through the culture of fake bookish intelligence there and ultimately failing at growing up this book is about mainly men in small town wisconsin trying to live life in a way consistent with who they are and they succeed for the most part in growing up can you tell which i liked better the people in this book are solidly 3d and the descriptions of the land and the small town midwestern culture are amazing it was just one of those books that i eat up and then i regret when they end","6":"sweet story and a very pleasant summer read","7":"writing is good but the story is ridiculous who decides they're going to start running and runs fourteen miles their first time out awful ending","8":"loved the small town farm atmosphere well drawn characters would have liked fewer f bombs and a more satisfying ending","9":"the author expertly describes why our hometowns attract and repel us at the same time he also accurately captures the binding confidences and jealousies between friends the ending of this book is perfect there could be no other conclusion and who would think that it would involve pickled eggs","10":"simple honest u0026amp relatable we all have friends like these u0026amp can see ourselves in this group i'm a fan the a the big chill u0026amp this book reminds me of an updated version of the movie very quick read too","11":" i love stories like this written about groups of friends who grew up together and how their relationships endure or not and or change it was especially appealing to me from the man's point of view i have found in my life that although the friends i had in high school 35 gasp years ago have not been with me during each twist and turn my life has taken since we were in our teens these friends are easy to reconnect with why they know the core of who i am which was established in my hometown where we spent many hours together the characters in this book had a deep connection and i felt mr butler did a wonderful job of conveying this to the reader as i write this nearly a year after i read the book the story resonates with me still i hope to read more from this author i also like that he's from eau claire wi which holds a special place in my heart","12":"this book is my top contender for the best book of 2014 i simply loved everything about the writing the beautiful and emotional depiction of strong friendship between a group of men and one woman most of whose lives have grown far beyond their hometown when all they want to do is go back to who what they once were the incredibly evocative description of economically depressed small town america and so many other things just read it you will be glad you did 5 stars for sure","13":"i really liked this book i was interested in every character","14":"this would probably be more like 3 5 there were a couple of plot moves that i thought were either unnecessary or unbelievable but overall a nice reflection on the ways in which friendships evolve and the challenges that go along with that evolution","15":" i absolutely loved this book the story was one that is easy to relate to for most of us one of the gang growing up together in rural america and the changes that take place as we all grow older and find our own niche in life though most of us do not have a friend who becomes a massively popular pop musician the book incorporates him into the narrative in such a way that we focus on his being rather than his accomplishments and popularity the characters were so real they feel like my own gang the events and challenges that the friends face seem so common and real that i nearly forgot that this was a novel at first the authors use of colorful and unique descriptions seemed a bit over the top and i began to suspect that i was going to be subject to a wannabe writers narrative that borders poetry rather than a story that i could connect with but this story has a way of drawing you in and sitting you down in the middle of a new group of friends making you feel like a part of the story rather than an observer this was an audio book and the production of this enhanced the story wonderfully each characters voice and mannerisms were reflected perfectly far from a detached narrator who tries to change his voice for each different character this story was produced with attention to even the smallest details those which make all the difference in life this book and the audio are destined to become well known and loved i am so pleased to have this audio for my own thank you to mr butler and those who put this recording into my hands","16":"this kind of book just bugs the shit out of me so i think the problem i had with it resides less with its quality than with my personal peccadillos having said that there is nothing i like less in a novel than page after page of descriptions and lists of things that are so supposed to be oh so beautiful and real and that feel designed to get me to see that the heartland is just so so beautiful man and miserable winters and dying towns are the only authentic way to live man and i say this as a resident of missouri who is probably never going to leave and likes it here just fine this also felt like about 75 pages of plot and about 225 pages of atmosphere and endless recounting of just how special farmers and small towns and troubadours are i had the distinct feeling by the end of this book that if i encountered any of these people in real life i'd probably want to punch them in the face with the possible exception of ronny and felicia i could go on with the troublesome advice certain characters beth give certain other characters or how stupid it is to think that a lifelong friendship and a solid marriage should be derailed by an incident that occurred more than a decade ago and violated absolutely no bounds of even the most strict moralist other than the almighty bro code i guess but i think i've bashed a book enough that i have given two stars to those stars are for the fact that it was an easy read which i sometimes appreciate and that the writer is certainly not talentless hope he thinks up a better story next time though instead of trying to convince me that small town wisconsin is where authentic living is happening man because i remain unconvinced","17":"a great coming of age story well developed characters and great use of location as a supplementary character a good quick read","18":"3 5 stars there is a lot to love in shotgun lovesongs nickolas butler has created some interesting and mostly likable characters i truly loved some of his poetic descriptions of the wisconsin landscape i had the pleasure of hearing mr butler speak at an event and i found him to be a really fun down to earth guy he addressed the rumor that this story is that of bon iver and insists that while the book is loosely inspired by justin vernon's story it is not the basis for the book i grew up in a small town in northern wisconsin less than an hour from where the fictional little wing was located the characters in the story are relatively the same age as i am and because of this i was hypercritical of this book i think had i grown up someplace else i would have mostly loved this book while i enjoyed reading it there were just constantly little things that would happen where i would want to yell that would never actually happen a few spoilers below first of all let me tell you henry ronnie kip and leland nobody in northern wi born in the early 80's was named that everybody was joe or mike or dan or nick we had a tucker in my class and that's about as exotic as it gets also while this idea that the entire small town is just all friends with each other seems pretty far fetched like honestly it's really nice to think that felicia would be friends with lucy the stripper but i can pretty much promise that wouldn't be the case also i felt like sometimes butler's dialogue really gave into the wisconsin stereotypes that we're all simple people and kind people i suppose kip's existence is supposed to show some diversity but in the story he's apparently only smart and cosmopolitan because he moved away to chicago and the part about ronnie getting drunk and wandering out completely unnoticed it just bugged me everyone knew he was a recovering alcoholic they would never have had his bachelor party in a bar and people would have been watching him and helping him on one had you're telling me that everyone is wi is simple and kind but they leave their drunk friend to fend for himself in the snow unlikely there were also just really silly inaccurate things as i mentioned in a status update nobody would ever drive down lake shore drive in chicago to get from ny to northern wi nobody that would add a good three hours on to your trip and finally the end was just a little to drawn out and dramatic for me the whole egg story left me feeling kind of annoyed at the story as a whole whereas most of the book was enjoyable i think nickolas butler is a good author with a great voice in this case the story just hit home a little too much to me and made shake my head more often than i would have liked","19":"heartfelt real genuine just like the midwest the book so lovingly describes","20":"great loved it makes me remember why i miss the kind of people you get living in the country","21":"what a wonderful piece of storytelling truly a tale to settle in with and sit back and enjoy","22":"i enjoyed this book and wobbled between three stars and four i read the review on goodreads and wondered idly if the author had written that synopsis smooth very smooth when it got right down to it the characters seemed to be just characters not really types but not really fleshed out as much as i at least needed to feel some real emotion with them so i went with three stars this book is very well written some profound ways of saying some profound thoughts quotations i've earmarked to share with others my final analysis is that this was a good worthwhile read but it well just felt written","23":"shotgun lovesongs is a difficult book to define the story centers around five childhood friends - lee henry kip ronny and beth - who all grew up in the same small rural town of little wing wisconsin the narrative kicks off with the reappearance of lee now a famous rockstar who hailed from little wing and returns to his ranch there whenever in need of a break from his chaotic lifestyle though much of the story centers around lee making him the catalyst for most of the \"action\" that occurs high school sweethearts henry and beth are the glue that hold everyone together as friends as much about a place and moments in time as it is about the characters there is really very little plot to speak of and character development is based mainly on their shifting friendships relationships with each other i would say that much of the growth to speak of occurs through flashbacks and memory which the reader is periodically thrown into and though the story is about a group of childhood friends we largely only get a third person perspective from three of the five i believe ronny gets one short chapter and kip is only seen through the eyes of others it would have been nice to hear more from ronnie's perspective he was definitely one of the more interesting characters i also found the ending to be problematic with everything too neatly wrapped up for my liking at its heart shotgun lovesongs is an ode to a place -- specifically the simple beauty that is small rural america where everyone knows and relies on one another -- and whether or not you can ever truly go home again once you've left though i must admit that i didn't much care what happened to some of the characters in one way or another the novel took its emotional toll on me and i found that i could only read a couple chapters at a time little wing almost becomes one of the characters it is the voice that permeates throughout and lingers long after the novel is done frank gut wrenching and heartbreaking butler's prose is beautiful poetic spiritual this debut author undoubtedly has promise and i hope we haven't seen the last of him","24":" this book is a great story about the midwest it's about friendships relationships families living in a small town and the struggles to survive since i happen to live in the midwest and travel to wisconsin often i especially enjoyed the scenery described throughout the story the characters were fascinated to the point i imagined living in little wing being friends and going to their weddings the audiobook version was especially intriguing because each character was narrated by a different person so the reader really got to know that character as their own individual it's just a story of small town living - nothing tragic or phenomenal occurs - however especially midwesterners will become intertwined in their lives","25":"as a disclaimer i'm a sucker for books set in wisconsin and for that matter minnesota illinois and maryland because i was born and partially raised there and the majority of my family still lives there this is the story of a group of high school friends and how their relationships have changed since one of them has become a famous musician the narrator changed from chapter to chapter which was an effective way to show how the musician's view of his hometown had changed as well as how his friends' impressions of him have changed it helped to flesh out the characters to both see how they view themselves and how they view each other overall it is difficult to review this book because while it was an ok read i kept putting it down to start a new book or listen to an audiobook if it wasn't a first read copy i might have called it quits after a few chapters because it wasn't very engaging when i first finished it i gave it 3 stars a goodreads i liked it but now sitting and writing this review i'm changing to 2 stars it was ok because that's what it was ok","26":"this was a lot better than i expected great ending","27":"absolutely beautiful writing i loved it from start to finish i don't write many reviews but this is one of the best books i've read in quite awhile and i want others to enjoy it as much as i did","28":"loved this book had a little bit of everything suspense drama romance humor","29":"3 5 stars there aren't many novels out there that explore male friendships as there are far more chic lit books out there i really enjoyed this novel because i'm a gal who hails from a small town in south dakota complete with a rodeo grounds railroad station farmers ranchers and lots of cowboys nickolas butler does a fabulous job in his character development i swear those men came from my town each chapter is told from one of the main character's perspective and identified by the first letter of their name there are 4 men and one woman who grew up together and are now back together at their hometown in wisconsin the characters are in their 30's and trying to figure out their places in their respective worlds there's a lot of romancing the farming and simple life but that's what these men woman are simple people loving their simple worlds it's written without adornment a very easy read authentic characters are the novel's gift","30":" holy amazing this was the first time in a very long time that i found myself speaking out loud while reading a book i felt such a deep connection to every single character especially henry and beth i grew to love them and feel as if i were a part of their amazing friendship this has easily entered my top 50 favorite books of all time i have been telling everybody about this book and i plan on buying several copies to share with a few of my friends if you love music if you love small towns if you love friendship read this book","31":"i loved loved loved this novel the characters were unique and engaging and it was easy to get emotionally invested in the story it was a beautiful story about love life and friendship and the ending was very touching i was totally hooked and can't wait to read butler's other novels","32":"vaguely entertaining and this could be a generous statement","33":"maybe this would have been a 4 star story had i read it and not listened to it on audio but luckily i'll never know the audio production was so well read the story poetic heartbreaking and relatable i felt like as the listener i was a part of the story of these four characters lifelong friends finally coming of age in their early thirties the small town a fifth character holding everyone together observant and straightforward i'll be looking for more from this author","34":"having grown up in a small town i understand some of the deep seated loyalties and connections between the characters in the story it was a pleasant read no more than that","35":" i actually listened to this book on cd during my commute now that i have to spend a lot of time in the car driving to and from and was surprised that my mind never wandered in the slightest i usually have a hard time focusing during audiobooks i enjoyed spending time with these characters and felt like they and little wing wi were real my only complaint is that some of the lyrical descriptive passages about wisconsin scenery went on for too long and since i was listening to this book i was acutely aware of not being able to skim ahead i generally appreciated the author's care and creativity crafting the prose in this book but there were at least 3 or 4 spots where i would have trimmed a bit still the story and the characters kept me engaged","36":"not finished yet but absolutely love this book want to recommend it to all my book loving friends strange to say but it is hitting me the same way bridges of madison county did when i first read it long before anyone else had ever heard of it update just as good all the way through anxious to read the next by the author","37":" the story of 5 friends from a small town in wisconsin henry the farmer who stayed home and married beth his childhood sweetheart ronnie the rodeo star alcoholic brain injured in need of tlc kip the businessman who left to make his millions in chicago and came home to indulge a dream of making it on his home turf lee the rich famous musician who left to tour the world and retired home hurt on the back of a failed marriage written in these five voices this sort of crept up on me it's a slow burn and nothing much outside the ordinary happens but the writing is lovely lyrical i've never been to wisconsin but i could see and feel and smell it the characters were less successful i won't say they were interchangeable they weren't that but they were a little cardboard a set of type cast avatars and i had a hard time relating to them they felt alien to me with behaviours and attitudes that seemed just plain odd i couldn't work out why these people were behaving the way they were maybe i just don't understand american midwesterners for all that it's an enjoyable tale a long meander through tales of lost loves of friendships made and broken but it doesn't really go anywhere and ends quite suddenly after such a slow telling of a tale the end came so precipitously it left me disoriented it needed a slower come down","38":"excellent first novel about a small wiscinsin town four thirty something friends who grew up went different paths ones a farmer ones a mercantile trader ones a former cowboy and ones a bon iver type rock star and the woman at the center of their lives fully realized characters an accurate portrayal of the tension of breaking out versus the desire for the identity of home well worth the effort","39":"i really enjoyed reading this a nice story about friendship over time i enjoy stories told from multiple perspectives and this one was no exception","40":" i really liked this book especially coming off the downer that was lynn coady's hellgoing it was interesting reading it too on the way home from two days with a bunch of canadian farmers on an executive development program the book tells the story of the relationships between a handful of people who have been friends since childhood each chapter is written from the viewpoint of a different person and documents their relationships over time in the small town of little wing wisconsin maybe the book is a bit saccharine but it was comforting to read about people who were decent kind and cared about one another","41":"i love this beautiful simple story","42":" this book is wonderfully written and really captures the feeling of small town wisconsin the storyline is compelling because it's not filled with crazy far fetched action or drama so over the top it makes you shake your head but rather is a heart felt this could happen to anyone plot told from alternating perspectives and shifting through time the reader gathers information about a group of men and one woman who grow up knowing each other inside and out or so they think it's the feelings and thoughts that come out in each of their chapters that change the course of their lives a thoroughly enjoyable read for absolutely anyone looking for a realistic down to earth novel","43":"i loved this book so many books are written about the life long friendships of women and it was so interesting to read the same about men extremely well written down to the littlest description and detail so well done i would highly recommend it","44":" best book i have read this year the writing was simply sublime and believable i am sure that the setting in a small town in wisconsin contributed to my love of shotgun lovesongs but it is also about men and friendship and indie music all of those are my loves the reflections fears hopes desires and connections between the characters was quite touching and i found myself easily putting myself in their shoes i kept seeing the parallel between the story of shotgun lovesongs the album from the book and bon iver's for emma","45":"i received a copy of the book from goodreads giveaways i really liked the story and loved the friendships of the characters","46":"nothing special had it not been for book club i probably wouldn't have finished","47":"great book by a great guy recommend highly","48":"starts w a wedding invitation and ends w a slug ballistic not mollusca in a mason jar and in between a lot of familiar 1st novel territory","49":" bear with me here what is with every book these days having alternate points of view for each chapter am i old school in that i prefer one or at most two povs it's too much for my brain to comprehend a new narrator every chapter sure seems to be the trend tho so i guess i will start to accept it okay rant over i enjoyed this book even with the multiple narrators lol butler does an amazing job of setting the scene of a small town in wisconsin made me kind of want to live there or at least visit his writing is lyrical yet accessible i'm not sure if i would recommend it to everyone tho 3 stars","50":"i read this book slowly and deliberately butler paints wisconsin so perfectly his descriptions of the seasons were fantastic and created such perfect imagery i feel like i have spent time in my life in little wing and like the characters exist in the real world i see myself re reading this again just to revisit the characters and their lives the outline of lee to justin vernon of bon iver was thought provoking and had me listening to his old albums over and over again","51":"this book just resonated with me set in rural wisconsin shotgun lovesongs tells the story of four men and one woman revealing the meaning of friendship love and home just well developed characters the book just flowed","52":"adorable book loved it all wonderful characters clever writing five stars","53":"i liked the author's style of writing the characters were interesting and i really enjoyed how the story unfolded it kept my interest throughout","54":"youza lovely storytelling","55":"amazing word pictures i'm from eau claire and loved the book","56":" this book follows a group of friends lee kip beth ronny henry and who grew up together in the same small rural farming town in wisconsin their lives come together and break apart in fascinating ways but underneath it all their friendships endure each chapter is told from the perspective of one of the characters and to be honest my only quibble with the whole book is that the author opted to use the first initial of each character instead of the name to headline the chapter i've given you the names above to help out future readers wink this book was simply great storytelling i fell in love with all these characters each one rendered flaws and all like a true living breathing human being so so well done in terms of character development honestly i didn't want it to end this book makes you feel joy concern worry anger and more and illuminates what it means to grow up in a rural area the good the bad and the ugly really really good read it","57":"set in the wisconsin that i love revolving around very real but flawed characters shotgun lovesongs is an amazing first novel of friendship rivalry betrayal and love nick butler writes with tremendous heart and empathy for his characters this is my kind of read","58":"another book that has a vague ending what is with this trend i gave it three stars because of the great character development","59":" shotgun lovesongs has flaws that ultimately make it a disappointing book and the flaws involve mostly the multiple first person narrators the five narrators are very different people obvious archetypes in fact but they all sound the same as each other partially undermining the sense i was hearing from different people additionally the narrations are too flowery too observant and too insightful coming from your average person who is simply describing some events not writing a novel and the narrators' shifting from past to present and back again while often effective in juxtaposing important events is sometimes confusing so at times i wasn't sure where i was in the chronology the ending is also flawed it seems overly dramatic freighted with importance to make a larger point and to conclude the novel it's a bit much and somewhat unsatisfying so overall i was disappointed in shotgun lovesongs however i do feel one idea is well developed the deep affection people can have for a home town while at the same time experiencing an urge to move away to go to a place that's different or possibly better elsewhere this tension between home and elsewhere is woven throughout the book so i often felt the contrasting contradictory feelings those feelings are expressed in a heavy handed way at times but they do capture an experience many people have when cherishing home on the one hand while yearning for a richer happier experience possibly somewhere else","60":"the story is about a group of friends from a small town the charactors are lovable and beliievable the story feels familiar like it could have been about me and again this is a debut novel","61":"i really liked this book and after meeting the author i liked it even more the voices are strong and realistic and the story of friendship and going home is one everyone can relate to there were a couple of spots where it bogged down a little but overall a great read","62":"i don't know about this book i absolutely loved the first couple of chapters but i seemed to progressively lose interest throughout the book the characters seemed distinct at the beginning but then failed to develop any more also i kind of wish that the story had just focused on kip ronny and lee and not even brought beth into it at all i was really interested in their relationship but then i found out that view spoiler the big secret was just infidelity and come on that's a pretty jaded subject in modern literature hide spoiler re the ending view spoiler really i'm pretty sure i wrote an ending similar to that back in ninth grade honestly i would have liked to see ronny actually die which would snap these people out of their self absorption over something that happened one time ten years ago hide spoiler i think butler is a good writer but maybe not a good novelist yet","63":"i enjoyed this story despite feeling the ending fell a little flat it was a good bounce between childhood friends who all went different ways in their life it is easy to relate when you look at yourself or at your friends lives and how you grow apart and stay together at the same time this book does a great jobs of that plus it helps that the characters are likable even when they are not","64":"a good quick read about four small town wisconsin friends the farmer the businessman the inured rodeo star and the rock star and how their friendships evolve as they face adulthood i'd liken it to early tropper novels plan b book of joe recommend it","65":" i received an advanced reading copy of this from the publisher via goodreads first reads giveaway program this novel is a lovesong to small town america and the struggling people who inhabit it written from the point of view of four life long friends and the wife of one of them it details their struggles to stay together in friendship and discover their adult selves in terms of past glories and failures it is a type of novel that many people are just going to adore because it has some psychological depth steeped in realism and in the end is uplifting warm and generally 'feel good' despite their struggles and faults all the characters in this book are really good people at heart people who want the best for their family their friends and their small home town they slip up they aren't perfect but they in the end they are loyal and true strong midwestern folks all in fact the only character in the entire book who isn't portrayed this way is a hollywood actress who never wants anything to do with the small town and its populace a person of the city and ultimately selfishness in a certain way this all makes the novel rather simplistic and despite its 'realism' somewhat contrived and a little too worshipful of a type of life and ideal person yet still butler makes it work with something that could easily turn sappy and saccharine and utterly disingenuous and trite butler manages to keep things balanced between a realism and some midwestern ideal that is this lovesong the majority of the narrative comes from the point of view of three characters the most sincere and virtuous ones at that but butler intersperses those with the points of views of those that are not ideal those that may still be lovable but are still clearly damaged and weak if you want a warming and ultimately optimistic literary read of small town america then this is certainly something you should check out","66":"set in the small town of little wing wisconsin shotgun lovesongs is the story of 5 friends who either do or have lived there farmer and wife hank and beth rodeo cowboy ronny commodities trader kip and rock singer lee they are an unlikely group but have lots of shared history nickolas butler writes about the upper midwest like pat conroy writes about charleston that is to say he says so much the scenery becomes a character i could have done with about 50% less farmland description as with all small towns there is lots of small intrigue love triangles marriages divorces comings and goings drinking and cursing at the vfw the characters are all a bit flawed but generally well described and tolerable the narration which is pretty straightforward unless the character decides to talk about the scenery alternates among the 5 characters and it is sometimes hard to tell who is talking unless one has looked carefully at the initial which labels each chapter this book is not a bad read but it's not one of the best i've experienced lately","67":"one of those books where you read single sentences paragraphs pages whole chapters a second or third time because they're so damn good this book is like the most glorious sunrise warming you in increments until your whole being's on fire","68":"i loved this book it was so satisfying to read about all these relationships that sounded just like the ones i have or have known it should also be noted that this is not the typical book i pick up there are no swords or lasers in it sorry for the spoiler just characters that i cared about making real life choices about how and who to spend their life with","69":"a great book with a feeling a nostalgia i loved all the characters who seem so real and even though i am a city person i was able to sympathize with each character","70":"i enjoyed the book growing up in rural wisconsin allowed me to relate to the story plus all the local references were very cool an easy read that i will recommend to all my small town friends","71":" i loved this book i did not know prior to reading it that the author grew up in a small town with an actual famous rock star and i think if you are going to read this you would do well not to make the stupid assumption that it is about that actual rock star and just enjoy the book for what it is which is a beautiful book about friendship and how it evolves over time i think trying to figure out that kind of stuff ahead really does the author and the book and most importantly yourself a real disservice every author has inspiration but we don't always need to know that ahead i found the characters to be very believable perhaps it is more believable to me because i live near wisconsin but i am in illinois and near a big city so it is more that i enjoyed the references to things here like the train stops etc but i feel like the author described it very well and anyone could relate to it i also enjoyed how he tackled the many issues of how small towns are changing i think the characters changed and developed and evolved just as people do as life events and relationships alter them the way that people think other people's lives are a certain way or how they may judge based on their own assumptions and not on reality or not truly understand other people all of this was handled very well it was enjoyable to see the story unfold through different characters' eyes and see some of the same events from different angles while still having the story unfurl i would recommend this to anyone and would caution a reader to not research the author and the story too much ahead just read it and go with it the author does a beautiful job of capturing the place and how it affects the characters it is like a character itself the physical place the weather etc and this is extremely interesting i didn't find these characters to be stereotypes i found them to be truthful and compelling and i enjoyed how they developed and also the beautiful writing sorry if this is a bit of poorly written review i have been interrupted so many times while writing this at this point i just want to send it off before i get interrupted again a great book and if you know guys who have been friends for a long time like this i think it will really ring true","72":"amazing favourite author after reading both his novels","73":" i really liked this novel of four lifelong male friends from a small town near eau claire wisconsin the story of their friendship is told through the eyes of the different friends and the wife of one of them the friends are in their thirties i think i liked out how he brought out the importance of their friendship and brought out the positive side of male emotional life and friendships something few books do most just bring it out for women and their friendships and men too often are depicted as people with little emotional depth to them the characters all have flaws but we empathize with all of them the book seems to bring out the closeness and at times distance for these four men very well and the insider outsider perspective of beth the wife of henry draws it all together very well","74":"extremely well written and excellent character development a modern day story that richly portrays life in a small town in wisconsin and the ups and downs of friendships and relationships","75":" i loved this book i would give it 4 5 stars i saw a reviewer mention that it was very big chill like and the funny things is i had thought the very same thing it's about small town coming home again relationships and what makes them tick friends spouses and those peripheral people in our lives who make up what we call home and then of course there is a secret there is a melancholy tone running thru out this book that happy sad kind of feeling that you just can't put your finger on and call me weird but that always appeals to me i love a book told in third person multiple narrative different chapters in different perspectives i love getting to know the characters on that level","76":"a heartwarming story about friends who grew up together in a wisconsin farm community they are rejoined as adults trying to keep the friendship alive despite life's changes disappointments and secrets told by each member i found solace sympathy and hope in their friendships and their futures","77":"2 5 stars listened to the audiobook version pretty ambivalent about it it was okay but not sure i'd recommend this one","78":"heartbreaking and uplifting at the same time this book transported me away to the world of little wing wisconsin with wonderful characters and a great story i felt as though i were right back home in the midwest while reading this book and it made me miss it terribly i highly recommend this book yet another great example of work from an iowa writer's workshop author","79":"beautifully written while totally readable at the same time best book i've read in quite some time","80":"author did a great job of making the characters come to life ending didn't seem to fit with the rest of the book","81":"this book was a good read it picked up speed in the middle i did enjoy each characters side of the story and as always i liked the midwestern setting","82":" henry lee ronny and kip have been friends for ages even as henry has stayed home in tiny little wing wisconsin to take over his parents' farm ronny hit the rodeo circuit kip moved to chicago and started raking in money and lee hit the big time with his music they've remained tight over the year or two chronicled in shotgun lovesongs their lives hit roller coasters as marriages and breakups occur arguments flare up and their friendship is put to the test i'm sitting here thinking about what it was exactly that i liked about this book i can't really say that it was about much of anything it's just a slice of everyday life but i think what stands out to me most is that this is a book about male friendship not good buddies or even battle forged bonds these guys just like and genuinely care about each other they always have more or less as is true with friendships of any real length when is the last time you read a book about male friendship i'm sure they're out there but i personally haven't come across many if any i like it the group really is put through the fire in this period of their lives though they're all starting to kind of settle down now henry and his wife beth also a member of this tight group of friends have been settled for a while but now the others are coming home to settle too so they're adjusting to having a more prominent position in each others' lives again it takes some getting used to everybody pretty much fights with everybody else but then they settle down and then the serious disagreement happens the ending sounds a bit far fetched at first but the more i thought about it the more i wonder if this is based on an incident in the author's own life it's so bizarre it has to be true and then i tried to picture my husband and his best friend getting up to mischief like that and i absolutely could well up to a point i just had to laugh i pretty much liked the characters solid henry appealed to me most i related to him he's maybe not the most exciting guy in the group but he's the rock lee is world famous but he mostly hasn't let that change him he knows that this landscape is what has shaped his music and his soul he knows that he needs his friends to anchor him ronny isn't quite the same after a head injury years ago but he's learned to appreciate the moment even while yearning for more kip is the weak link he doesn't quite fit in with the others but he knows it he tries too hard and manages to always do the wrong thing even with the best of intentions he has the most growing up to do i've kind of left beth out of everything i really liked her but i don't feel that she was necessarily any sort of real focus she was the well not the outsider but not one of the guys either she gave us a different perspective on the group both in their younger years and currently she also added some tension and a whole other set of dynamics to the group and then there's small town midwest america lee says something late in the book about how this is his america not the excesses and selfishness but the sense of community and even the sense of connection to the land little wing could be every town usa if you're lucky you grew up in a place like this if you're really lucky you know how lucky you are to have roots there i really enjoyed the narrators who read the parts of henry and beth even kip did pretty well i didn't enjoy the narration for lee and ronny quite as much it's still definitely a good choice in audio format but i wish the cast had all been equally strong i highly recommend shotgun lovesongs it's one of those books that will sink into your bones and linger with you for a long time to come","83":" the character of lee really struck home with me because of my son he like the character in shotgun lovesongs is a musician and through lee's view of the world and music in particular i feel as if i now understand some of the things my son has been trying to communicate to me it is if i understand english and he speaks music but lee does both lovesongs is a story about four guys in their early thirties who have come back together in their home town of little wing wisconsin it is like so many little towns across america a dying concern henry married beth had a couple of kids runs a small farm and worries about the bills ronnie got tossed one too many times from a bronc in the rodeo and is back home retired from the circuit and being looked out for monetarily and spiritually by lee kip made big money in chicago and came home sank it into renovating a co op grainery and getting ready to go belly up on that project there's a lot of drinking marriages divorces old secrets revealed quarrels andjust about any other thing that can and will happen in a small town saturday night this is a fine book which i recieved on audio cd through the goodreads program and i felt that listening to each caharacter give voice to their own story enhanced the experience to a degree that just reading it would not have done i know i enjoyed the story because as i played though the last disc i was hoping the fool's hope that there might just be one more disc i had overloked that the story wouldn't end just yet and that i might have another hour or so with these people","84":" met the author beforehand so again i am slightly skewed here it's a smooth portrait of rural wisconsin told through multiple perspectives including an implied eau claire area native bon iver i've had just a slight taste of this as a college freshman and i can say that i appreciate this more now than i would have had i not read michael perry's population 485 though it didn't quite resonate with me like perry's still a good indie wisconsin read and i am excited to see what else comes from butler","85":"4 i'm on a roll lately i love every character in this book not a very groundbreaking plot but great setting great writing great characters","86":" in tennessee william's play the glass menagerie tom the narrator stands alone on the stage he begins his soliloquy by saying being a memory play it is dimly lighted it is sentimental it is not realistic in memory everything seems to happen to music that explains the fiddle in the wings memories are indeed the fabric of life and in butler's debut novel he weaves both memory and music around the lives of 5 characters whose lives are grounded in a small town in so doing his writing soars and leaves us feeling and hoping desperately for his characters to succeed i am amazed by butler's writing it is lyrical and reflects a major talent one could pick any page and select any passage as evidence hope and sadness and love and pain are the ingredients of life and song and the author has captured both those feelings in each character this is a brilliant debut novel","87":" at first this seemed it was going to be a collective memory piece told in first person plural telling of a small town's boy who made good and the reactions of those who grew up around him i was prepared to settle in much as i did years ago with the series of books by t r pearson but this wasn't to be the case the small town in wisconsin is intact as are the four childhood friends with different life arcs that converge separate reunite in intriguing ways but it is told from many different points of view in first person giving a roshomon like perspective to the finished product it was an enjoyable read although this first time author is more successful in narrating through all four men rather than the one woman pivotal to the story her contribution can be forgiven since her thoughts are essential to the overall story but she didn't come through as clearly as her male counterparts","88":"this book just drew me in i appreciated the plain writing that managed to make me feel involved with the characters and story","89":"an earnest little novel with a few very nice moments totally maddening however when you use multiple first person voices that all sound more or less the same","90":"reads like poetry at times a love letter to the midwest and to friendship","91":"arc copy read in early 2014","92":" i was drawn to this book because of its rural wisconsin setting i grew up in suburbia so there's always been something charming and seductive about small town life for me and given our proximity to wisconsin it wasn't hard to imagine the town of little wing the setting of this marvelous book shotgun lovesongs tells the story of four friends who grew up together in little wing but went their separate ways one to ride the rodeo circuit one to make his fortune on the chicago commodities exchange one to become a rock star only one man henry stays home and works his father's farm with his wife beth who is cherished by all four of the men the story begins with a wedding that brings them all back together in little wing and what follows is an exploration of the events that have shaped and sometimes broken their relationships although all four men are adults at some level their friendships have not passed beyond adolescence and it takes some painful lessons to cause each of them to finally and fully grow up this book is a beautiful study of love and friendship but it's also a love song to small town america butler captures the midwestern landscape its sensibility its poverty with gentleness and respect i haven't lived in a small town but i can tell you this you will feel for these characters as each one tells you their story your heart will go out to them and not come back for a long time shotgun lovesongs is a story that is moving warm and heartfelt","93":" i would maybe go to 4 5 stars but the ending was a little silly i suppose its because i grew up in small towns in minnesota that i related so highly to the characters and town in this book what it feels like to have friends for 25 years people that know you inside and out friendships that fade in and out in their intensity but always knowing solidly in your heart they will be there forever i know what all that is like and that's what this book reminded me of a quick read one where i never muttered to myself 'man this could use some editing' one of the best books i've read in a while","94":"shotgun lovesongs is an ode to a place to a home butler's story centers in the town of little wing a rural farming area a few miles from butler's own hometown of eau claire the five best friends at the core of this story battle with issues of leaving and returning to their home escaping and becoming who they are butler creates fascinating outlines of characters ronnie an ex alcoholic and rodeo rider lee a disillusioned rock star he studies their interactions as the high school friends grow up and grow apart henry and beth however were disappointingly one dimensional the author idealizes their marriage to the point where henry becomes a cardboard cutout of a \"decent man \" he lacks the cruel nuances and mistakes of the lesser characters however i wanted a little more from everyone less predictability more passion and action the simple imagery of the story might have been the strongest aspect butler depicts the lonesome countryside with spare beautiful language that makes elegant what might be considered provincial butler waxes poetic on a simple way of life at times in a way that becomes overbearing he idealizes the clutter free lifestyle devoid of the superficial trappings of big city life the straightforward language is clear cut and honest echoing the voice of the characters butler depicts because of the clear style i fell in love with the landscape however towards the middle of the novel the plot lags heavily not a lot happens--most of the action occurs before the story begins most of the plot developments center on the weddings of kip lee and ronnie the wedding serves as an interesting demarcation of coming of age but all of the relationships actually shown were fairly one dimensional and unimportant the second half of the novel is mostly internal monologues with little action the scenes last too long and lose momentum cycling back to characterization already established","95":"it's not often that i get to read a book that's set in small town wi i liked the characters and i thought the portrayal of adult friendship was pretty spot on","96":"wanted more ronny i guessed what was up with him from the beginning and i just wanted to see read more about his interactions with certain characters overall the book was good could have been better but i enjoyed it","97":"the story of four long time friends from little wing wi the author evokes a sense of small towns that dot the midwest it's a heart of your shirt sleeve type novel that most of the time also possesses a clarity of tone that hasn't got a shred of sarcasm there are some clumsy moments but all in all it was a stunning debut novel","98":"it's midwestern guy lit four childhood friends come back to their hometown in wisconsin to learn who they are where they've been and what they want it's told in 5 unique voices excellent debut","99":"outstanding butler captures the sorrows and triumphs of long friendships and small town life as well as anything i've read wisconsin and its winters provide not just a setting but the spirit of the book one of my new favorites i'll be looking for what's next from butler","100":"good story very well written","101":"this story quite surprised me and i enjoyed it immensely small town life friendships that can stand the test of time will be recommending to all my friends","102":"i found this book very depressing and sad","103":"i don't think i could pinpoint a specific reason as to why this book was so immensely enjoyable to me maybe it was from spending my formative years in the midwest that i felt such an affinity towards these characters from wisconsin made me question how i define success without beating me over the head with a very important message it was impossible to put down give it a try i loved it","104":"this book follows four friends who grew up in rural wisconsin and ten go their separate ways one stays in the small town and marries his high school girlfriend one stays in the small town and aimlessly bums around due to head injury one becomes a rock star said to be based on bon iver and one moves to chicago to become a business man they all return for a wedding the rock star's and come to see how their lives have changes and aren't what they want them to be the book follows the four main characters for several years the writing is beautiful and the descriptions of the wisconsin landscape are poetic and spot on often making me think of a place i know in real life highly recommended","105":"http www goodbookfairy com shotgun","106":"why why do so many authors feel the need to ruin books by using so many swear words i will never understand","107":"i really enjoyed this one about love and friendship in small town america the writing was lovely the characters a little over the top but still really endearing and their intermingled voices and stories were compelling overall a nice read","108":" a solid read with loveable characters and believable relationships full disclosure i'm from wi and so i'm somewhat biased to novels set in my home state but they have to be done well which shotgun lovesongs is butler does a great job of weaving into the story many nuances of wi culture including green bay packer obsession pickled eggs drinking at the vfw the dramatic change of seasons dairy farming drinking leinenkugal beer i'm not from a small town but i feel he captures the essence of small town america with this novel and tells a big chillesque tale of a group of friends and how their friendship evolves with the passing of years and the challenges they each face in adulthood i recommend this novel whether you are from the badger state or not","109":"the narrated book is awesome i love the voice of le great story but i'm a sucker for unrequited love great writing quite vivid and earnest","110":"there aren't many books as good as this one being published as a former midwesterner i loved the small town venue and the exploration of long standing male friendships not a false note throughout the book i've encouraged my husband to read it too","111":"this review has been hidden because it contains spoilers to view it click here old friends get reunite fall out with each other and then are all saved in different ways i liked it anyway and did not put it down","112":"i had high hopes for this book unfortunately it did not suck me in and i had a hard time getting through it","113":"characters so well done i cared about them real feel for the good u0026amp not so good aspects of small town life look forward tomr butler's next book","114":"i haven't read prose this artless in a long time i can't help the exclamation point that first sentence has to be recited in a faux chipper voice that seems to promise a rave review but reveals the exact opposite it just feels right perhaps because a lot of people really did rave review this book i found this effort so sophomoric that i kept flipping to the author photo on the back flap to make sure that the writer wasn't well a high school sophomore the book broke down on every level the sentences regardless of what they were saying were soft and gummy and perhaps most damning of all obvious the pacing was slow one third of the way through the book i began to read one sentence every fifth page and still had a complete sense of plot character etc character development was heavy handed more tell than show and while the premise had potential the actual plot felt under realized and none of the characters had more than one dimension especially the women the only thing i liked about this book is the title which is great i guess the cover art isn't bad either otherwise take a pass on this dud","115":"for whatever reason this one just spoke to me","116":"i love this guy he can make you hear the music in the sunrise and sunset and things that you never knew made such beautiful sounds for the eyes i wanted to read slow and wallow around in his descriptions and soak it up takes you to your knees in tears with the exquisite beauty of sunrise sunset on page 53 these people are my people and they are me","117":"it's always nice to find a page turner that's still smart and well crafted","118":"a group of friends in a small wisconsin town drift apart and come back over the many incidents in each of their lives kinda meh not super deep characters didn't really identify with any of them in fact most were annoying","119":"after a slow start i was getting pretty enthusiastic about this book and then it deteriorated i finished it but i'd feel guilty recommending it except if you're snowed in somewhere and it's the only book around some nice reflections on small town life and an enviable marriage between two of the main characters but somehow nothing added up to much","120":"this is the second full read through i love this book so much the characters are brilliant and the author did an amazing job depicting life in rural wisconsin which really becomes the protagonist in this book","121":"what an incredibly deeply personal book about friends and life in the midwest about the american people i listened to it on audio an excellent cast but now i want to read it some of the passages are sheer perfection they hover around you resonating haunting truth don't miss this one","122":"butler's debut novel is a lovingly rendered portrait of rural wisconsin as a native badger myself i recognized the depictions of people and place butler's narrative is rich with detail unique to the area successfully capturing the small town atmosphere its rife with unspoken questions about loyalty home and belonging occasionally overwritten and without enough distinction between characters' voices","123":"this book is about 5 people who grew up together in a small town in wisconsin it jumps from present time to history and back and forth again it's about how they've changed grown apart moved away come back etc i wanted to love it and i certainly did not hate it but i think i might have been missing what other people loved it was well written but i wanted more i didn't connect or relate to the men though i found the women interesting and wanted more from them i think it's one of those books where i feel like it's me that's missing something i can see and understand why other people connect to and love this book but i am missing something it's not you it's me","124":" if you only read the paragraph on page 249 that describes a giant jar of pickled eggs on a dusty shelf in a small town wisconsin bar the price of this book would be worth it the book is about a group of friends who grew up in the fictional town of little wing near eau claire one of them has become a rock star think justin vernon of bon iver the author went to school with him the characters are so vivid i think i might run into one of them the net time i go to eau claire a funny book that's also sad with equal parts regret and hope one of the best books i've read in a long time","125":"i picked this one up when we were in door county at a cute little bookstore on washington island at the recommendation of the owner it is set in small town wisconsin and was the perfect accompaniment to our trip there the five main characters all grew up in the fictional town little wing wisconsin set outside of eau claire not too far from the minnesota border when the book opens they are all in their 30's lee made it big as a rock star with many adoring fans and a lot of time on the road kip has become a successful financial trader in chicago beth and henry married and stayed in little wing working on a dairy farm and ronnie has to retire from rodeo work after an accident leaves him with traumatic brain injury little wing is a presence in all their lives and they continue to be defined by their relationship to it and with each other the descriptions of the town shaped by the sky winter and trees are lovely butler has done a great job with his characters which alternately narrate i really liked this video with butler shot in winter on his own farm in rural wisconsin http www nytimes com video books 10","126":"good easy summertime read","127":"this review has been hidden because it contains spoilers to view it click here not much happens but then that's pretty much the story in most small towns you have to live there for a while before the stories beneath start to surface i liked butler's descriptions of little wing of the relationships between the five main characters and the pickled eggs at novel's end","128":"small town wisconsin guys that grew up together and how their friendships change over the years really beautiful honest writing","129":" i haven't read a book that lovely in a long time butler's prose is simply beautiful reminiscent of kent haruf even the book is told from the viewpoint of each of the 5 main characters and it works beautifully i came to love each one of them as well as the land because the way it was described revered remembered etc made it a character in u0026amp of itself and like any really good book it left me wanting to know more but also completely satisfied with the ending thank you for the book amy it was just lovely","130":"this book was beautifully written butler's use of simile and metaphor made the characters and the setting come alive i highly recommend this engaging read","131":"as with my other 2 5 ratings it's ok just about sums it up i liked it enough to keep reading and i admire any sort of small town blue collar type of environment but this never elevates to anything substantial it wasn't bad it wasn't great kept waiting for something great to happen and it just kind of remains pretty flat throughout","132":"4 5 stars beautifully written i could feel the raw emotions see and hear everything described a great story of friends that evolve through everyday life","133":"really enjoyable read i very much liked his writing and characters","134":"a coming of age story set in rural wisconsin beautifully descriptive especially the town of little wing but a bit of pretentiousness when it comes to american skies etc i felt a certain degree of empathy for the characters but at times the author shoved sentimentalism down the reader's throat","135":" i thought this debut novel from butler was refreshing maybe i think that because for the past few weeks i've been engrossed in young adult dystopian series books so this was a nice change of pace the reviews on this site seem to focus on how this is a book about a musician who comes back to his home town this book is not entirely about that this book is about adults it is about a group of friends who grew up together then grew apart went their separate ways and who are brought back together again in their adult years it seems pretty honest it makes me think about my friends how we are trying so hard to remain together as a group but slowly we are drifting drifting to different cities and lives this novel makes me both excited and nervous to imagine our lives in 20 years to see how adults have to try to remain friends how we will gather for some great event and look back on our lives and secrets and childhoods and see how that is still changing and molding us also apparently the musician is based loosely on bon iver whom i know absolutely nothing about","136":"great summer read","137":" secrets in small towns spread like tumbleweed in albuquerque new mexico that is to say a secret lasts about as long as a change in wind direction or a flying ball sailing across a major highway in the middle of rush hour traffic shotgun lovesongs brings up many of the negative points about small town life and therefore it won't be at the top of my christmas list anytime this century the third person multiple perspective nature of this tale peppered with the occasional flashback left me with a head scratch or two for my trouble but i was in charge of my fate as i continued onward perseverance pushed me toward the finish line not the writing or the story itself each perspective proved mostly unique but i did feel as though it was all a bit convoluted lee and kip and chloe represented a trio of selfish bastards and bastardettes with more than a secret or two between them i wanted to offer up a tongue lashing but it might have fallen on a group more focused on a droid phone clutched between delicate fingers or lost in a previous reverie with my thoughts scattered and my hopes shattered i had really hoped a few more lives might turn out better instead of shotgun weddings and battered relationships and subsequent divorces the story sounded better in the synopsis or maybe i had higher hopes or the bleakness of the tale shattered my optimistic dreams whatever the reason i found myself more put off than satisfied and that included the mostly unrealistic ending if this story was supposed to represent life it wasn't a life i was particularly interested in living i received this book for free through netgalley cross posted at robert's reads","138":"another case of really liking parts and then wondering why i am reading the book the ending seemed a little strange it kind of felt like the ending was just tacked on to get some ending","139":"i noticed that some of the other reviews aren't very complimentary however i urge you to read it anyway small town life long friends secrets kept and then revealed sounds a lot like life to me i found the writing a pleasure to read butler obviously loves the midwest and it shows although as a southener i can't quite learn to love winter ice or snow","140":"i probably would not have picked this book up on my own but a good friend of mine who knew of my joy in reading suggested it to me she noted that it takes place right here in the eau claire area with very descriptive still unnamed yet easily identifiable places in the area that made for fun reading this is a story about relationships old high school friends and how their life stories continue on in various places but how they are still united and get reunited back in little wing wi what was very unique about the book is that it shifted back and forth between the story line and then soliloquies of the various characters at first it struck me as odd but as the book continued it was really neat how the author wove the two styles together this is a wonderful story about love and pain relationships and the ending of relationships about singing and mourning about hopes and dashed dreams about caring for others when one might not be inclined to care anymore a wonderful read great for residents of wisconsin for sure but for readers of all places too","141":" a unique voice telling the tale of small town americana as told from different points of view the intertwining of lives through the years the complexity of the relationships each one holds with the other the secrets the pains and the triumphs welcome to little wing wisconsin henry aka hank is the strongest link of this group a farmer married to beth a father generally happy with his hometown life...his life the simple sunset the milking of the cows he has a sense of happiness and gratitude a man's whose treasures are not measures in gold but who is truly rich beth married to henry mother holds a secret sometimes loses sight of what is for the road that wasn't traveled she knows how lucky she is and feels guilt because of this motherly to everyone within the group leland aka lee the famous musician that made it big but always comes home no matter what in life lee makes his way home after a tour making a new record dating a movie star - it's his and only his he feels the emptiness of not having someone to share a life with not having children envious of the happiness he sees in his friends having in the simple things and he wants it he thought he had it years ago once ronnie former rodeo star alcoholic and living with a brain injury currently in recovery having a great sense of life living and perspective he has lee as a benefactor best friends that watch after him yet feels caged in and trapped and feels the need to be free kip the small town boy who went to chicago made it big and returned he was never that popular within the group yet came back home to buy the mill make it into something he tends to be more worried about how things appear to others but over time and a few stories especially harvey bunion you see a deeper complexity the town itself is also a character and a metaphor for each one of the characters symbolic as each one speaks and shares a moment a story a secret - and as the words unfold so does the town as a separate entity each time i really enjoyed the tone of the story the weaving of tales the characters that were so well developed the only thing there was so much jumping around - so much back and forth that sometimes it felt a little whiplash and that you missed something but you didn't really good take your time with this one i think this is an author's voice that has been missing in novels lately","142":"struggled on whether to give this book 4 or 5 stars probably really a 4 5 for me i thoroughly enjoyed the story the characters and the writing i couldn't put it down for the most part but i felt the ending resolution was a bit lacking for me at least","143":"most of me really enjoyed this simple story of friends who grew up in a wisconsin farming town i have to admit though that i was getting annoyed with one of the guys it was the very end that made me forgive butler and resulted in a 3 5 star rating","144":" as someone who has moved around a few times i sometimes wonder how my life might be different if i'd remained in the same small town i grew up in everybody knowing one another tolerant of their quirks and watching the families grow and change this book paints one such portrait of a lovely small town in wisconsin and several of the friends who grew up there together some moved away some stayed lives changed in the way that lives do the story is presented in five voices of the friends as they drift apart and come together it's a beautiful tale told in a beautiful way the sixth voice is the writing it is so vivid so clear and beautiful it's a rare treat to really see and feel the story the way i did with this book i realize i should have used a thesaurus instead of being so redundant but there it is thanks nadeen","145":" 4 5 starsthere's no doubt about it nickolas butler can write and his writing will make you feel all the feels the characters in shotgun lovesongs remark that lee's music evolves over time so too does the reader's understanding of the small group of lifelong friends in little wing wisconsin their history actions motivations and life choices butler skillfully accomplishes this with crystal clear prose and a series of five alternating first person narratives not only is this novel evocative of time and place it's full of insight into friendship trust loyalty love marriage indeed into all of life itself my favorite quotes i know this is excessive but there are just so many quotes i loved on small town life here life unfurls with the seasons here time unspools itself slowly moments divided out like some truly decadent dessert that we savor weddings births graduations grand openings funerals mostly things stay the same on summer and then summer comes the green coming in such profusions that you think maybe winter never even happened at all never will come again on winter and then snow snow to cover the world cover us our world left to sleep and rest and heal underneath those white winter blankets the forests that in october threw hallucinogenic confetti at the world now withdrawn bereft composed and suddenly much thinner looking like old people who know their time has just about come on wedding bands i stood at the front of the room beside ronny holding the wedding bands that had come to him through his grandmother his grandfather's old ring almost like the string a forgetful person ties around his finger as a reminder and hers this ring i rubbed between my thumb and index finger within the confines of my pocket felt the softness of the gold imagined all the places the ring had gone all the fingers and objects it had touched i felt the little diamond this was the wedding ring of poor people of middle class america it was a promise of things to come not some gaudy galleria ring some designer monstrosity like the one i bought for chloe on the sunrise lee used to hear music in sunsets jazz i don't know about that and the sunrise i don't think sunrise has a musical sound to me it's like a beautiful woman yawning as she first wakes up or maybe i don't know a baby a baby opening her eyes maybe both on marriage what he could have said is i know you better than you know yourself and this i think is what marriage is all about on forgiveness sometimes that is what forgiveness is anyway a deep sigh on america america i think is about poor people playing music and poor people sharing food and poor people dancing even when everything else in their life is so desperate and so dismal that it doesn't seem there should be any room for any music any extra food or any extra energy for dancing a note on the audio production many of my favorite audiobooks are multi narrator productions and this novel is perfectly suited to that format all five narrators deliver strong believable performances which lend a distinctive voice to each character i highly recommend the audio version it's my favorite so far this year but don't be surprised if you end up wanting a print edition too","146":"3 75 a novel about friendship and trust set in small town wisconsin where people look out for each other and have looooong memories","147":"i try to reserve my 5 star ratings for the extraordinary so i wish i could give this a 4 5 i really liked this book a story of four friends and their small town hometown told from each of their perspectives and from that of one of their wives another childhood friend the first person narratives each had a distinctive voice without overdoing it a great book about friendship love and most importantly how we each define success","148":"this is one of the few times when i think i would have enjoyed the book more if i read it rather than listened to it definitely enjoyed this loved the setting so different than my own experience and sensitive men","149":"the author did a wonderful job evoking a sense of place great depiction of small town wisconsin life","150":"a simple story about four men in a small town who've been friends since childhood and the way their lives have diverged and back together over time the themes in the story fame love marriage financial hardship betrayal loyalty are all common but the author's prose made the story for me it so descriptive and almost lyrical in places","151":" shotgun lovesongs by nickolas butler pub date mar 11 2014 nickolas butler writes beautifully in his debut novel shotgun lovesongs about the trajectory of childhood friendship stunning imagery of rural wisconsin paints the mythical town of little wing where four boys grow up as best friends three leave and return as adults to find the dynamics of their friendships changing and maturing shotgun lovesongs is as much an ode to wisconsin's natural beauty as it is an examination of our oldest intimate relationships forged as children highly recommended for readers of larry watson and david rhodes not to be missed","152":"a beautiful story about friendship u0026amp love against the backdrop of small town america a wonderful first novel","153":"ooooh noooo said with the classic wisconsin rounded os it is such a disappointment that i didn't like this book it seemed pitch perfect for a 30 something reader who grew up in a small wisconsin town and moved away but still has friends a cultural affinity and ambiguous feelings about the place as i started the book i was excited to see references to the packers euchre and the vfw post appear quickly ya der hey but as i continued reading i kept waiting and waiting for some irony depth or nuance to appear in the characters and the plot there was no sign of any of it so i gave up at 100 pages the characters seemed cast from a mold of stereotypical archetypes the brooding but generous rocker the struggling but dependable farmer the damaged hillbilly with a heart of gold side note who in wisconsin joins the rodeo maybe that is something they do over there in the west but i've never heard of it etc etc everything was just so incredibly sincere and so bland it felt like a jon bon jovi song toooo baaad","154":" i am a little biased about this book i had the opportunity to interview the author for a local arts publication volumeone org if you are interested and we share several other connections even if i did not know the author the book is set where i live which adds another layer of bias i am thrilled at seeing the places i frequent and the types of people i know described in print doing my best to ignore those things i still greatly enjoyed this book i love the non linear method of storytelling and i love the sharing of perspectives that sort of nontraditional story is exactly what i need to pick up and enjoy some contemporary fiction more than anything though i love contrast and butler has set up quite a bit in this book fame versus small town life family versus friends old connections and obligations versus new commitments i was left with a few questions about some of the characters' choices and reactions but other reviewers have offered potential explanations that i had not thought of even that is an example of the depth butler has created","155":"4 5 stars one of the best books i've read lately","156":"butler's first book and it is wonderful about 4 people who have been friends forever and the book focuses primarily on their adult lives they are from a small town in wisconsin called little wing terrific character development and story line highly recommend","157":"great writing interesting to read about male friendships from a male point of view pretty slow story line and weak ending","158":"this book was not my cup of tea perhaps i should have done more research and known ahead of time that it was going to be a character study so i could have steered clear i liked the premise of old friends coming back to their hometown and seeing how their relationships have changed and how they've grown apart i think at this point in my life that's something that's easily to relate to but i just couldn't get into this by the time something exciting happened at the end i won't give it away it just seemed so ridiculous if you're into character studies it's well written and you'd probably like it a lot more than me","159":"you can tell i liked a book when i read it in 2 days which is sad because now it is over i thought the characters were very honest i enjoyed how the book was mainly about relationships among men when most books that deal with multiple complicated relationships are about a group of women i think i enjoyed it so much because it was different from other books i usually read or have read lately and it was written so well","160":"beautiful writing interesting characters so so plot","161":"hopes and dreams in small town america lee","162":"essentially the story of 4 guys and a girl from rural wisconsin some who left some who stayed all who return at various times to re connect with the land that formed them told in the voice of the main characters with glimpses into their past one of the most moving heartfelt reads of the year movie rights have been optioned but you should read it first","163":"shotgun love songsnicholas bakerthis is a debut novel so i will definitely be watching for more great reads from this author this is

town life in wisconsin lots of secrets and one devestating secret that he reveals and tests the friendship with his best friend","165":"excellent book compelling personalities","166":"interesting chance to see inside a man's head something i've been seeking without knowing it the voices didn't really sound distinct enough though and beth's voice didn't seem authentically feminine to me","167":"well written strong male friendship theme","168":"i am a sucker for books set in small town wisconsin this was a quick entertaining read by a new author who i suspect will improve with time","169":"i liked this book i had an art class and and english class with mr butler during high school he and my cousin are very good friends this is one more book in my collection of signed books written by people i know i took issue with the lady in the book johanna who mans the station one could staff the station instead having grown up in eau claire i could relate to a lot of it i have been past the strip mall that contains chicken unlimited and the men's clothing store a lot has changed in the city since i lived there but that little part somehow remains the same the art teacher was strangely similar to an art teacher i knew and liked but just different enough that it wasn't an exact caricature i went to that art teacher's funeral several years ago he unfortunately died young i found it harder to relate to the rural parts i have relatives in black river falls and lacrosse but i did not spend a whole lot of time in smaller towns if anything i would go to the twin cities when going out of town i went to a small town for college but moved to a bigger city after that i still really enjoy visiting my hometown though i have heard some accusations that this was written about specific people i don't think it was because the details are just different enough so as not to remind me exactly of anyone i knew but the themes are all there we definitely took different paths after high school i was pleasantly surprised to see ronny's story unfold i was curious about the relationship challenges presented for all characters as i'm at an age where i have as many happily married friends as never married or divorced friends it would be nice to see a sequel i'm particularly interested to see what happens with felicia and kip","170":" went to bed early intending on catching up on sleep then made the mistake of picking up shotgun lovesongs could not put that book down and four hours later i simply decided to give up on my inner guilt trips about getting some sleep and instead kept reading it through the night worth it i'm not great at flowery prose filled reviews so let me try to say this in the simplest terms in the same way that i love population 485 by michael perry for showing the beauty and poetry of living in rural small town wisconsin so too do i love nickolas butler and this book having lived in some of the same places he's dwelled i had heard the now standard story from booksellers and admiring readers that lee a central character in the book is based on justin vernon whom butler is reportedly friends with even if this wasn't true butler writes lee with the kind of warmth and genuine affection that easily makes lee one of your new all time favorite characters in literary history but then i say that and i wanna retract it because almost all of the characters become your new all time favorite characters in literary history they're all wonderful and real and flawed and true all people that you know and people you wish you still knew i just really loved this book a third of the way in i already knew that it was now in my list of top 10 favorite books it's one of those wonderful novels that i'll be gushing about over twitter and dinners and afternoon walks telling friends you have to read it you have to you will love it over and over and over so you have to read it you have to you will love it","171":"growing up in rural wisconsin this was a treat to read butler's sense of imagery with scenery and senses amazed me i thoroughly enjoyed the different chapters he wrote with each of the primary character's perspective it has been difficult for me to find a book that takes place in the midwest primarily wisconsin with a true sense of what it is like his descriptions described home for me","172":"this book had me captured right from the beginning i felt the characters and how they lived but i did not like the ending it left me hanging in a lot of ways the story of the pickled eggs didn't fit with the rest of the story not going to the hospital was plain stupid some of the characters were just dropped and i wanted to know what happened to them the ending seemed rushed i gave it a b","173":"great look at small town midwestern life and the heart of human emotion","174":"a decent book about adult male friendships i liked the split narrative though wondered about giving a female character so much prominence","175":"shotgun lovesongs is the tale of a group of friends all trying to make something of themselves in a small town some make it big some just want to make it to the next day while other try and eventually fake it to try to impress others the main focus is the friendship of leland and hank these guys all grew up together and while hank stays home and becomes a farmer leland is determined to make music and leave that town forever leland makes that happen and becomes a star he travels around the world but as much as he wanted to live now all he wants is to settle down back home he wants to escape the fame and the fake friends that comes with it told in flashbacks and flipping back to present day we learn that beth hanks wife had a fling with leland before she got married while it seems as if she and leland have moved on we see she still thinks about him and vice versa and although beth truly loves her husband she can't help but wonder if something could've happened with leland one night when leland comes back home after his failed marriage he decides to tell hank what happens while drunk rightfully so hank is mad but is his pain valid i mean they weren't together and although they were friends and leland should've know better no one knew they would get back together and marry i truly loved this book it just read very epic and all american in my eyes we all have those group of friends that know us better than we know ourselves these people are our family they are the ones we love and equally hate at times they are there for the highs and the lows and everything in between nikolas butler writes a story that beautifully describes the american life in a small town and a group of friends we can all identify with these characters will capture your soul and you can't help but get invested into them as much as you root for these characters to succeed you want them to know that there is no place like home home is the place that made you who you are and it's the place that will always take you back it never judges it just loves you for you although we are only three months into the year shotgun lovesongs is one of my favorite reads thus far it's just one of books that will stay with you way after you finish it so... do yourself a favor and read it as soon as you can","176":"the book is set in a country town of wisconsin called little wing it's a story of 5 close friends who were born and raised in this small country town who's friendship is slowly drifting in different direction as they reach their mid 30's trying to keep the close bond intact as well as getting through obstacle that life throws at you has proven to be challenging prior to reading this book i had found out that the lead singer of bon iver justin vernon was the inspiration for one of the main characters i've not heard of this band but have since listened to them or do i know how much of the facts in this story are true but i would say that bon iver fan would be rushing out to read it once they find out about the connection however i'm afraid they would be very disappointed and perhaps cheated because i felt the author was trying to make something out of nothing unfortunately this plot was weak and tiresome it read like a rural chick lit but with male protagonist dealing with issues concerning their career love money family and lack of freedom i can see the writer trying to build drama within themes but i don't think the issues that had arisen were problematic or had any substance i have more drama in my family then what was shown here the characters were too good nice that it was to the point of being unbelievable and ludicrous the only good point to this novel is that the rich and crystal clear setting of wisconsin which the author described skillfully and with pride it's the place the author was raised and knows so well and that is the only reason why i've rated this book 2 stars thanks to st martin's press and netgalley for my review copy","177":"i really liked this book it was a slow lazy read charming thoughtful sweet about love and friendship with identifiable characters they're old friends who've grown up together through good and bad they've stayed friends connected by history and not necessarily more than that i don't tend to love third person narratives but i liked hearing perspectives of all the main characters the ending is wrapped in a nice little bow but i found myself smiling at its end","178":"the main character is based on justin vernon bon iver other than that it isn't really notable","179":"little wing wisconsin is a fictional small town that must have a great deal of energy compressed into it the novel deftly switches perspectives and voices among four friends one of whom stays on his family farm while the other go elsewhere to attain great success in their respective fields yet they are always drawn back to the town at its best this is a paean to home and friendship at other times it's awfully hallmarky","180":"five close friends in their 30's all grew up together and then chose different paths both in and away from little wing wisconsin they each narrate their versions of how their relationships intertwine for better or worse","181":"it's been a long time since i read an author who could paint pictures with words nickolas butler first time author knows his way around descriptive adjectives i have never been to wisconsin or anywhere near it but the pictures are now in my head butler writes beautifully four friends hank who never left the dairy farm his family owned leland the famous musician kip the chicago commodities broker and ronny the rodeo star have known each other since they were in kindergarten they have grown up together and are closer than brothers the have shared everything now they are adults trying to reconcile their boyhood friendships with their adult lives and responsibilities of all the relationships i was more invested with lee ronny and lee hank the friendship between ronny and lee is beautiful especially after ronny suffers brain damage lee continues to look after him and love him hank and lee's relationship is damaged by past secrets but they attempt to work through them there have been a lot of books written with multiple girlfriends and their lives and loves but this is the first book i've read that explores the friendships of men men who love each other not in a romantic sense but as brothers and even thought life damages some of these friendships they continue to fight to keep these relationships my only criticism was the abruptness of the ending i guess i wanted a little clarification of what happens next i understood the necessity of the interaction between lee and hank but it needed a smoother ending i received this book free from goodreads com in exchange for an honest review","182":"eh nothing special","183":" some books do a great job evoking a sense of place and a general mood which draw you even further into them nickolas butler's shotgun lovesongs is one such book it's beautifully written--poetic even--and tremendously compelling and i read it between two short flights little wing wisconsin is a small rural town henry lee ronny and kip were best friends who grew up together while henry stayed in little wing to take over his father's dairy farm ronny found some success on the rodeo circuit before his drinking led to a brain injury following an arrest kip moved to chicago to become a broker for the mercantile exchange and lee was the successful one becoming a popular singer ten years later the friends are reunited for kip's wedding as he has returned to little wing to breathe life into the town's defunct mill lee agrees to sing a song at the wedding and he finds himself caught between the magic of a new relationship with a successful actress and the desire to return home where life is simpler but the wedding also causes the start of some stresses among the friends as they deal with the problems of their own lives and the envy frustration jealousy and insecurity of small town life when you've known each other forever the book shifts in perspective between the four friends as well as henry's wife beth who also grew up in little wing and had a special connection with many of the friends it moves back and forth through time touching on the victories and defeats hurts and happy times while some characters are more engaging than others butler has imbued them with such life and complexity that they feel almost larger than life and you find yourself wishing you had friends like these while nothing out of the ordinary happens in the plot it doesn't matter because you become truly invested in their lives shotgun lovesongs is a paean to life in small town america its virtues and its disadvantages it's a book about trying to live your dreams and worrying about what to do if the dreams don't turn out the way you hoped it's a book about how far the power of love can take you and how far the power of friendship can carry you and butler's use of language is so evocative and mesmerizing but yet still simple and appropriate for the story here's an example strange i thought to myself right then how his life was like my own and yet not at all like it though we came from the same small place on earth and why how had our paths diverged why were they still even connected why was he then in my backyard on my farm the sound of almost two hundred cows faintly in the background mooing and lowing how had he come back this famous man this person whose name everyone knew whose voice was recognizable to millions in a way that made it impossible for him to be a stranger in so many places i really loved this book and didn't want it to end i think it would be a great movie as well because i would love to see these characters and their stories play out in front of me again i'd encourage you to take a trip to little wing wisconsin and spend some time with these people their lives might not wow you but their stories will hook you","184":" i'm going to categorize this book as somewhat depressing the central characters are mid thirty adults who grew up together in a small town each now has their own dark path from making it rich to coming home and blowing all his cash to revitalize the town in an effort to be seen as something he's not to another becoming a famous singer who is never fulfilled another as an alcoholic ex rodeo star to the married guy who's knee deep in debt for his farm each character plays out differently but are equally unfulfilled i found myself not really rooting for any of them but wishing they'd be happy as they are while the ex rodeo alcoholic ronny seems to be the ultimate winner the rest are somewhat left without a real ending i liked how the author was able to fully place you in small town america and feel that he did a damn good job creating the town of little wing","185":"i liked it because i grew up in the area where the story takes place he captures the wisconsin rural and small town life perfectly it was not a page turner but it was a pleasant read","186":"i loved this book so much","187":" the story of four childhood friends from a small town whose lives lead them in very different directions they are drawn together for a wedding but soon secrets and resentments emerge that could change their lives forever butler's style of writing is really beautiful and he does well to create a wonderfully atmospheric picture of small town life and the difficulty of friendships that transition from childhood to adulthood the book is told from the perspective of five different people and butler creates richly detailed characters i read this very quickly as it was so addictive and i didn't want it to end it's a moving book about family love friendships and growing up i would recommend it to any general fiction fans as i think it has a broad appeal i can't wait to read what nickolas butler writes next","188":"i really enjoyed this big hearted sentimental love letter to small town americana butler fills his book with characters that do the same funny and stupid and decent and kind and infuriating things that people we all know do and then makes you care about each and every one of them and the language he uses to do so is full of the same beauty as a dawn over a freshly fallen field of snow recommended","189":"i received the book shotgun lovesongs as an advance readers' edition i was immediately excited to read it since i grew up in the general area where the fictional book took place not only was it engaging to read about local points of interest i thoroughly enjoyed the book its story and the characters set in rural northwestern wisconsin shotgun lovesongs paints a picture of a typical small town the main characters in the novel grew up together their lives and friendships intertwined then and do again when they reconnect in their 30s i connected with the characters' within the context of their friendships with each other and their individual stories shotgun lovesongs was a book i had a hard time putting down i couldn't get the story out of my head and couldn't wait to pick it up again to find out what happened","190":"what a fun witty and entertaining read i was not expecting much and was nicely surprised it's a quick unpretentious book about male friendship growing older and life's ups and downs the characters are well defined and realistic i'm looking forward to reading more of nickolas butler's work i received this via first reads","191":" on wisconsin grand old badger state america's diary land home of cattle and corn and butter and brawn all of that rich farmland yields more than what you find on your dinner plate it is fertile grounds for writers as well in nickolas butler's debut small town wisconsin gives birth to a circle of friends whose lives diverge each onto a road less traveled by the others the characters narrate the chapters and through them we learn their stories henry is the hometown boy who stayed put marrying beth the hometown girl theirs is a solid marriage with two young children and a farm that need tending henry's father started the farm and henry continues to manage it and its attendant headaches most of them financial it's a difficult life one full of hard work and stress but he has beth and their children he has everything he wanted beth moved back to be with henry after attempting a career in a local city she has always loved him although part of her continues to be drawn to lee the local boy who made good through her occasional breakups with henry beth always felt an attraction to lee she admits that when she got married part of her wondered about him but she's a faithful wife yes she yearns to travel more and yes she occasionally finds herself curious about life outside of little wing but she's happy she loves her husband and her family lee is henry's best friend the guy henry has always admired but of whom he has never felt jealous if anything lee is jealous of hank's life hank has stayed put while lee has traversed the world as a musician known as corvus he has bedded scores of women sometimes more than one at a time and dates a famous actress but he's always drawn back to little wing it's his touchstone where he goes to center himself lee's other close pal is ronny a former rodeo champion ronny too left little wing to travel the rodeo circuit he was big and powerful and an alcoholic who suffered a brain bleed that left him a bit mentally diminished he has lee though and he has hank and beth he has friends who love and support him he also has the hope that he will meet someone someday and have a family of his own then there is kip who was never as close to hank lee and ronny as they were with each other kip moved to chicago earned a pile of money and came back to little wing buying an old mill and refurbishing it with hope of turning it into something he also came back with his fiancee felicia a city girl who loves him enough to settle their home in little wing kip's chapters are the fewest in the book and in some ways are not necessary he might have been better served if he'd been left a mystery the book's title is the name of lee's debut album written as a paean to his first and perhaps truest love the shotgun is lee's conscience and when he pulls the trigger to shoot it he causes terrible damage to friendships and relationships a gun once fired cannot be un fired and lee learns that lesson the love songs are varied there is the love between man and wife the love between friends the illicit love between those who should not love each other and the love people have for their hometowns butler clearly adores wisconsin and his details give the novel a life apart from its characters whether the old timers who enjoy drinking beer at the vfw hall or the large jar of pickled eggs or the boarding house where lee lived when he recorded shotgun lovesongs we see little wing and it becomes alive for us apparently this is a take off on the life of bon iver someone whose music i am not terribly familiar with and of whom i know nothing you won't need to either in order to appreciate this novel i enjoyed the way butler wrote his book i liked getting into the heads of henry lee ronny and beth even if i occasionally disliked a couple of them and yes i'm talking to you lee and beth i adored henry though he is everything that is good about midwestern folk reliable strong loyal and good he's a man who can forgive even if he doesn't realize that himself he wants needs to see the best in people and he learns to accept them when they give him their worst it's a lesson that comes with no small amount of pain for him but his goodness and straightforwardness keep propelling him forward this is a good one don't pass it by published on cupcake's book cupboard @vivaamarisata","192":"good read the friendships shared over a long period of time were interesting i am from the area written about so that was fun to read the references one character's obsession with another's wife bothered me will look at the author's other works","193":"an amazing book just loved it from the first page","194":"this is an outstanding first novel about friendship and loyalty among men both tender and raw a love letter to the upper midwest and the pull of home one of the main characters is based on the songwriter bon iver for some people that's a draw but also recommended if you like michael perry david wroblewski david rhodes this is milkweed prize caliber debut","195":"it was better and worse than what i was expecting the writing was done well but the story came up just short of making me care side note i can definitely see bon iver in the rock star character","196":"some friends from small town wisconsin grow up one of them grows up to be indy rock star bon iver one of them writes a book about a group of friends who grow up one of whom becomes an indy rock star many debut novels are thinly disguised autobiographies and it's somewhat refreshing that this one doesn't pretend otherwise each character writes in his or her own voice and perhaps unsurprisingly this leaves some narratives strong and and authentic and others particularly the female voices weak and unbelievable there were a few moments so poignant and heart breaking i nearly wept or gasped or closed the book unable to bear the next paragraph other parts were just silly it will be fascinating to see what writing nickolas butler might do now that his big hometown tale has been told","197":" kind of predictable with a rather unnecessarily dramatic ending the writing was fine but a bit too heavy handed on the setting as a character thing i guess i've read more than enough books with the 4 5 friends from high school where each is a type the temperamental artist the greedy successful business man needing to prove himself to his friends the sweet sad sack who everyone loves and wants to take care of the all around good guy who stays back home and the girl everyone loves the characters are a bit stock it was a quick read and a decent story but nothing particularly new or interesting","198":"butler's debut novel tackled some really important topics with realism and elegance the characters were intriguing each riddled with personal issues from their past the ending was perfection the grammatical and spelling errors along the way detracted from the novel's brilliance however","199":"friendship forgiveness and the word 'forever' stayed up most of the night finishing this wonderful story and i'm not sure i can do it justice here suffice to say that it made me want to be both a better person and a better writer i really cared about the characters how hard life can be to get right and how easy it can be to get wrong","200":"loved this ones loved henry and beth and sweet ronny loved the friendships and relationships and small town feel","201":"somewhere between 3 and 4 stars an entertaining fast read captures much of the midwestern spirit well and includes a bon iver inspired character i liked the wisconsin pride that shined through though lots of wisconsin binge drinking pride too","202":"file this under wisconsin nostalgia it made me miss wisconsin something fierce which is probably why it landed at 5 stars man i miss wisconsin","203":"i enjoyed this book i really like the picture it paints of rural communities in the mid western united states","204":"as a girl growing up on a 47 acre hilly wisconsin dairy farm i dreamed two future lives for myself one of living in the country as a veterinarian tending to dairy herds the other of traveling the world living in cities my occupation fuzzy as it turns out save for the veterinarian degree i did a bit of both and by my thirties dug my heels in for a life in northern wisconsin this tension of whether to settle or strike out is at the heart nickolas butler's first novel shotgun lovesongs no matter the decision--rootedness or restlessness--his characters wrestle with their choices butler tells his story of modern rural life through the perspectives of five childhood friends now in their thirties from fictional little wing wis henry and beth are married with children and a herd of cows they are the bedrock across which all the characters intersect and interact henry's best friend is the wandering lee a successful musician based loosely on butler's friend bon iver who is on the road but returns home beaten and bedraggled to recover over and again ronny is a popular rodeo rider who has achieved a modicum of success and much like a ex football star is left with little to do once it is over in contrast kip who has achieved financial success as a trader in chicago tho remains woefully socially challenged he has returned home in hopes of winning the town over by buying the old grain mill in town a place that holds the history and hope for the future the book begins and ends with a wedding with a few more in between my mother read it with her book group and introduced it to me by reading the start of a wedding scene--just one of many details about small town life that butler nails down \"in the balcony a widow began playing the church's gassy old organ and everyone rose loudly the processional music was meant of course to be a march but the widow played it like a dirge \"we laughed reminded of my cousin diane's wedding when hazel the church organist played like a dirge and on her own schedule butler not only gets the details of rural wisconsin life he gets the people too my husband read the first chapter and looked at me and said \"he's writing about our people \" by that he's writing about community about people who take care of one another have each other over for dinner and attend one another's weddings butler even got the women right they drink wine out of jelly jars share secrets at the vfw and start jogging when faced with a trip to new york city","205":"welcome to wisconsin a great tail of your origins why home is home and what makes living in wi what some people continue to crave for their lives it has some great connections between male characters which is refreshing for its depth and truth","206":"it's just good start to finish","207":"at first i wasn't crazy about the book but as i read deeper the characters opened up particularly kip and lee there were some chapters in the middle of the book where i found tears running down my face at the raw and humble thoughts expressed on the page stick with it my heart was convinced at the end of the goodness of people","208":"this quiet slice of life story of five friends in a small rural town in wisconsin is expertly performed by five different narrators i've read a lot of books about female friendship it was interesting to examine male friendship and how it evolves and changes over time and how it can impact and affect other relationships a compelling beautiful story and a satisfying audio book","209":"small town vibes","210":" this is a big chill set up 4 male friends from a small wi town called little wing rather than the larger group as in the movie but much the same nuance some stay some went they return for weddings or events as they have taken different courses and directions and it is easy read and told in alternating chapters of each male 4 in the group of childhood and h s friends and henry's wife it ends before any of them have hit any true consideration or encroachment of middle age as if their marriage choices or money partnerships or deep compromises in work or lifestyle have set the determined road all around lol that's basically my problem with this kind of tale and especially if it has the spirit or sense of the small town immersion which this does to a t everything about the small town context and direct writing and speech of american plains or midwest nature i love it parts of this book start to give you the sense of that space just these month i have been focusing on midwest lake nature and flatland novels and there are some masters who can write it but in this book the people just did not come fully alive to me as being midwestern at all they were nice enough small town life your neighbors know your nature and these midwest ones often embrace you ultimately regardless of your flaws or successes yes success is often hardest to forgive but these men i know wisconsin iowa illinois indiana michigan and especially in their lakes and rivers and minnesota almost as well at least parts of the se section my best friend of 60 years grew up in hibbing so where are the cheesehead hats and no hockey player stories or more tales of hunting fishing or winter treks with these boys or worrying about who they are going to leave their packers tickets to in their will if they don't have kids rodeo instead strange actually i thought nicolas butler did better with the female voice than with the male voices especially kip's the setting was much enjoyed and i loved sections of this book when he encompassed nuance of midwestern space good first novel i just did not connect to the characterizations as wisconsin alive and real here they were flat william kent krueger is an author who does midwest male and american plains well authentic gut real maybe this author can get there if he leaves the neighborhood of chick lit midwest men usually will not dwell there","211":"i loved this until the last 10% i had to rush through a long and gross scene that was followed by a hasty ending","212":"this book was a nice quick read not great literature but a nice diversion for some summertime reading","213":"this is a very good story winding around a group of friends and each of their perspectives on their life journey you will find brotherhood friendships love arguments danger and more in this read","214":"i listened to the audio cd for this book it was a very humorous and enjoyable story the story is about a group of friends who grew up together in a small town in wisconsin it's a story about life in a small town it's about marriage relationships growing up and much more i higly recommend this audio book the author is very descriptive his language is very poetic throughout the cd the voices they chose were perfect too i can't wait to listen to it again","215":"i liked it picked it up from the shelf because i liked the title","216":"really enjoyed this one small town wisconsin and the bonds that connect childhood friends","217":"not much happens but it's still an enjoyable read about midwestern small town relationships","218":"we think the world is steady rolling through space beneath our feet day and night rain and sunlight and then one day you just fall off the planet and drift away into outer space and everything you thought was true all the rules and norms that kept things in place that kept you in place they're gone and nothing makes sense anymore gravity is gone","219":" i won this book as part of a goodreads giveaway this isn't necessarily the type of book i would usually choose to read i love books with a lot of action adventure suspense and a climax that keeps you on the edge of your seat this book does not have these things however it is a beautiful story about friendship and how it changes as we grow older and grow up i loved the way the book ended but i'm still sad that i won't be reading about these friends any longer i look forward to reading more of butler's work in the future","220":"i enjoyed this book there was interesting story line that flowed nicely from character to character it is not the best written novel but it is the first by the author so well done","221":"nice story no mystery no exciting plot lines days in the lives of a bunch of nice people","222":"good book much better than i expected","223":"full of heart and full of love makes me feel like i'm at home and all the characters are my best friends","224":"it's a decent holiday read slightly saccharine i was expecting something a bit grittier i really didn't like the chapters being narrated by 5 different characters i think it would have read better as a one character pov the author could have done much more with the story of lee and beth and as a result it didn't feel 'whole' a few events loosely stitched together disappointing","225":" i really liked this it's a slow moving character study type of book so don't be expecting a lot of action though there are some tense moments the story is told from different perspectives of a group of friends the only even slightly negative thing i'd say is that the characters voices weren't that different they are all different characters but when i was reading for example a lee chapter i don't know that i would have known it was him 'speaking' if not for the subject matter they just didn't sound that different from each other but it was still a great read","226":"my partner told me i would enjoy this book and he was right 5 stars loved the perspectives of the main characters always makes a great read","227":"i am so happy that i won this book i don't think that i would have picked it up off the shelf when its released but now after having read it i'm completely in love with this story i love books that draw to deeply on the nature of our lives this book forces you to fly away with it i really felt like i was there in little wing going through those real and raw emotions with every one this will be a book i go back to read over and over again","228":"i different kind of story linear but each chapter is told from a different characters perspective as the situation evolves i'm not sure i really liked lee the main character but a good read","229":"this was an enjoyable book i appreciate how real the characters are how relatable their emotions are what struck me the most is the truth that no matter where you end up in life people are people we all have the same emotional needs and wants regardless of how much or how little we have a deep relationship with yourself and with those you love is both the key to sanity and madness","230":" 3 5 the characters seem a little canned the plot done before but there were parts of the book that just as i was about to roll my eyes pulled at me and brought me back in particularly one character individually lee there are some astute observations he makes about living in a small town how it never really leaves you no matter how far you run poignant observations about life love and friendship that makes you want to call your childhood best friend in the middle if the night those saving graces make this book worth the read in my opinion despite the 'been there done that' plot line","231":"christ guys man up","232":"i thoroughly enjoyed visiting this group of friends from small town wisconsin i just didn't want to leave them it was well written","233":"this novel explores friendship and everything that could make or break it love loyalty betrayal and broken trust what is different for me is that it's the first time i've read a novel that tells such a tender story about friendship between men it's heartwarming to read how these men love and care for each other above all when one becomes disabled after an accident all but one jumps in to help in whatever way they can lee being as famous as he is can't let go of his roots and his love for little wing and his dear friends this novel was just lovely to read full review here","234":" i was initially drawn to this novel because it is set in a small town very near my hometown the setting is important with butler giving place as much significance as david rhodes does in his novels about the driftless area of wisconsin the major themes of shotgun lovesongs are male friendships and the way the place you grew up can pull you back against all odds well into the book i was dismayed as the plot dissolved and the narrative voice switched to my least favorite character what i perceived as a flaw was thankfully short lived and butler's skill reasserted itself as the characters are buffeted by the shock waves that threaten their friendships","235":"gone are the easy friendships of youth between mid westerners kip ronny lee henry and beth told in alternating pov's adulthood brings marriage financial success and even fame but also disillusion and setbacks character flaws are revealed and friendships are bent but not broken one of the best depictions of male friendships i've read","236":"sappy in the ways i rarely like books to be sappy authentically small town wisconsin sweet touching and kept me reading and some really nice writing in it too","237":"i really enjoyed the writing in this novel about a group of friends and how their relationships develop over time","238":" if i were a blue collar bon iver worshipping bro from small town wisconsin i'd lose my mind over this book as it stands now it's nice i actually loved the parts about the town i loved that everyone hung out at the vfw i loved reading about the town that's pretty much falling apart physically and financially i loved that they all still care about an old mill and i really loved that they have picked eggs in bars that just seems like something you'd see in a dive bar in the upper midwest it was well written and funny but also took itself a little too seriously especially the parts with lee the big rock star based on justin vernon the frontman for bon iver i had a hard time believing lee was that famous especially because 80% of the country probably has to google lead singer for bon iver but in a small town especially one that seems to be crumbling i suppose it's possible he is a hometown hero the one thing i appreciate is that it's a story about a group of friends but not necessarily about a pack of women it's refreshing that they went there without going into hangover territory and as far as bromantic comedies go this one has potential i didn't love this story but i do think nikolas butler is a good writer and i'm interested to see what he can do in forthcoming books","239":"shotgun lovesongs was an enjoyable heartwarming and mesmerizing read i have to admit when i saw the cover and title of this book it did not jump out at me and although it is usually a tendency for myself as well as others to judge a book by its cover i would have to say to do so with this book people would certainly be missing out on a beautifully written story","240":"this is a story made great by its characters who are drawn in three dimensions and fully developed it's a story of old friends nostalgia hopes dreams home and community and how the nature and concept of each of those things changes over time there are no frills here no huge overblown drama or knock out 'moment' but it's all the better for that leaving it feeling very real and genuine i also love that one of the characters lee is based on bon iver something i only discovered after finishing reading it","241":" i wanted to like this book more than i did but parts of it were so cliche and overwrought that i kept putting it down and picking up other books instead i read ten other books between when i started and finally finished it not a good sign also looking back having lee so closely resemble justin vernon is a weird choice butler hasn't spoken to vernon since high school so none of this is at all based on fact yet the parallels are clear was he just trying to piggyback that said there were parts that i liked the character of ronnie in particular and i'm looking forward to books hopefully with a more developed writing style from butler in the future","242":"i received this book as a first reads giveaway i really enjoyed this book as someone who reads a lot of ya and a lot of memoirs i wasn't sure how i would fare i was hooked early on and my attention was kept throughout i enjoyed the characters and the language was conversational which made for an easy read overall it was a fantastic debut novel that i would heartily recommend","243":"unlike many of the reviewers i really enjoyed this novel i found it beautifully written i thought the characters were appealing i loved the setting in farmland wisconsin and i really enjoyed the story of what home means and what friendship means i think the author wants to show the wholesome world of middle america though i will say this is a very white washed world","244":" i might not have liked this book as well if it weren't written by a wi author and hadn't taken place a few miles from where i live it's a story of 4 male life long friends with the main character being one who became a famous rich musician each chapter is written by one of the men in the first person and a couple chapters are written with one of their wives as the first person there are bug and small conflicts between the men it's a good story and accurately describes many aspects of a small rural town i agree with some other reviewers that the characters all sounded alike as far as writing style and it may have been better written in the third person also if everything could be solved by binge drinking we'd have fewer problems in the world even so i'm glad it was chosen by our book club as a summer read","245":"loved this book want a wonderful writer feels so great to find such a writer didn't want to finish it his description and characters are out of this world can't wait to read more of his work","246":"i'm really between 4 and 5 stars but i can't explain why it is not one or the other i really liked this book and the characters but i'm not sure i ever really fell in love with at least one of the characters","247":" we invited him to all of our weddings he was famous we addressed the invitations to his record company's skyscraper in new your city so that the gaudy gilded envelopes could be forwarded to him on tour--in beirut helsinki tokyo thus begins the story of five friends hank henry lee leland ronny kip and beth who grew up together in the small town of little wing wisconsin and who are preparing to attend kip's wedding to felicia hank is the farmer who married beth who loves being married to hank and raising her family yet is still her own person lee the famous musician who rocketed to fame as a result of his album \"shotgun lovesongs \" ronny the retired rodeo performer who suffered a brain injury that stopped his career short but still wishes he could be travelling and kip who has come back to renovate the local mill after making it big on the chicago exchange and is about to marry felicia their lives are both intertwined and yet have grown apart in some ways the interconnections sometimes coming in unexpected ways i was torn between the parts of this novel i loved and the parts i just didn't care much for at all so am giving this a three the characters are well drawn out and believable particularly kit and ronny by the end they were probably my favourite characters of all along with lucy perhaps because i don't like the taste of alcohol although my friends and extended family mostly do nor do i enjoy the feeling of inebriated i got bored with the antics of drunk people in real life at a very young age and this wasn't any better for me in this novel particularly given that they were well beyond their college years despite the affection i felt for some of the characters while i understand that plenty of people swear sadly myself included at times i don't need to read as much of it as was in the book to get the idea i felt a mix in some of the other things if you don't mine reading scenes of people in their thirties high on pot with alcohol at almost every social gathering they have and or swearing doesn't bother you you may well enjoy this book better than i did for at all so am giving this a three the

like there was no real plot if someone asked me to summarize the whole book i wouldn't be able to tell much in terms of plot progression it wasn't bad and i enjoyed reading i just didn't feel that emotion of reading the ending a great novel","249":"a charming bromance with big feelings for small town wisconsin","250":"i really enjoyed this book it made me think a lot about places hometowns and what a location can mean to me i highly recommend this book","251":" is it that i am in a mid life crisis that i like coming of age stories especially about men or better about friends because that is wat shotgun lovesongs is all about friendship friendship gained lost found regained re lost re regained etc and that might be one of the most important themes in a man's life audible brought this one to me and it is a good performance by four men and one woman their charachters are well expressed by theorie voices my favorite part is the dance i hoped it would never end and i think lee thought the same and maybe even beth did","252":" i live in a tiny farm town in illinois and this book's small town midwest setting feels authentic and comforting it's obvious that the author grew up in a small wisconsin town himself i admire the author's plain but vivid language which captures the essence of the setting perfectly i grew so close to the characters in this book that i found myself both rooting for them and arguing with them at separate times as i would with my own friends maybe it's because i appreciate a well written first novel or because the book truly feels like home or because i live the ins and outs of small town life but i fell in love with shotgun lovesongs some argue that the ending or the bromance was too unrealistic and dramatic but it didn't feel that way for someone who knows how life here works i did feel a bit of a drag in the dialogue here and there and that too much emphasis was placed on lee but overall i think this one is going to stick with me for a while","253":"mr butler's melancholic friendship elegy with many comedic moments channels garrison keillor through richard russo and maybe a little raymond carver no small feat","254":" a very good book it talks about a life in a very cold part of our country and does it quite well i was cold reading parts of the book almost freezing like they were it is a tale about male friendships music farming rodeo and i recommend it to anyone who likes to read i loved that the only bar in town was the vfw because i have a friend who talks about her family going there they are an institution in those great lake's small towns i think the book begs for a sequel because the characters do have more to share with their readers","255":"i really enjoyed this book being familiar with this area of wisconsin i could connect to the characters and places described the ending wasn't predictable and i thought it was handled nicely reading this has made me long for a paper boat of cheese curds and some good friends to share them with","256":"really fun book about growing up in small town wisconsin it has the point of view of people that stayed in their hometown and those that returned after many years away","257":"each chapter told from the perspective of a different character great story highly recommend","258":"one of the best books i've read all year","259":" i am not sure what you call a male chick lit book but nikolas butler's debut novel shotgun lovesongs seems to be it it's a story of small town folk with one exception a indie rocker who hits the big time but still calls little wing wisconsin home it is a story of growing older the meaning and importance of family and friends trying to figure out what's important in life with the emphasis on trying the novel is told from shifting perspectives so the reader gets insights from not only each character but how those characters view each other both by visiting the past as well as the present day story but getting down to it and back to my chick lit reference it all ends up being a bit too much on the soap opera y side but with a healthy dose of testosterone or maybe bro ness i would go as far as to say it's a full blown wmfun white male fu0026amp ck up novel but the elements are certainly there a good enjoyable enough read with very well rounded full characters but just never feeling like it had full lift off with the prose caring connecting with the characters or really having something to say","260":"an unexpectedly enjoyable grab from the library shelf","261":"loved this book beautifully written","262":"i mean there was potential here but i feel like it got kind of squandered in cliches the hometown girl everybody adores beth the lovable fuck up ronny the arrogant guy who left and made money and came back to bless the town with it kip the straight arrow good guy henry i did like this book and it has its moments where that potential for something better arises the characters are fully realized although kip probably could've done with more exposition and highly normal being from small town wisconsin myself i recognized a lot of homey references and allusions to places and ideas that are uniquely ours that's probably what saved the book for me really had this been set in rural ohio or nebraska i don't think i could've gotten into it much at all","263":"best book i've read in a long time if you grew up in a small farm town and left this book will make you long for what used to be his writing transports you to a time and place outstanding","264":"really enjoyed this one a story about growing up and living in a small town longtime friendships and the strain of secrets and adulthood highly recommend","265":"i thought the ending was pretty anticlimactic the author was pretty heavy handed with the profanities all in all though a very good read the imagery was breathtaking and the small town backdrop was very relatable","266":"i enjoyed reading about complicated male friendships for a change","267":"shotgun lovesongs is a story about four friends living in a small wisconsin town...but truly it could be any small american town if you grew up in a rural agricultural community you will be able to identify with this debut novel although the reviews tend to be mixed i truly enjoyed this book i became intertwined with the characters and grew connected and concerned about their lives they were friends who loved and cared deeply about each other they all had their flaws and that made the story even more believable you just don't see that type of friendship any longer and it was refreshing","268":" i live in wisconsin and that was the feature that drew me to this book originally along with the synopsis i enjoyed the point of view this book used telling more or less the same story from the point of view of the five main characters with each taking a turn advancing the story giving little nuances that come from their perspective i thought the characters were nicely developed and we saw how each contributed to the overall story in their unique way the story is quite predictable however and each character is a bit too similar to the other even the one female voice to be completely believable the plot is pretty predictable but maybe just because the story of the washed up little midwestern town that everyone leaves as soon as high school is over is one that many of us lived overall this was an enjoyable read that probably got the fourth star because of my familiarity with the make believe setting read if you are a guy and want to be able to relate to your spouse significant other on a book","269":"this is the book i chose to take on vacation with me to read at the beach i'm glad i did i really liked it could be because i can relate being from a small georgia town i hope to see future books from nickolas butler","270":"eau claire wisconsin what else is there to say","271":"there is no action no mystery just a compelling simple story of male friendship and bonds that were developed in childhood in rural wisconsin written with a great deal of warmth","272":"this book came along at just the right time definitely what i needed right now as the one of the quotes on the back cover of my arc suggested yes it did make me want to call old friends or in this case email and soon make phone calls a story about a group of close friends family love music booze and the ups and downs that come with life enjoyed how each chapter was from the point of view from a different character i'm ready for more from nickolas butler","273":"good literary fiction debut really focuses on characters relationships and the small town that roots them together it's not flashy and not a lot happens but isn't that how our lives really are really enjoyed and look forward to more of his work","274":"i didn't want it to end i felt like the characters were apart of my family","275":"enjoyable and well written","276":"i really loved this book","277":"it sort of felt like much was made of \"shotgun lovesongs\" by nicholas butler when it was first released and this kind of confused me during the first chapter when i had to find a way to read between eyerolls this is one of those stories about lifelong friends and a small wisconsin town this one has the added bonus of a indie rock star character penned by an author who grew up with bon iver so there is the happily married couple the musician who craves his hometown and his best friend's girl the former rodeo star with brain damage and the asshole money dude who returns from living large in chicago to save the small town so so folksy it's an easy plot with tiny dips curves and bleeps and during one of the more significant plot quickenings i was so pissed off i refused to pick up the book for days ultimately i decided it's a nice book that won't hurt anyone","278":"i won an advanced copy from goodreads first reads even though i had no recollection of signing up for it i secretly believe that they looked at my goodreads profile and handpicked me personally to read this because of my love of small town u0026amp farm stories and shotgun lovesongs is no exception even though the title just makes me cringe little wing wi and its inhabitants won my heart and made me reminisce about growing up in a little midwestern town only little wing has better scenery shotgun lovesongs is actually the name of a struggling musician's first album the one that he wrote about his best friend's wife who he secretly is in love with and the one that brought him fame fortune and a perfectly gorgeous movie star wife despite all that he can't tear himself away from little wing and his friends each of these friends has their own chapters to relate the story of their lives from multiple perspectives which i think makes it all the more interesting and it was done very well without bogging the flow of the story down at all the author grew up in eau claire and his love of wisconsin is glaringly obvious through his beautiful descriptive narrative although the setting and the idea of it was familiar to me the characters were unlike anyone i know you have your townsfolk who can't wait to leave the town which i can relate to and those who have never left there's the unending questioning of their selves--what if i had married her instead or what if i'd stayed in chicago those types of things everyone at some point asks themselves this was a surprisingly enjoyable read and i thank you first reads for choosing it just for me","279":"read for our book club we always enjoy reading local artists and local stories was really good seemed like author liked the bon iver story a lot of similarities","280":" this book reminds me of tom mcneal's books butler paints rural wisconsin as vividly and lovingly as mcneal does northwest nebraska if you've ever lived in a small town in the midwest you'll recognize so much in this book the characters are recognizable and likable but the strength of this book lies in it's descriptions of friendship seasons time and place a reviewer writes this is a talented thoughtful writer who throws his characters against the singular wisconsin backdrop and coaxes them to live and breathe read shotgun lovesongs with caution these guys will stay with you for a while my favorite review says in fresh gorgeously wrought prose butler weaves an intricate irresistible tale of friendships old new lost and found of love and betrayal of forgiveness of growing up and most of all of what it means to be 'home ' hooray for this warm wise bighearted book i should have just said that to start with","281":"in shotgun lovesongs we experience a progression through time as five lifelong friends nurture and later renegotiate friendships the setting is little wing wisconsin hank married beth and is bound to the family they created and the family farm beth hanks wife held a special place in the heart of each friend ronny went on to be a handsome rodeo rider but was destroyed by the rough rodeo circuit and alcohol sometimes he looks like his old self but in reality he is badly brain damaged kip a successful chicago commodities trader has returned to little wing to restore it's decrepit mill lee a newly successful musician is drawn back home periodically to refresh in audio the individual characters are a unique blends of energy love humor and all give you that true feeling of what it means to be home however the story is authentic and some very rough turns must be negotiated the bonds this group formed in childhood remain intact through a decade of physical separation and sporadic contact but when they reunite in little wing they learn none of them are the boys they once were and their relationships with each other are now complicated by the men they have become a ballad of friendship love and home perhaps my small town roots made the story more endearing but i would encourage anyone to explore this novel by the way lee's haunting first album lends the novel its name","282":"a poignant account of childhood friendships grown up it feels real lovely and bittersweet in so many different ways","283":"wow i wasn't expecting to like this book but the more i read the more i got sucked in i loved it perhaps because i am from a small town too and that ending","284":"i really really liked this book read it in two days","285":" what i like about this book was that of all the places in the world it takes place in wisconsin shotgun lovesongs traces the lives of 5 childhood friends and how their lives differed from each others and yet they are still connected by one place little wing it's truly amazing that these 5 friends have stayed together for so long and yes fights have come and gone misunderstandings happen in the end they are still a family that forgives each other and tries to stick to each other book was won via goodreads","286":"an excellent first novel his love of the land shines through plain spoken language a delight","287":" 4 5 it almost cracks the top of the charts for me but i think it could improve ever so slightly i read this book because of this review by a friend who has always directed me toward good music and good writing if nothing else check out the bon iver clip at the end of the review so pretty http corduroybooks wordpress com 20 wlc says it's the best novel of the year i don't know about that but i will say for all of the readers from midwest small towns you will love the subject of this book it's friendship and growing up and trying to get out having an exit plan and holy hell that resonates with me this was a dog eared page america i think is about poor people playing music and poor people sharing food and poor people dancing even when everything else in their lives is so desperate and so dismal that it doesn't seem that there should be any room for any music any extra food or any extra energy for dancing i grew up at these town hall dances and potlucks and butler is so true in these lines as a minor side note another friend grew up in this fictional little wing and knows the author and lee so i kept looking for her appearance between the lines","288":"this is a story about high school friends now in their early 30s from the same small town in wisconsin little wing a town that is dying but that keeps drawing all of them back in the story is told sequentially by each of the four also by the wife of one of the four she also grew up with them and theirs is the rare story of a couple who is very much in love shotgun lovesongs is the title of an album issued by one of the friends now a very successful rock musician the other three are a local farmer an ex rodeo rider who has had a head injury and a hedge fund manager now real estate developer this is a first novel and i will want to be reading more from butler as i think he has a lot of talent he uses language well and also understands relationships i stood and went to her understanding right then that we were already growing older that we would grow old together i think you're beautiful we kissed again and held hands as we walked downstairs our garments good enough eleanore pre teen daughter had begun listening to certain music in the privacy of her still pink bedroom they didn't get together like they always used to so close they might be horses in a stall their shoulders rubbing talking to each other behind cupped hands laughing in a way that made you wish they'd include you there are some repetitions of phrases or focus which are alternately interesting or annoying after different episodes characters are described as being wine drunk champagne drunk and one beer drunk strong phrase but would have been far more effective used once rather than three times there is also an interest in color watching the sun come up purple and orange and pink the creeks glinting silver and blue the teardrop ponds the innumerable lakes the yellow gravel roads and the blacktop you hear that tone that note i swear to god that color over there that pink color when that pink color starts to really blush it's like this note i can't describe it this sweet high note while by no means the focus of the book there are also interesting observations on cities the musician never feels at home in new york and the farmer wants to get back to little wing however beth the wife reminisces to a high school teacher who described the excitement of cities as thousands upon thousands of informative conversations building on each other and this concept of city was an original take overall my sense is that butler is better at describing situations and circumstances than at plot as he could not seem to figure out where these characters were going however the writing and reading style is easy so i am looking forward to his next work","289":" butler writes a beautiful story about a group of friends who grow up in a small wisconsin town we experience their journey into adulthood with all of the changes that implies in the first chapter butler introduces the friends and really nails the way guys interact with each other butler does have a few women in the mix but as i'm a guy i can't tell if he nails their interactions although it seems he does subsequent chapters further develop the characters and their interactions and unlike many other character based novels i've read i really identify with these guys great book","290":"this book was great writing and the author created dynamic characters rumors are that this will be a movie it would make an excellent movie","291":"i really loved this book i grew up in wisconsin and the novel evoked many memories of the state it captured the physical landscape of northern wisconsin the fields and forests and streams in a way that no other book has the characters were well drawn and there was a palpable sense of love and history and wariness between them only flaws i could cite would be the last 50 pages or so where things get a little ridiculous","292":"i'm having trouble deciding how i felt about this book it took me a while to really become interested but then i was kinda hooked there were some chapters i loved and others i just could have done without","293":"so basically the action in this book centers around the fact that the protagonist and his now wife decided to see other people after college and she got with one of his high school buddies which is like half the town but its a thing because hes that dude from bon iver the other three women in this book are cliche big town rich bitches and a good hearted stripper who can still get freaky while pregnant on her wedding day","294":"a story like a million others nothing remarkable or unique not terrible just not better than ok","295":"this book has some good characters but a somewhat choppy plot and often atrocious profanity just to be using atrocious profanity i grew up 15 miles south of wisconsin and the portrayal of midwesterners was often insulting at best","296":"an old fashioned read in a good way this is in essence a story of friendship between men i love butler's description of small town wisconsin its land its weather its people some gorgeous prose here the ending was a bit overwrought but acceptable in this context","297":"fast read bittersweet story about male friendships from boyhood through adulthood","298":"wonderfully evocative novel of friendship in a small wisconsin town u0026amp how friends change and are changed by growing up and away from each other gets the appeal of small town rural life totally right the friendship of 4 young men u0026amp the woman who is at the center of their lives is so real you could swear you know them","299":"great character driven novel that is simultaneously simple and complex left me wanting more","300":" back in the day i was a huge fan of the tv show thirtysomething back when i was still in my teens and thirty something seemed impossibly distant and terribly romantic babies and briefcases i loved all the navel gazing angst the soap operatic lives hope steadman's hair i wanted to be hope a writer a mother wife to a hunky kind of dorky husband amazingly now that i'm fortysomething i got most of what i wished for except the babies and i definitely don't have that hair i derived the same sink into a comfy chair and be entertained pleasure from nickolas butler's shotgun lovesongs as i did from that iconic pre grunge television series lots of hunky guys gorgeous women everyone leading terribly romantic lives with heavy doses of angst and melodrama all to a great soundtrack the character lee is based on justin vernon the singer songwriter behind bon iver a favorite band of mine butler knows vernon from their eau claire schooldays i have to chuckle when i read the professional reviews of shotgun lovesongs it's as if--at least in the critics' eyes--butler has broken new literary ground by telling a straight forward story about the emotional journeys of everyday characters set against the backdrop of domestic life weaving in the antics of bffs and entanglements of the heart women authors have been doing this for years in case they hadn't noticed there's even a whole category devoted to these stories women's fiction although women's fiction is largely ignored by professional reviewers and award givers readers have known for years that a sentimental story with empathetic characters and relatable themes can be deeply satisfying nickolas butler has a terrific sense of place and his affection for his homeland of wisconsin is so evident it had this devoted pacific northwesterner recall her years in the midwest with homesick longing the characters are warm and cuddly all wrapped in flannel and carhartts this is meat and potatoes comfort food reading the plot's a bit of lycra stretched too tightly and occasionally butler falls in love with his own voice veering to purple poetic phrasing but it has the same small town america charm as a bob seger song you'll be singing mainstreet if only because you can't actually discern the words to any bon iver song","301":"great characters great setting i couldn't put it down","302":"so i give this book 4 5 out of 5 stars because of the first about 60 pages that were a bit boring to me this book made me cry and it also made me laugh i really loved the characters especially beth i liked the writing style i am kind of sad about this book because of those 60 pages at the beginning that were a bit boring if those 60 pages had some interesting events i am sure that i would give this book 5 out of 5 stars i think that everyone should read it","303":"didn't love the ending and i felt the book revolved a little too much around lee i did think that there was a lot of really great stuff in here about community small towns childhood friendships etc and i think i wanted more exploration or a deeper dive on that angle a good read though","304":"there are no words it's beautiful and haunting","305":"3 5 starsi really enjoyed the relationship between all the characters i would have liked a different ending one that tied things together a bit more","306":"i absolutely loved this book check out my review on my blog","307":"a little slow moving but great character development","308":"not a lot of stories about male friendships written by a male this one was very good","309":"home agianthis story is everyone's story who hails from a small midwest town lives of the everyday person who ordinary lives are extraordinary and exquisite in the pain joy loss and love of life i have lived there and left i can't go back but i was there for a moment again in this precious book","310":"the story of four friends from little wing wisconsin one of them becomes a famous rock star but from time to time he returns to little wing to his friends and to the woman he loved when he was young the one for whom he wrote his first album shotgun lovesongs there's no way i can explain how beautiful this book is just please read it","311":"i very much enjoyed this book the author really knows how to render a feeling","312":"the prose of this book is beautiful i was totally taken away to the farm country of wisconsin i loved the development of characters you both liked and disliked some of their choices it was totally realistic i loved this book i hope the author continues to write beautiful poetic prose","313":"the first part of the book was a tad slow but did a great job of building the characters i'd give the first half three stars the second half had me hooked very entertaining story and dialogue i'd give the second half five stars the slow building of the characters really had an impact on the connection i had with them in the second half","314":"nails the northwestern wisconsin setting lays on the small town sweetness a little thick but carries you along with a good story","315":" a story of small towns and of friends growing up and grown i enjoyed this book although it didn't live up to my hopes it was too ragged and made too many leaps of faith in the plot and the portrayals of the main characters were far too cliched but it's worth a solid three stars for its descriptions of the midwest wisconsin in this case and its small towns the setting of the small near dying far town of little wing is bang on in both the good and bad points of such places sometimes the good and the bad are actually the same thing as anyone from a town like this knows the first half of the book is solid the second far less so and the jumping about of pov can be confusing but little wing is what brings it all back home","316":"the pace of the narrative was interesting it started off as a story about the lives of these characters and how they intertwined towards the end though there was a shift and the story became more dramatic ultimately ending with a sense of oh that's funny and cute at the same time i liked the imagery in the book of a small midwestern town","317":"if you grew up in a small midwestern town this story will have some meaning to you a good winter break read","318":"i had read the other reviews after i began this book with its intriguing jacket not bad i think the attempted dialogue no easy task was the downfall here butler's descriptive voice is superb storytelling on its own the ever changing perspectives from the primary characters of this novel a book that reads like a memoir of a small town boy or girl grown up makes for fascinating discovery i wanted to know a little more of what leland's band sounded like--corvus what is that what was he a solo artist or band leader given the geography was he a bob dylan bruce springsteen or a paul westerburg some connections were made to recording studios near eau claire wi and bon iver's success and coattail riding even but i get the sense that corvus southern for crow was something a bit countrified i enjoyed the regional midwest nature of this story of lifelong friendships that drift and come back and resume in another direction after life's turmoils have dragged them down survival","319":"got this as a first reads giveaway book i did enjoy it although it became fairly predictable i liked it because the emotions and actions particularly with the relationship and marriage of two of the main characters seemed realistic i picked up on the justin vernon of bon iver link right away and i'm still deciding if that made me like the book more or less all in all an enjoyable quick read","320":"perhaps i put too much stock in a few early positive reviews but i was disappointed by this novel and its relatively flat plot line","321":" a refreshing change from most books i've read that characterize small town life as the forgotten tenth circle of hell unfortunately it goes too far to the other extreme and greatly over glorifies the rural wisconsin lifestyle more detrimental however is the general lack of conflict in the book nearly the entire first half is simply observation and how many weddings do you really need in one book the characters were pretty well developed but some of them seemed to change pretty drastically without any noticeable catalyst i did give it one extra star simply because i think it's fun to read about towns locations i'm very familiar with my former favorite chinese restaurant even received a short description overall it's worth reading if you're at all familiar with the eau claire area or if you want some validation of your choice to live in a small town","322":" this is a easy mild telling of two men friends for life and their circle of friends no murders no mysteries no bad guys just a story of friends who grew up in rural wisconsin it is about family about sacrifice about wrong turns about gentle people the friends make mistakes as all folks do and the book turns around men working to right the wrongs that have happened it is almost and they lived happily ever after except we know that some of the bonds are a little frayed less strong but the bonds are still there what a comfort to read that in the end most of all this book is humorous butler is a superb wordsmith and the reader can enjoy every word we are safe really bad things do not happen and when they almost do we get redemption in the end a wonderful book for book clubs","323":" after reading the book i have discovered that it is at least a theory that a character in this book is modeled after the rock star bon iver if you are like me the fact that bon iver is considered a rock star tells all you that needs to be known about our current perception of a rock star that said innocent of that information i found this book to be interesting and entertaining in the book we meet four high school friends as they struggle and cope with life in their early thirties the characters are well drawn though it has to be said they are pretty straightly drawn there is little straying from the margins and expectations henry has taken over the family farm in his little town of little wing wisconsin married to his high school sweetheart with two kids he loves and seemingly little ability to get ahead on his farm he is still the richest man amongst us due to the strong and proud life he leads i am not minimizing the character or the depth with which it is drawn i am just allowing that in the first meeting with henry we know all that the character is and will be the other main character is leland the drifter always in love with music with the ability to hear sunsets it is his first successful album that the book is titled after little do we know as we pick up the book that the album shotgun lovesongs was written at a pivotal moment not just for lee but for all the characters in the book a time that will reverberate through the whole story moving back in time to that winter of despair for lee to the current moments in their lives we watchthese four men come to grips with both who they were and who they are this is a book of weddings divorces betrayals and forgiveness if as much had happened to any four friends in high school then all of us would in their mid thirties be lucky to still be walking the earth still in does show that in anyone's life there are moments of both simple beauty and painful loss both of which we have to move on from to keep moving forward the question becomes which is more detrimental to future success in this book it is the beauty of a moment that becomes the albatross the descriptions of small town life in the seventies and eighties is about as dead on as i have read of special note are lee's sections each chapter is told from a specific characters voice perhaps being the songwriter he is meant to be more poetic but the descriptions of the feelings he has returning home from page 130 to134 are worth the price of the book still as lee continues to wax about the real america the poor people and music what begins as engaging in later chapters comes close to beating us over the head verbally it is a fine line to walk and for the most part butler does it well a book that is a little uneven but one worth reading","324":"heartfelt charming small town friends making their own way in the world they live in surprisingly refreshing received free copy through goodreads first reads","325":"liked this book about friendship small mid western towns family life transitions engaging read but not great","326":"fun to read a book set in wisconsin minnesota but kind of meh","327":"this is the april selection for my library book group the author nickolas butler is coming to our community's book festival later this month unfortunately i will not get to go to his talk but i listened to him on a you tube video this was an interesting book lots of descriptive passages about wisconsin my state","328":"nothing earth shattering but a good story about small towns and friends who have known each other their whole lives","329":"this story follows four childhood friends from wisconsin they each have ups and downs and their friendships are tested but they have such a strong connection to each other and to the small town they live in it was so beautifully written i wanted to live in this place i'd otherwise think was small and boring the audiobook was great because each character was narrated by someone different which helped me with the shifting povs fun fact the author went to high school with the singer of bon iver so the character of leland was based on him","330":"author's male answer to chick lit story of four guys in a small wisconsin town their friendships go through many changes but survive over the years the only female voice in the story provides grounding and warmth to a wonderfully told story","331":"small town story about friendship i'm in","332":"$ it wasn't money wasted the moment i read the first page i was hooked i just felt the characters the town was intrigued by their story the realness and honesty i don't read many novels so i can't say if it's original or stereotypical and what not what i can say is that you'll never be bored to be honest i even skipped watching netflix just to continue reading to finish i can s a story about reality in friendshipi bought this book an amazon daily deal the cover just spoke to me and for 3$ it wasn't money wasted the moment i read the first page i was hooked i just felt the characters the town was intrigued by their story the realness and honesty i don't read many novels so i can't say if it's original or stereotypical and what not what i can say is that you'll never be bored to be honest i even skipped watching netflix just to continue reading to finish i can say i am putting nickolas on my writers to read list","333":"3 1 2 stars the ending kinda pissed me off but the book was pretty good overall it's the story of five friends that grow up together in a small town in wisconsin one of them goes on to become a famous musician and i just recently found out that that character in this book is based on bon iver whom the author apparently grew up with or something i gotta be honest i don't dig bon iver's music so frankly i couldn't have given a rat's ass about this anyway it's a solid story about these five friends growing up navigating adulthood and all the issues that come with it getting married having or not having kids figuring out how to remain friends and accept each other's assholishness that sort of thing i liked it enough that i'd read more by this author this is his debut novel not bad at all","334":"would have given it 3 5 if that were an option this is a different book genre than i normally read story is about 4 life long relationships between men friends from a small town in wisconsin it was enjoyable a light read and reminded me a lot of people i grew up with in the midwest however i feel the author didn't change the character's voices enough as he flipped from one character to another they all kinda had the same inner dialogue all were likeable and the story had a happy ending all tied in a bow not my normal read but okay nevertheless i grabbed it off the shelf in target while in a hurry without really reading the back","335":"as usual i loved this book because i loved the characters i couldn't necessarily relate to all of them but i sure did like them tons","336":" i really wanted to like this book which is set in the same kind of rural wisconsin town where i grew up and which came recommended to me well to laura by someone who works in book publishing unfortunately it's treacly and bad butler keeps the stakes low throughout and while he's clearly trying to write a paean to small town life none of these characters ever feel real beyond that i will say the way he demonizes big city life and people specifically new york is borderline embarrassing butler's a fine writer of prose but he needs to do some more living before he shares his brand of folksy wisdom also one specific complaint the character of ronny who we're told early on in the book had an accident and suffered brain damage and in his first appearance seems to be heavily mentally retarded morphs into just one of the boys by the end of this book what","337":"enjoyed it being about an area i have been to many times","338":" 5 stars with a caveat i am giving shotgun love songs 5 stars with this caveat - if i could give it more stars i would i was in love with this book from the opening pages because of the writing it was lyrical and beautiful but not in the \"hey look what i can do\" mode that some writers employ to try to impress you that they can write it was the descriptions of the town and countryside and even the sky which took my breath away this does not take away from the fact that nickolas butler has written a moving story that slides back and forth from the present to the past and back again different people tell the story and each person not only brings their own viewpoint to the situations but they also share their own reality it is a story of friendship and loves lost and found if i could also rate this book as an audio book i would award it the same 5 stars with a caveat it is presented by a full cast and each narrator in the book has his her own narrator in the production the voices ring true and make it a very special listen","339":"with some great actors and a decent screenplay this might make a good movie as a book well just okay cardboard characters that i never liked enough to care about and a plot that meandered about with only middling conflict and no real theme","340":"the first 2 3 was good then it rushed the ending and didn't make sense","341":"4 is a bit generous but i was surprisingly drawn into this small town story it's a rough one lots of instances of life not going as planned of wanting things you can't have of being torn between the familiarity and obligation of home and the near desperation of wanting and needing to break free but these themes ultimately left me feeling like this book is more 'real' than many other novels word to the wise if swearing bothers you don't read this book","342":"although there is a little smut in this book it gives an excellent view and feel of home","343":"i enjoyed the fact that the story was about 4 male childhood friends it was interesting to see how the writer explained their relationships instead of relationships about women i also enjoyed the author's descriptive writing","344":"not great but very enjoyable 3 5 easy listening audiobook","345":"my husband bought this book for me i didn't think the book would be very interesting at first glance but i decided to give it a try i was immediately glued to the book after the first few pages i thought the story was good and i like reading the different perspectives of each character overall i would say this is an excellent read","346":"this is a brilliant big hearted book it seems to capture the spirit of middle america while touching on big themes i recommend this whole heartedly","347":" what i loved the setting and the writing about the setting anyone from the rural midwest will get all romantic and wistful for their lives captured so richly the land the seasons the people the vfw what else i liked the characters the novelty of peering into male friendships the clever details the pickled eggs what i could've done without beth her perspective was so unnecessary plus she's not that special stop fighting over her already she is cool no doubt but that is how we grow 'em in middle america go harvest another one just like her and stop being such a whiny starving artist about it but anyway it is a book i'd recommend to others it's an easy read and satisfying i came this close to loving it darn you beth","348":" yeah it's too bad first time novelist nickolas butler couldn't quite pull this off because i'm a total sucker for books like this when they work shotgun lovesongs is the unashamedly almost aggressively sentimental tale of four male friends who grew up together in the tiny farming town of little wing wisconsin they're now all in their 30s and life has taken them down predictably diverse if improbable paths good hearted lee's a world famous rock star he's basically justin vernon times ten douche y kip made a bundle on the chicago commodities exchange erratic ronny was a rodeo star ruined by booze solid henry married the prettiest girl in town beth and is the only one who has remained milking cows raising kids planting crops for various reasons the four of them get together quite a bit mostly in little wing and plenty of drinking drama bonding weeping apologies secrets revealed goofing fighting ensues butler alternates narrators among the four with beth getting a couple of chapters for good measure but their voices aren't really all that different and i found myself thinking the wrong character was talking more than a few times don't get me wrong there are several terrific moments here brimming with honestly earned emotion but even for a total romantic like me for true love for community and a sense of belonging for nostalgia butler is mostly too ham fisted with his plotting and themes rural vs city friendship vs blood faded youth and lost dreams etc for it to be consistently effective","349":"i loved this story the characters the descriptions of the surroundings i hope to read more of nicholas butler","350":" this book just really really sucks it's awful i hated every second of it the characters were flat the plot if you can say this book even had one was stale the dialogue was so unnatural it made me cringe each character's voice sounded exactly the same no dropping the g off of a gerund doesn't count as creating a unique character voice unless you're lazy about your characterization it was way way too long for the story it was trying to tell and there was a strange amount of product placement i couldn't for the life of me understand why everyone seemed to think beth was such an amazing woman all i got was that she was pretty otherwise she had the personality of a cinder block the author also relied heavily on italicized thoughts of the characters which was again lazy and unnatural and boring the book is also seemingly in love with itself i get the draw of wanting to make your setting a character but jeez dude how many purple descriptions of rural wisconsin do we really need we get it rural wisconsin is better than them bustlin' big cities like new york enough already get on with whatever story you're attempting to tell one might wonder why i read this book all the way through if i hated it so much two reasons one i have a compulsive need to finish all books that i start two i had hoped that it would get better i wanted it to be better i'd hoped that it would pay off that it's the kind of book you need to work for that it was a slow build i certainly didn't want to waste my time on a pile of pretentious crud but no that's exactly what happened the ending was also atrocious and it felt like the author realized he had just blathered on for 300 pages and needed a quick way out do not read this book","351":"beautiful prose it reminded me of hemingway with 21st century sensibilities","352":"i honestly don't understand why this was on a best of list it's entertaining enough but not anything i'd recommend to a friend","353":"big chill lite minus the cool soundtrack i will say the author did a great job of varying the voices of the ensemble cast","354":"easy good read especially if you're from ec or are familiar with the area lots of fun references","355":"a terrific book with great characters and interesting story really one of the best books i read in 2014","356":"i wasn't sure what genre to file this under i really enjoyed the story the setting itself was very good one i feel somewhat familiar with being a farm girl i really felt i knew all the characters by the end of the book a nice story easy to read but beautiful writing","357":"i just absolutely loved these characters and the setting and the writing such beautiful words for the universal experience of everyday living","358":"nice use of place beautiful language characters might be a little flimsy","359":"what a lovely book full of people i will think about for a while yet an honest look at friendship and how friendships change throughout our lives","360":"good book probably make a good movie probably a solid example of a book that is simply a good story not an allegory no stunning subtexts but just a good story there were moments of concern and drama and the author does a good job of fleshing it out many different characters","361":"shotgun lovesongs is an excellent story centered around small town wisconsin and the people who grew up there live there u0026amp move away from there one is a globe trotting rock superstar another an average farmer the third a man who moved back after making loads of money in chicago and a fourth as a down on his luck former rodeo star the interplay between them over the course of the story is wonderfully written i look forward to reading more from this author","362":"i loved this book with all my heart i was engaged throughout and felt a kinship with each character i felt a loss leaving a friend when it was over","363":"perfect airplane read i think that i liked it because of its midwest feel with midwest innocence and pride it reads a little like a nicholas sparks story lots of feel good emotional manipulation i found the ending to be a little contrived seriously getting shot but overall i enjoyed this sweet small town story there is some language and the f bomb but for whatever reason i didn't find it too distasteful in this story","364":" i started out really liking this book it was told from the point of view of 5 people who grew up together in a small town in wisconsin and are all now adults and back in town for one reason or another i am also from a small town in mn so i could really relate to the story but after a while it really began to seem so forced and romanticized and almost condescending mostly when the story was told from the point of view of lee one of the group that became a successful musician but is now living back in town he was so selfish whiny and entitled it just got to be too much plus a horrible friend yet expected loyalty and friendship in return","365":"enjoyable story about a tiny town in middle america i actually related more to the transition the characters were making from childhood friends to adult friends than the small town life i wish i hadn't known that it was loosely based on bon iver not sure why that tainted it for me but it did i listened to the audio which is read by different narrators in general this was a great way to take in the book but the one exception was the female narrator who read for beth she sounded like a 5th grader reading the gettysburg address in a school play","366":"who doesn't love small town america i think deep down we all that in us","367":"solid read not many books on men's friendships especially set in wisconsin","368":"good tale of you always want what you can't have when you can't have it enjoyed the story","369":" solid book about the lifelong friendships of 5 friends in a small town in wisconsin it seemed to accurately reflect how friendships change and develop and even struggle over the course of a lifetime i found personally that unless you were just deeply interested in these characters that there was a bit too much information about them in their chapters each chapter is written from the perspective of one of each of the friends they all have at least two chapters on the flip side maybe the author was just developing them well enough to be sure you got a solid grip on their personalities and who they were which he did accomplish good reed overall but wouldn't top my recommendation list","370":"butler made me feel almost proud to live in the midwest he clearly loves the landscape and people and has great skill in observing both i listened to the first 2 3 and enjoyed the changing narrators even though this is slow paced and detailed i didn't mind as i sometimes do with audio there was enough interesting detail and characterization to keep me listening this is a good choice for people who like to reflect on friendship marriage and choices and who sometimes question why they live in wisconsin when it's the middle of winter","371":"read this for my book club the author is coming to our next meeting i liked this book alright but it was a bit overly sentimental almost like it should have been set in the 1950's didn't know about the bon iver connection until after i finished it but that is cool i do think it might make a better movie than book and i understand that is in the works","372":"some parts were great some fabulous funny and sad moments but the plot fell apart at the end and nothing really happens the book just ends","373":"this guy knows loves wisconsin reading this book i felt right at home i love wisconsin his characters were f ing great the relationships between them were brilliantly interwoven this was my favorite of this year for sure pickled eggs yep seen lots of those jars never thought about stealing one tho","374":"this book is midwestern america somewhat painful beautifully written u0026amp completely unforgettable","375":"this book is set in a small town and is about 5 live long friends 4 men and a woman each chapter is narrated by a different character it was a quick read and pretty good story i haven't often read a book from the male perspective and i enjoyed it good summer book","376":" the love in this novel is palpable and it's what made me finish the book love for male friendships for small town life for farming and for language it's a huge hearted book you feel good reading it the characters especially leland are well drawn and i found the language cloying too much of the time it reads like a first novel from someone who attended iowa it doesn't serve the story but more the writer's love of language this is especially obvious when the character's chapters are written in almost the same voice the novel's tone overwhelms i also found the climax rather unbelievable and strange to have it take place so early in the book this is a writer to watch","377":"i really loved this book i was dubious at first though i can't pinpoint why but soon i was thinking in a rural twangy accent wondering what was going to happen and excited about the whole story it was just great and spoiler lover that i am i looked ahead to the end to try to find out what was going to happen and couldn't figure it out i love stories that don't give themselves away easily","378":"butler perfectly captured the essence of midwest small town life the love hate relationship the vfw being the hot spot in town the mill as the quintessential teenage hang out i guarantee every small town has their own version of the mill the i have to get out of here mentality but then when life goes to shit the need to return to your roots the feeling of regret was a common thread throughout the book regrets in love choices regrets in job choices how we learn from those regrets and use them to help us in the future i also enjoyed the fact that it centered around the friendships of men there aren't many books that dive into those kind of relationships so it was refreshing to me this is a story about life love friendship heartbreak and home","379":"like 15 000 or so others i received this as an advance readers' edition this story of friends finding their way around out and back into smalltown midwest is right on in tone and development the misspellings and one repeated paragraph all of which could have been easily remedied with attentive editing briefly stole my attention from what was otherwise a well told story regardless of its relation to bon iver the novel stands on its own as an authentic voice of the midwest","380":"shotgun lovesongs is about friendship in small town little wing wisconsin four men hank lee kip and ronnie have known each other since elementary school hank a farmer is the only one who stayed kip is a stock broker in chicago ronnie was a rodeo rider until he got hurt during a bar fight lee is a world renowned singer who thinks he's still in love with hank's wife beth a minor character observes that any of the boys could have married beth as she was really the fifth friend in the group kip decides to upgrade the town mill which has seen better days there's water in the basement along with rats his vision is a kind of general store with satellite businesses but he goes overboard spending too much money with not that much revenue kip gets married to a girl named felicia but he neglects to invite ronnie who's kind of slow since he hurt his head lee goes ballistic and kip compounds the sin by inviting the paparazzi they won't leave lee alone their friendship seems to be over the town of little wig will be recognizable to most rural midwesterners there's one of those feed mills about ten miles away from where i live the town won't tear it down despite the fact that there's nothing in there you will see one or two in just about every little town in southern minnesota as that's prime farm land with soil called \"gumbo\" before the dairy herds expanded farmers would store their crops in these mills and ship them via the railroad unfortunately nickolas butler runs out of gas toward the end he includes a flashback right before the climax something you don't see too often lee also tells hank something about beth that no guy would ever tell his best friend butler must imagine that the reader will understand since lee's six month marriage to an actress has gone belly up and he's not all there but still then there's the pickled egg interlude hank hasn't been speaking to lee and lee imagines this goofy stunt will bring them closer together but it sounds more like a fraternity prank than something two grown men would do there's just no suspension of disbelief pickled eggs are also common to small town bars at least they once were i've never seen anybody eat one the impression is that they've been in the jar longer than the bar has been open butler does have a facility with description the guys climb to the top of the mill to watch the sunset and lee the musician can actually hear the colors something kip the stock broker can't understand this book is kind of sad in that childhood friends drift away when they marry or move away these guys and the gal are unusual in that they hang together for the most part despite the occasional squabble","381":" minnesota and wisconsin are rival states when i was a kid i would have insisted minnesota is superior but i'm grown up enough now to admit that wisconsin is actually the more lovely i read this book while vacationing in wisconsin inhaling it while simultaneously escaping from family time i loved the writing loved the characters and the story i loved the between times moments of description more than some of the central conflicts but hey that's saying something good about the author too i usually hate any book that tries to incorporate the lives of musicians but this one i was able to more than tolerate he succeeded in capturing something real a slice of real life that those of you not connected to the midwest don't know about i'm pleased","382":" i loved this book for so many reasons i grew up in northern illinois southern wisconsin nickolas butler captures the feel of that area perfectly the sense of loyalty to one's hometown mixed with despair the region is hurting economically yet it is still home still a place where people spend their money in a place they hate simply because they feel bad for the proprietors also i suppose because they know your name shotgun lovesongs is rooted in midwestern reality the characters are real as well even though they easily could have become stereotypes hank the down to earth farmer beth his beautiful practical wife lee the disillusioned rock star kip the small town boy made good and ronnie the damaged rodeo rider the book's pov moves among these characters and manages to give them all a distinctive voice while maintaining a strong poetic narrative it is refreshing to read something written by someone who actually lives in the midwest rather than say a new yorker's or californian's interpretation of 'the big flyover 'i look forward to future novels by mr butler","383":" little wing wi is just like every other midwestern small town barely holding on the residents of the town are also the same as you would find in any of them farmers mostly and a few dreamers who want to find their place in the world the characters who populate this book are exactly that henry and his childhood sweetheart beth took over his father's dairy farm where they raise their children ronny left home and made it as a rodeo star before alcoholism took it all away kip moved to chicago to become a commodities broker but came back to restore the old mill lee hit the big time as a famous indie rock musician but returns to little wing regularly to rejuvenate himself and his music this book is entirely character driven there isn't much in the way of plot but so much happens life happens and that's just the way it is in a small town i come from a community much like little wing though it's economy was driven not by farming but ranching and tourism growing up every single one of us wanted nothing more than to get as far away as possible but when i go home i still see most of the same faces of the kids i've known forever married to someone else i've known just as long it's refreshing to read a book that essentially told my story i saw myself in these characters and i really cared about what happened to them as if they were the kids i grew up with i am definitely looking forward to reading more from this author and can only hope that it stands up to this excellent debut","384":"inspired by one of my favorite musicians justin vernon aka grammy award winner bon iver shotgun lovesongs accurately depicts small town wisconsin i loved how honest this book was the characters all had a lot of depth and were very relatable i was very said to finish this book i hope to see more from this author","385":" i loved this book except the ending but that shouldn't stop anyone i ran across this title through my work in a library and looked it up here on goodreads after i started reading it i looked it up on amazon and read some more reviews on goodreads i had no idea about the connection to bon iver as another reviewer mentioned but i spent a few hours doing some research and listening to some music and became a fan when was the last time you read a book that led you to good music i don't know if that's ever happened to me before and i loved the book even more for that getting back to the novel itself though the story takes place in a small wisconsin town a farming town much like many farming towns all across america i imagine i can certainly imagine this story happening in a small town that i've lived in myself or one of the others nearby i liked that i like stories in small towns i can imagine the bar at the vfw because i've been in a few so this story struck a chord with me i was thrown off for a minute as i went from the first chapter to the second and the narrators changed but once i adjusted to that and began to pay attention to the l h r b k etc at the beginning of the chapter i did just fine it's a good way to tell this story switching points of view all the time because it really helps you get the full story i was fully drawn in to the characters and i had trouble putting the book down when it was time to do other things now that i've read it and returned it to the library i may buy a copy to put on my shelf for when i want to read it again it was that good highly recommended","386":"this novel works to occupy the spaces between love and friendship and while i would not consider myself from small town america i happily embrace all its midwestern sensibilities while i can't really put a finger on why it took me a few sit downs to get into this book i read the last 175 pages in a day and feel very satisfied with its conclusion i'm anxious to see butler speak next month","387":"another audio adventure listened to this one in two separate stints a little romantic about small town life and dude friendship but i missed the characters when between listens and the romanticism too","388":"i adored this book it is simple and beautiful a love note to the midwest i am definitely looking forward to what this author nickolas butler will do next because i found his observations to be subtle and sublime and the way he developed the voices of his characters to be terrific really just a pretty introspective and heartfelt read what kinsella's shoeless joe is for iowa this book is for wisconsin yes it's that good","389":"loved it this book was a joy loved all the characters their relationships their growth the last 1 2 let me down a little bit but till enjoyed the book as a whole being a small town wisconsin girl the references and settings made me smile i recommend this book to anyone who enjoys friendship books as an audio book this one is well read expressive and entertaining","390":"i found this incredibly long and kind of boring it's one of those books that i assume is supposed to be character driven rather than plot driven but the author forgot to make any of his characters even remotely interesting enough for that to work each chapter tells another little bit of the story from a different character's point of view but there's no clear voice for any of them if you blanked out the names you'd assume you were reading the one character the whole time","391":"really well written enjoyed the story line a lot and unpredictable and keeps your interest the whole time","392":"a great depiction of small town america great characters with a lot of soul perfect summer read","393":"liked this story about a small group of thirty something friends since childhood in a small wisconsin town the friendship dynamic changes but we see the past and present from five perspectives in simple but colorful language there is no specific plot but a very human portrayal of these characters as they attempt to weather the ups and downs of their lifelong connection the title drew me in but it has little to do with the scenario itself","394":"this book made me so happy if you have a group of people who personify home for you then you'll really get this story","395":"i really liked this book but for one thing the supposed dairy farmer character really annoyed me i grew up on a dairy farm and i could not have the attitude of partying and smoking weed and hoping the cows get milked and taken care of not so much but otherwise the book and the story was an enjoyable win","396":"too much about high school memories i have little desire to remember high school","397":"this book is a beautiful ode to wi friendship forgiveness love and the best of small town america the language and voices are beautiful and so real i expect this will be making best of the year awards you will love it whether you are from wi and grasp the cultural references or you will want to visit if you're not the story stands on its own if it were written anywhere but it is dearer to me being located in my home state and describing it with such love","398":" nothing fancy here just great storytelling having lived in wisconsin for 6 years reading this was intimately familiar to me it's clear that the writer truly gets what it's like to live in a small rural wisconsin town every detail was finely wrought and realized often in fiction i encounter characters who are from the midwest or who live in midwest locations but the descriptions are largely stereotypical or flat this depiction and these characters are multidimensional and true just an all around wonderful first novel that i definitely recommend friends beware some of you will be getting this book from me this year","399":"i loved these characters and couldn't stop thinking about them even after i finished the book but the main character here is home and that was the most beautiful character of all","400":"alright","401":" sometimes you begin reading a book and it immediately feels comfortable like slipping into an old sweater on a cool day that's what i felt reading nickolas butler even though i grew up in the chicago suburbs and not small town wisconsin i knew the midwestern feel of this novel down to my bones i knew the speech patterns the sense of both belongingness and isolation i knew these people these men these men who have known one another their entire lives these men who were all born in the same hospital delivered by the same obstetrician these men who grew up together who ate the same food sang in the same choirs dated the same girls breathed he same air they move around one another with their own language their own set of invisible signals like wild animals occasionally i still see my childhood friends groups like these pictured on facebook i marvel at how these packs of boys have maintained that closeness that tribe mentality well into adulthood they still live in the same town drink in the same bars run with the same crowd they leave and they come back that's not how my life evolved but i get it henry's voice the voice of an old friend like finding a wall to orient you in some strange dark hotel room so all of that is to say that i had no trouble believing the backdrop of kip henry ronny lee and beth in little wing wisconsin they are facing their 30s all reunited in their small town with varying degrees of professional relationship and personal success there are the jealousies secrets and broken hearts you might expect from such a small town novel mostly predictable but no less interesting just because i could guess where it was going the story is told in alternating chapters from each of the main characters' perspectives allowing us a glimpse into their inner thoughts and back stories the strategy worked to keep me invested in each person but perhaps sacrificed the momentum of the plot which does pick up dramatically in the second half i can't say this is a great story or brilliant writing but i can say i enjoyed reading this book i like reading about people groups places i know sometimes that is what forgiveness is anyway a deep sigh read alikes the year we left homeby jean thompsonolive kitteridgeby elizabeth stroutmidnight champagneby a manette mansay","402":"i really liked this book i don't think i ever fell in love with it but i really really liked it i enjoyed the wisconsin small town becoming its own character thoroughout the book for me some of the characters felt less developed than others or maybe i just connected to some more than others i especially liked beth i don't want to tell you her story so i won't tell you the specific reasons why i liked her let's just say her predicament and her experience seemed relatable and authentic","403":"mildly entertaining that's about it","404":"i really enjoyed this book loved the small town wisconsin setting and the references to eau claire i went to high school and college in eau claire nickolas butler did a great job depicting the complexities of lifelong friendships in rural wisconsin i'm looking forward to listening to the author speak at the fox cities book festival in the spring great debut novel","405":"this book was awesome the writing style of butler made the work vividly come alive i received this as a goodreads firstread","406":"this book is subtle it grabs you without you realizing it when you put the book down and try to walk away all you can think about are the characters and you wonder what comes next for them how are their lives going to turn out you fall in love with them slowly page by page i can't wait to read more by nickolas butler","407":"growing up in a small town and vacationing in an even smaller town throughout my life i felt like i could relate to the characters really enjoyed this book","408":" there were things i really enjoyed about this books and things i really disliked the language was awful and felt totally unnecessary this book felt to me like a love letter to wisconsin and small time farms and i loved it i also loved the descriptions of all the seasons and it made me long for more seasons than rain and not rain there was a lot about regret and melancholy and how the choices we make affect us and that was the best part of the book for me the author did such a good job capturing relationships and how we mess things up and how hard it is to fix relationships and how important the relationships in our lives are i really liked this book but it also made me sad","409":"as a wisconsinite i've always struggled to express what that means thankfully this book did so with me everything in this book is perfect","410":"this book is beautifully written and makes you want to move to wisconsin half way through however i was wishing he would get on with the story it's about 4 men who grew up in a small town and their desire to both escape and never leave","411":" i received an arc from bookreporter com as a native of wisconsin i have a predilection to like books that capture with authenticity the midwestern experience in that regard shotgun lovesongs by nickolas butler fully delivers moreso than any book i have recently read butler captures the temperate passions loyalties and subtle dramas of midwestern lives he captures the nuances of conversation taverns like the vfw the landscape and concerns of humble people with deep lives and strong loyalties following the lives of high school friends turned middle aged adults henry lee ronny kip and beth butler explores how their hometown ties continue to shape them and how the siren song of home continues to call though not always to their trailing spouses i liked how the chapters were told in alternating voices one weakness i perceived was that the various character's voices were not distinct enough from one another and occasionally used words that did not seem authentic eg when henry refers to a vernal smell in the air but that is a small nitpick in what is overall a story told well and that shows great affection for midwestern lives and honors pull of home those brave enough to leave and perhaps the braver ones who don't henry more than any character felt fully fleshed out and real i knew henry butler nailed this character i understand that the character of lee is loosely based upon the life of bon iver that is an interesting tie in and makes me want to dig a bit deeper into that now that i've completed the novel as a wisconsin girl who has called california home now for 22 years this novel resonated with me","412":" amazingly beautiful story about friends growing up together in a small town in wisconsin sums up nicely the struggles and joys of living in smalltown midwest usa i enjoyed reading about the areas around the state i know well in addition to relating to the beautiful seasons we have even the winters with all of the snow i guess the only downside to this story was the constant highlighting of nothing better to do than always drinking or getting drunk that also sums up wi living and the drinking culture we have here","413":"this review has been hidden because it contains spoilers to view it click here like how the world looks or even time my life now it stretches out before me like a highway to nowhere one of those prairie highways where you can be driving eighty ninety a hundred miles per hours and the only way you can tell you're flying is the sound of the engine burning and the way the gas needle starts to lean toward that big old e quicker and quicker but there ain't anything to measure yourself or your speed against no trees no buildings if you're lucky you got a string of t like how the world looks or even time my life now it stretches out before me like a highway to nowhere one of those prairie highways where you can be driving eighty ninety a hundred miles per hours and the only way you can tell you're flying is the sound of the engine burning and the way the gas needle starts to lean toward that big old e quicker and quicker but there ain't anything to measure yourself or your speed against no trees no buildings if you're lucky you got a string of telephone wires but most of the time nothing more","414":"this was a light read but easily forgettable","415":"perhaps this would have been a five star if i hadn't been continually confused by who was speaking i had to keep looking back to know for sure that said this was a beautifully written true to life bittersweet tale as in true life the characters were allowed to languish fail settle then revive and in the end my favorite character was not henry or lee or ronny any of the women but kip the author's love for wisconsin is the central theme maybe answering the age old question can one really go home again","416":"liked the characters a lot felt like real wisconsin folk","417":"beautifully written book it takes place in wisconsin and i enjoyed the authentic midwestern plot lines and details","418":"nothing too memorable here just a nice story about a small town think there is a deeper meaning someplace in this just could not put my finger on it","419":"a great midwestern read lots of fields fireflies and beer i liked how each chapter was a different narrator because it gives you a deeper sense of how each character feels about a particular situation","420":"four childhood friends back in their midwest hometown reconnecting recollecting and resolving conflicts how many books in this vein have we read from a woman's point of view shotgun lovesongs breaks that mold focusing on four mid thirties men three who left a successful chicago commodities broker a disabled rodeo bull rider and a world famed rock star plus the one who stayed on the family farm to marry the high school sweetheart and raise a family the story is told in five voices the four men and beth the sweetheart wife offering different perceptions of the friendship's strengths and weaknesses and each persons' role i understand that the book was based on the story of justin vernon a folk rock musician i have to admit i'm not familiar with vernon or his band bon iver i enjoyed the male viewpoint and want to believe in the fabric of lasting friendships this arc was provide my netgalley and publisher thomas dunne books in exchange for an honest review","421":"enjoyed the setting the age cohort the realistic human foibles and the nostalgia of youth","422":"takes place in mid west a book mostly about friendships between men","423":"this book is by a university of wisconsin graduate and the setting is in rural wisconsin i loved this book and the characters were well developed enjoy","424":"the ending was a little flaky","425":"loved this book there was nothing spectacular that happened nobody rescued the world or anything this is just the story of normal people in normal lives it reminded me of how truly blessed i am to be living the life in the midwest","426":"i listened to this book and loved the different narrators for the different characters these real engaging characters have stayed with me for several days after i finished and i didn't want the book to end","427":"character development was great but i didn't love the story nor understand why some of these people were friends","428":"this one was quite good i loved the insight into a small midwest town and the friendships of these 4 friends i will definitely look for other books by this author the 4 men were definitely brought to life","429":"i appropriately finished this novel about 4 male friend's weddings the day before my wedding loved this book","430":"really enjoyed this book it maintains a consistency that made the book easy to read even though the chapters are told from each of the five main characters' perspective and jump back in time i found the characters genuine and relatable a great story about love how childhood friendships evolve and what home comes to mean","431":"i liked the way the author covered time from different high school friends perspectives he flipped between current and the past and kept both interesting i would have rated it higher but the ending was a bit of a disappointment it wasn't bad it was just flat i am not sure what would have been better but after i was done i questioned why i read it","432":"loved this book one of my favorites went to author talk enjoyed it immensely","433":"apparently i've been meaning to read this book since 2013 that is when i first shelved it but i think i was probably meant to read it now sometimes you come across the perfect book that's perfect for your mood at the perfect moment and this was one of those experiences","434":"i always enjoy books that are written through multiple character's perspectives what i enjoyed most about this book is that i could find myself and my own experiences in every character and incident","435":"really enjoyable novel about a group of friends who grew up together in rural wisconsin lee has gone on to become a successful singer songwriter henry has taken on his family's farm and married beth his highschool sweetheart ronnie has had a rodeo career cut short by his alcoholism and an accident and kip left the countryside for a business career in chicago they are all back together for a wedding and this is the beginning of tensions and the revelation of a secret that could tear their friendship apart it all sounds rather dramatic and it is in places but this is a wonderfully easy paced book about friendship expectations love and home set in a landscape that is at once wild and beautiful the characters' lives are shaped by their memories of the town the harshness of the environment and the connections they made with each other over their lives it really made me think about my friends about good things and bad happy times and regrets a well written and thought provoking book","436":"oh wow finished this one on a speed read loan from the library really enjoyed it a full body immersion into a small wisconsin town with some inspiration provided by bon iver one of my favorite musicians i would have appreciated another chapter or two to get some more perspective in the perspective shifts between five characters i don't think you need to have lived in a small town or listened to bon iver to connect with this one","437":"growing up in wisconsin this book made me homesick in a good way i really enjoyed this book and will definitely read more by this author","438":"an engaging narrative a perfect summer read perhaps out of step with modern novels about dysfunctional relationships but there are only so many of those i can take so it was a genuine relief to go along on butler's mid western ride if that makes me a sap so be it","439":"probably really 3 1 2 stars but while it was an intriguing set up with some interesting characters on the whole i felt a little left out like all of these characters shared some secrets that the author did not want to tell i thought that a rock star in a small town would provide a little more music related storytelling but that never materialized while heaven forbid that we get more huge books i just felt that there was more to this story that was cut out i'm curious as to what this author does next because he clearly has some gifts i just felt that they were not properly harnessed here","440":" funny thing about this novel it doesn't follow the typical formula--the characters' goals and motivations are hazy at best the main conflict doesn't rear its ugly head until halfway through the book and the story doesn't have much action mostly this is day in the life type stuff with lots of internal thought but i couldn't put it down i flipped through the pages as if i were reading a thriller the unique storytelling style got me five different characters took turns narrating episodes of the novel in a first person skipping stone approach from one wedding to the next and a few events in between each of them regarded the others from a different angle allowing me as a reader to gradually piece together five complete profiles henry the young farmer who never left the tiny town of little wing two of his friends kip and lee who found fortune and fame but lost their bearings along the way--they return to little wing to reestablish roots and in lee's case find the love of his life ronny the rodeo rider who came home a mentally damaged man from an accident but not nearly as damaged as his friends think and beth henry's wife--the focal point of a love triangle a few interesting side characters lucy the stripper felicia the disappointed wife and chloe the fickle movie star add spice to the brew ultimately this is a story about a group of friends who try to control but ultimately become overwhelmed by the world they live in and all of its emotional complexity i wanted the novel to go on forever","441":"i've been struggling with trying to write a review worthy of this absolute gem of a book it pulled me in from the first page and i fell in love with the landscapes the characters the way things develop it made me smile and think and feel sad at times i was so caught up in it that i swear i could practically smell the warm dusty wooden porch smell of summertime even though it's 10 degrees outside this is a simple story without any earth shattering events or surprises but it's one of those things -- just like a certain color in the clouds or a particular song on the radio -- that just kind of gets to you which is pretty much all a reader could ask for this was a netgalley advance reading copy","442":"a coming of age story about a fictional small wisconsin town that has a strong magnetic pull on a band of friends that we follow from boyhood to manhood all with different adult lives a rock star a yuppie a struggling farmer and a down and out rodeo rider all who are still drawn to one another as well as to the town the author himself is from a small wisconsin town and even went to high school with future real life indie rock star with all this realness i am not sure why the book felt so one dimensional to me the writing was good the characters were interesting the reviews were very good with the debut author receiving a prize or two and still i felt that i was being preached to that basically only in america's heartland can one find true happiness this \"sermon\" is why i am only giving the novel a three star review","443":" a lovely lonely tale of childhood friends who grew up together in small town wisconsin scattered to their different fortunes and return home for various reasons it's a tale of friendship loyalty jealousy dissatisfaction love dreams and longing the characters are detailed and nuanced familiar but unexpected the book is told in shifting first person perspectives different chapters told by the revolving characters so that you get everyone's feelings and perspectives on the others this is the sort of fiction i would call chick lit in that it deals with emotions and friendships but the fact that it is being narrated by such masculine characters creates a different feeling you can see how hard it is for these men to reveal event to themselves their true feelings and admit their insecurities a lot of the content centers on the relationships between men and women but this is not a romance the book feels like how you think about family and home perhaps i connected to it because the small town setting is so familiar to me but i think the book is masterfully written and incredibly insightful into the human psyche one of my very favorite reads of 2014","444":"this is a book about the relationships between a group of individuals from a small town in wisconsin as their lives unfold in their child bearing years the author does an excellent job of describing the intimacy of small town life the only shortcoming of the book is the last 50 pages that seem to last forever as though the author had runnout of steam","445":"childhood friends from a small farming community grow up relationship shift and change and some end told from the viewpoint of each of the characters in turn well written engaging and you really cared about these characters","446":"interesting since it is about the eau claire area","447":" what i liked strong sense of setting small midwestern town and the pull of home juxtaposed with wanting to get out and see the world characters that had complicated relationships friendships that changed over time and hardship what i didn't like beth beth is strong a midwestern girl everyone loves beth she's the perfect mom did i mention she's beautiful oh and btw she has a gorgeous singing voice but doesn't show it off everyone wants to sleep with her beth has perfect nipples beth beth beth but the chapters in her voice were flat and underdeveloped compared to the chapters told in the other main characters' voices all male also she gave some really inane advice to a female friend and i was like beth would never say that overall a decent read from a wisconsin guy who grew up with justin vernon i think he should read some more female authors and cut down on the adverbs and his next novel will be even better","448":"this was such an interesting take on growing up in a small midwestern town where friendships and family lines go back years and loyalty to people and place can go back decades or even generations the ending got a bit bizarre but i thought the friendships and their accompanying jealousies rang true","449":"second half was better than the first would give it 3 1 2 stars","450":"didn't want this book to end","451":"if john cougar mellencamp wrote a novel this would be it","452":"i really liked this book a lot then a crap ending gah","453":"if i could give 1 2 stars this would be 3 1 2 pretty solid story told from multiple perspectives","454":" i can't fully explain why i liked this book so much maybe i'm tired of reading books written by urbanites who hate rural life and who shit on small town values like community helping family living slower and living closer to food production maybe it was refreshing to read a book with a husband and wife who actually love each other henry was my favorite character by far i felt compassion for lee who couldn't control the emotions of his heart he can't help that he loved beth and who made eccentric choices like any troubled artist stereotype i can blame him for saying it aloud to henry and fucking some shit up i thought the flashback story telling worked out really well i usually don't like a chronological story telling because i find it distracts from the forward movement of the plot but butler did this well because every time he switched perspective to a new character the character's story was more forward in time than where the last perspective ended usually by weeks or months","455":"the story of friends who grow up together in a small town in wisconsin and return there later in life one now famous one wealthy one with some brain damage after an accident and a couple who never left i liked this one","456":"won this book thru a goodreads giveaway being from wisconsin i so could relate to this book and the way it was written farmers i know working the fields dawn til dusk or sharing a cold beer with a friend in a small town bar where everyone literally knows your name is what butler portrays to a tee i love his descriptions and color of the words were amazing and i could so relate to the beautiful land wisconsin is highly recommend","457":"quick easy summer read","458":"loved it seemed to be a very real and heartfelt exploration of self discovery friendship relationships and small town life all done with tlc and insight","459":"nice simple and calming reading","460":"3 5 starsthis is not a fast paced thriller or a twists and turns whodunnit it's a book about a group of friends that come in and out of each others' lives in a small town in wisconsin if i wasn't familiar with a lot of the locations etc mentioned i probably would have rated it 3stars flat not my favorite but an engaging book with ever changing narrators it was a decent summer read","461":"totally enjoyed this book makes you want to live in a small town especially one in wisconsin beautifully written book","462":"not much happened and it was just simple and i really enjoyed it","463":"i was expecting something zany based on the title which this isn't really focuses on 5 friends who had grown up together in a small town and paths their lives were taking 4 guys and a girl i liked it would read something by this author again thought he captured those thoughts we have when we compare our lives with others i did think the characters read as older than they were when one moaned about being divorced before he's thirty i was startled these guys are only in their twenties i was thinking they were several years down the road from that wasn't crazy about the last plot line but did like the book although now it probably sounds like i didn't","464":"excellent hated to see it end","465":" i thought i might really like this book but wound up merely liking it because the ending went a direction verging on the ridiculous this is the story of 5 individuals in early to middle adulthood living in little wing wisconsin it is about 4 best friends and the girl one of them married and another one loved there's the steady farmer henry and his lovely wife beth ronnie who used to be a rodeo cowboy until drinking led to an accident which resulted in brain damage kipp who makes it big in the futures market in chicago and leland the rock star the story revolves around each of their weddings what i really liked is the author's obvious love for the midwestern landscape small towns and fallow fields he renders it with reverence what i didn't like is the way the end took forever to reach by means of a nonsensical boys' night out that starts out funny and almost becomes a tragedy but i think the author's heart is in the right place and i liked henry ronnie kipp and leland","466":" i try not to read too much about a book before i read it because i like to form my own opinion when i discovered shotgun lovesongs i only knew it was about dude friends it was set in a small town in a northern state and the author had loose association with indie god bon iver stories set in small towns and deal with the themes associated with being tied to people for life just because you were born in the same hospital as them really speak to me so that aspect trumped the other two giant red flags for me going into it the dude bro friendship stuff didn't end up being all that bad in practice but because i knew there was this bon iver justin vernon connection to the story it was absolutely impossible to get into this book without being pulled right back out it with the lingering feeling that i was reading real person fiction so some background i used to read a lot of twilight fan fiction not because i liked the characters or the themes from the actual series but because women took the boring characters and premise of stephenie meyers and made it into better stories i mean better in the sense that they were more entertaining sometimes other times it would end up being creepy odes to robert pattinson falling deeply in love with a self insert of the author and then i'd have to reevaluate how much time i was wasting on reading twilight fan fiction as embarrassing as it was to admit i used to read twilight fan fiction is directly akin to how embarrassed the author of this book should feel for writing blatant real person fic about a musician who has never seemed to interested in sharing his personal stories and selling it for profit recognition and when i say blatant i mean it's actually what nickolas butler uses to sell the story boasting about the fact they are from the same 'small' town um eau claire is nowhere near small town status but ok and ensuring interviewers know where the inspiration behind leland sutton came from as if we couldn't tell from the balding bearded lumber jack hippie hipster who sings in a falsetto about wisconsin and winter and isolation so on and so on don't worry butler we got this leland bon iver you've effectively captured the 18 24 demographic and the reason that this all bugged me so much because it was such a waste of great writing potential nickolas butler has great sense of painting that mental image readers love and he even showed us how to hear music in words granted he was describing previously recorded music by a mainstream artist but still where butler truly falls short is story tell shotgun lovesongs is a multi character pov story about being childhood friends in your 30s that only needed to be told from one character's pov we first meet hank who is a simple man with simple means and simple life goals and just simply uncomplicated he is the perfect insightful thoughtful but undramatic narrator for this kind of story but then we get his wife's gossipy side where she reads too deeply into other character's subtleties and is annoying always right and the frenemy kip's absolutely cold and useless story about how he tries to impress the town with his successes and then we get filler from leland and ronny who seems to have nothing to tell us about except how much he loves his friends so if the problem starts with having too many captains on this ship things start sinking once you realize literally every single character narrates the same way hank paints a beautiful picture of a wisconsin sunrise in a poetic fashion we'd expect from multi platinum selling folk rock superstar so does kip and beth and ronny the wannabe rodeo star who we were told nearly drank himself brain dead in the first chapter in fact the only person who isn't that poetic is leland his voice is choppy cold and mostly serves as filler to tell the reader what goes on with his rock star life when the other characters aren't around at least with hank we learn that he is secretly artistic why not just write the whole book from his perspective story telling aside and focusing on the story line things aren't that much better we're dealing with a tale as old as time here that's right unrequited love triangles here i thought i was reading something different form my usual twilight fan fiction but that little ditty isn't revealed until about half way through the book so in the beginning i'm liking all the friends kip ronny hank and leland and i'm excited to see how their friendships change over the years and then nothing nothing happens their friendship is basically the exact same by the ending which is so saccharine sweet i wondered if i was actually reading a young adult novel for a moment but the raw writing is good i'd give nickolas butler another shot only if he doesn't try this opportunistic bullshit again","467":"i loved the imagery detailing the wisconsin fields and sky butler makes me want to move there live in little wing and become friends with the characters this is a great novel about love family and friendship","468":"a wonderful book i enjoyed reading this book very much and loved the characters my only complaint was that it ended too soon and not the way i wanted it to everyone should read this book","469":" original review found at http kristineandterri blogspot ca 2 i received an advanced readers copy of this book through a goodreads giveaway in exchange for an honest review shotgun lovesongs is an honest story of life long friends from small town america where the setting is just as much a character as the people each chapter alternates between the key players and tells the story of present and past throughout the pages you can truly feel the friendship love and loyalty of all these characters who's lives have taken dramatically different routes the characters are so well developed that by the time you finish the book you feel like you really know them the multiple points of view along with the stories of past and present are key in understanding each character the story is not action packed but filled with real life drama minus modern technology friendships are put to the test by fame distance illness money love and lies butler pens each character with such vulnerability that it is almost impossible not to like them in short the story is about friendship standing the test of time and the things that make or break this life long bond i really enjoyed it and loved the final sentences at the very end","470":"i received this book through a giveaway with st martin press it is the first book that i have from nickolas butler but it most certainly will not be the last i dove headlong into it and didn't look back i wish that the characters had been laid out better so you know who is who but because i read a short synopsis about the book before i received it","471":"i won this book as an advanced listening copy through goodreads the entire book was a beautiful sad love song the notes painting a gorgeous picture of a small town and the love and pride and rawness of the characters","472":" we have all heard of 'chick lit' well i believe this book is a good example of 'bro lit' the story reminded me of the book the interestings for it tells the story of four male friends who are from the same hometown and are on equal footing as youth but then life changes as they become adults and they all achieve different levels of success i could relate to these characters more than i could from meg wolitzer's book and i enjoyed the beginning of the book greatly but as the book went along i was less enamored with it as the character of henry was portrayed as too perfect and lee was unrealistically whiny about trying to woo back the friendship of henry despite these criticisms i would definitely read the next book by this author and would recommend it to my bookclub","473":"interesting to read about male friendships which is different than the books i usually read involving women and friendship i was disappointed with the ending made me want to roll my eyes and say boys will be boys yet had its touching moments","474":"i found this to be a lovely book about good and decent people trying to do their bests as someone who grew up in a small town the friendships between those who have known each other since birth rang true for me i wasn't ready to say goodbye to these folks at the end","475":"so carry on my dear what is clear up in the daylight is we're hung here fall is coming soon a new year for the moon i hail from madison wisconsin i have sucked cold air in between my teeth relishing in the feeling as it coated my throat and chapped my lips i have watched pastures teeming with livestock roll past the window of my parent's car our skyscrapers come cherry red topped with broken shingles and housing generations beneath with their sheeps and their cows madison wisconsin isn't little wing but i know of places like it whether it be the briskness of door county heat shimmering off sidewalks of milwaukee or the great lakes iced over the heartland is something you can never forget butler knows this he knows of how seasons coalesce into one another here he knows of small town conversation and of loyalty beyond blood he branches out to bigger cities bigger problems while still keeping to the heart of it all i fell in love with this book with the lyrical quality of winter and summer bursting at the seams of teenage years memories sought after and of friendships broken and mended again lee henry beth kip and ronny all stole my heart real people bound together through time a constant state of cause and effect each setting off something for the other i didn't know it was loosely based off of bon iver until i had almost reached the end bon iver is an artist i've always desired to follow more closely but haven't had should i even say the time it doesn't seem like the appropriate word but it's true now i listen to his songs to the sleepy quality of his voice and the muted strum of guitar strings and dream dream of a wisconsin sometimes lost to me one where i can find beauty in nature and reach my roots shotgun lovesongs does that it's a slice of humanity in one of its purest forms the only downside to that and the novel is that the conclusion doesn't feel real too much occurred during this novel for it to end like it did it seemed to idyllic too perfect and it just happened too fast i almost hope that this ends up having a sequel because there's so much butler could still explain","476":"loved this book this book captures that small town feel and it does it just right","477":"an incredibly well done debut novel easily the best novel i've read in recent times i stayed up late on a tuesday devouring the last several pages unable to put the book down the sense of longing and twinges of regret felt by the characters were painfully palpable the love scene was the sexiest thing i've ever read and butler didn't even invite us in to it past the kiss this book is my jam i loved it and i wish i were still reading it","478":"actually maybe 3 5 stars i enjoyed the small town storyline as i can definitely relate to that but the characters never really came alive to me and i was worn out by lee's life long obsession with beth spoiler not sorry i read it but not overwhelmed either","479":" shotgun lovesongs is a love story about small midwestern towns and male friendships beautiful poignant and in some parts heart wrenching the characters are well drawn and the wisconsin heartland is a vivid backdrop with a different pull on each of the characters since the book is told with multiple narrators readers can really grasp the depth of the characters' connections to one another and to their hometown highly recommended especially for those who enjoyed silver linings playbook or nick hornsby","480":"good solid read i liked the characters based in midwest wi mn references which was an added bonus","481":" this debut novel from wisconsin based author nickolas butler is worthy of the abundant praise received from critics and readers set in the fictional rural town of little wing wisconsin five friends undergo major life changes from marriage to recording a bestselling album chapters are written from the perspective of each of the five as their friendship is tested a character driven novel butler gives each character depth including flaws and quirky mannerisms so they seem more like an actual person you might see in small town wisconsin rather than a character in a book it's also fun to watch for the wisconsin references he inserts like pickled eggs the packers the 715 area code and of course milking cows tkathleen k marathon county public libraryfind this book in our library catalog","482":"if you've ever lived in a small town as a native or alien you need to read this book if you've ever experienced friendship marriage betrayal or love you need to read this book great storytelling and writing that you reread because it is so right","483":"it's well written but i just meh i think this is the type of book you need to be in a certain mood to read otherwise the characters come across as whiny and narcissistic","484":" firstly thank you to the publishers for sending me a copy via netgalley in exchange for an honest review i took nearly a week after reading this book to mull over how i felt about it it is a very lovely story told with a great narrative style which enabled the author to switch between different character perspectives and stretch over quite a period of time including flashbacks without feeling rushed or overly drawn out i really liked the characters and i really liked the world that the author created in this small town so on all of those fronts i recommend this book unfortunately i just didn't feel the story took me anywhere that interesting by the end i must say that this is quite a common issue for me with many of the books that i read so please keep this in mind when reading this review i really wanted to love this story and be able to give it five stars by the end but felt it was more of a 'i liked it' three star read once it was over i really like the writers voice though and would definitely read more of their work","485":"perfect narration i love having the story told by all four friends it is a great big epic story toward in powerful but small quiet moments great language and writing","486":"wisconsin author wisconsin setting wisconsin characters a story of friendship and love you can't help but love this book","487":"this review has been hidden because it contains spoilers to view it click here highly recommend the audio version narrated by four different actors each bringing a different viewpoint on friendship and living in the small town they grew up in it's a riveting story the epilogue is rather disappointing it feels disjointed from the rest of the book hank holding court telling tourists pub

the audio version narrated by four different actors each bringing a different viewpoint on friendship and living in the small town they grew up in it's a riveting story the epilogue is rather disappointing it feels disjointed from the rest of the book hank holding court telling tourists pub goers and neighbours about the night of the eggs and his famous friend jars surely the point about

if the characters who look for more elsewhere but always end up feeling a piercing them was left at home the second half of the boom left me wanting a break from the mundane","489":" i grew up in a small town i loved the accurate depiction of that life some of my closest relationships to this day are with people i've been friends with since kindergarten i loved the accurate depiction of those relationships and how they evolve and come in and out of focus over time i married someone i've known since grade school i loved the accurate depiction of that kind of love story i would put this book down and continue to reflect on my past and even more how my past has translated to who i am in the present i cried reading this while getting my hair done so there's that it's that kind of book","490":"listened to the playaway good production","491":"hank lee ronny and kip were best friends forever in little wing wi they're brought together for the wedding of one of the group they have such a history together but secrets too and are revealed and resolved","492":"like and yet unlike michael perry butler captures small town wisconsin as we wish it could always be refreshing to have a whole cast of likable characters imperfect but generally trying to be decent as we wish we could always be","493":" nicholas butler has a simple writing style and the characters are likeable i suspect they will always be adrift and imperfect it was a very easy read but in the end i was left wondering what to take away from this book was this an attempt to be the gen xers \"st elmo's\" fire did the characters come together for any real purpose any lives changed for the better here in the backwoods of wisconsin the setting was indeed a nice touch i am from milwaukee my biggest issue is the rock star character lee corvus cribbed largely from the real life story of the recording artist bon iver gimme a break can't guys like butler come up with an original idea i was drawn to this book in part because of the music connection heck the book was dedicated partly to levon helm so can someone in the book editing world explain to me how spelling errors occur in a book at this level on p 210 a band is refered to as \"credence\" it's creedence dumbass","494":"for me perhaps the most satisfying book i have read this year it follows the friendship of four childhood friends in rural wisconsin and they grow and mature more than a buddy book recommend it as a study in interpersonal relations in the contemporary world","495":"i liked this book so much that i was up at 3am finishing it unfortunately when i hit the star ratings on my kindle i must have been half asleep already because i accidentally hit 1 star instead of the 5 i meant to rate it when i woke up u0026amp saw my mistake in my gr feed i changed it right away this is a 5 star book beautiful descriptions of the midwest true renditions of the complexity of friendships and some laughs along the way too i thoroughly enjoyed this lovely debut and look forward to more from this author","496":"loved this book about small town 20 30 somethings trying to figure out their lives and friendships excellent writing by first time author","497":"shotgun lovesongs a great title for a great story of friendship what ifs apologies and forgiveness small town friendships are long lasting picking up even when friends have been away for years nickolas butler has captured the intimacy of these men and the successes and failures experienced as they mature nickolas has a gift for descriptive passages his words lull the reader being present with the rolling clouds in the blue sky the fields the smoky bars a wonderful book that i think appeals to both men and women definitely mark your calendar for this one march 2014","498":" let me start by saying that i received this book for free through goodreads first reads i found myself wondering about what was going on with the characters when i wasn't reading it i could relate to the characters in their coming of age and the struggle to become adults yet hold on to all that is special and unique about themselves and their relationships the cliche' you can never go home was proven to be wrong for once what they had they worked for to keep their relationships active and that is what home is not a place alone but the people we continue to hold onto some of the reviews mentioned that they had a difficult time following the narrators characters this author uses homodiegetic narrators i found it charming and part of the fun trying to listen carefully for the first few lines to catch who was speaking as a wife of a musician i loved the character of lee how he told his story how human he was the descriptions in all the scenes put me right on the spot i really loved this book i recommend it to anyone who wants to go home especially for young people who still have the chance to build life long relationships with their friends for some of us it's too late to go home from whence we came but gives me hope that i can establish home now thank you so much for sharing your novel with me i will keep it and recommend it to my friends","499":"this is a story centered around a few friends who were raised in a small town went their own ways and then come back together for a wedding i lived in a small town for a few years as a teen so i could relate somewhat to this story i've known a kip a ronny a leland a hank and a beth i know that the author nailed the people and life of a small town it's told by alternating characters which i thought would be strange but didn't take away from the story at all the story moves at a steady pace then slows for a teeny bit and then picks up again even through the slow part i never lost interest the characters were well written and i enjoyed them all as well as every aspect of their relationships...the good and the bad parts the book made me feel so many different emotions the characters portrayed love sorrow happiness hope and disappointment this is a really good book that will be in my head for a while it brought back so many good memories of living in a small town and i was so drawn to what was going on and to the characters that i was sad when i was finished i hope the author has plans to bring these characters back in a future book either way i look forward to more from nickolas butler i listened to the audio cd version of this book which had multiple narrators since i'm so picky when it comes to narrators i wasn't sure how i'd be able to handle listening to this i was pleasantly surprised none of the voices grated on my nerves or made me want to turn it off the author did good on choosing all the narrators and now i have some more names to add to my listenable list","500":" okay i enjoyed this novel more than a three star review might suggest this is the third famous guy returns to his hometown male friendship novel that i've read in semi recent history first two are book of joe by jonathon tropper and return to oakpine by ron carlson i was more interested in the budding friendship between the book's main two female characters than i was in the men's friendships i felt like i could not quite get a handle on how old the characters were was listening to audiobook so it is tricky to go back and find specific references that might enlighten me but they were written it seemed to be in their very early thirties i felt like the nostalgic tone and overly sentimental style put one more in mind of grandpa rocking on the porch and telling stories than thirtysomethings figuring out life plus the timelines of marriages careers etc just did not seem to fully jive there were some beautifully crafted sentences and butler definitely situates the reader in the small town of little wing but many passages felt overwritten or maybe overread since the narrator who read the character of leland got on my nerves you'd probably enjoy this book if you read it so don't let my nitpicking scare you off i think with a bit of authorial restraint this novel would have been more than pretty good says the woman who can't even find time to write a blog post","501":"a good story overall","502":"a lovely realistic heartbreaking and honest novel some portions of the text were pure poetry the author does such a fabulous job of taking every day happenings and turning it into something that makes you stop think re read and just let it soak in i liked the different narratives throughout so that the reader is given many sides to the story this takes place near eau claire which is where the author lives and being that i went to school there and grew up in a small town an hour away it's like reading my life i know these people i am these people","503":"not worth the read i was intrigued by the bon iver angle but the characters were small town caricatures the plot was predictable and the writing came off as inauthentic","504":"five friends lee kip ronny hank and beth who grew up together in a farming community of wisconsin reunite and rekindle their relationships each chapter is a narrative of one by the five through their storytelling the reader is revealed their past and how their struggles stresses and accomplishments are related the book is an easy read but can be a bit slow at times","505":"another book club selection this time because the author is coming to the fox cities book festival this week a bit too predictable for my taste but i felt he had an adequate description of wi life minus all of the pot smoking","506":"i enjoyed this book and recommended it to my daughter as it is relevant for her generation as well as mine great summer read that you won't want to put down","507":"beautiful prose i thoroughly enjoyed this book","508":"this book was welcoming and almost nostalgic i really enjoyed the simplicity of the story and the exploration of each of the characters and the connections between them i highly recommend this book","509":"i wanted this to be something it wasn't when i read a description that includes small towns and long lasting friendships i want small towns and friendships and some conflict real conflict in this book you have several different perspectives that all sounded the same a lot of the characters sounded the same and i'm not interested in the problems of people that don't really have problems the characters just weren't that interesting and the drama wasn't all that dramatic i ended up skipping huge sections of one of the many times a character went off on some barely connected to this story tangent but the cover is really good too bad it doesn't really tell me anything about this book i discovered the bon iver connection after finishing the book knowing it beforehand wouldn't have made much of a difference http www publishersweekly com pw by","510":"this book seemed to have a very abrupt and unsatisfying ending however i enjoyed the characters and their growth throughout the book","511":"great characters loved it","512":"this is one of those books that is right up my alley a group of people who grew up together and are facing the world as adults a big chill sort of vibe is what i love in this sort of book and this one is a fantastic version of the coming together as adults books i really enjoyed every moment of the book what made this book stand out for me was it's focus on male friendship many books focus on female friendship or a group of male and female friends but those focusing on men tend to be few and far between so the exploration of male friendship was one of the great things about this novel the novel is narrated by alternating chapters from the perspective of five different characters the four male friends as well as one of the friend's wife each of these perspectives is key to telling the story and allowing the reader to peak into the lives of these characters and their relationships to one another i loved learning about their community which is frankly another character in the book and how their stories and friendships have played out over the years it's a fascinating read and alternates between hopeful and heartbreaking there is something rather simple about this novel which makes it all the more affecting and real the characters felt very real and honest to me they all demonstrated the good bad and ugly that is the human condition and it all felt very real to me i began to care so much for each of the characters in this novel and their journeys were gut wrenching at times it was a wonderful novel that i definitely recommend to anyone who likes a good story with fantastic characters i can't wait to see what nickolas butler has for us in the future","513":"i liked this book it was homey and the references were familiar if he mentioned the vfw one more time though i was going to scream","514":"i was intrigued because this was about a musician from small town wisconsin who made it big then came back to his home town and friends the story was slow each chapter told by one of the 5 main characters and there was no plot considering the author lived in wisconsin he probably could have picked a more wisconsin sounding name for the town","515":"meh very predictable","516":"i really enjoyed this debut novel it is not very often you get to read a story about male friendships and the impact they have on each other the characters are well developed their interplay is realistic and the story flows well the characters are distinct enough from one another that it is easy to keep track of each one there are no good or bad characters just flawed human beings who possess good and bad traits i would like to be friends with these guys and hated to part ways as the book ended looking forward to more from this author i would recommend this to both men and women i think we can all see a little of ourselves in these characters","517":"really enjoyed both the story and the writing excellent debut novel but not entirely surprised as he came through iowa writers' workshop i've yet to read anything from one of their alumni that was other than excellent hoping to meet and hear mr butler when he surely visits the valley bookseller in stillwater","518":"this is a good summer read of four male friends growing up in small town wisconsin it reflects back on their paths as they become adults and return to their small home town the four characters are the famous rock star the trader returned home to make good the steady farmer and the lovable recovering alcoholic rodeo star of course added to the mix is the girl they all love while not a new script the characters were vivid fallible and likable definitely worth a quick read when it comes out in paperback","519":"the midwestern farmers and small town characters felt familiar like actual people i grew up with","520":"i loved this book it was not a complicated story but loved the characters and the overall message it was nice to see the good side of a small town instead of people dying to get out","521":"finish date june 17 2014interesting book i usually read mystery crime or history this was a book about several friends in a wisconsin town little wing they all grow up and get married each has a different destiny nothing thrilling or exciting just a matter of fact book seems to me like it may have been the experiences of the author no surprise ending which i was awaiting","522":" i am excited to discuss this novel about life in small town wisconsin day after tomorrow book club the characters are characters each with their own story as well as being lifelong buddies it took me a couple of chapters to get into the plot but then i was hooked despite the heavy drinking and profanity because in most cases it was appropriate to the story lee the songster henry the farmer kip the retired commodities guy ronnie the broken rodeo star and beth who is henry's life make life interesting in their hometown of little wing wi interesting to follow","523":"a study of friends in their 30s in small town wisconsin ruminating on the relationships we keep http faintingviolet wordpress com 2","524":"3 5 starsi enjoy the descriptions of small town life the 5 different fist person narratives sound too similar as most everyone else has said when reviewing the book i really like the walks down memory lane for each character mostly about events in another character's life i can see where the author was presumably headed but he seemed either too anxious to publish or the editor didn't push for a grittier tone and i had no idea it's based on justin vernon his split from deyarmond edison later megafaun and his retreat back to wisconsin to write music and start bon iver","525":"the way shotgun lovesongs is structured is interesting but the varying length of chapters made it really difficult to pace this book the characters are all likeable but there isn't much about any of them that's unique the ending felt a bit simple but overall shotgun lovesongs is a mostly entertaining and touching story about male friendship which seems sort of difficult to find lately","526":"a solid listen to read on audio the novel is about four men and one woman who grew up together in a small town in wisconsin the story centers around their lives post graduation through their early 30s and how their relationships change as their lives change the characters are well crafted in this book which is a good thing since this book is more of a character study than a plot driven book which may turn some readers off i actually enjoyed the book very much i found the characters to be interesting realistic and their interactions to be believable i enjoyed reading about small town life and farming and how some people feel the need to escape that life while others can't wait to leave it the book is also about how we define home as individuals overall i feel comfortable recommending this book to my gr friends the only weakness that i saw in the book is the overemphasis on the use of certain language patterns that sound like a list so that when read these parts i couldn't help thinking please stop showing me how many different ways you can make the same point although this approach didn't grate on me as it did in the execution of noa p singleton a novel it came up right up to the edge of that in a few places i believe that this writing technique is being taught in mfa programs and in particular the iowa writer's workshop and i am asking the educators within those forums to please stop teaching this technique before i go mad","527":"liked reading it but not as good as i thought it would be melodramatic","528":"even if you are not a native of wisconsin you will find so much to like about shotgun lovesongs by nickolas butler read the rest of michelle's review on the library's blog http carnegiestout blogspot com 201","529":" received as a firstread from goodreads this book might very well be the best book i've read all year one review blurb on the book cover called this gut wrenching and heart breaking and i think they couldn't be more wrong this book is beautiful a fantastic glimpse into the lives of 4 childhood friends as they traverse the trails of adulthood it sucks you in so quickly you can't help but be fully absorbed by their little wing wisconsin world it reminded me of a story on a prairie home companion listened to on a public radio station in a dark bedroom late at night this book soothes and lulls and invites you into their world and by the end you are cheering for the characters and feeling so thankful you got to enjoy the ride with them for just a little while very few books impact me as happily as this one has and i cannot recommend it enough if you're someone who lives in middle america i e anywhere not on the east or west coasts you'll find something in this book to relate to a must read 5 stars isn't enough","530":"this was a quick read i enjoyed all of the wisconsin connections i just kept thinking somehow that something more would happen but it never really did simple book interesting enough characters to keep your attention but wouldn't go out of my way to tell someone to read it","531":" this was not at all what i thought it would be from the title cover i had an image that it would be about a school shooting or other tragic thing involving gunfire instead it's a meditation on small town life and male friendship involving 4 males who grew up together in a tiny wisconsin town and who are now in their 30s and learning to come into their own enjoyable however after having said all that this book pales in comparison to the supremes at earl's all you can eat i read that a couple months ago and there are a lot of similar themes but it's no question which is the more entertaining and enlightening book just so you know","532":"an enjoyable quick read certainly a different take on the small town midwest experience than my growing up","533":" i received this arc through the goodreads first reads giveaway program bravo to this author's debut what a wonderful work of story telling you feel very engaged in the lives of the five main characters just doing life together it reads very similar to william gay's provinces of night which to me is a very high compliment it wasn't similar in plot but very similar to the structure of the novel a story of lives and how they interact together and separately from each other it's a book i didn't want to end i wanted to see what else life threw at this group of friends i anxiously await mr butler's short stories","534":"amazing heartfelt without being sentimental obviously written about a place and people that the author knows well zoomed through it in a weekend","535":"i thought this book looked great and was thrilled when i won this book through goodreads' giveaway program my favorite books are those where i am pulled into the story in the very beginning in the first few pages i like to connect either with the character narration or plot regrettably that did not happen here i did not connect with any of the characters and wasn't interested in what happened to them the writing was good but was more focused on retelling the characters' history than on describing the characters or their current challenges the back stories did not culminate into an engaging story for me and by page 100 i gave up","536":" i really wanted to love this book but i just didn't i didn't hate it either though so that's something the problem was this each chapter was broken up into one of the friends point of view which can make or break a book and this one fell flat every character sounded the same there was nothing to break it up it may have been better if it hadn't been written in alternating pov this takes place in a small town in wisconsin the author was raised in wisconsin he nails most of that it really should have been a simple story it would have succeeded if it had been i do love the small town wisconsin feel to the book though","537":"review to follow disclosure i received an arc of this book via a giveaway offered by the publisher","538":"entertaining enough easy read kind of funny ending","539":" audible kindly gave me a free copy of this novel which might not have attracted my notice otherwise the setup is a pretty familiar one a tale of five friends who come from the same american small town go in different directions in life and then come together again as 30 something adults finding that they still have some growing up to do the writing isn't really anything ground breaking but it's not bad either and i thought that there was a basic honesty to nickolas butler's sense of people and places two of the five main characters resonated with me first there's lee the brooding alt rock superstar who keeps returning to the town in which he had recorded his first hit album during a depressive phase and probably relatedly been in love ah hipster nostalgia then there's ronnie the former rodeo stud now living with the after effects of a brain hemorrhage connected to the alcoholism of his younger days looked after by neighbors both of their restless slightly unhinged narrative voices are well done and are brought to life by the audiobook readers the novel's central dramas though weren't very dramatic to me henry and beth are both solid decent midwesterners but a bit dull as characters however capable maggie hoffman is at reading beth's parts and i couldn't get excited about beth's one act of \"infidelity\" which never seemed to have much emotional conviction on her side as for kip the high powered broker he felt tacked on to the story never really graduating from a trope to a convincing character as another user review noted cutting a protagonist might have forced butler to add more layers to the others still just as a cup of microwave soup is sometimes comforting a well worn story format is sometimes just fine for my listening needs during a sunday trip to the grocery story there are a few moments of familiar poignancy in this tale of people realizing that their youth is over and they must deal with their baggage and make choices about the rest of their lives what a serious time our thirties are some readers may find the literally painful male bonding in the last chapter silly but i liked that butler finally upped the level of chaos and didn't go for the easy happy ending shotgun lovesongs would probably work well as the kind of movie my parents like to stream if given some charismatic actors good midwestern panorama shots and a stirring soundtrack as a novel it was a pleasant if not hugely memorable time passer","540":"i picked this book due to the picture on the cover it is a picture of lacrosse wisconsin minus the water tower it is complete with leithold's music and the arenz shoe store sign what is labelled as st elmo's is actually the bodega the story is really really good too of course how can it not be since it is set in wisconsin the story is about a group of high school friends and the changes in their relationships as they get older there is stress and heartbreak but there is also hope and joy the story is just so much like growing up in a small midwestern town","541":"worth reading if only because so few books chronicle friendships among men would have given it 3 5 stars but that might only be because it was the third book in a row that i have read that told the story from each character's point of view in rotating chapters it's beginning to feel formulaic and i am getting tired of it surely there are other ways to get into the head of each of the characters it seems sort of lazy writing to not find more inventive ways to do so on the other hand the descriptions of place in this book were superbly written i felt more in tune with the town than i did with any of it's inhabitants","542":"loved all the characters in this book and actually cared what happened to all of them i kinda want a spin off book just about lee","543":"it was so refreshing to read a book where the characters actually loved living in their small midwestern town as well as loving the people they grew up there with this book was a love letter to the midwest and i enjoyed my stay in little wing wisconsin","544":"pretty fun read loved the character development","545":"there were flaws here lots of them though the book is narrated from five different points of view each voice kind of sounds the same everybody is pretty nice pretty forgiving wears carhartts and drinks lienenkugel sp and i guess that's a real wisconsin beer that i would be all like ooh he knows wisconsin if i was from wisconsin i guess so it's a nice book with five people dealing with their thirties in the nice town of little wing kind of reminiscent of the big chill and i liked it it was engaging sweet uncomplicated i read it in a day it kept me out of trouble","546":"i really enjoyed this book it's a story about friendship and life in a small town and how we grow i just found the characters to be very real and enjoyed following their lives","547":" this was a quick exhilarating read it is about a group of friends from rural wisconsin who fight against their individual troubles to support each other in their quests for a better life i love the sparse beautiful farm landscapes the characters' strengths and faults it is alternately funny and heartfelt as we follow the people in their lives whether they are famous musicians ex rodeo riders or commodity traders we feel for them and enjoy seeing them make it through life they ultimately are good women and men who really try at whatever they attempt to do","548":"quite enjoyed this book each chapter is a different character narrating which works well here story of life love friendships centered around the friend who made it big as a famous musician but really centered around the core group of guys who's friendships have endured since childhood for those who care profanity and weed smoking why is this in every contemporary based book now but not bad and relevant to the story","549":"probably 4 1 2 stars","550":" shotgun lovesongs is just okay it was an easy read and somewhat entertaining but i found myself racing through it because i just wanted it to end the story was flat the characters were kind of cliche and i really never connected with them on the positive side the author does a beautiful job describing his surroundings he clearly loves his hometown and expresses it well overall it was not a bad book but definitely not memorable or thought provoking once you have finished it is out of sight out of mind","551":"it's a good book but maybe just a little too simple for me a real love letter to small town america which i can't help but feel we've had enough of i mean do we really need another book about working class heroes and their noble housewives i need a little more than that","552":"how could i pass up the opportunity to listen to this audiobook after living in northern wisconsin for most of my life i just couldn't i've always enjoyed reading books that take place close to where i live and shotgun lovesongs delivered butler did a wonderful job of creating a fictional town containing the things that make our little piece of the world special from friday fish fry shopping trips to duluth to commuting to minneapolis for the airport butler didn't miss a beat the story is told from various viewpoints and each character had a different narrator our main characters all grew up together in little wing and although a few left the small town early in their lives they all find themselves building their lives back where they started beth and hank married and work on a farm kip married a woman from chicago and moved back to little wing to restore the old mill leland is a rock star who spends time in the town recuperating between gigs while ronny may be the most loved character of all having to give up the rodeo circuit after sustaining too many injuries the book opens as the town is getting ready to attend kip's wedding kip doesn't spare any expense for his wedding and it is apparent that he has let the powerful persona he developed in chicago take over his attitude did not come across well to his home town friends setting a tension that would separate kip from the rest of the group throughout the novel leland and hank were best friends since they were kids but with ronny's injuries leland always took the initiative to take ronny under his wing whether it was paying for ronny's medical bills or not indulging in alcohol at bachelor parties leland did whatever he needed to do to help ronny feel like he belonged a couple of our characters hold a secret from years before and once it is revealed friendships will never be the same i think all of the narrators did a wonderful job of bringing these characters to life for me my only complaint about the audiobook was the choice of narrator for leland although i enjoyed his narration the voice just did not fit the character for me obviously this was a very small distraction for me as i absolutely loved the book otherwise with themes of love secrets and forgiveness you may enjoy this book as much as i did i don't hesitate in recommending this book for either personal leisure or as a book club selection","553":"reading shotgun lovesongs was a walk down memory lane for me little wing the fictional small wisconsin town in the book reminded me so much of the little wisconsin town where i grew up even the cover reminded me of my hometown which like little wing was surrounded by family owned farms nickolas butler captured the feeling of this charming sometimes isolating environment where farmers are the salt of the earth and people know their neighbors' business","554":"reads like great southern small town fiction only set in the midwest","555":" i adored this book the setting the characters the writing itself all beautiful it drew me in right from the start and didn't let go he describes little wing in ways that remind you what is beautiful about small midwestern towns and then summer comes the green coming in such profusions that you will think maybe winter never even happened at all never will come again long days languid days and the vfw post #88 all neon brewery signs all open windows and screen doors and sweet smoky darkness and his description of fall left me longing for the season even amidst this hard earned summer that ultimately i'm nowhere near ready for to end and in the backyards clothes pinned to lines snap in the cooling down breezes that signal autumn's arrival that elegant season that season of scarves and jackets that season of harvest and open night windows and the best season for sleep just a beautiful book that i was sad to part with when it ended","556":"didn't know what to expect when i started this book and it exceeded my expectations it is a story about a small town and i enjoyed getting to know all of the characters throughout the novel a good read","557":" shotgun lovesongs is a novel about small town america and getting back to our roots what we know what moves us and what we care deeply about it's all about people and what makes us great as a nation each chapter is told from the vantage point of one of the 5 main characters and they weave together into a very satisfying whole i cared deeply about each one valuing their strengths and understanding their human imperfections i saw shades of bruce springsteen in leland one of the main characters even if you are not from a small town this book has the power to stay with you long after the last page the writing is lyrical with the kind of sentences you just want to read and reread this is one of those books you can't put down yet as the end looms closer and closer you want to slow down and not let it go","558":"a good story about believable relationships it reminded me of a grown up version of rob reiner's film stand by me","559":"wow once in a while you discover a book that reminds you of why you love reading this book is no huge drama just a brilliantly told saga of friends growing up in a small town and the love that binds them no matter where life leads them the author's lyrical prose makes you long to sit on the porch with your oldest friend and watch the sunset and laugh about old times i feel so fortunate to have people like this in my life and i truly feel sorrow for anyone that hasn't experienced love like that this book touched me and it will stay with me for a long time to come","560":"a novel about life long friendships and feelings told mostly from male perspectives which is a bit unusual","561":"nickolas butler certainly knows how to write in the different voices of his cast i love books written this way hope he writes more","562":"this review has been hidden because it contains spoilers to view it click here i liked this book very much as a former midwesterner maybe you are never a former midwesterner i felt like this was a love song to the midwest the author is from wisconsin and tells the story of four friends who stay and leave the small town of little wing henry is farmer married to his sweetheart ronny is a former alcholic rodeo star leland is the town's successful rock star and kip the returning businessman i found henry to be the most realistic the most midwest ronny is the stori i liked this book very much as a former midwesterner maybe you are never a former midwesterner i felt like this was a love song to the midwest the author is from wisconsin and tells the story of four friends who stay and leave the small town of little wing henry is farmer married to his sweetheart ronny is a former alcholic rodeo star leland is the town's successful rock star and kip the returning businessman i found henry to be the most realistic the most midwest ronny is the stories heart in many ways kip the stereotypical winer and diner leland i couldn't quite figure out he leaves little wing to become a rock star but keeps coming back to this little town he doesn't seem ambitious in any way and weren't his musical ambitions what drove him out of this small town perhaps because i left the midwest i kept thinking if he has these lofty ambitions wouldn't he want to keep pursuing them i understand he misses the realness of the town and his friends his home but i wondered how realistic if is i really did love this book the author is a beautiful writer who at times brought me to tears i read several paragraphs over and and over they were so beautiful i got a little worried in the end i thought lee getting shot was going to end horribly but in the end i was happy more","563":"did not love this book shallow self absorbed characters i couldn't like or hate any of them enough to really care perhaps the author was doing that on purpose to show a modern day vain and privileged american group of friends but it just didn't capture me on any level","564":"as much as i liked the book i hated the ending seems like the author got bored with his subjects and decided to come up with a way to wrap things up before that it was a very enjoyable read with interesting characters and recognizable traits","565":" i thought i was going to like this book but i really didn't nothing ever happened with the plot and maybe nothing was supposed to and that was the whole point the book being set in a small town in the middle of nowhere and all but who wants to read a book where nothing really happens even though you are set up to think things will happen such a tease i found a lot of the characters annoying as well almost all of them also the singer lee when he was living in the farmhouse he had the owner of the house who he estimated to be aged anywhere from 75 90 buy his groceries for him and he never thought that maybe that wasn't the best idea","566":" this book produced such great rewards that i want to press it into the hands of everyone i know of course this is coming from a wisconsinite who will soon be driving like one of the narrators through the dells north through the pinelands towards eau claire to pick up my son at uwec but even if the physical terrain should be unfamiliar the psychic landscape of these 30 something characters will hit home resoundingly does every voice of the rotating narratives match the character rather than the author's literary ear no but cut nickolas some slack he tells the story with such warmth and heart that quibbles are soon forgotten this is a book which beckons you back to it like a warm fireplace on a wisconsin winter night cozy up and enjoy","567":" welcome to little wing usa this is the best contemporary us fiction i have read in a while the novel is narrated by the characters each has a few chapters and sometimes the plot is less than linear but not by much each character seems to have the same voice but the voices are lyrical the prose is cinematic and vivid butler captures the wisconsin landscape the way willa cather captured the prairie the plot develops slowly but it is compelling it cost me sleep no need to rehash the story it is enough to say that butler makes the characters real and they draw us into their world","568":" shotgun lovesongs is a well written book about some friends who grow up and apart together in a small wisconsin town unfortunately for me at least a book like shotgun lovesongs makes me think that an aspiring writer might do better going out into the world and living rather than spending time in an mfa program hemingway writes about love and death in the spanish civil war nickolas butler writes about a long gone one night stand with a buddies wife there may be universal truths involved here but they are not on the same scale","569":" marvelous in shotgun lovesongs nickolas butler shows his readers a glimpse of life and aging in a small town he gives us the flavor of wisconsin the hard gravel the deep woods the wide open fields and dairy farms it is a story of childhood friendships in decline as age and life grip each individual in deep and significant ways based in a small wisconsin town the stories of little wing can happen anywhere the romance the secrecy the myth and legend gripped me from the start this story is somewhat inspired by the work of eau claire native justin vernon and the myth surrounding the beginnings of his bon iver project as an enormous fan of the music as a born and raised wisconsinite i may lean slightly more towards the impressed side but that would discredit the phenomenal crafting and story telling that nickolas butler exhibits within these pages this is well worth investigating for any reader especially those fans of justin and the music of bon iver they may find themselves humming those tunes while reading or looking deeper into the story and reacquainting themselves with those albums throughout i thoroughly enjoyed this story and look forward to mr butler's next work","570":"four lifelong friends and the one girl they all have in common lend their voices to narrate this heartfelt story set in rural wisconsin though born and raised in the same small town of little wing each of the four men went on to live very different lives nickolas butler begins his novel at a wedding that has brought all four friends back to little wing a secret will be revealed that will change the course of more than one friendship with a plot that felt not entirely realistic but was none the less poignant shotgun lovesongs is a beautiful and honest portrayal of friendship love and the loyalty one has for their hometown","571":" even though the climates of arkansas and wisconsin are so different the way the characters related to the land and scenery and the way everything seemed to gravitate around nature's temperament it could have been about my own small town we definitely have a lot more ronnies and henrys than we do kips and lees though the way they stuck together throughout life and no matter how far apart they got there was still a pull back to one another was familiar when you're from a small town you become friends with all sorts of unlikely people out of proximity mostly there aren't a lot of options on who to be friends with so the farmer becomes friends with the businessman etc i loved the rough poetic feeling throughout you don't see the sensitive side of these types of guys portrayed as often as their gruff counterparts all around a really good book gave it 4 stars instead of 5 because it ended a bit abruptly and i tend to like things wrapped up tidily","572":"started off well almost old fashioned story of small town life wonderful descriptions of mid west america but towards the end it became a sloppy bromance","573":"this is like annie proulx lite if annie proulx were talentless forced to write in inanities and was busily trying to cash in on an old high school acquaintance's success that is to say that the book is working with the same themes but in a very shallow and sentimental way the prose is neither pretty nor interesting but it is mostly serviceable the most glaring issue however is that there is no real variance of the narrative voice between the five povs one gets the sense that it is one voice in five different circumstances rather than five separate characters the worst is beth who sounds so much like henry as to be indistinguishable unless she references clothing can't say i'd recommend it","574":" this one took a long time to get through this was not because it was a bad read but rather it was one that i listened to via audio book on my daily commute yet this story is perfect for car stereo and views of the open road shotgun lovesongs details the story of a small town and the tight knit group that belongs to it there is a loose character based on the musician bon iver in the form of the fictional character of leeland which may mean more to true fans than it did to me as it is the novel is a solid work the characters are vivid and lovable even with all of their faults on display the ending felt a bit cobbled together but the story probably could have gone on forever so it's as good an ending as any i recommend the audio book for the variety in voice actors you get that bring the story more to life #4starread","575":"home is the place where when you have to go there they have to take you in --robert frost | \"the death of the hired man\" the following is excerpted from home is a place you only think you know a review of nickolas butler's shotgun lovesongs which originally appeared in voice of baltimore on 6 1 15 to read the full review visit http voiceofbaltimore org archives i grew up in baltimore a metropolis once known for steel in the 1960s it was the sixth largest u s city today at approximately 622 000 residents it hangs in there at no 26 little wing wisconsin the fictional setting of nickolas butler's debut novel shotgun lovesongs is a farming town of about 1 000 its pastures and cornfields dissected by forests rivers and lakes stand in stark contrast to the blocks upon blocks of formstone row houses in baltimore that provided the backdrop of my youth still i can fully relate to the love butler's characters feel for the place that shaped them love of home is universal and ageless though shotgun lovesongs was released more than a year ago recent events in baltimore moved me to review it just this month unless you've been in a cave or far abroad you know what's been happening in baltimore protests following the death of freddie gray a young black man whose neck was broken while in police custody turned violent stores were burned and looted police cars smashed with bats and stomping feet in my heart i know baltimore as a town of mostly hard working people whose leaders made some damaging decisions still i can't see an image of her signature row houses - the well kept blocks of homes with marble steps gleaming or the graffiti tagged ones whose steps were long ago stolen or salvaged - without feeling the tug of the place i call home such is the case for a group of childhood friends in butler's debut novel shotgun lovesongsopens with an introduction to little wing's most famous citizen leland sutton a rock star - really as \"corvus \" leland a k a lee is renowned for his peculiar brand of northern clime inspired indie rock he's even won a grammy on the road he's hounded by adoring fans lusted after by beautiful women who use him as a trophy but the road is no home as butler makes clear early on in the voice of lee's lifelong friend henry brown \"he would call us some times the connection scratchy and echoing a chorus of young women giggling in the background his voice never sounding as happy as we expected it to \"the book is narrated in first person by five friends in alternating chapters but it is henry and his wife beth who narrate the longest and the greatest number of chapters they are the stalwarts of little wing of the five they are the ones who never really left they make a living in the manner of their forebears by milking cows and sowing corn into henry's ancestral acreage they've been friends since childhood have dated since they were old enough to find the opposite sex attractive they left little wing for a short period after college -- beth for a lousy job and lousier marriage prospects in a slightly larger town henry for a place so short lived and nondescript that he never even reflects upon it upon returning to little wing they married and have been married ever since they have two children their home is never neat they're always strapped for money still in the view of friends like lee who's made his mark in the larger world their life is enviable it is little wing lee repairs to when he's sick of the road and groupies his music and even himself in little wing his biggest fans are in fact his friends they know the words to his songs buy more of his albums than they need or can afford \"he wrote songs about our place on earth \" says henry \"the everywhere fields of corn the third growth forests the humpbacked hills and grooved out draws the knife sharp cold the too short days the snow the snow the snow his songs were our anthems - they were our bullhorns and microphones and jukebox poems \"if lee's songs in any way resemble this symphony of words used by the author to describe his own obviously well loved place on earth i don't wonder how the fictional lee sutton won a grammy at this early point in the novel it was easy to assume butler's ode was to a specific \"place on earth\" the author's butler hails from northern wisconsin it is but like all well written novels shotgun lovesongs is way more than that the praise butler sings is for more than just place -- it's for the place called \"home \" in all its varied meanings even when home is a place you merely think you know after lee graduated from high school his parents quietly divorced while he was out trying to make his mark \"touring the back roads bars and bingo halls of the midwest \" they sold his childhood home and went their separate ways dad to arizona mom to minnesota \"and so they left me homeless \" says lee \"little wing being the only place i really knew \"something irretrievable from his past is what lee really yearns for and it's embodied in people like henry and beth that's what continually draws him back i can relate when i return to baltimore i immediately head for the familiar fells point where in my college years i drank in old sailors' bars 'til they nudged me out the door highlandtown a tight knit working class neighborhood where i lived twice in the 70s and then again in the 90s oftentimes i'm disappointed at the sight of a parking structure where once stood a beloved bar once i lingered teary eyed before the padlocked entrance to the strip joint where as a teen and young adult i worked i walked through this door every day for four solid years i thought and now i never again will in little wing there's a structure that evokes a similar reaction it's the town's cornerstone an old feed mill with six story silos nowadays the mill is infested with mice and partially flooded with standing water \" it loomed over us casting long shadows like a sundial for our days \" remembers henry \"early in our childhoods it had been a bustling place where corn was taken to be held for passing trains... by the late eighties it had fallen into disrepair \"everyone has memories of the mill of its better days everyone would love to see those days resurrected enter kip cunningham the fourth of the five friends kip is a stockbroker after nine years trading commodities in chicago he returns to little wing a success his chicago born fiancee in tow in a ceremony to dwarf all prior little wing weddings they marry in an old barn that kip has renovated just for the occasion kip's old friends mostly find him pretentious he's described by henry as speaking to townsfolk \"out the sides of his mouth his eyes still trained on the news\" streaming from one of the four plasma tvs he's installed in the mill which he has also renovatedwhen he's seen driving around town it's with \"a bluetooth lodged in his ear his mouth working as if he were still out on the floor of the mercantile exchange \"still henry reminds us \"we respected him just the same he kept a farmers' almanac in his back pocket understood our obsession with rain had he not gone away he might have been a prodigious farmer himself \"the almanac he once told me was almost entirely obsolete but he liked to carry it around 'nostalgia ' he explained \"rounding out the group is ronny taylor he jumped ship long ago dropping out of high school to ride the rodeo circuit technically ronny was little wing's first celebrity he's traveled from butte to baton rouge laramie to las cruces making his name atop bucking bulls and broncos now he's back in little wing a prisoner of sorts -- he'd love to leave but can't whenever he tries he's lassoed back by some well meaning little winger who even ronny admits has his best interests at heart ronny's the town casualty in an accident involving too much alcohol his head met the sidewalk outside little wing's vfw hall one night long ago if he drifts more than a mile from what he knows - his apartment downtown little wing - he becomes hopelessly confused in a sense ronny is butler's metaphor for what happens when restless and ungrateful we drift too far from what we know and look elsewhere for what we already have at home this is true too of all of the five except henry the only one who seems not to suffer nostalgia when henry thinks back he exalts the farming life his parents gave him in the same breath he uses to boast about how he's improved upon it \" my father and my mother milked about fifty guernseys and jerseys - a fairly sizable herd for that time \" he says adding \"i've more than doubled the herd and right now it's all that i can do to keep up even with beth's help but it's fair to say that he worked harder than i do and i remember that too... this was before all the new machinery \"in contrast here's kip on why he returned to little wing despite the fact he had everything he needed in chicago \"i suppose it all comes back to those nights and mornings atop the crumbling silos with his friends ... feeling like we were apart from everything we'd ever known and maybe better than the place that made us and yet at the same time in love with it all in love with being small town kings standing up on those bankrupt towers... looking for something - maybe happiness maybe love maybe fame \"looking for fame looking for love looking for happiness lee found fame but not happiness or love kip has love and his own sense of what it means to be famous but he's not happy ronny found fame yet look where he landed right back where he was a shadow of his former self and beth let me just say she sometimes wonders what life would have been like had she not married henry and the mere act of wondering is the pea beneath her stack of mattresses throughout shotgun lovesongs is sweetened with elegies such as those above love songs if ever there were perhaps this was butler's intention in not giving each of the friends a more unique voice they are essentially five of a kind still i found it disconcerting when called away one night from reading in mid chapter i returned only to have to flip to the beginning of the chapter to rediscover whose point of view i was reading next spring i'll return to baltimore and immediately head for what i know is there great restaurants and pubs though not necessarily the ones i've been to or those that shaped me a lovable group of supportive writers and book lovers what's left of friends and family like kip who sees restaurants and pubs in an old feed mill i see perhaps a black owned pharmacy specialty foods store where once was a burning cvs","576":"the boys point of view of growing up together in a small town great summer easy read it needs to be a movie","577":"really enjoyed this book and cared about the characters 4 5 stars","578":" i love an atmospheric small town tale of lifelong friends and butler's wisconsin based shotgun lovesongs definitely fits the bill four friends and the town of little wing make up the central characters with intermittent contributions from wives and lovers butler captures the invincible and yet boundried adolescence of growing up small town the simultaneous inherent teenage perception that anything is possible and also the confinement of life to a cast of characters and setting defined by county lines place is as much a character perhaps the deepest and truest lover to any of characters as the people the harshness of winter bounty of harvest promise of spring all roll along year after year and etch their signature on each character all the seasons and the characters orbit a solar system of key places the old mill lee's house the vfw and hank's farm cities appear from time to time chicago new york minneapolis like far off moons but the gravity stays in little wing as with any novel that shifts between perspectives there are characters more and less evenly developed voices you want to spend more or less time with than others so much of the book hinges on lee and while i liked him his waxing poetic about his hometown can be a little repetitive and he falls into a woe is me bent more often than i liked although to be fair the thrust of his character is the proverbial fame and happiness are not intertwined life lesson so his melancholy is fitting within the narrative the other thing i found distracting about lee is that he is so closely based on bon iver that it distracted me from the fictional character it's a solid read and a refreshing portrayal of male friendship that acknowledges both the difficulty of emotion and the unflinchingly raw moments of feeling butler is definitely on my radar for additional reading","579":"i got the copy of a shotgun lovesongs via goodreads i was from the first page amazed at the talent of this author his description of the life of a midwestern town is so real that the reader imagine himself being and living there with the characters the relations with the different characters are as truethful as life love friendship and forgiveness i give this book 4 stars and i was amezed at the talent of this authir nickolas butler a name to remember","580":"i really liked this it wasn't a truly gripping story it was actually one of those stories that was more or less about nothing but i found it to be quite entertaining one of the biggest knocks i had seen against this was that it was poorly written and the characters all had the same voice i did this as an audio book and they used different voices for the different characters including a woman for beth and it really helped me feel like i knew the characters","581":" 4 5 stars an excellent read particularly for those of us who grew up in western wisconsin set in a fictitious small town near eau claire a group of friends grows together while young then reluctantly grows apart as they age this book deals with the harsh realities of tragedy infidelity and the differences between the facade people present to others and the realities of what people are feeling on the inside it's thoughtful and thought provoking as a bonus for la crosse area residents you'll recognize the cover art as a scene from downtown la crosse with a few changes","582":"3 75 stars i sucked this book down over the christmas holidays as greedily as if it were a glass of mulled wine the characters leapt off the page the dialogue crackled and it brought you right into the world of the american mid west which we on this side of the pond are inclined to think of as a place full of bible belters and gun toters the ending was beautifully done it wasn't quite memorable enough to get four stars but still a superior holiday read","583":"loved loved loved this book it's about a group of friends in a small town in wisconsin who try to stay friends through some challenges one becomes a famous singer one goes off to chicago to become a commodities trader before returning to their small town and one returns after a damaging rodeo career their relationships have ups and downs at one point i thought the author was going to let a character die no spoiler and i was so upset that it let me know just how much i had come to care about the characters who they are and how they relate to each other kept me turning the pages","584":"half way through this book i wondered why i was reading it in just a few pages more i was hooked that is a lot to read and stick with any story but it is probably due to this being a debut book in the image of stand by me this book relates the small town life of 5 friends who have gone different ways but return to little wing wisconsin for the big events in their lives while they are certainly not perfect you grow to love the characters and wish them the best sometimes hard to read but a book with real heart","585":"this book is written from an interesting perspective and i really enjoyed that particular part of it the story isn't too suspenseful or particularly captivating but it is a good easy read","586":"being from the midwest and knowing so many from small towns this novel spoke to me right away butler's descriptions of towns i thought i knew and wished i did made me fall in love with this book and its incredible easy to love characters i'm only sad it's over","587":"a beautifully written story about friendship and love loved ronny and especially henry","588":"being set in wi brings the book home the characters are very likable and seem so real the author's use of language is wonderful i enjoyed my time in little wing wi","589":"a little slow and the plot isn't really a plot since nothing actually happens but it was really nicely written and i sure do love reading about hearing about small hometowns","590":"this is a beautifully written novel which creates a snapshot of people and place complicated people longing for simplicity simple people dealing with their complications their history is shared in alternating points of view and timelines even though there wasn't much story it moved quickly i guess more than anything after reading this book i feel melancholy there was a lot of stark humanity in this book and it made it sad not taking away from the book because it was very well done it's just not how i wish for a book to leave me feeling audio the audio is multi cast and well done i always feel like maybe i'm missing something in the writing when i listen to a book but i think the way it was read really enhanced the writing","591":"five stars for the multi voice audiobook version reminded me of one of my other favorite midwestern novels plainsong by kent haruf","592":"well written interesting characters good story","593":" if you have ever lived in a small town or know someone who has lived in a small town particularly in the midwest you may enjoy this book 4 men all from a small town not far from eau claire wisconsin return home to little wing wi i like the writing style chapters narrated by each character and the story seemed to flow from one to the other no violence to speak of ok maybe a couple times but friendship renewed friendship love and making some tough life decisions make this a very readable book","594":"we read this book for my october book club an interesting character study about a group of friends from a small town in the united states","595":" i love debut authors because i want to hear the new voices and find the rock stars before they even play their first real gig which is why i am so excited about this book nickolas butler is going to be one of those rock stars this book is about a group of friends ten or so years after they graduated from high school there is literally a rock star in the bunch as well as a famous rodeo guy who got hit by one too many bulls and bottles a married couple with small children and a big farm to worry about and a wheeler dealer commodities guy who is collapsing under the weight of his facade they are closer than close yet everyone has a secret side that the others don't know about all of them feel lonely in some way and yet they know that they all can rely on the others i fell in love with every one of them i didn't want the book to end i wanted to go to dinner with them or go dancing with the whole town down at the mill but mostly i want this new writer to keep writing and i want you all to read this first one i'm betting you'll be just as hungry as me for more","596":"i wanted to love this book but did not told in the voices of 5 different characters the evolution of friendship and love is shown in a small town of wisconsin the setting felt very real as did the voice of three characters the other two took away from the development of the story well written","597":" i really wanted to like this novel not only because the cover photo is from my town but because it explored the vastly different lives of people living in the same town butler created convincingly flawed characters a hard working farmer and his devoted wife a selfish business man a depressed musician and a broken adventurer to butler's credit each character had his her own distinct voice and the stories wove effortlessly together to create a rich melancholy description of midwestern life however i did not like butler's view of wisconsin living he makes it sound as if everyone who lives in wisconsin is a hick going down to the vfw to get plastered and high and then heading back to the farm to milk some cows perhaps that's what it's like in super small towns but i disagree with this sad lonely description of life and that's what i really didn't like about the novel i have read a few other reviews about shotgun lovesongs and i have to agree that it is overly sentimental like many summer novels the story looks into relationships lost loves and how fast life really is like many summer novels it is lonely reading this novel i felt so very alone and sad each character had their own depressing story which dripped with overly sentimental descriptions of life love and friendship although shotgun lovesongs did not seem to have a strong plot it nonetheless spoke about the importance of friendship trust and honesty butler wrote convincingly about healing relationships and time which is a very hard thing to do but the level of sentimentality was a little too much for me each character had multiple flashbacks that led to more melancholy sentiments and hurt feelings actually the book was very distressing in that fact as there was just so much emotion honestly this aspect of the book seemed very dry and added to that lonely helpless feeling i also did not agree with the amount of intoxication my goodness two of the main characters were parents and all the time they were getting drunk or high and then they swore almost every page this bothered me overall though the book was decent not especially memorable but a decent summer read","598":"masterful characterization the town and it's people are so believable flawed and beautiful","599":"i wanted to like this book but it's so dull and treacly i turned against it about half way through i kept waiting for some plot development character complexity or insight but amazingly nothing happens i'm pretty sure no one alive is as wholesome virtuous and smug as these characters butler describes their idealized midwestern values ad nauseum without any actual introspection or critical thinking to provide counterbalance i understand that writing sans irony is an intentional literary if old fashioned choice but geez i just couldn't take all these midwesterners with no sense of humor whatsoever the basic plot small town boy made good indie rocker lee is miserable in the big wide world so after a failed marriage to a selfish movie star he fantasizes of a simple life married to high school beauty turned housewife beth back home in wi unfortunately beth is married to lee's best friend hank lee stupidly tells hank he had sex with beth back when they were all single hank's pissed he never knew such a huge secret but ultimately forgives all fact is homespun farmers beth and hank are in love and rich handsome talented lee just has to cope lee atones for his success by spending $1 mil making the old mill into a fancy music venue saintly brain damaged friend marries a nice stripper and rich selfish yuppy friend agrees to have a baby with his feminist baby starved wife the end butler permits these folks a few faux flaws beth makes macaroni and cheese for dinner henry doesn't work as hard as his dad did lee hates new york it all feels so depressingly phony and facile i found myself getting angry about it but why because i suspect nickolas bulter is better than this there are glimmers of an erudite and thoughtful writer visible through all the americana flavored pablum i wouldn't have finished it but it's for for my book club it's probably just not my taste i loved the goldfinch so grain of salt","600":"initially attracted by the cover which evoked a vision of small town america i wasn't disappointed well written beautifully descriptive nickolas butler has crafted a gentle story with interesting characters which held me spellbound throughout money well spent on this skilfully crafted book","601":"you know how sometimes books made you feel all strange inside just before you start to cry just me okay anyway i felt like that many times in the beginning of this story then it all fell apart after the man falls asleep in the snow poor resolution to the main story","602":"four friends meet up after years the meeting confronts them with who they were and who they became beautiful and tragic at the same time a story about what friendship and growing up is all about i loved it","603":"an ode to both male friendships and small town america that makes you consider the appeal of small towns and the beauty of strong male bonds written in the alternating voices of a band of friends the narrative reflects their personalities and adds greater depth to their stories butler's writing is lyrical when speaking in the voice of the artist grounded as the farmer fragile as stories unfold a wonderful book for everyone who enjoys travelling away from home in a book and peering into the ordinary lives of others","604":"the writing in this book is especially pretty and it was an easy read i didn't feel a connection with any of the characters but they held my interest and i finished the book in one sitting i don't know if i would have finished it if it had taken longer","605":"i loved the characters in this simple book about friendship in a small town could not put it down","606":"loved this book i grew up in a small town so i could really identify with the characters and the setting plus the writing is phenomenal i highly recommend it","607":"i really enjoyed this book it was inspired by the man behind the group bon iver who grew up in the same small town as the author it is just a sweet story of four friends who grew up together and find themselves back together in their small town made me want to listen to for emma forever ago which i love so much","608":"friends in small town wisconsin farmer rodeo guy rock star business man wife really good liked it listened","609":"although simple in its plot this novel is beautifully complex as it follows the lives of four friends from a small town these characters and the situations in which they find themselves are immediately relatable","610":" good depiction of every man's issues that come with the dawn of middle age including challenges that pervade career relationships marriage virility and accepting what we are or have become by the time we reach 40 something butler also does a great job of capturing a sense of place rural wisconsin even if the story mostly takes place during the dreaded pale days of winter i liked how butler's story and its characters enabled me to reflect on my own position in my life including the changing but still genuine friendships that i have maintained with a group of friends who i have known for over 30 years recommended the book for women as well as the character's story lines resonate with not just the men who make up the core group but also the wives and girlfriends who keep them close or may threaten to tear them apart butler has a keen sense for understanding what most married couples contend with as they manage the sometimes mundane but always pressing responsibilities that are required to maintain family life careers marriages dreams decisions regrets and commitments that shape us into who we are by the time we have come to learn that the alternative lifestyle we thought we would have achieved may never be realized i am keeping an eye on this author and looking forward to future works","611":"really enjoyed listening to this book maybe being from wisconsin helped but i found it very true to time and place not exciting but felt like so many people i know in northern wisconsin just telling me a story great job","612":" the big chill for the emo set also a good argument against grad school do you have to go to the u of iowa writer's workshop to write this badly the famous musician character speaking of women he's had one night stands with a surprising number of them can't find chicago on at atlas of america even if you tell them it's in illinois or on a great lake leave aside the missteps an atlas of america i have a fundamental question so in the few hours he's with them he's gotten out a map sorry an atlas of america right and given them a geography quiz i don't think so and the book is full of lazy sentiment like that the only reason i can think he'd be so careless is that mr butler believes his own crap 30 year olds who sound like they're 45 real people are more interesting than these dullards he's sketched here","613":"after numerous recommendations i finally listened to this book wow to me it felt like a wisconsin farm town version of friends but better sheesh it is hard to pinpoint exactly what i loved about it butler was able to bring to life everything i love about visiting my family's farm in wisconsin with his beautiful writing ok lets just say that this book it awesome and very recommendable","614":"the vivid descriptions held within this story of a group of friends transported me to small town wisconsin this is a tale of love friendship betrayal loss and forgiveness it is a quick read and while i hadn't heard anything about it before picking it up i enjoyed it","615":"as a disclaimer i won this book through a goodreads free book giveaway it was a really enjoyable read i loved the diversity of the characters i would definitely recommend it to others","616":"if you're a guy from a small wisconsin town this should resonate pretty strongly for the rest of us it's still a rich and well told tale of friendship shifting lives and the pull of a place i can see it as a movie","617":"this was an easy read good escape from what may be on your mind nice stories about friendships that stand the test of time","618":"i really loved the feel of this book based in wisconsin about a small town group of friends that get back together after many years apart reminds me a little of my city everyone wants to leave or get out but they always end up coming back","619":"it's was ok not a favorite","620":"set in a small wisconsin town this story of 4 boyhood friends is told in alternating chapters from the viewpoint of each one friend has become a well known singer one has moved to chicago and made his fortune and two have stayed in little wing the relationships between these men can be strained at times but butler creates a novel showing the deep love these friends have for each other and the town in which they were raised","621":"fun book to read on the beach it was well written but the plot was a little dull and very predictable","622":"got this book from goodreads giveaway overall this book was ok there are five different points of view each with a unique perspective unfortunately i feel like the different viewpoints rendered the story less engaging as the stories seemed to focus more on the past less on the present","623":"i really enjoyed this book i loved the way the beauty of the midwest was evoked and also enjoyed the depiction of male friendship","624":"i quite liked this great characters good use of shifting povs really strong sense of place i just felt a bit unsatisfied by how lee was treated at the end so that's why i'm not giving this 5 stars","625":" butler does a wonderful job creating his characters and weaving a tale of place rural wisconsin farm life the strength in the novel is how with such simplicity he conveys the bonds the friendships and love that his characters all have for each other and also the sense of place shotgun lovesong's real main character is that little farm town in wisconsin little wing somewhere near eau claire and not too far from minneapolis the only weak spot in his cast of characters was lee corvus the small town boy turned international rock star there was nothing about his character that seemed authentic to being a musician other than being told about how much of a musician he is and how great a song writer he is this character lacked any community of musicians he had no musician friends it was like he became a big touring sensation as if he were a stand up comic completely solo but that's not so weak all the other characters in the book really read with complete authenticity including that magic bound that have to little wing for me the story was a bit too romantic and at times skirts the line at being saccharine and that's why i downgraded this to 3 stars","626":"i tired i really did beautiful prose but no story","627":"http bindblottyandcajole com 2015 0","628":"nickolas butler's shotgun lovesongs tells the story of five long time friends in the small town of little wing wisconsin and the challenges these friendships face as each individual finds their place in adulthood one can argue that little wing itself is a sixth major character in the novel as butler describes the picturesque town in words that make the reader feel as if they are a resident of the community from the mill to main street henry's farm to the vfw the reader forms a bond with little wing making it easier to understand the pull the town has on all of its characters speaking of which each chapter is narrated by one of the characters so the reader encounters a range of emotions and complete set of details about each individual how they felt and their response to a situation i found that each character was quite loveable and had qualities insecurities dreams and regrets that any adult could relate to i formed almost a friendship with each character laughing and smiling during their times of joy and feeling sad or melancholy when their friendships reached a rough patch i must admit that at times butler's ability to describe a quality within a character was so moving that it brought tears to my eyes the scene where lee describes henry as a good man a better man than he was such a simple but powerful moment in the novel the way ronny describes his frustrations with remaining in little wing and kip's story about the bunyan's bring so much nuisance and so much complexity to each character that the depth of your relationship with these people is far more than you bargained for no words or summary can relay how great of a novel this is so i will end by highly recommending this book you will not regret your journey through little wing and you won't forget the friends you'll make along the way","629":"i really enjoyed it and was intrigued by the characters i hadn't voted for it and hadn't expected to like it that much it was a quick read","630":"this was an intriguing story about how our past weaves through our present i usually read books with either thriller suspense or apocalyptic elements and this had neither but still had enough intrigue to keep me wanting to read more each chapter is written in the voice of a different character and the author did this quite well i'd recommend this book to anyone who likes a good story with strong characters that doesn't need constant action or suspense","631":"having lived on 40 acres outside of eau claire for 4 years i totally related to this novel the characters are so rural wisconsin yet universal these are sturdy hardworking people trying to find their way in life","632":" i enjoyed this book although i wasn't crazy about the ending spoiler alert if someone is shooting don't you duck down instead of saying 'here i am' and when shot you don't go to the hospital instead you and your drunk pal go back to your house work on your issues until morning and then try to remove the bullet with a pliers finally when miraculously your buddy lives through this apparently successful home operation you repeatedly tell the story for years down at the local watering hole to the enjoyment of the admiring crowd yet no one ever says what idiots you both were and no one of authority ever gets wind of the story or cares to ask questions or investigate so a drunk armed teenager in a very expensive car comes flying through little nothing town in wisconsin gets showered in glass shoots someone and then just drives off and no cops are ever involved at all wow wisconsin sure seems to be a wild and lawless place do you ever get the idea that a storyteller has been spinning a pretty good yarn but then can't quite figure out how to resolve everything","633":" this book is classic wisconsinite soul food i don't know how much appeal it has with people outside of the small town mindset but considering i went to college in eau claire this hit close to home the drama is exactly what one would expect rural wisconsin drama to be and the resolution is full of passive aggression and ultimately doing the right thing my only complaint with the book is that i felt it could have ended about 40 pages before it did and there were a few ok kind of a stretch that this would happen in real life moments but they shouldn't diminish the beautiful prose with which nickolas butler writes","634":" five high school friends in small town rural wisconsin living in the present but looking back and telling us how they have arrived at this point in their adult friendship or is it friendship small towns have few people so odd friend combos do happen as well as intense friendship jealousies butler does a good job making one feel the atmosphere and how life goes in these types of locations being female it was interesting to read the four male perspectives regarding friendship if butler publishes another novel i will read it","635":" it is a bad sign when a book jacket is covered in glowing reviews from other authors but not a single positive review from an actual unbiased book reviewer i ignored that sign and read shotgun lovesongs based on a friend's recommendation despite the lack of real reviews when i read in the author bio on the jacket that the author was a graduate of the iowa writer's workshop i thought well how bad can this be pretty bad it turns out full of cliches and characters lacking truth in my opinion i reached my limit in a scene halfway through the book when superstar musician lee is pining for beth the wife of his best friend henry a salt of the earth no nonsense hard working dairy farmer lee is agonized by picturing them together her reading him the newspaper him painting her toenails i almost threw the book across the room with disgust there are too many talented writers out there to waste time on this kind of stuff","636":" this book is very much written for someone else someone belonging to a subset of people to which i belonged for 27 ish years people who have never lived in a small ish town in the middle of nowhere probably even more so for people who have no experience with this kind of place most people who know these places intimately will know little wing isn't quite right and the rest will hate the place little wing reminds them of too much to enjoy it though where i live now isn't little wing small it's small enough and similar enough that it makes little wing feel just a little false and the relentless romanticizing of it feel grotesque i found almost everyone except ronny and lucy unpleasant and or boring and i spent the majority of the book going oh my god shut up leland and groaning there were still lots of bright spots and nice images when butler stopped getting in his own way or letting leland go on and on listing colors and it was an enjoyable listen my first successful audiobook on a drive that took me and my girlfriend through dozens of similar cities there is something truly wonderful about being able to experience a book at the same time being able to pause and make fun of the same things for that alone an extra star","637":"the sense of place in the novel is lovely the friendships described are believable but some of the plot didn't work for me","638":"life long small town friends unforgettable characters good friends that are there for each other no matter what good read thank you nickolas butler good job","639":"july 2014 audiobook recommended by my parents after they read it as part of a casual book club a narrative told in a timeline from the perspective of multiple characters at first a little jumpy to follow but then i got it and it became easier story about a midwestern musician relationships and small town life the whole time i read i kept thinking of local to me american idol winner lee dewise","640":" xxx the small town tale of high school friends as they approach their thirties i was excited to receive this book though situated in wisconsin this could be almost anywhere with a population of less then ten thousand and a predominance of farmers i adored this book all of the characters are people you feel you know you empathize with and understand people you care about and want the best for i especially enjoyed seeing the story from different perspectives as the narrator changed from person to person i will add this to my list of books to buy as it is one i will want to visit again with luck mr butler will do a sequel and we can follow these friends into their 40's as well","641":"liked this book quite a lot just the kind of light fast read i was looking for to pass the time it can be annoying to read a story told through the voices of individual characters but i cared about these people and what they were feeling and thinking the end was a bit of a disappointment like mr butler got a little carried away with the poetic imagery right at the end but that was only in the last few pages really and wasn't enough to spoil my enjoyment of the story i like spending time with these people","642":"i'd give it a 2 5 i didn't think it was great but i've read worse there were a lot of loose ends and plot holes each character's point of view sounded exactly the same one of the main characters kip was barely in it all the characters love beth but i still have no idea as to why her point of view was a good portion of the book and i found her to be very forgettable the problems the characters face aren't realistic to me the only realistic problem is what happens to kit with the mill the rest seem like they belong on a soap opera i won't be recommending the book to anyone and i probably won't ever read it again","643":"i truly enjoyed this book loving description of small town life","644":"shotgun lovesongs is voiced from 5 different friends that have grown up with each other the story takes place when they are adults but sometimes goes back in time to develop the characters love is the main theme but it isn't necessarily a love story it's really delving into these relationships and how they grow i enjoyed the authors prose as it was easy to read but still colorful all in all i thought it was a good book and i wanted to keep reading which is always a good sign","645":"if you ever lived in or are from a small town you can relate to this story loved the friendships and the characters that were developed really enjoyed reading this story","646":" 2014 304 pagesactually i would give it a 3 5 it is refreshing to read a fiction about emotions friendships and small town america written from a man's perspective chosen by one of my book clubs when i saw the title frankly i put it off to last minute but started the story and was pleased to read a story i felt i was in a car riding along while being told stories of some one growing up in a small town it can be a little bit choppy in places but then you read what a shotgun is you will laugh","647":"shotgun lovesongs is a quiet novel about four men and one woman who grew up in a small wisconsin town of little wing each of them has taken different paths and they are reunited for the fancy wedding of kip a chicago stockbroker the other friends are hank and beth who have clung to their wi roots after hank inherits his father's farm that has been in the family for generations ronny battles alcoholism after a head injury put an end to his success as a rodeo star lee is a famous rock star of sorts who made it big in the international music scene and there is kip who should be center stage as all gather for his wedding bash but it's lee and his hollywood girl friend who everyone is watching shotgun lovesongs makes you think about whether you can go home again and if you could do things over would you choose a different path these are the kinds of questions i think many readers will ask themselves the author goes deep inside the minds of his characters and does this by alternating chapters with multiple viewpoints the best part of the novel for me was the way the author captured the feel of small town life the challenges each individual faced was well drawn out and the author does an awesome job creating a sense of community and friendship although i enjoyed this novel it moved a bit too slow at times for me it's a simple story more thoughtful and reflective it's a story that captures small town life its people and their conflicts perfectly it's the type a story which will appeal most to readers who don't need a lot of action for them to feel satisfied","648":"i really liked the wisconsin setting and small town background","649":"this book might appeal to setting u0026amp language peeps but this girl craves some plot also the multiple perspectives were unbalanced and the characterization was surprisingly superficial meh","650":"one of those books that leaves you thinking of it when you aren't reading it and stays with you after you finished i loved all the characters and the midwest setting definitely made a connection i stayed up until after midnight just one more chapter and then woke up at 3 15 and finished it at 4 21 am each of the characters tugs at you great story about the pull of a small town and the strength of childhood friends","651":"born and raised in wisconsin i relate to the places and feel of this book i enjoyed the story of life living in a small town while it seemed to start off slow i throughly enjoyed reading it as the story developed it was intriguing to me to know that lee's character is based off of grammy award winner bon iver i recommend this novel as it was a quick and entertaining novel","652":"beautifully written moving and true one of my favorites of 2015","653":"poetic nostalgic beautifully written so honest and human absolutely loved it","654":"struck me as being similar to the big chill absolutely loved this not only for the plain and believable character development but also for the description of the wisconsin countryside and smalltown life the story being told from the perspective of each of the main players in a rotation throughout the story was very well done looking forward to reading more of his writing","655":"after reading a lot of rave reviews i thought this might be too young and hipster for me but i fell hard for the characters and the small town setting it's a generous story about good people who are finding their way as they settle into adulthood butler really made me envision the landscape of the fictional town of little wing wisconsin his prose is descriptive without being flowery the book is a real triumph for a first time novelist","656":"are books on male friendship about drunken nights jealousy over women and wish i was doing something else the author confines his characters to gender stereotypes i kept thinking there is more to this there wasn't","657":" nickolas butler's first novel shotgun lovesongs st martin's press library hardcover is itself a love song to small town america and long friendships it's an ensemble piece with the narrative fluidly moving back and forth in time and among five friends who grew up together in the wisconsin farming community of little wing now in their early 30s they're facing that second coming of age where they're starting to second guess past choices and wondering what comes next hank runs his family farm with quiet competence and is a happily married husband and father his wife beth knows her high school sweetheart is a good man but a small piece of her heart still belongs to leland hank's best buddy who has found fame as an indie rocker despite his wandering lee keeps returning to little wing kip a successful chicago broker is also back ready to develop the closed mill into a commercial enterprise another friend ronny was a rodeo cowboy before drink and a disabling accident sent him home to little wing where his old pals can keep an eye on him at the vfw there are four weddings in the book but the only funeral is for the lost dreams and missed opportunities among the group butler writes with lyric ease but his characters are carrying around an awful lot of nostalgia to be so young they may think it's the big chill but it's really just an early frost from on a clear day i can read forever http patebooks wordpress com","658":"the ending was frustrating but otherwise this was a nice story","659":"really liked this audio version very good author did an excellent job of character development only reason not a 5 is that i compared it to my favorite book so far this year me before you and it wasn't quite there but definitely will be high on my 2014 reads","660":" debut author nicholas butler grew up in eau claire wisconsin and his novel takes place not far from there in the fictional small town of little wing five memorable main characters 4 men and 1 woman in their 30s grew up together in little wing they have long and somewhat complicated histories with one another each character narrates separate sections of this book allowing deep insight into each point of view character and his her feelings about the others some of the characters have left little wing for fame and and fortune others have remained but wisconsin roots run deep and all are pulled back to little wing home from time to time a sentimental and highly descriptive book much of the writing i liked very much but at times the descriptive language seemed excessive and didn't quite work for me a bit of an odd ending that i am still trying to figure out in the audio version each main character is read by a different excellent narrator","661":"one of my all time favorites","662":" do you still have friends that have been friends since childhood shotgun lovesongs is about four friends who grew up together in a small wisconsin town henry stayed to work on his family's farm kip became a commodities trader lee traveled the world as a musician and ronny was a champion bull rider no matter how far they strayed they can't stay away from home or each other as they get older they're learning how to navigate adult friendship i couldn't put this book down it reminded me of the friendships i've had and the struggles that friends sometimes go through butler brings each of his characters to life i will be thinking about them for a long time to come","663":"this was a well developed story about old friends","664":"i loved this book just a great read about the friendship between four men from wisconsin i found out about this book when it was featured in people magazine and was given 5 stars it's mr butler's a wisconsinite first book i'm hoping to read more from him","665":"i enjoyed the multiple character narration once i figured it out enjoyable characters including the jerks being from mn u0026amp wi the small town wi setting seemed very real","666":" this novel is set around the small wisconsin town of little wing the story is told in the voices of four friends henry leland kip and ronny and henry's wife beth the story begins as kip is getting married kip is retired from his work as a commodities broker in chicago where he was very successful and has come back to revitalize the town and maybe to show off his success a bit henry stayed in little wing working the family farm raising dairy cattle and corn ronny made a career in the rodeo world until a drunken fall caused brain damage that changed him forever leland lee persisted in his music eventually becoming famous around the world and with the money that came with that lee is seldom in little wing but always makes it home for big events and has made sure that ronny is looked after this time kip has asked him to sing at the wedding something he didn't do for henry and beth and lee has agreed but the way that kip has handled this breaks the friends apart for some time and as we see their lives unfold we also see what came before as they all emerged into their adult years this is a story of friendship of small towns of love and of hope i loved the characters here how the complexity of them is drawn out over the story as they all speak of their experiences you also get a great feel for the setting in small town wisconsin the sense of community and the ties to the land a great read","667":"great atmosphere and a strong start but it sort of petered out for me would be fine for the beach plane a good writer and i'd certainly give future novels a chance","668":"kind of a wisconsin soap opera with a down to earth theme","669":"if i hadn't grown up in the midwest i don't think i would have enjoyed this book as much as i did he wrote so poetically about everything i love about the midwest it was a breezy read not too complicated maybe even too simple all in all i'd recommend it to a midwesterner though anyone from a small town could possibly relate","670":" when i dislike a book i try not to dwell on it what's the point right but this one really ate at me for a lot of reasons first of all where was the plot construction is this really just about washed up strung out soggy musician leland and his crush on his best friends wife beth beth who he slept with once a decade ago yet he still dreams of the shape and color of her nipples beth who's about as dry as a uncooked price of broccoli if so then show us that don't tell showsecondly where was the character exploration and depth if these band of bros are so tight show us why their childhood anecdotes teenage angst and their newly minted midlife crises i don't think i've come across such a cast of characters who were so aggressively dulland why is little wing such a utopia of the midwest what pulls and keeps the characters there none of these basic insights were addressed and i felt no connection with the characters or the story i realize that this is butler's debut and it was clear that he has the ability to write but where is the story where is the breath to give the novel life furthermore it appears that butler grew up with knows knew the head member of the band bon iver although i've heard of the band i have to confess i'm not familiar with any of their work but if there's one good thing to come out of this reading it might be that my curiosity nudges me to learn more","671":"reminded me of the romantics at first though with a small town field as always a sucker for character point of view chapters","672":"if you only read a few books a year this should be one of them if you read tons of books this should still be one of them i'm normally a fantasy fiction reader sometimes a romance reader this was neither this was a story that i could not put down a gathering of voices from friends who had grown up together in a midwest town this story enchanted me from beginning to end men who had grown up together from boys diverging into adult lives and what happens to them from stardom in music success in the financial world a career ended on the rodeo circuit one who stayed to take over the family farm and a woman who loved them all but married only one full of passion friendship and altogether unputdownable you have to work take the day off because this is a ride you're gonna want to take","673":"beautifully writen such that these are all real people that i can care about set mainly in a small town","674":"i loved this book i loved all the people in it i loved little wing a tribute to friendship and love and humanity","675":"enjoyed this book reminded me a lot of another recent read where there were 4 guys reuniting in the midwestern home town","676":"i listened to the audio version of this book i am so glad i did because i didn't miss one of the wonderful words or descriptions what an enlightening book about an area and way of life i knew little about","677":"a quiet book that makes you want to stay in wisconsin for a bit","678":" i think this is one of my favorite books that i've read recently five childhood friends from a small town in wisconsin one of them now a famous musician and the draw they feel toward their town and each other i read that the author went to high school with justin vernon aka bon iver and basically felt like the tone of this book matched up pretty seamlessly with the tone of his music this book felt like winter and heartache but also the power and importance of people and places from childhood it made me want to move to a tiny town off the beaten path but simultaneously made me itch to leave it","679":"this book was a little risque for my taste but i really liked the story i was let down by the ending but the theme of friendship and small towns made it a book that i wanted to keep reading overall a good quick read","680":"slow and almost melodic no huge twists in the plot instead a very steady unraveling of the history of 4 friendships nicely captures both the intense love of a small town and the intense need to get away it took me a while to really get into it but by the end i was very satisfied","681":" the new york times describes this book best by saying it is about a hometown in wisconsin little wing and the close band of friends who will always feel its magnetic pull i thoroughly enjoyed reading about kip ronny lee henry and beth and their friendships disappointments and achievements the author describes life in little wing as here time unspools itself slowly moments divided out like some truly decadent dessert we savor weddings births graduations grand openings funerals the writing is superb and at the end i wanted their stories to go on and on","682":"this is an interesting story told from the view point of several of the characters i liked the way butler advanced the story with the different view points but didn't retell the same exact incidents good character studies","683":"shotgun lovesongs tells the story of a group of small town friends and how their relationships with each other shift over time and by certain events it was a little predictable but i still enjoyed it i think most of us have been in the position of feeling loss as a dear friendship changes or is somehow damaged which is a big theme in the book","684":"it's been a while since i've been moved by a novel as much as i've been by shotgun lovesongs butler manages to capture what friendship growing up and the changes entailed within are all about while at the same time reminding the reader that america as it should and still can be is alive and well","685":"i liked the writing style and the characters the book is slow but i didn't mind","686":"fantastic book especially if you are from a small midwestern town i swear i was transported right back there in every great detailed chapter and story it was incredible how the author captured the essence and spirit of being from a small wisconsin town some of the details are probably pretty regional e g the jar of old pickled eggs on the bar not a 5 star like some of the greats but definitely a 5 star for the trip down memory lane alone for me a super quick and easy feel good read to top it off","687":"i loved this audiobook butler writes in beautifully poetic prose about love romantic familial brotherly hometown love he delves into the wonders of rural americana set in the small town of little wing wisconsin which not so ironically is the name of a jimi hendrix song and interweaves the lives of henry beth lee ronnie and kip that will have you sniffling and smiling by the end of the novel","688":"there's an integrity woven into this because the author is so skilled he removes his own presence and just lets the story be told i was impressed with the rural midwest feel what it's like to be from a small town centered around a farmer's co op and a vfw bar u0026amp pool hall told from the point of view of five different residents and good friends there is enough good story to keep entertained one character is loosely based on justin vernon the band is bon iver so here's your soundtrack all by bon iver 'for emma' 'skinny love' u0026amp 'blood bank' 5 because this author has skills","689":"absolutely loved this book","690":"i received an arc of this book in a goodreads giveaway i've just now finished reading shotgun lovesongs by nickolas butler and the only word i could utter was wow then i wanted to begin reading again right from the first page i hated closing the book on these characters on this small town in wisconsin on these events situations relationships that butler has created that all seem so real to me that i don't want to let go of them i had never heard of nickolas butler before but i will be watching for any new books now he writes like a dream and i found i was wanting to reread sentences descriptions whole passages they were that good i've even posted a quote from the book to facebook and plan to post a couple more now to share with my friends there his writing is such that i want to grab perfect strangers by their collars and say listen to this he's a brilliant writer well maybe not to act that crazy but you get the picture this is the kind of author and book i loved to discover when i was a publishers' sales rep whose duty it was then to go out and convince bookstores and librarians to read it hoping they would be then able to sell lots of copies now even though i'm no longer a rep i still want to go out there and shout out the title and author's name to every reader i know buy this book or borrow it from the library read this book tell me that you love it every bit as much as i have enjoyed reading it whatever you do though do not ignore this author nickolas butler has proved to me that he is in the same league as some of my very favourite writers wallace stegner ivan doig kent haruf and yes even richard ford and i don't throw those comparisons around lightly congratulations to nickolas butler and st martin's press for publishing such a fine work of fiction and thanks so much for the arc","691":"a great read this book was recommended by a dear friend when i was worm out by deep and heavy reading while dubious i ordered it and started reading so glad i did i loved the inside look of some friends in a tiny farm town in wisconsin i will ember these characters for a very long time the writing is fabulous","692":" i really enjoyed this book i don't remember why i picked it up at the library because it doesn't look like something i'd usually read i'm sure some people would think it's too slow it seems that during most of the book that very little is happening i thought the characters and their relationships were affecting and personable the only slight stylistic peeve i had with the book is how the narrative skips around from different points of view and different times overall i thought it was an excellent read","693":"good debut novel about the area we live very close to","694":"could not put this book down very easy read","695":"not bad i enjoyed it no suspense but memoirs often are not","696":" my nomination blurb for libraryreads shotgun lovesongs is an ode to america's heartland five childhood friends a farmer his wife a commodities trader an ex bull rider and a rock star reevaluate their lives and relationships after reuniting for a wedding in their remote hometown of little wing wisconsin set in an old feed mill on wooded back roads around bonfires and on bar stools at the vfw their stories are funny sexy and deeply moving i liked the rhythm and flow of nickolas butler's shotgun lovesongs butler's straightforward approach is unpretentious it is warm and friendly and honest although the voices of the five characters sound a lot alike i think the consistency in style works well the characters are all from the same small town are the same ages and are childhood friends it seems natural that they sound the same that their voices are as similar as their lives are interconnected i didn't know until i finished that the rock star was loosely based on justin vernon lead singer for the band bon iver that's sort of interesting but the novel works without knowing who justin vernon is i wouldn't call this a bon iver book i enjoyed butler's descriptions of rural wisconsin which is close to where i live but the passage i related to the most takes place when an older couple invites a younger man a stranger to lunch because he reminds them of their only son who died in iraq i knew then that the novel didn't just have interesting characters or that those characters might represent larger truths about rural life i realized that shotgun lovesongs moved me personally in ways i hadn't expected","697":"i loved this sweet book","698":"to me reading this book was like listening to a country song slow poignant commendable debut","699":"loved some parts hated others","700":"i really enjoyed this book i am not from a small town or from wisconsin and i am not a male but there was still so much in this book i could relate to most of the characters were really likeable and it was a pleasure to read","701":"although this takes place in wisconsin and often talks about the land there this story could still take place in any small town with a group of people that have known each other all their lives often there are secrets between old friends and sometimes bad feelings but very often in real life and like in this book with a bit of love and maturity things have a way of sorting themselves out there were a few slow spots but all in all a really great read","702":"growing up in the heartlandthis is a charmer of a book butler gives us first a series of character studies each in first person and then ties their lives together into something of a novel it's an interesting construction it's sentimental it's poignant and it's sometimes filled with pathos all adding spice to his characters and their interlinked lives there is no continuing chronological order here the story swings from characters' memories of significant events in each personal life to events of mutual importance butler's tale s takes place in rural wisconsin mostly in a small farming town called little wing these twenty and thirty somethings growing up together drinking climbing silos watching their town all but disappear the town is a metaphor for their lives their mutual friendship at the edge of fragmentation just like little wing's existence is but the group's members persevere against odds in their mutual relationships as they do in perpetuating little wing as a place of repose a place in which life can resurrect shotgun lovesongs personifies the northern rural midwest indeed it's the author's love songs to a place caught between that area's farming past and the nearby modern urban life my rating 18 of 20 stars","703":"this book felt so real that i wanted to be a part of all that was going on the characters were so alive and so raw at times that i wanted them to be a part of my circle of friends listening to this book was key for me there was a separate voice for each character which made everything i was listening to more credible i adored the vulnerability of the characters i felt deeply connected to all of them this is a true and vivid story of friendship and one that will stay with me long after the last page has been read","704":"this did not win me over as a fan i found the descriptions too long and redundant the characters lacked a truth that would make me like them the familiarity of the locals was the most interesting part of the book in my opinion","705":" a light and easy read about a group of friends from wisconsin and a story about the american midwest itself overall the book felt almost too short what could have been a great exploration of the five major characters unfortunately turned into a whirlwind of love stories quickly leaving behind some of the great characters that were introduced in the opening fifty pages ultimately the storyline that persevered was one of the weakest and left me wishing i could have followed kip and ronny instead the other main issue with this novel is it tried too damn hard to be american i love stories of the flyover states of middle america of the legacy of making it outside of new york or los angeles or chicago or san francisco what could have been a great tale of the american landscape think of the sportswriter turned into a teenage boy's love letter of the u s american pastels american skies etc became redundant quickly a love story of the american midwest that fell a little flat overall a decent first effort and i would pick up another butler book and give him another shot","706":"this is a nice story about four young men who grew up together in a small town in wisconsin one becomes a famous rock musician one a farmer one a damaged ex rodeo star and one a financial wizard in chicago they come together for a wedding back home and things get pretty crazy it's not a perfect book but i always love reading stories about wisconsin","707":"this novel is about friends who grew up in a small mid western town some stayed some left one became a dairy farmer one became a famous singer their lives remain interconnected as they come and go from the town they all call home","708":"shotgun lovesongs by nickolas butlerthis book was ok for me i enjoyed the various pov's there were several instances where i could really relate in regards to friendship and small towns as i also grew up in a small town my life being slightly more restrictive because i was on an island and the cost of travel was somewhat prohibitive nevertheless i in my 50's now what would not change a minute of it i liked the story on the whole of it but it wasn't spectacular to me not a story i would consider reading again though i did share parts of it with my daughter on the subject of marriage and family that i felt would be good for her to contemplate and understand she is engaged w two kids she doesn't like to read much smhthe places people and things were easily imagined from the excellent descriptive writing style of this author despite the fact that i did not think the end was sufficient i still recommend this book completely dependent on your own likes and dislikes i think many will enjoy it it's a fictional memoir of sorts on small town life the customary yearning to escape and lifelong connections to friends and family with all that entails that not everyone gets to experience sadly the focus of this book was on a musician who did well in his career but it wasn't really about that it was more about his connection to the place and people of the town he grew up in with only a small portion of it describing his life outside of that the characters were great a familiar small town menagerie of types and situations ronny is my fave i received this book from the author publisher after being selected as the winner in the goodreads first reads giveaway thank you so much","709":"shows you don't need vampires teenagers or aliens for a good book just well written authentic characters and a storyline you will think about later","710":" not for me this book i normally love multiple povs and i normally love small town dynamics this one just felt a little too righteous a little too small town snooty and then there's the big red warning sign of the entire town and its relatives being in love with a woman the book insisting this is so but not showing why beth is the object of contention between two men her husband goody goody hank and his best friend the rockstar lee the other two povs are ronny a slightly slow alcoholic and kip the money maker who seems a typical wall street y ass even though he is based in chicago the other two povs don't matter even though they're interesting beth doesn't matter beyond the fact that she's a bone to be tossed between hank and lee everyone's feelings vacillates and not naturally beth maybe still in love with lee but then no she's not lee may have been in love with beth maybe still is but then no he's not lee's part time wife the beautiful actress chloe is set up as a good person who treats hicks like beth and hank nicely and then she's a manipulative bitch but then no she sets ronny's stripper wife up with a respectable job i guess this is supposed to mean that the characters weren't black or white but to me they were just inconsistent the storyline that engrossed me most was kip and his wife felicia there isn't much reason to be honest they're really paper thin but they were still more interesting than the people around them ronny was alright and had his alcoholism been explored there was the perfect opportunity for it to have been his would have been a compelling story but it wasn't that type of book this was a wishy washy angsty bromance novel that wasn't even much of that some of the things that bothered me why paint celebrities with a generic black brush at one point lee muses that the actors he knows are all good looking but plastic and with vacant expressions not the exact thing but that's the gist chloe kisses lee convincingly during their wedding but that must have been because she's an actress new yorkers get the same treatment beth looks at her small town monuments with new eyes everyday but new yorkers take their skyscrapers for granted soulless types populate the big city and small towns like this book's little wing are the most perfect places on earth it was annoying it reminded me of the art of fielding which annoyed me similarly and for the same reasons they have the same structure the same love triangle that's really a straight line with a lame side added for conflict they both have better minor characters who aren't developed this book didn't annoy me to the extent art did probably because i loathe music less than i loathe baseball but still a disappointment 2 stars","711":" as a lifelong small town resident i relate so well with the strange melancholy and deep attachment that comes with the territory of rural life that need to escape coupled with an abiding loyalty to the place that formed you nickolas butler eloquently plays out four very different scenarios among four friends who gather together in their hometown for a wedding with deeply felt consequences for all charming affecting and unputdownable butler's writing and these great characters live well beyond the page highly recommend","712":"i listened to the audio of this book and i felt that the voices were very well done i enjoyed the story very much","713":"incredible debut novel loved the descriptions of midwestern life small towns changing seasons and the relationships between longtime friends love jealousy unbreakable bonds hands down the best book i've read this year looking forward to attending a nickolas butler author event in the coming months","714":"this was a very slow moving book about a group of high school friends reaching adulthood in a small town in the midwest that is slowly dying i only giving it three stars and not two because i am from a similar area so the book had a certain nostalgic quality overall pretty boring","715":"such a fun book with a unique u0026amp interesting narrative style and good lessons about friendship and honesty","716":" we grow to know and care about and love the residents of little wing wisconsin the ones who left and came back the ones who stayed and are leaving now the one who never left butler's characters are drawn deftly a sketch here a line there a phrase a look a conviction they're new friends we're meeting and we're very glad to have been invited into their small tight circle a warm affectionate true to life read sit back and enjoy i had the serendipitous good fortune to pick up this book to read just after i finished the hard way on purpose david giffels's memoir of growing up in akron ohio the poster child of midwest rust belt cities the clear eye the joy and the affection giffels turns on his home town is indistinguishable from the brush butler uses in shotgun lovesongs to paint his story this pairing was truly an unexpected joy as each work reinforced the other i hope somehow each author is made aware of the other's work","717":" i grew up in wisconsin and the local flavor clicked pretty well with me for the most part i also love rock music so the themes appealed to me and i'm of a similar middle age as the characters still i wasn't sure i'd like this the shifting pov threw me off at first and it felt gimmicky in the end i liked the contrast among characters' perspectives the conflicts among the characters are a little everyday but they seem pretty real to me i like how it's put together and i think it's a great 1st novel guess i'll have to download some bon iver","718":"i always hesitate when pre publication reviews are so great but shotgun lovesongs lived up to them all this is a wonderful story of friendship love and the true meaning of home you never want it to end but when it does you realize that butler gave you just enough","719":"excellent story of five friends growing up in a small wisconsin town each going their own way but eventually coming back home mainly focuses around ex rocker leland his best friend henry and the love of their life beth great story","720":"i feel like i've read a bunch of these types of stories lately ones that track friends since childhood where one goes off and becomes a star of some sort still this one was my favorite great character development combined with perfect sense of place","721":"an ode to friendship in a small midwestern town being from a small town i can attest to what it feels like to have the same friends your whole life i graduated high school with the same kids i started kindergarten most of my friends married high school sweethearts and a fair number of them still live in my hometown there is an ebb and flow to the friendships times when you see a person every day and then suddenly you realize it's been a year since you saw them but going home still feels like it is one of the few places i can truly just breathe and be myself and those friends regardless of our fights perceived slights and broken paths are always waiting for me butler's debut novel was a lovesong to that way of life henry and his wife beth are high school sweethearts elementary school friends who are settled down with a family on a dairy farm in little wing wi lee is henry's best friend but he became a famous musician and now lives a life of the rich and famous but returns regularly to his hometown too see friends remain grounded and get his musical inspiration ronnie is a retired rodeo bull rider the life was hard on his body harder on his alcoholism and a freak accident left him with slight brain damage which impacts the way his friends treat and interact with him kip is the friend who was always lowest on the totem pole he never quite fit in right he moved away to earn money as a commodities trader in the big city of chicago but now he and his wife felicia are back to renovate the old mill and help revitalize the sleepy town told from these five alternating points of view we learn of their lives together apart and back together again there is no big event that has you on the edge of your seat no mystery waiting to be solved no revelation that shocks and surprises instead it is a steady story about friendship love and life i adored this book i loved the characters i loved the setting i loved the authenticity of each scene and conversation i felt like i was also a resident of little wing that i was a part of this group of friends and the audio was surprisingly good it was an ensemble cast with each person reading the chapters that touted their name i highly recommend this book and have no doubt it will be in my top 10 this year and even a solid contender for the #1 slot","722":" wow this book really grew on me the set up is pretty familiar childhood friends from a small town in wisconsin hit middle age one becomes a hedge fund banker one stayed behind and became a farmer one's a rock star and they're all gathering back in the small town for a wedding you can already imagine the trailer for the sappy movie version but by carefully using alternating points of view butler creates a surprisingly dense and emotionally nuanced portrait of these guys and their history together and i ended up being quite moved by it","723":"the writing is truly delicious","724":"set in little wing wi story of 5 close friends who's lives are moving in different directions it mentioned me cheese curds how could it not be enjoyable","725":" the book grabbed my interest from the first page but i was wary that the writing would be poor the author used some form of the word blush 5 or 6 times in the first 40 pages that is noticeable and annoying but i am happy to say that the story character development and writing picked up immensely the characters are very finely drawn and their relationships ring true the author did a very nice job in particular of fleshing out the characters lee and henry lee who has what anyone else would think is everything but because he does not have love feels he has nothing his best friend henry leads what he would self describe as a boring life but to lee he is the one who has it all this all takes place in the backdrop of small town wi which is given a spot on depiction since i grew up in southern mn and have spent a lot of time in wi i could almost picture myself in little wing","726":"loved the way the author captured the essence of wisconsin and its inhabitants","727":"i picked this up hoping it would be a sweet sentimental tale about about the midwest reminiscent of say dairy queen days which i adored but at best this book turned out to be maudlin syrupy and a bit hackneyed for my taste it's a predictable bromance tale about four friends henry who stays behind to raise a family lee becomes a big shot musician and marries the wrong woman a famous actress kip a hotshot businessman and ronny an alcoholic rodeo player who finds love with lucy a stripper who all take turns shifting voices to talk about where they have gone in their lives and where and if love has gone wrong for them right in the middle of this is beth henry's wife who had an affair with lee years ago causing a rift between the two buddies overall i feel that this book would make a better movie starring some of today's hottest 30something talent but was shamelessly hokey which could have been unintentional","728":"meh felt like a more contrived friday night lights from an author who just wanted to name drop bon iver sneakily quick and easy mostly rolled my eye","729":"read it with my book club everyone of us loved it","730":"sweet story of 5 men who grew up in small town wisconsin and the ramifications of the return to the small town great visuals of small town life","731":"this is an interesting read about friends it is a reminder that no matter how well we know someone there are still secrets it comes down to the loving and caring attitudes of those we extend the hand of friendship as we go through life i enjoyed the book and it was never predictable the ending surprised me and the development of the characters leaves me wanting more","732":"it's difficult to understand what this book's main theme is but it has many plot elements that make it into a surprisingly intense and nostalgic look at what matters most in life success and fame or friendship and belonging","733":"great story of four men friends since childhood the lives they live and their feelings for each other refreshing to read something about real feelings and friendships","734":"i received this book for free through goodreads first reads great debut novel really enjoyed the story of these friends lives recommend will look for future books by nickolas butler","735":"i haven't added a book to goodreads in a while but after finishing this book i just wanted to share how much i enjoyed it it's beautifully written and quite frankly i looked forward to the next time i'd have some time to read more it's been a long time since i enjoyed a book that much and i read a lot","736":"spoilers the book's main problem is that it feels phony not in its description of small town america the author coming from midwest living next to a buffalo farm in wisconsin is the reason his debut novel does convey that small town feeling rather convincingly the problem is with the story itself what we have here is a group of friends rather archetypical characters who complement each other for the story's purpose whose life and little dramas are centered on little wings wisconsin but everything works out in the end everybody gets their happy ending in a way that feels stretched feels like the story betrays its own plot and i think the reason is that the author does have an agenda in a sense he really loves small town america and its people nothing wrong with that of course and sometimes this feeling penetrating the whole book shining through at some points rather evidently like when he talks about america being about poor people playing music and sharing food forces the story to develop and end in the way it does as a debut novel it proves that nickolas butler is a talented young writer and ill be expecting his next novel with the hope that it will feel more authentic","737":"this is a beautiful book characters that feel so real you can almost touch them an absolute knockout of a story loved every word blown away by this one i was caught up in this right from the get go","738":" the five main characters are unrelatable and too similar to each other the plot is flat and the plot twists look as a clumsy attempt to build up some kind of drama or tension that ultimately results in unrealistic boring situations one after another i enjoyed the description of rural wisconsin life though ps i don't get why all the characters are thirty somethings but almost all of their parents haved died already and they talk about themselves as they were fitfty beth talks about she and henry growing old together old woman seriously","739":"i'm a big fan of debut novels but i just could not get into this book at all it's one of those where the premise sounds really promising but overall it didn't deliver","740":"very talented author descriptive writing made it very easy to visualize characters and environment it was easy to relate to the story looking forward to more of his stories","741":"engaging story mostly likable and interesting characters i found it intriguing the way the story unfolded where every new chapter revels that i didn't have the whole story before and i didn't realize i didn't have the whole story this happens again and again also the writing is lovely","742":" kathe wrote in her review on this book on another site this is not a book that reaches out and grabs you but rather slowly winds its way into your heart stressing emotion over action and that describes it perfectly when i started reading it i thought to myself where is this book going nothing is happening but it slowly and gently grabs you it is the story of 4 male friends and one female from little wing wisconsin told by each of them in alternating chapters from each one's point of view going back in time and then picking up into the present now adults in their 30s and back in little wing for one of the friends wedding they look back on their relationships with each other their decisions in life and what might have been if they had done things differently a well written and character driven novel which i enjoyed 4 ","743":"abandoned i just couldn't get over the strange word choices and the oddly drawn characters","744":"i was lucky enough to receive a copy of shotgun lovesongs through the publisher and netgalley it may be my favorite book thus far this year the story takes place a small town in wisconsin and is about a group of friends who stick together through the years despite the changes in their lives fame and success passion and struggle and love and jealousy all are depicted in shotgun lovesongs the title is the same as the album title of one of the characters who makes it big as an indie artist it reflects the pressure a feeling like a shotgun to his back of the character lee to try to prove to his friends that he is not a failure the love songs were written for a girl he has known all his life who eventually marries his best friend the characters in this book are so real that i felt like they were my friends i could almost predict how they were going to react to situations since i also grew up and still live in the midwest there are so many things in the book to which i could relate i found it a moving and memorable story that i will not soon forget this is a book for someone who wants to feel something when they read it would relate equally to men or women since each are so well depicted in the characters the writing style works particularly well by moving between each of the characters and being told from their different perspectives this allows the author to use the characters to tell the story not only thorough action but also with thoughts and emotions it creates a much more intimate look into their lives again i think this book will appeal to both men and women readers and i think you will find it to be as moving as the title a beautiful yet bittersweet love ballad","745":" so i decided to just drop this book my to read list is 200 books long and i can't really justify wasting my time on something that isn't holding my interest here's what i didn't like the book was boring to me not really surprising that i was unable to relate to a novel about four thirtysomething guys living in rural wisconsin being that i'm not any of those things i only picked it up in the first place because one of the guys might be kind of sort of based on bon iver sadly it was not enough not all that much happened in the first 50 pages while it's told from the point of view of 5 different people each chapter had the same tone and sounded like the same voice compare this to something like the poisonwood bible by barbara kingsolver which was also told from 5 different points of view but each had a very distinct voice to the point where you didn't even need to read the name at the top of a chapter to know which character was speaking at one point chloe talks about wanting to live in nyc because everything is there the fact that i found myself agreeing with what was supposed to be presented as a dissenting opinion in this book made it clear that this wasn't the book for me","746":"a beautiful lyrical read about friendships and small towns and growing up and out and in left me wanting to listen to an album that doesn't exist","747":"quite an engaging read the main characters are male which makes the read interesting very relatable as the setting is a small town in the northern u s","748":"lee ronny kip henry and beth a friendship that started in a small town it broke apart and went around the world and came back again to little wing wisconsin i'm going to be looking for more from this author as he is a very good storyteller these characters were very real to me and i became immersed in their lives well done","749":"goodreads win advance readers' edition poignant portrayal of four childhood friends as adults in mid america where each take different paths in life we see their interaction with one another and the level of friendship how one secret revealed almost ruin a lifelong friendship a heart warming tale of love","750":"oh wow it was great wonderful narrative one of the best of the past 365 days for sure never boring","751":"4 5 stars such wonderful and true descriptions of homesickness love sickness and feeling out of place even in the places that are most familiar","752":"i really enjoyed this book i come from the midwest and know most of the settings that are used in this book first hand if you've seen the movie 'beautiful girls' that's the piece of work that this book reminds me of well written good character development","753":"i loved this book","754":" probably 2 75 stars quick read about a group of friends from a small town all circling back to come to terms with the idea of home growing up moving on coming into their own based on bon iver as the author was a high school classmate there is something to be said about a simple storyline and a clear love of small towns and changing of seasons a sort of comfort envelopes you as you're invited into the lives of the people populating this wisconsin small town--grounded in love of family and friendship and wanting to be home but it fell flat with stock characters who all had much the same voice predictable plot and completely unnecessary strong language i'm always a fan of love songs to small towns it's where i'm from they have my heart so i might be giving this an undeserved extra star it had quite a bit of potential maybe this just should have been another draft could have used more red pen left feeling sort of eh","755":"i listened to this incredible book and there were 5 narrators the lovesongs are many in this book there is definitely a lovesong to wisconsin and a lovesong to male friendship and lovesongs between couples in the book the writing in this book was beautiful and gorgeous to listen to it reminded me of michael perry only it was fiction i enjoyed the richness of vocabulary i loved all of the characters in their frailty and in their strengths one quote that stayed with me sometimes that is what forgiveness is anyway a deep sigh just a great story with lots of intricacies a detail is mentioned and you are not sure what it has to do with anything but later all is revealed i love that kind of storytelling this is also a debut congrats a wisconsin author to watch","756":"decent story with interesting characters ran a bit slow towards the end and boredom set in","757":"well written with interesting characters","758":" this is a debut novel from nickolas butler and i look forward to reading his books in the future its the story of four male friends in a small town in wisconsin they are all in their early 30s and have all taken different paths in their lives hank is a farmer who still lives in the town they grew up in lee is a famous singer kip a trader in chicago and ronnie a former rodeo star the novel is the story of their friendship and the story of life in a small town i enjoyed the novel and the love between the friends its rare to read a book about male friends and i found this to be a very honest and interesting story definitely worth reading","759":" i received an advance reader's copy of this book i loved this debut novel about small town america specifically little wing wisconsin written from the perspective of five longtime friends in alternating chapters lee is a musician who has made it big after many years of struggling to be heard henry is the good husband father friend who stayed in little wing to farm beth is his beautiful loving wife kip is a successful commodities trader who recently rescued the town mill from demolition and ronny is a rodeo who is not altogether right after an accident i cared about each of their stories and couldn't put the book down i look forward to more from this author","760":"this was okay an easy enjoyable read although it was overwritten at times and a bit repetitive how many times do we need to be told about the characters' teenaged adventures with alcohol and drugs the characters and their actions not so believable especially at the end descriptions of rural life and the wisconsin landscape were lovely","761":"actually 4 and 1 2 stars i really liked it and was sorry when it ended i hope there is a sequel","762":"lovely novel i did expect different things to happen though thought it was more action packed what's said on the back is true it does make you want to call old friends","763":" shotgun lovesongs is before everything else a paean to the great midwest of the u s it is a sentimental reflection in part back to the days of growing up and together of five teens in a small wisconsin town and in part it is those five reuniting there later in life somehow the author manages to keep the sap from flowing to too great an extent while he captures the romantic sights and sounds of that place as seen through the eyes of his collection of dreamers and realists the story which i listened to on audio cd as i had won it through goodreads offered alternate chapters spoken though the voice of one of the characters each dramatic episode of the book is talked about from at least two points of view offering interesting opinions about the events that take place foremost of the group for me was henry the farmer the guy who stayed behind and kept his roots growing firmly in the town of little wing he is married to beth another member of the group of five and the sole woman's viewpoint in the book he is rock steady even as he faces the ongoing crises of making his mortgage payments second up is ronnie basically a comic relief character if there is any such thing here he left to ride rodeo and is now back one concussion too many an alcoholic but one whose friends keep him off the booze he is a best friend to leland the indie rock star who bears more than a little resemblance to bon iver frontman justin vernon look him up lee is back in town getting married to a hollywood star and confused about what his life is going to be spoiler alert it doesn't help that he once slept with beth who is now henry's wife and he feels the need to tell henry about it tailspinning their relationships kip is given short shrift here adding little to the story bouncing through his few chapters without offing too much in the way og plot development in sum i think hearing each character tell his or her story helped me get more out of the book than if i had merely read it the audio version has five actors reading the various chapters and so adding a greater depth to the meaning of the words the wistfulness and longing in the characters comes forward and the poetry of the novel paints a audible picture within you mind adding the experience of the book this story depicts the kinds of experiences that happen in the midwest the bonding over drinks the random egg theft the incidental shooting and the blizzards that can take a life which is just starting to come around to something important reminds me of the whistle of a long freight train off in the distance that one cyclopean lighted eye traversing though the inky night calling to all who hear her to ramble on and see the dawn","764":"loved it fell in love with every character and didn't want it to end","765":"i really enjoyed this and it made me want to visit wisconsin the characters were so well developed and i couldn't put it down definitely worth the read","766":"fun easy breezy reading though i had some issues with it spoilers way too much drunkenness here seemed like everyone in little wing was always looking for an opportunity to get s faced drunk that all became tedious for me and there was some redundancy and implausible bits but overall it got the job done i enjoyed it and the characters were engaging especially henry i look forward to reading more by butler","767":"this is a beautiful story about friendships and home i especially love this as an audiobook narrated by at least 5 different characters each has their own section of the book","768":"butler writes with heartbreaking honesty about life in a small town and how sometimes growing up means growing apart it's hard to put into words how much i enjoyed this story or why i liked it so much perhaps it's the realistic representation of what happens to friendships after so many years perhaps it's the unwavering love between these characters either way i highly recommend this book for someone who's looking for a good but occasionally melancholy read","769":"good story liked the characters felt a little at the end like there were some unanswered questions","770":"i picked up an arc at my work reminds me of mike perry's work something about small towns in the midwest that really appeals to me the characters are relatable and overall good despite their shortcomings","771":"i'm going to rate this book as all right it did not have many likeable characters i think we were supposed to think some of their antics were funny or at least fun but most of what the characters were up to was not interesting the shifting points of view various first person accounts was an interesting technique and could have made for an interesting book had the characters been better","772":"great book about family and friendship i like the theme of commitment that ru s throughout the book commitment to family friends the land and their home town","773":"pretty predictable but kept my attention long enough to finish it","774":"this was interesting in a folksy sort of way it involved tales of lifelong friends from a small wisconsin town but to me at the end it seemed to drag my preferred rating for this book is 3 5 but since that's impossible i'll settle for 3 0 but i'd have to say that for a first time writer it's a remarkable book","775":"rather than you can't go home again the moral of this novel is you can go home again but won't be the same and neither will the people shotgun lovesongs tells the story of a group of friends from rural wisconsin who experience the growing pains of middle age and how their friendships have changed over time what i liked most about this novel is the structure it's a collection of vignettes told from each of the friends characters perspectives taken as a whole they form a whole picture of the group and their friendships this structure resonates because of one of the major characters is a well known musician famous for his album called wait for it shotgun lovesongs","776":"summer beach read about small town wisconsin","777":"really loved it when i stared reading it and it was overall a good read","778":" i really wanted to like this book hell i really wanted to finish it but after forcing myself not to abandon it a couple times through the early going i finally hit the wall some 130 pages in at times butler comes close to hitting what could possibly be his stride but for the most part the writing is stale the plot contrived and there really isn't anything new or insightful here then there is his obsession with forcing his emphasis on his readers with his incessant use of italics which got old quick as this is not a new storyline there needs to be something new in it or about it and it's just not there for the most part this reads like a ya novel a fact emphasized by the large page margins and the just a little bit extra line spacing as if adding an extra few dozen pages to this would give it more weight unfortunately such weight needs to come from the words on the page not how they are arranged there and that makes these love songs a miss rather than a hit","779":"what a wonderful book i couldn't put it down great characters that reminded me of richard russo my absolutely favorite author more more","780":"this review has been hidden because it contains spoilers to view it click here if you liked the art of fielding you might also like this book its very midwestern it follows the emotional lives of 5 high school friends through their late 20s ish whose lives are intertwined in interesting ways and heading in different directions i really empathized with the character beth and ronnie surprisingly but had trouble dealing with henry's really violent urges although i totally understood why he was upset although nothing really bad happens there were a few times wher if you liked the art of fielding you might also like this book its very midwestern it follows the emotional lives of 5 high school friends through their late 20s ish whose lives are intertwined in interesting ways and heading in different directions i really empathized with the character beth and ronnie surprisingly but had trouble dealing with henry's really violent urges although i totally understood why he was upset although nothing really bad happens there were a few times where i was convinced someone was going to die and the book would get real real quick but that didn't actually happen more","781":"interesting story of four men who grew up together in a small wisconsin town tells how their lives diverge and come together i enjoyed it","782":"a character driven novel that also emphasizes place this book clicked with me due largely to my time living in wisconsin i was brought back to those small midwestern towns and boys who had grown up with one another and were now struggling with their grown up identities","783":"i really enjoyed this book about male friendship set in the midwest it's narrated in alternating chapters by four men who have been friends since childhood and describes how their relationships change as adults reading this was comfort food","784":"a quick engaging and entertaining read couldn't put it down finished in two days then was sad because it ended and i wanted to read more","785":"parts of this book i loved i began the book enthralled with the writer and his characters some of his writing is really beautiful but with so many characters in his story not all rang true especially his female characters but the writing that he knows about the long friendship of four men in a small town kept me interested until the end i give the book 3 75 stars","786":"love love love read this book i can't say enough about it i don't even know where to begin lifelong friendships in small town america just a good story plain and simple","787":"probably closer to a 4 5 i binged the audio version and loved it but part of the ending lost me a bit which is why the actual 4 5 rating","788":"heart rending and joyous contemporary novels set in wisconsin see also the art of fielding just seem to kick ass and kick ass","789":" this one had me from the very first page loved the characters enjoyed the way the surroundings were described found the relationships interesting and true i'd be ready to read a sequel if he wrote one at one point in the middle i had a let down when some crappy things were happening in the story however liked how things were resolved i'm between four and five stars on it so we'll call it 4 1 2 stars but since i hardly ever give a book a 5 i'm going to round up this time a really good read highly recommended","790":"i listened to the audiobook from the library i liked the main characters a famous musician a farmer the farmer's wife a business entrepreneur and a once famous champion bull rider these five grew up together as best friends love and good will abound with a little violence a little infidelity and much sought after forgiveness recommended","791":"good characters interconnected by living in the same small wisconsin town intertwined story told through various voices enjoyed the read","792":"i really enjoyed this book i started it tuesday and finished wednesday i loved the characters and how they developed as their stories and friendships interacted i adored the small town setting an impressive debut novel","793":"a love letter to rural wisconsin places old friends and the love of home i enjoyed this book it made me miss my days in wisconsin","794":" easily one of the top three books i've read this year i loved it every single beautifully written word of it butler made me fall in love with a farm with land and what it means to the people who live on it prosper from it and that's a hard sell on me i fell in love with these people these wonderfully flawed and good intentioned and kind and hopeful people they reminded me to appreciate my own real friendships the people who would just as easily drop everything for you in an emergency as they would help you wash the dishes and maybe i loved it most because it's timely to me this book explores how childhood friends evolve and how those people remain in your life or drift apart from it the shape those old relationships take at 30 it's poignant put this book at the top of your tbr list friends","795":"great story about small town life and friendship strong characters with beautiful writing i had to pause and reread at times his prose was so on target and beautiful i'll talk about this one of for awhile","796":"this novel is about a musician leland sutton and his relationship with his three best friends for life from little wing wisconsin despite moving all around the world for months at a time he only truly feels at home in little wing i wanted to love this story i enjoy stories about small town life and friendships that span a lifetime despite huge life changes and distance sadly there were times that i wanted to give up on this story the characters were very flat they never stepped outside their box so to speak no one even ever thought out of character even though it is told from several points of view i don't know about you but what goes on in my head is not always what i act upon it was like he was afraid his characters wouldn't be believable if they were not consistent in thought and action but that's what makes us human the story is told from several points of view as i just said there is henry who has been leland's best friend forever he is a farmer and he is a good man he is loyal to his family and friends he never has an impure thought or steps out of line at all ronny was a rodeo rider and an alcoholic he ended up getting brain damage which now gives him a much more innocent naive view of the world then there's kip who is a business man he is obsessed with money and he would do anything to make a buck then there is henry's wife who is very loyal to henry and would do anything to make it work not that that is a bad thing it just all had so much potential but i felt like it fell very flat the end of the book was absolutely unbelievable and a mixture of a bromance with chick lit mixed in it was something that i saw coming a mile away all in all the foreshadowing was obvious and the characters were dull if this author writes another book i would give it a go that's how much i wanted to love this book","797":" when i began to read this book after a few pages i was certain i would hate it i don't know i thought this but i am very happy i didn't put it aside the book is really wonderful it brings us into the lives of the main characters 4 men and 1 women these characters all came from a small wisconsin town called little wing as so often happens in small towns they all grew up together and formed very close friendships that lasted through many decades i believe the main character to be lee sutton a rock star each of his friends tell their story of their own relationship with lee it's a story of friends family love and betrayal it tends to bring the reader into the lives of these friends you feel the happiness and the sorrows they felt this is a debut novel but i think i'll be looking for mr butler's next book","798":"i loved reading this book i relished it ending was not my favorite but i would definitely recommend","799":" nickolas butler's shotgun lovesongs is a lot like bruce springsteen's born in the usa both resonate because they feel so familiar but at the same time manage to rise above their peers because they have a hard to define unique quality about them also like born in the usa to the ironically trained ear shotgun lovesongs can feel a bit embarrassing to find yourself liking so much butler's characters are such hearty regular guys that they teeter on the brink of cheesiness for the most part butler manages to stay on the right side of that line he succeeds because he has a keen understanding of the complicated nature of the present state of male friendship one of the characters muses that his father never had friends but that he himself has always had his close friends sometimes being friends is about drinking beer and raising hell but sometimes things gets complicated and just admitting that complications are possible or even calling them complications is enough to make these men feel uneasy it's unfamiliar terrain and watching these well drawn characters negotiate it is what is at work at the heart of this novel","800":"loved it really rich characters and a town little wing that is absolutely a character on its own multiple voices and they each felt distinct and compelling","801":"i liked it nothing much happens but a good read","802":"i received this book from a goodread give away i enjoyed the characters and their story lines it didn't hurt that the book was based in a small town in wisconsin","803":"i really enjoyed it but probably because i grew up out in the mid west the story of 4 boys adult lives after they'd grown up together in a small town in wisconsin interesting introspective on how things change but don't really change it's not unusual to end where you started","804":"i had the opportunity thanks to goodreads and macmillan audio to listen to the audiobook of this exquisite novel there's a richness that seeps from this story and has the potential to resonate deep in one's soul i found myself being transfixed to smalltown life in the midwest filled with the lives of four friends as they regain their footing during a time of discovery and growth a personal connection was found in this novel as i understood the significance of how hard it can be to remain friends with people you've known your whole lives they are the ones who know you best and you feel as though they'll be your best friends for eternity but what happens when life gets rough paths take us down unexpected routes and we have to decide on whether to keep clinging to this fragile strand or learn to let go of it piece by piece this novel touches upon all of those elements and much more told through alternating voices shotgun lovesongs digs deep inside the literal meaning of what happens to life once the fog of innocence has slipped away henry is married with kids managing the family farm on the outside his life appears to be simple hardworking and fulfilled lee followed his dreams to becoming a musician only to loose himself along the way ronny is daring in his own mind but settled by a soft heart that can be felt by pretty much anyone who has the privilege of knowing him kip is the rational one the guy who just never quite got it but longs to discover his own content their stories intertwine and eventually culminate back in little wing wisconsin but it's the type of ending that doesn't have a definite answer life's finale is not always played out with a simple resolution there will be heartache misfortune and uncertainty but there is also beauty self perseverance and forgiveness that shines through in the most unexpected ways shotgun lovesongs is a story that carries itself to the sounds of crinkling leaves quiet winter mornings and a soft whisper in a warm summer breeze the relationship between these characters and the small town they inhabit will leave an impression upon the reader that longs to be remembered see more of this review others at my blog u0026gt greads","805":"five characters in nickolas butler's shotgun lovesongs explore what it means to share a small town past henry and beth married each other and stayed in little wing wisconsin to raise a family and farm the land ronny is back in town after his days travelling in the rodeo are ended by an accident kip returns to become a local businessman after a successful financial career in chicago leaves him unfulfilled and lee is an indie rock star splitting his time between new york and little wing the place that inspired his music the characters' relationships to the town and each other are formed over decades and affect how they view and experience married life yes weddings abound in shotgun lovesongs from the mill to the vfw hall to the homes and farms little wing's paradoxical complexity and simplicity are perfectly rendered shotgun lovesongs is an excellent choice for book discussion groups and i'm ready right now for nickolas butler's next novel","806":"while i could put this book down at times it took me a few weeks to read it is a well written novel with pretty interesting characters who struggle with their own demons but they are likable and as the book proceeds we see a depth to them that is touching and moving i give butler a 5 as a writer but the story moved a little too slow at times for my personal taste overall an enjoyable read though","807":"while this is by no means a literary masterpiece it is a good read the alternating narrators helps keep things in perspective and creates a very human feel to the story","808":"i rarely give a 5 but the way this book made me feel well 5 i watched the lives in this small town lived just the way he told it this is how it is in rural america","809":"i'm not sure what i was expecting to get out of this book it was good writing and i enjoyed the characters deep down this is a normal people soap opera love and life happens but really this book was uneventful the little bit of action was forced inconsequential and out of place it's similar to what a literary version of the tv show parenthood would be like it's good writing so i won't say not to read it just know what you're getting into","810":"it was amazon's best of the month in march 2014 the story deals with of 4 men who came of age together in little wing wisconsin it is unique as the story features male friendship - the bonds formed in childhood that remain intact through 10 years of physical separation the author gently weaves a tale with nostalgia and \"what if moments what i found most enjoyable about the book were the author's descriptions of the land butler is so poetic in describing the landscape that lee loves so much here i can hear things the world throbs differently silence thrums like a chord strummed eons ago music is the aspen trees and in the firs and burr oaks and even in the fields of drying corn pg 48 i often felted as if i were standing along with the characters observing a land that i have never visited","811":"a character driven story with strong midwestern sentiments i really enjoyed the writing style and the story lines","812":"good read rang true to my experience of rural wisconsin life even if it was a touch heavy handed in portraying life in boniverville","813":"i enjoyed the midwest setting of this story parts of this book dragged and seemed repetitive i kept waiting for the big surprise 3stars is probably generous","814":" i loved this book on so many levels it's a fascinating story of 4 guys who grew up in a small town in wisconsin and their friendship butler explores how it changed and grew or didn't as they all moved on in their lives after high school some stayed some moved away but their lives continued to intersect it doesn't seem like many books really explore the idea of men's friendship or i'm just not reading the right books and it seemed to me like this one hit the nail on the head i also loved everything about the setting what it means to grow up in a small midwestern town what it means to stay and what it means to come back it was as much a character in the novel as the people and finally i loved the way the author looked at the various marriages of the 4 guys really a wonderful read and i need a guy to read it to tell me if the author really nailed men's friendships","815":"really enjoyed this one the town of little wing felt like one of the characters in this novel","816":"four stars from my heart two stars from my mind every character's chapter was written in the same voice and i had to often go back to the beginning of the chapter to see who i was listening to this was an easy entertaining read that didn't make me do any thinking only feeling fictional little wing wi was the main character here and i enjoyed the way butler showed his love for rural wisconsin","817":"3 5 4 0 for the audio","818":"this book is about four friends and their relationships that said it struck me how the sense of place was perhaps one of the most important elements of the book set in a town in rural wisconsin the topography town folk and importance of agriculture and the land take center stage","819":"i have one criticism of this book there is not a single town in wisconsin with only one bar no matter how small all wisco towns have a minimum of 3 bars that's truly my only criticism of this book it is stunningly beautiful i could have read 400 more pages of these characters and the town of little wing perfect","820":"wonderful story of male friendship in a small wisconsin town i liked the shifting points of view telling each character's story the whole thing felt very real","821":"so i don't know if it's because i recognize so may things in this book the people the landscape the feelings the pain i don't know if people not from these parts will get this book get the characters get the feeling of winter i'm roughly the same age as the characters here maybe it's that we're at the same place in life that helped me feel a connection love loneliness connection to land to people midwest it's all here my heart ached so many times henry killed me killed me butler channels the feeling of western wi right into these pages if i was teaching a wisco writers class this would be required reading this is a #wisconsinlovesong and it's also a #midwestlovesong if you're not from wi you will still recognize this landscape and the traits of the people","822":"spent a pleasurable sunday barnstorming through nickolas butler's buzzworthy debut novel shotgun lovesongs my baby boomer sensibilities detected a big chill for millennials familiarity to some of the material but this was always offset by butler's keen eye for rural wisconsin seasonal detail \"the october air filled with corn dust enough to make each sunset a postcard with colors like a benign nuclear explosion\" and above all the novel's clever use of the mythology that's grown up around the music of bon iver's justin vernon who shares with butler the hometown of eau claire","823":"fabulous summer read","824":"i enjoyed this book tremendously read it in close to one sitting and couldn't decide between three and four stars some of the writing was spectacular i could list any number of passages but below are some of my highlights overall i went with three stars because i couldn't really believe in the characters and i didn't completely buy their interactions the writing was beautiful the characters were interesting and i like really like that the story is set in rural wisconsin how do you rate a story that flows contains gorgeous language but isn't for this reader a complete story it aggravates me when people insist on an arc so i guess it's not that i didn't know where the story went where does any story go storytelling is just an excerpt of life but that the characters needed to come to life for me more than they did however i'll read his next book for sure here are some favorite passages it had been a place that smelled of dog food and corn dust and new leather and the halitosis and the cheap cologne of old men the coffee cup exists eddy said with a funny look on his face because of midwestern guilt and sunday after church breakfast in all my travels only in the midwest would someone spend their money in a place they hate simply because they feel bad for the proprietors i can identify with this so mornings when the vernal ditches sluiced noisily with meltwater and over the unplanted fields terrestrial fog hung in the air like so many surprised ghosts i went running the gravel beneath my sneakers soft and a little unsteady the best i can describe it music is the way sound travels in winter when everything is cold and still how at first there is no sound you can't imagine anything living or moving around and then after you tune your ears after you wait you begin to hear the crows in the treetops the barely perceptible sound of their flight their wings on the crystalline air and then more a far off chainsaw a motor idling ice forming creek water burbling past that ice icicles dripping birdsong layer all those tiny noises beneath lee's sad sad falsetto and you had an anthem for our place on earth","825":" a book brimming with characters that once you finish you'll feel as if they were part of your life all along a homespun story full of kindness it's a story about friendship but also about the choices a person makes regarding the trajectory of their lives and how those choices may or may not affect those closest to them i had the immense pleasure of meeting mr butler at a library author visit in johnsburg il and he came across as genuine kind and down to earth as any of the characters in this wonderful book","826":"i listened to this book it was very well read and well written i think the portrayal of small town friendships rings true i'm still thinking of the characters i love loyal and enduring friendship stories the more i reflect on this book the more i like it henry is the rock solid anchor of this group of friends he is true to himself and doesn't feel the need to reinvent his life henry was my favorite character i think most will be able to relate to the trials of the characters","827":"i thought the plot was a little slow and kinda dragged at times but the way of writing about a small midwestern town was really lovely at times","828":" a lovely story heartfelt but not sentimental or sappy it made me think of a black and white movie like the last picture show even though that is only set in the past and this is what happened to characters then and where they are now it's the story of friendships of growing up together in small town rural midwest wisconsin and it has a real feel of time and place it's told from multiple alternating points of view so it's perfect for full cast audio which it is with broadway stars filling the roles it's a poignant story of emotional journeys lives then and now how they interacted then and still do now or not closely observed flawed characters moves at an easy pace conversational prose nostalgic bittersweet emotionally charged tone despite the mispronunciation of south dakota's capital someone should surely have caught that it's a good listen","829":"having recently moved from wisconsin after 50 years this was like returning home to a macaroni cheese corn and hamburger hot dish i loved the straight forward writing and the honest folks nice change from the high powered formula stories of many established authors","830":"this is a richly textured story of friends and lovers and his ingeniously structured narrative takes us deeper and deeper into their shared past our understanding of their present is increasingly colored by the extraordinary secrets regrets and guilt they carry within them i've lent this book out so often i'm not even sure who has it now highly recommended","831":"a bargain book at b u0026amp n liked the cover that it took place is wisconsin and the it was dedicated to levon helms hard to get into but midstream it seemed to pick up interesting cuz i read this right after the interestings similar genre and about relationships between male companions sort of a male click lit rare in the sense relationship books usually focus on female female or male female not male male also the ending worked no spoilers here","832":"started out strong and then dragged with a ridiculous ending","833":"i did not expect to like this book as much as i did even though the reviews were so positive the blurbs describing this as a story of four men who are lifelong friends and the small wisconsin town they grew up in just didn't strongly appeal indeed a few chapters in i was semi congratulating myself on knowing my reading taste so well the story was fine but the tone felt gray and wintry no matter the season described and then i kept reading and by the middle i was completely drawn into these carefully crafted characters and their relationships and the amazing writing behind them i must have turned to the back flap a dozen times to see the man who had the insight and voice and talent to create this book and these characters the gray tone is fitting here for this small midwestern town world the deft portrayal of a rock star returning home which could have been a caricature was well executed and the voices of the female characters albeit more minor were so multi dimensional i was even more impressed that they were not written by a woman they were so dead on that i started to think i must be getting great insight into how men think via the male characters definitely recommend","834":"so nice to read about the friendships and struggles of men for a change butler knows small towns and about the jealousies that can exist between even the best of friends","835":"i read this for our book club it was pretty good not totally memorable but i enjoyed it","836":"i'm from wisconsin and live in wisconsin and am in the same generation as the characters in this book and i found nothing relatable the characters were one dimensional cliches and the tone was nostalgic and deterministic i kept waiting for it to spin off into something fresh but the whole thing felt tired there were moments of writing that were okay but it just didn't feel like this book had anything to say","837":"a paean to life in this part of the midwest altered photo of downtown la crosse on cover is stand in for the fictional small town of little wing wisconsin not far from eau claire","838":" a fine slice of life novel the work is evident the characters feel real and the conflicts between them and among them and between them and their environments small town wisconsin chiefly propel the story forward and keep the reader at least this reader engaged what might be preventing me from rating the book even higher is the timing of my reading i opened this one just after finishing kate atkinson's life after life which meant i was pretty much doing the comparison thing at least subconsciously and unfortunately for shotgun it was a bit like comparing a nicely crafted wooden table to the monet hanging on the wall above it so read shotgun lovesongs but try it after something that doesn't knock your socks off","839":"with so many books out there where things turn out predictably fine i was hoping things would turn out ok for the characters the characters felt real so much that i learned enough about them to find things i didn't like in all of them not a bad thing","840":" this is a chick lit book with a weak predictable plot and a whiny unlikable lead assuming lee is the lead the author is clearly more enamored with his prose than with constructing even a somewhat interesting story there's also the major flaw of two supposedly best friends and one doesn't see the other pining for his wife even though some acquaintance notices it at their wedding the book is filled with anecdotes from the past of these unlikeable characters where i think the author was trying to be poignant and insightful and was neither the one bright spot is the character ronnie who is refreshingly unique and interesting unfortunately however he doesn't make enough appearances to save this book","841":"i love the title of this book brilliant i just had to read it based on that and i really liked it small town america but big time life explorations friendship in all its riffs and changes growing up love loss and what 'home' really means the story starts off slow but gathers pace into a well conceived mosaic of character sketches plotted along the lines of memory milestones and the momentum into adulthood the author uses multiple narrators and pulls this technique off well as they are all different voices with contrasting views i particularly liked lee the musician who i've just discovered is actually based on the popular indie singer songwriter bon iver this made it even more interesting the interplay of fact with fiction i loved the poetic passages of his descriptions of music music as a season 'winter' in this case as the colours of a sunset the skyscape over a field clouds at dusk the author who grew up with and was friends with bon iver particularly excels in describing how his music emanates from the land small town rural wisconsin where the singer is from so i drove through southern wisconsin past madison past the dells and farther north the aspen trees so yellow that when a shaft of sunlight hit them it actually looked like a sound like a high pitched musical note so pure it was hard to keep my eyes open the sound of some divine sword splitting the air and the maples their red as bold as the hearts we colored back in elementary school those paper hearts we crayoned the hell out of to give our mothers after the set was finished the bluegrass band took to the stage and the music they played was like a giant bucket of water poured over a great tree fully leaved the notes dividing and dispersing themselves down gradually growing smaller and smaller joyously running bouncing flowing down down down from leaf to leaf as if racing one another a one child family suddenly multiplied a thousand a million times over each rivulet each bead each tear a drop of sunlight and glee i found these descriptions fascinating and brilliant in how they offered not just an insight into the artistic nature of a musician but articulated clearly the author's deep love of his homeland the different characters' viewpoints manage to encapsulate exactly the love hate relationship with their home the love of the natural space versus the constraints of small town living i found it all so real and affecting coming from a small town myself he has his finger on the pulse of life there alright the pull and push of it nothing much happens in terms of plot it is all introspective but it is compelling and written very well poetic at turns punch in the gut straight up at others ronny's narrative particularly so i've heard the novel's movie rights have been bought if so i can't wait to see it all that epic sweeping wisconsin countryside and the lives that go with it the quiet lives there being told out loud yeah that's the best way i can describe this novel or as one of the reviewers said 'shotgun lovesongs is as true as an honest day's work as serious as a busted heart as welcoming as a warm home fire burning ' amber dermont author of the starboard sea this is a novel about home an in depth exploration of how it affects our lives and loves and how it contributes to who we are as people affecting smart and all so real a modern american classic and frankly terrific for a debut","842":"i thought this book was very cute loved that it was supposed to take place just outside of eau claire wi i would highly recommend it to booklovers in wisconsin because who doesn't love reading about people in their home state even if they are fictional","843":" i really really liked this there's loads wrong with it the five first person voices all sound a bit too similar at times the characters are cliched in parts the one female voice isn't entirely convincing the plot is quite soapy at times and you kind of know where it's going to end up right from the beginning but honestly it doesn't matter i've read too many books lately where it's all about the plot where big things have to happen just for the sake of it but in the end you just don't care that it was a relief to read something that focused on place emotion and character instead i could really see the small town and feel both its draw and its claustrophobia the characters for all the flaws in the way they're written were vivid they outgrow their 'stock' off the shelf beginnings and live and breathe i cared about what happened to them i really did it's a warm and human book raw at times and rich at others quite old fashioned in its way and all the better for that if it had been written by a woman i'm sure it would have been pigeon holed as 'women's fiction' and i do mind the way a man writing about love family and loyalty is understood to be writing about something universal but if a woman does it she's just writing women's stuff but that issue isn't this writer's fault i wish the female character had been stronger but he had a decent try at her and i will forgive him because aside from that the characters are very real highly recommended","844":"four friends from a small town in wisconsin recount their memories loves and troubles as they come in and out of each others lives beautifully written and overwhelmingly nostalgic butler definitely has wisconsin in his blood and doesn't make a mockery or cliche out his small town characters leland ronnie henry and kip are all so flawed but good at heart ronnie sweet ronnie was my favorite my only quibble was that i didn't truly understand the draw of beth i wish a bit more time would have been spent developing her character despite the couple of chapters from her pov as magical as beths are ahem i wasn't quite sold on hers","845":"it's rare to find a book that i love so much that i want to read it slowly savor it i picked up this book by chance in a local bookstore and i'm glad that i did just a warning there is strong language in this book it's not for everyone","846":"this book explores the ties that bind and those that break friendships between the five main characters who grew up in and return to

in this book so well developed","859":"captured small town life in wisconsin memorably i liked the complicated male friendships portrayed","860":" i started out thinking i was really going to like the

picadillos and personalities we get flashbacks and learn about bad things they have done they have fights disagreements and then they well you can probably guess what happens next spoiler alertand

characters friendship knows no boundaries","867":"the reason i gave this book 2 stars is because it really was just ok for me at first it took me awhile to get use to the chapters being a different characters point of view but after the first 100 pages i was use to it the difficulty i had with the chapters were that they were written with the characters not only describing what was going on in the present day but also flashbacking to different aspects of their lives in their home town of little wing it was a little difficult to understand the story the author was trying to tell was the bottom line story about growing up in a small town in wisconsin and the different types of people that evolved from it or was it about a love triangle between 3 friends or about the love a small group of friends have for each other i really think that the book could have been better","868":"great story about a small town in wisconsin loved the characters and i have seen and met those types and wanted more 4 5 stars","869":" traveling pants for menwhat's it like to be from nowhere \"shotgun lovesongs\" is a coming of age story told from the perspective of four male friends and a woman who

their lives have a tough time navigating between around and despite these testosterone riddled relationships their struggles aren't without reward however mostly this is a story about childhood relationships that mature and become lifelong commitments this review is based on an advanced readers copy provided by the publisher","870":" i was lucky enough to be a winner of a first reads copy of this book and i highly recommend this book for all adult readers as i was reading i was struck by the audacity of the setting wow a book based in the the heartland or as east and west coasters may refer to it \"flyover country \" the theme though strikes a chord with anyone who has moved away from a longtime residence and returns to find that while the town may look the same the people have moved on just like the traveler the main characters are mostly likeable and relatable without being cliched the author uses multiple points of view which can be distracting until spoiler alert the reader finds character's the first initial as a chapter heading allowing the reader to track descriptions of midwest life in little wing wisconsin a small town struggling to stay afloat with boarded

tropes and great writing to boot this was a very satisfying read and i enjoyed escaping into a familiar location with people i might have known back in the day","876":"i loved this book it made me miss minnesota winters which is crazy i loved loved loved this book","877":"an unexpectedly lovely book and refreshing to see chick lit written by and about a bunch of dudes instead an authentic excursion into small town life in middle america and maybe the prose is just slightly overblown in places a little bit too much rambling about the sherbet colored sky and maybe some of the situations in which the guys find themselves veer on absurd i could have done without a lot of the fallout from the pickled eggs incident but i found myself unexpectedly touched both by these stories and by the non linear storytelling through which they unfolded","878":"very midwestern kind of a comforting read that way small town illinois with all the classic characters the local boy who inherited the family farm the one who got out and became a big shot and came home to prove it the one who followed his bliss and became famous for it and the good friend who is a little off due to a brain injury i

interesting characters this book earns your affection almost immediately if you've ever lived in a small town you will probably feel like you \"recognize\" little wing the book's fictional town close to eau claire wisconsin the story is centered on six friends in their early thirties henry and beth brown leland lee sutton ronny taylor and kip and felicia cunningham all of whom are anchored to little wing by a deep sense of place lee is supposedly based in part on justin vernon lead singer of the band bon iver who came originally from eau claire where the author grew up lee a successful folk rock musician has his biggest fans among his hometown friends and it is in his hometown where he also finds his inspiration as revealed by these poetic passages \"and in the fields as it is in the forests the springtime prairie fires and tire fires and sit spreaders slowly spraying the fields with rich rich manure sandhill cranes and whooping cranes in the sky big as b 52s and all the other myriad birds come back home like returned mail making the night sky loud as any good homecoming party and then summer comes the green coming in such profusions that you think maybe winter never even happened at all never will come again \" \"late night softball games at rural diamonds behind crossroads taverns where the sodium nitrate lights bring in billions of bugs and moths ... and in the backyards clothes pinned to lines snap in the cooling down breezes that signal autumn's arrival that elegant season that season of scarves and jackets that season of harvest and open night windows and the best season for sleep \"when lee was answering questions about how to learn to sing he'd say \"sing like you've got no audience sing like you don't know what a critic is sing about your hometown sing about your prom sing about deer sing about the seasons sing about your mother sing about chainsaws sing about the thaw sing about the rivers sing about forests sing about the prairies but whatever you do start singing early in the morning if only just to keep warm and if you happen to live in a warm beautiful place ... move to wisconsin buy a woodstove and spend a week splitting wood it worked for me \"around this hub of little wing and the old mill at the center of town which serves as its focus the characters spin their interconnected stories in alternate chapters henry and beth are the paragon of a married couple to which the others aspire yet they have their own struggles lee is their tragic muse whose life seems so glamorous but he can't always get what he wants ronny is the damaged alcoholic they all take care of and kip and felicia represent the outside the world beyond little wing the characters argue with one another but in the end they are each other's families each other's homes as the author alerts us in his epigraph from moby dick the feelings they have for each other are deeply rooted \"but heave ahead boy i'd rather be killed by you than kept alive by any other man \"i loved this book up until the end when it just... ended... but i guess that's part of why i keep thinking about the story evaluation excellent writing with a story that merits a broader audience","882":"shotgun lovesongs by nickolas butleran eau claire author where i'm from has hit the big time we're talking huge here people author nickolas butler was fought over by high brow

home... more","883":" this book seems to be the darling of this spring's new crop of books i read so many rave reviews i could hardly wait to get my hands on it it was a good portrait of small town rural wisconsin and the characters came to life for me but it fell a little flat for me little wing wisconsin produced a famous rock musician named lee who returns to his beloved town between gigs desperate for some midwest simple living basically this is a story of male friendship love and rivalry but since lee was supposed to be such a gifted songwriter and because his first album deeply relates to his origins and love for beth his best friend's wife i expected to at least read the lyrics of some of those songs but they were not included picky me all in all it kept my interest and did have some deeply human heartbreaking or illuminating moments but it did not bowl me over","884":"i liked it but wasn't blown away the story was told from the perspectives of a few different people but all of their voices sounded identical","885":" i thought this was a great read there are well developed and interesting characters as well as a provocative interplay between them i liked how each chapter was told from the point of view of a different character and how little pieces of their histories were gradually revealed as you went along as you read you grew to understand in a very natural way more and more of the larger fabric of their lives and friendships i didn't necessarily like the big incident at the end of the book i found it very odd and frankly kind of stupid but i understand that the characters involved were at a weird place themselves and something out of the ordinary was maybe the only way to get them out of their funk nevertheless it seemed a little out of place to me and a bit misaligned with the tenor of the book as a whole however the rest of the book was very well done i always wanted to keep reading as i wondered if things might turn out differently with the couples but i love how they each of those relationships were handled and narratively justified but perhaps the star of the book and my favorite aspect in butler's novel is his pitch perfect description of place he captures so well the spirit of wisconsin and the meaning of home as someone born and raised in wisconsin i was proud to be from and living in this state as i read his novel his writing helped remind me of the the wonderful attributes and quirks of a small town and of our state in general he helped bring forward the little details of home and life that we can take for granted but that are so beautifully meaningful in ways we don't necessarily realize that was a special gift with this read","886":"really enjoyed this book i loved how the lives of all the characters intertwined and how the setting was such a huge part of the story the author made me feel like i was right there and made me care about all of these people i loved their small town world wish i could've stayed there a little bit longer","887":"loved this book fell in love with the people and even made wisconsin appealing to me amazing debut a must read ","888":"if i could have given this 6 stars i would the author has beautiful prose and a great sense of place i loved the characters it's mostly a story of a friendship between hank and lee with other supporting cast members if i have one complaint it is that the others characters fade of quickly at the end of the book i want more about kip and his wife and the ending was a bit weak but i truly loved it and look forward to more from this author","889":" enjoyed this book of midwestern friendship on valentine's day a rather romantic tale of friendship and love told in varying chapters by each of the friends henry beth ronnie kip and lee surrounded by the land they love filled with the music of memories and future sunrises the author specifically writes about small town friendship but i think it can be applied to larger towns and even cities that childhood friendship that binds you together for life some people have that and some people find their friends in their spouse children and family having family in eau claire and sons with childhood buddies made me enjoy and appreciate this even more","890":"beautifully written nickolas butler was absolutely meant to write","891":"it dragged out a bit for me without a lot of plot i enjoyed the characters though","892":"i thought this was a great book it's more of a man's book but a very enjoyable well written book set in small town wisconsin it's about 4 men that have been friends since grade school and how their lives evolve each chapter written in the first person by a different character reminds me of an anne tyler or richard russo book","893":"sometimes you pick up a book and it feels as if you are visiting your best friends slipping in to say hello u0026amp to catch up on where you are in your lives i felt this way as soon as i started reading this book i couldn't put it down when i finished i told my husband i felt as if i was leaving a part of myself behind in this small town i will certainly pick up another of nickolas butler's books he's a great story teller","894":"notes if possible i would've given this a 3 75 i enjoyed the multiple narrators quite a bit and i bet this would be a great book to listen to while on a road trip something about the music aspect the descriptions and the lifelong friendships seem like they would be the perfect accompaniment to the open road of the highway as for the story the characters are well developed and i liked the multiple viewpoints and the way it jump back and forth in time it kept a relatively untwisty story a bit more interesting","895":"an elegy for small town life for lifelong friendships for loves won and lost for joy and pain success and failure leaving and returning the cycle of the seasons coming to terms starting over wondering about what might have been taking stock of what is moving on settling down a lovely book","896":"a touching book about a lifelong friendship between four men","897":"very shallow and disappointing","898":"i listened to the audiobook version of this book and enjoyed it more than some of the reviews i have read while somewhat predictable i enjoyed the narrative and descriptions of small town life i did not realize that it is based on a real musician and i will have to do some more research on it i think it would make a good book club book","899":"beautiful read the book in one sitting wonderful writing and compelling characters","900":" it's one of those little books you find by chance on a bookshelf in your favourite bookshop you have not heard about it but being a music lover you feel attracted by the title so you open it and start to read it over and then you get transported to a little town and a tiny group of people living common lives but very different from yours and suddenly you realize that these four people have memories feelings doubts problems and that they question their decisions like you do and then you smile and appreciate the little things of life and enjoy the things you take for granted you sit on the floor and listen to your old vinyl collection and want to phone all your high school friends those who grew up with you who really know who you were and who you still are you're smile gets bigger because you know that now you're also part of hank ronny lee and kip and there's nothing like real friendship","901":"really enjoyed this an honest and funny and moving book about friendship and marriage i teared up at least a dozen times will leave you feeling happy great ending","902":"damn that was a good book guys i don't even know what to say right now i loved this small town and these characters that felt so real and honest i laughed and i cried a beautifully written book about love friendship and redemption","903":"fun softly melodramatic and still well written a pleasure to consume","904":"this book felt like i was reading about my hometown based in the town of little wing wisconsin this story revolves around a big time musician returning home some of the other reviews have stated that the characters seem cliched typical small town characters but there's no denying the honesty in the details of the story anyone who has lived in a rural village will read this and nod yep mhmm been there done that they're typical characters because those are actual characters we're all the same i absolutely loved the book i adore novels that are written from different characters' perspectives and this one features different narrators in each chapter","905":"loved this deceptively simple novel and was surprised by it since homespun is not often something i treasure but this plainspoken story about four guys and the town they grew up in and the secrets they keep has stayed with me i grew up in a smallish place too and while it was completely different from little wing wisconsin the alliances and secrets formed there travel with me","906":" this book is or at least wants to be an examination of small town life the storytelling is shared by five narrators who all grew up together went their separate ways and then found their way back to their small wisconsin farming community for various reasons the author was unable to resist redeeming everyone and sacrificed depth for a happy ending the changing viewpoints was a bad call the author was unable to sufficiently distinguish them aspects of the characters were cliched and there was a glorification of america that presented as naive rather than moving there were moments of really great tension and clarity some very lovely prose but kent haruf does a much finer and subtler job of exploring small town values and struggles so i'd pick up plainsong rather than this book if that appeals to you","907":"first novel by this author a story of a musician u0026amp his friends in a small wisconsin town and their travels to chicago u0026amp nyc they're consistently drawn back to the small town where they grew up together excellent quick read","908":"this book is a good example of why i give a book at least fifty pages before deciding whether or not to dnf it at the beginning of this novel i got fidgety what is this book about what's with all the long character introductions and the author did something that annoyed the mess outta me each chapter is told in first person and alternates between the characters i e kip is one chapter beth the next lee the one after and so on and so forth the problem is you have no way of knowing who the character is until a few paragraphs in one time i had read the whole chapter and then realized i had guessed wrong i hit a stride of guessing correctly until the end then it happened again i didn't know who was speaking if i had wanted to play guess the narrator i would've... um... ok i don't know how to finish that sentence but it definitely wouldn't be \"read this book\" for that i had to take away a star but and i capitalize that word for a reason if i had let that get to me or put the book down i would have missed out on quite a read this book is very good it's about five friends one of which is a woman who live in little wing wisconsin the plot would be hard to explain you're basically just following their lives these five friends are fiercely loyal to each other one of them gets hurt towards the beginning of the story and the protective and caring way they handle it moved me also i loved how flawed and real they all are they make colossally stupid decisions they give great advice the give horrible advice they keep secrets they know will bite them in the butt there were moments i couldn't stand and raged at some of them and then they would do something that would make me care and root for them again in other words they were like real friends i teared up a few times smiled laughed this was a solid read","909":"maybe it's because i live in a music town or maybe it's because i am in my thirties and can identify so much with the characters but no matter the reason this book really resonated with me comparisons to the big chill may be tossed around too easily but in the case of butler's shotgun lovesongs i think the comparison is apt this novel explores the delicate intricacies of friendship in a small town and tests the bonds once thought to be unbreakable that stretch and sometimes snap among those whose lives are so intertwined a quick yet meaningful read this book will be one that appeals to both men and women strongly recommended http avidbookshop com book 97812500","910":"i thoroughly enjoyed this book set in a small town in wisconsin a story told by five friends who grew up together as they deal with love and friendship and mistakes and forgiveness","911":"eh like the 2 stars i gave it says it was ok nothing great nothing too deep just ok","912":"it was a good story the ending seemed rushed this book reminded me a lot of my older brother and the group of friends he grew up with","913":"i enjoyed this book tremendously i'm usually a mystery thriller type but this simple story of love loyalty and friendship touched me i'm not gonna rehash the plot you can read that anywhere i'll just say this i was surprised and pleased that beth the simple farmers wife became such a central character i thought the book would focus on the friendships between the men who grew up tomorrow and it is mostly that but i loved the author made beth play such a pivotal part in each mans life","914":"i loved this story held me every page a story of friends and a small town in wisconsin well done","915":"this is a book people from the midwest or small towns will really really love it's every side of the story about being from either of those places the good the bad but all true it's about how people in small towns have a loyalty to each other despite all the history and everything they know about each other it runs deep and doesn't leave you no matter where you go i must have cried 5 times reading this because i was like yeah nicholas butler just gets it he really captured what it's like to live in a place like this and love and hate it it's so complex and so hard to understand unless you've been there which i have which is why i loved it but as well as he described it it was so nostalgic in the way it read that i don't know how well people without that background would connect to that but then on the other hand it's more of a love story than anything several love stories all kinds love for a town a lifestyle a past life a wife a long lost love a friend that's the part that no matter where you're from you'll love","916":"not a typical read for me but it was really good","917":"this is one of the better books i've read it flowed nicely and the writing was descriptive which made it an easy read i will definitely read more of his work","918":"shotgun lovesongs by nickolas butler is what might be looked at as a simple story about five friends however with butler's amazingly creative images these characters come to life to tell a tale that will capture the reader's attention and not let go until the end the rural area of wisconsin is the setting that nickolas butler has chosen for shotgun lovesongs and his descriptive talent allows readers to know this land as they read without ever having to have visited there told in alternating chapters by the five characters the story unfolds to give life to hank beth lee kip and ronny hank whose wife is beth has inherited the farm they live on kip's career is quite opposite as he is a successful broker while kip a music artist of international fame ronny is an injured rodeo star whose story i think was my favorite all very different and as we meet and learn more about each of them we come to realize the depth of each personality each character reveals themselves through their part of the story and when butler merges them all together the result is satisfying and rewarding","919":" listened via library if someone ever told me to read a book that nothing really happens there is just good character development i would probably pass luckily no one told me that about this book the thing is this is a story about 4 guy friends who grew up together and where their lives have led them if you listen to this book then each character has its own voice which i love part of me found it so interesting being in the brain of a man kind of and listening to their thoughts on friendship but really i just enjoyed the story would be a good book club book","920":"this novel unfolds like a sweet vidalia onion jumping between a cast of characters and back and forth in time gradually revealing its secrets just as the northerner does politely but slowly it is generous to its characters instead of condemning them to criticism or ridicule as seems to be the fashion among a certain brand of literary fiction some critics have pointed out that this can at times leave the narrative saccharine sweet especially in the voice of lee a poetic singer songwriter loosely inspired by justin vernon of bon iver fame and indeed the novel is as the title implies a love letter or possibly a mix tape to the american north but since so few authors have written about the region with such warmth and familiarity i consider that a positive rather than a negative if as i did you grew up or spent summers in wisconsin minnesota or northern illinois then you will instantly recognize the townspeople of little wing wi the author's keen eye for the details of small town life and the time allowed for each character's individual voice to emerge makes for a complex and entertaining cast of characters so many recent novels feature protagonists that are one dimensionally unlikeable this novel does not make the mistake of painting any one character as a villain but acknowledges the plurality of motivations and misapprehensions that lead to mistakes and conflict the theme of the dehumanizing affect of a society obsessed with celebrity and the importance of letting our heroes be imperfect people is important though not uncharted territory what may be is the warm subtle humor and patience with which butler explores it","921":" set in rural wisconsin shotgun lovesongs tells the story of four men and one woman renegotiating the meaning of friendship love and home five characters share the narrative in alternating chapters hank who inherited his father's farm beth hank's wife lee an international music artist kip a successful broker and ronny an injured rodeo star these people speak and we think that we know them who they are and what they dream of but each are capable of surprising us as the story unfolds i have read few books that feature male friendship and it was something that i really enjoyed about shotgun lovesongs the bonds this group formed in childhood remain intact through a decade of physical separation and sporadic contact but when they reunite in little wing they learn none of them are the boys they once were and their relationships with each other are now complicated by the men they have become the community of little wing in rural wisconsin is vividly portrayed i could easily imagine kip's mill looming over the town the car park full of battered pick ups weathered men leaning on the bar in the vwf hall and tractors traversing the the open farmland while tempers may flare the conflict in shotgun lovesongs is largely personal and the drama is subdued the pace of the story is measured and thoughtful emphasising emotion over action i found the writing and dialogue to be simple and honest yet descriptive and affecting shotgun lovesongs is an understated yet heartfelt novel an ode to friendship to love and to family it is a story about finding your way home where ever that may be i learned after finishing shotgun lovesongs that the novel is loosely based on the life of bon iver a folksy rock singer whom i had never heard of a quick browse on youtube revealed some really beautiful music and lyrics but i'm not a fan of his voice at all i much prefer the covers by adele {i can't make you love me} and birdy {skinny love} for example but play the clip below to sample his music wash by bon iver on youtube","922":"satisfying love story set in beautiful rural america","923":" i have to tell you i absolutely loved and devoured this book the story of a group of friends living in small town america growing developing and holding secrets which ought not be revealed i saw myself and my fiancee in there as well as other friends and people i know or have known and i guess that's the point no matter where you live once you leave the big city it's all small towns where people interact with familiarity on a daily basis and yet can we ever truly know what's going on beneath the surface the descriptive narrative made me want to jump on an aeroplane and land somewhere mid western and never leave mr nikolas bulter please don't ever stop doing this","924":"perhaps it's because i am a bit homesick but this book resonated strongly with me i couldn't put it down it's about home and those friends you've had forever that epitomize home it's another book where each chapter is told from the viewpoint of a different character but i always seem to like those books when done well the ending was disappointing an element of what in the world thrown in for no good reason","925":"this is why i read perfect","926":"i tried very hard to like this book skimmed through the last third there was just too much angst and long forgotten feelings to make it worth my while it mostly reminded me of people who never rally grew up lost in high school or college life and who who never managed to move beyond those times the writer tried very hard but the initials for chapters just pissed me off had to figure out who was talking not my cup of tea at all","927":"beautifully written i liked the varying perspectives of the characters from one chapter to the next but mostly i liked the characters themselves reminded me of my very favorite book ever staggerford","928":"this review has been hidden because it contains spoilers to view it click here i related to the setting of this book - a small town in western wisconsin not dissimilar to many in the area where i grew up i enjoyed the first half of this book both the sense of place and the rich characters so refreshing to read a coming of age story with strong male connections however i could barely stand to finish it the evenly paced development of the first half of the book was lost in a frenzy of one over the top occurrence after another","929":"i listened to an arc on audio i loved it even when the weather was a nippy 20 degrees i stayed in my car after i got home just to hear a few more moments although the story is artfully arranged through several voices each one is distinct and engaging the lives of these characters is interesting but not sensational well written and quite enjoyable","930":"i heard an interview on npr about this book and it sounded like a good book i think the writing is really good and the concept is great i lost it a little on the switching of storytelling between the different characters but the book was believable i'm amazed at how many works of fiction aren't and i think the author is someone to watch in the future there's a little richard russo in this story so that can never be a bad thing","931":" i really loved the four main male characters and how their stories intertwined i expected a bit more to happen plotwise but still enjoyed the excellent character development and picture of life in the midwest the book was described to me as chick lit but with guys in wisconsin and i can see that after reading it the book is more about men's memories and emotions the book follows 4 childhood friends who grew up in little wing wisconsin henry the farmer married to his high school sweetheart beth ronny the fallen rodeo star who is simple minded but honest lee the now famous musician and kip the rich entrepreneur they are all meeting again back in little wing for kip's wedding and the story picks up from there how their friendship has changed and how love can break and bind them together it took me a little while to get into this book and it felt a little slow moving at times but it was different and felt very real and honest","932":"four childhood friends gather in their wisconsin hometown for a wedding one friend is a famous rock star one was a rodeo star who hit hard times one stayed in the town and farmed his family's land and the last is the friend who never quite fit in two friends have a history with beth the farmer's wife fairly predictable characters and storyline not a bad book but nothing great either felt very familiar","933":"i enjoyed this book which is really about small town friendships and how they evolve--or break--over time can easily see this book transformed into a movie it got an extra star because one of the lead characters is a musician","934":" actual rating somewhere after 3 5 but not quite a 4overall a good book one that was pitched to me as the one character is based on the lead guy from bon iver the author and him went to high school together while the heart of that pitch is true lee is undoubtedly more than inspired by justin vernon all the characters seem to be written as exaggerated characters the author possibly knew through real life and this tale is a what if they all grew up together save for the tormented midwest indie rockstar we've all known these characters in one form or another henry and beth the rocks of any group these are the best people you've ever met and would never leave their small town kip the rising the superstar left home to make it in the big city and found success while never forgetting his roots and making sure his roots never forgot about him and his success ronny the tragic friend one of the kindest guys you would never let near your little sister whatever success this guy made was tragically cut short and stunted the rest of his life from ever really starting up again through the span of what feels to be a year and a half or so you see the highs and lows within these 5 lives the weddings the heartbreaks the children careers ramping up while others seem to crash and burn but at the heart of it all are these 4 guys from high school now almost in their 30s trying to see where if at all they still fit into eachothers very different lives this book made me cry several times not that impressive of a feat though major life events aka weddings have me bawling like a baby in real life on a screen or on paper but you definitely felt the heart the pain the struggles these people are going through and these struggles are ones that anyone can relate to once they start figuring out their own life and trying to figure out where exactly they stand in the world a good book that tugged on my heart strings to those that like down to earth heart warmth and are prepared to handle bumps along or possibly ending the way i would recommend picking it up that being said one i will probably won't pick up again","935":"i really enjoyed this book it's about friends in small town wisconsin the characters and the settings rang true to me this book is getting a lot of buzz for good reason i think it will appeal to anyone who enjoys well portrayed characters and a good story and it will especially appeal to anyone who lives in or has lived in a small town","936":"i won this book from a goodreads giveaway i understand that butler is a first time author this was a lovely book in the grand scheme of things it's a simple story in which not much beyond the ordinary happens it's a story about how close childhood friendships weather over time with all the baggage of the past and the disparate life choices that tug away at the friendships however what makes this book lovely is in the telling of the story the several first person narratives convey very real emotions in a simple and straightforward way the characters feel real and fully dimensional and every now and then the writing has a particular flourish of beauty or brilliance a bit of a criticism and without giving anything away the somewhat dramatic incident at the end felt unnecessary and contrived i thought butler could have brought his characters to the same place without this type of incident not a big deal i wish butler success with his book and look forward to reading the next one","937":"enjoyable read an ode to small town midwestern living","938":"i like books that take place in small towns this one takes place in wisconsin it was nice to read a book about the friendship of four men although it definitely wasn't a page turner it made me reflect on how much i treasure my friends and how life is so much better when you have friends you can count on","939":"although very descriptive and poetic the story never really went anywhere it was as flat as the land he described i found myself not really caring what happened to these people and felt no real connection to them","940":"this book is a perfect summer read requires little effort fully of rich imagery and relatable characters it doesn't strive to make a comment on society but simply to entertain","941":"wonderful story great characters don't judge a book by it's cover","942":"what a great book anyone who grew up in or has lived in a small town will recognize people in this book anyone who has friends for life from childhood will recognize themselves in this book anyone who has felt betrayed by a good friend will recognize people in this book plus it's funny the pickled egg story alone near the end is a complete farce a serio comic tragedy in the making","943":"loved the characters and absolutely related to them same age as me similar struggles and experiences same love of the midwest one or two of them i maybe even over identified with loved the multiple narrators too beautiful writing great read","944":"i enjoyed the wisconsin connection of the book but i'm really getting tired of the multi perspective books i think it would have been more effective just focusing on lee and his tribulations","945":" nickolas butler's shotgun lovesongs is a novel about five friends four men and one woman in the small town of little wing wisconsin i have been procrastinating at providing this review as i am not really sure what to say about this novel it is well written and easy to follow i guess it just feels too 'small town' granted there are a lot of readers and fans out there that would consider that a positive but i guess it just isn't really my thing whereas it wasn't really my thing i would recommend this book to those who might enjoy this genre as it is well written and the dialogue is not over the top like many other works in the genre the characters are quite believable this book was won on goodreads com","946":" america i think is about poor people playing music and poor people sharing food and poor people dancing even when everything else in their lives is so desperate and so dismal that it doesn't seem there should be any room for any music any extra food or any extra energy for dancing and people can say that i'm wrong that we're a puritanical people an evangelical people a selfish people but i don't believe that i don't want to believe that it's all been worth it every fight all those years of childish experimentation the occasional heartbreak the paltry checking account the used old trucks to have lived with another human being another person this man as long as i have and to see him change and grow this was an incredible book and i'm so glad that i picked it up the book is essentially a love song to life to friendships to family to love to forgiveness and to small town rural wisconsin hank leland kip and ronny were all born and raised in the small wisconsin town of little wig they have been friends since as long as they remember they each went their separate ways after high school but they soon find themselves all back in town and husbands and fathers and still trying to figure out their place in the world and then there's beth who plays a special part in each one of their lives shotgun lovesongs is a truly remarkable book and a tribute to american live and is filled with rich storytelling and finding hope against all odds this description says it all 'there is conflict here between longtime buddies between husbands and wives -- told with writing that is frankly gut wrenching and even heartbreaking but there is also hope healing and at times even heroism it is strong american stuff not at all afraid of showing that we can be good too -- not just fallible and compromising shotgun lovesongs is a remarkable and uncompromising saga that explores the age old question of whether or not you can ever truly come home again -- and the kind of steely faith and love returning requires 'see my review and others here http onceuponatime bookblog blogspo","947":"3 5 stars good beach read","948":" shotgun lovesongs by nickolas butlerfour friends who grew up in the small town of little wing wisconsin have all left except for henry who married beth had kids and farms just like his dad now they are all back together for kip's wedding kip a commodities broker in chicago ronny an ex rodeo rider and alcoholic with a heart of gold and lee a rock star who longs to return to the simpler life and times this is a great book about four friends that grew up together and have grown apart in a small fictional town in wisconsin the character lee is loosely based on the singer of the band bon iver justin vernon who the author went to high school with in eau claire wisconsin i also like how each character gets to tell their own story in alternating chapters my favorite book of the year so far","949":"if i were forced to count the number of ways in which i loved this book i'd likely land somewhere between 100 000 and infinity this novel ruined me for the next few that followed and the story resonated with me in a way that few stories do","950":"i loved this book and i'm not sure exactly why beautifully written so that is surely part of it","951":"amazing character driven novel about a bunch of friends and how life separates yet intertwines them all great descriptive writing i look forward to reading more from nickolas butler","952":"loved this book it is set in a small town in wi and i'm told it pictured it very well i loved and sometimes disliked all of the characters i e they were real also usually i don't care for the frequent change in time period in this book butler did this as well as telling the story from different characters' perspective beautifully","953":"i wish there were more books like this books about masculine emotion contemporary literature seems kinda yinny this is a book about friendship home love and betrayal and it was great","954":"i got to meet the author at pla this year and found out he'll be at the wisonsin book festival too the book is set in rural wisconsin and follows four buddies from high school through adulthood each are successful in their own way but seem convinced it's the other guys who are doing well loved the wisconsin references and it kind of made me want to find an empty chicken coop somewhere","955":"i really liked this story i think it's because i can relate to most of the small town idiosyncrasies we encounter as readers in the town of red wing wisconsin i liked that this was about the changing and evolving friendship of four men who had grown up together as opposed to women it was an enjoyable read with characters that i could picture in my mind pretty easily for those of you that work at cmjh this will be a part of my new and improved teacher collection i recommend this one","956":" i obtained this book through goodreads first reads this was a very enjoyable book about a small town and a group of friends and how their lives change i liked the closeness of the small town i also liked how each character took a different path in life and there was no judgement that one was bad or wrong some of the characters enjoy staying in the small town others find themselves happier away one of my favorite themes is how each person loves and makes mistakes however all can be forgiven and life goes on it is ok to say sorry fix things the best you can and move on and you don't have to stay mad forever","957":"wouldn't have picked this up but it is a perfect small town fall read really enjoyed it and identified with many of the relationships","958":"really liked the characters in this book the people the fact that it was set in a small midwest town i didn't read reviews until after listening to the audio book so i was unaware of the back story of a real life musician even then i didn't read them much i just plain enjoyed the stories","959":" shotgun lovesongs is the story of friends who grew up together in wisconsin and how their lives changed in the years after graduation one becomes a farmer one finds success in the chicago commodities market one loses his rodeo career after an accident and the fourth becomes a rock star none of them can resist the siren's call of their hometown some reviewers have said that the rock star character in this book lee is based on a singer named bon iver i have no reason to doubt this but i've never heard of bon iver and if i hadn't been told i would have guessed that he was based on sufjan stevens or beck and i do totally get that they are not so much alike lee finds his music in a chicken coop working by himself under the most spartan conditions he sings about his hometown for better for for worse in what butler portrays as a melancholy way for some reason although shotgun lovesongs has all the ingredients that i would normally seek out i didn't cozy up to these characters like i would have expected the story is told through the views of all of the different characters in randomly alternating chapters maybe if it would have been told just by one or two of them i would have gotten more committed to that person as it was i understood all of the characters and i was fond of them all but there was nothing about the story or its telling that really made me feel","960":"this book was a treat to read i enjoyed that the story of these wi friends was told from each point of view i know i really love a book when i read it fast even though i didn't grow up in a small town i could relate to these friendships it sure got me thinking of my friends near and far highly recommend this one","961":"a wonderful debut novel rarely do i read a story involving a group of male friends their friendships rang true and solid i could picture these guys as boys i dated or knew from high school beautifully written with humor and heart a fantastic read","962":" find all of my reviews at http 52bookminimum blogspot com arc received from netgalley thank you netgalley the story of four childhood friends and one wife their marriages and divorces successes and failures as they attempt to navigate their way through their early 30s until the day i started reading shotgun lovesongs i had no idea the story was inspired by the author's friendship with justin vernon of bon iver fame in all honesty the book got bumped ahead of some others on the tbr once i discovered this fact i thought perchance it would remove \"skinny love\" from playing on an endless loop in my brain wellllllll i'm still singing \"skinny love\" - probably even more so now since reading this made bon iver become my pandora flavor of the week what can i say about this book what did it make me feel sometimes it's best to let the book speak for itself \"melancholy is such a dramatic sounding word but sometimes it's the right one when you're feeling both a little happy and a little sad \" this book made me feel melancholy the entire time i was reading it nickolas butler definitely has promise - he put readable words on paper - but something was just a bit off or missing a couple of things that stood out were how many narrators were speaking in such a short novel and the bouncing back and forth between the present and past sometimes had me reading a few paragraphs or pages before i knew if i was in the \"now\" or \"then\" but for a debut butler did just fine i will be interested in seeing what he comes up with next if you're a fan of justin vernon and want to get a sneaky peak into what he might have been like might be when he's not busy being \"bon iver\" this book will probably make you fall in love with him a little or a little more if you've stuck through this review and still have no clue who i'm talking about go download \"skinny love\" and thank me later when it remains on your ipod shuffle list http www youtube com watch v 5l8otw","963":"a good dose of midwestern life's trials and tribulations but really the story could be set anywhere usa this book vibrates with all the usual themes of male friendship loyalty tested failure success but this story is as big as the big sky of montana movie material absolutely","964":"this novel was entertaining and undemanding with some nice descriptions of small town life if you can overlook for example a dairy farmer returning from playing 36 holes of golf with his palms riddled with blisters personally i find life lessons from sentimental guys half my age to be a bit lacking in texture but if you appreciate budweiser christmas ads with an i love you man chaser here's your next beach read","965":"fun touching an all around great read about friendship and life i throughly enjoyed this book","966":"closer to four but not quite i loved the story and characters and i'm generally a sucker for books with multiple narrators but i don't think the voices were distinct enough i often had to double check who was narrating each chapter that aside definitely an enjoyable read managed to make me nostalgic for a life much different from mine","967":"i felt a connection to his world i couldn't put it down","968":"if you grew up in a small town in the midwest you will love this book in a special way you will probably like it even if you didn't because there aren't a lot of good books in my opinion that really delve into the friendships between men in a realistic nonformulaic way you can knock chick lit all you want but i do like how some of the best of the genre explores the relationships between women of a certain age it comes out of the iowa writers workshop and the quality is there but it is not as much of a cliche as some books you will see from iowa or other top mfa programs if i could order up a hundred books like this i would and would probably enjoy them all","969":" bravo to this debut author nickolas butler hit a homerun his first time up to bat shotgun lovesongs is lyrical poetic and tender with feelings straight from the heart an anomaly from most of the male authors i've read in the past that's not to say it's a sissy book raised in the small town of little wing wisconsin the male characters are real men masculine and strong--bull riders and rock stars commodity traders and farmers shotgun lovesongs is not a plot driven novel but a character study of five very real and flawed and not always likeable characters--three guys bound together by their experiences of youth and a girl all of them at least a little bit in love with her leland--the famous rock star in the group he has hit the big time but he hasn't forgotten his roots his beloved friends at home in little wing when his brief marriage to a film star ends suddenly in divorce he returns to his hometown to finish what he started with beth henry--the strong family man the reliable one in the group the farmer content to carry on in his father's footsteps beth is married to henry her lifelong best friend and lover but she can't forget the feelings she once shared for leland ronny--a recovering alcoholic and wash upped rodeo star ronny is charming but childlike with the mentality of someone who has been kicked in the head one too many times by a bull kip is the most misunderstood in the bunch his friends view him as arrogant and callous yet he struggles from a severe lack of self confidence the audiobook is delightful one of the best i've listened too told by alternating narrators from each of the five points of view but i feel i missed an important opportunity by not reading it in print one day i will return to shotgun lovesongs if for no other reason than to study butler's style the amazing creativity he used in crafting a unique voice for each of his five first person points of view i can't say enough good things about shotgun lovesongs i recommend it for both men and women a great choice for book club for more of my reviews visit my website at www chroniclesofavidreader com","970":" this book was acquired from the goodreads giveaway program this book was an exquisite portrayal of the midwest the farms the farmers the mannerisms of people screamed midwest i loved this book so thoroughly that i even read the acknowledgements no one ever reads the acknowledgements this book was told in alternating points of view beth henry kip lee and ronny beth and henry are married lee is a rockstar who loves to come back to his roots beth is the one who got away or is she ronny is a former rodeo man who should not drink ever again i loved how real the people were albeit sometimes they were just a little two dimensional but all in all this was a great book with great people this is a surefire example of write what you know the author is from the midwest so he wrote a love letter to it this book is basically a love letter to the midwest it made me really appreciate where i was from","971":"this book was enjoyable the characters likeable the story believable very much along the lines of fanny flagg will it change your life probably not will you enjoy it yes more than likely","972":"this was a fantastic debut","973":"loved it reading this book was like coming home it refreshed my love for bon iver and small town wisconsin is a lot like small town kansas comforting americana","974":"loved it i was quickly transported home and i could smell the fields","975":"it's refreshing to see a book about the bonds of male friendship really really liked all of the characters and thought they were well developed and real","976":"good start and catching almost till the end then a disappointing ending mah","977":"three and a half stars","978":"best book i have read in a long time great characters","979":"this was a super well produced audio book it got me through lots of sloppy snowy walks to and from campus and i found the lyrical prose rolled off the narrators tongues in a very natural way great sense of place and each character endearing in their own way","980":"this is a debut novel that is centered around a musician leland sutton and his relationship with his three friends who all hail from a small town in wisconsin called little wing leland only feels at home in little wing where he recorded his first album which catapulted him to fame a little background information about nickolas butler the author nickolas himself grew up in wisconsin and attended the same high school as musician justin vernon who is the frontman of the band bon iver and it's justin who is the inspiration for leland's character i had a bad feeling about this bit of information as i am not a fan of bon iver but went against my intuition and read the book anyway turns out i was right there were times that i wanted to give up on this story the characters were flat and very cliche for example henry who is leland's best friend and a farmer a good man and is loyal to his family and his friends he never puts a step wrong never ronny who was a rodeo rider and alcoholic has ended up with brain damage which has given him a more naive innocent outlook of the world and a great sense of humour to boot then there's kip a businessman with a heart of stone and is obsessed with money and greed and is at odds with leland","981":"story of five friends from little wing wi a small town near eau claire my hometown completely fun to read the local details which rang largely true to me though i have been away for many years now had hoped there would be an author reading here in brooklyn and perhaps there will be next time around i look forward to reading more of his books as he writes them","982":"full review to follow outstanding writing and a beautiful story of love friendship heartbreak and home still thinking about this one","983":"engaging and full of heart love his sensory prose","984":"i was enthralled almost from the beginning it was like a chick flick only all but one of the main characters were small town midwestern heterosexual guys it was fun to read the different guys' chapters but then in the end it annoyed me greatly it was just drippy and macho all at once disappointing last couple of chapters i look forward to reading more by the writer in the future though he captures the midwest very well","985":"i loved the title i loved the premise 4 men who were childhood friends telling it all but i just didn't love the book it was like a danielle steele novel for men some of the things in the book just didn't ring true to me no man tells his best friend that he slept with his wife trust me i know this also you can't tell me that everyone embraces this stripper as one of their own i will read this author again he obviously loves the midwest and small towns","986":"this book got me through an overnight stay at the detroit airport and still kept me up reading the next night even after 48 sleepless hours a bookseller described this novel as one you want to give a big hug to i agree","987":" i received this audio book free from goodreads the book is set in a little township in rural wisconsin coming from a small town in north dakota not as small as little wing thank goodness i was able to relate to the friendships one develops in a small community the book relates the friendships between four men and one woman lee who becomes a world famous musician ronnie who becomes a rodeo star kit who moves to chicago and is a star in financial matters henry who inherits his family farm and stays in little wing and beth who loved lee but married henry the story of their friendships is related by each character in first person most of the book revolves around a period of time when all five of them have returned to little wing without giving away the meat of the book the essence is that all of the characters have tried the friendships of each other and in the end the reader sees the successes failures and fears of each character i thought that the author did a good job showing the complexity of friendships by placing the story in a very small town i enjoyed the book i liked the first person approach with each character explaining themselves i thought that the book dragged a bit which explains the 3 star rating","988":"this is a book written in a plain spoken way i listened to this book in audio format and i liked the song like titles at the beginning of every chapter","989":"this was a pretty good story read like a screenplay lots of vivid imagery i liked the characters and the story itself at least until the end the events leading up to the ending didn't fit with the rest of the book and was too long and drawn out then the actual ending was abrupt so close to being a 4 star book but for the ending","990":"good popular fiction an nice beach read with the background of small town wisconsin","991":" this is a superb debut novel from a writer who is very much in the american tradition the new york times described this book as a good old fashioned novel suggesting that it was favourably free of the cynicism that plagues much modern writing there's no doubt that you can see the influence of writers like steinbeck and hemingway in butler's work yes he is that good but there's an honesty about his work that is timeless and deals in simple human emotions in a way that is just good writing rather than any attempt to evoke nostalgia for simpler times shotgun lovesongs is a book about homecomings and friendships about the importance of roots as well as the importance of learning to grow and of understanding yourself the four main protagonists are a group of high school friends who have all chosen very different paths through life some with more success than others as the story progresses told through the eyes of the different cast members we see how their own perceptions of their lives and their strengths and weaknesses often differs from the perceptions of their friends and the people around them this excellent novel is as much about emotions as it is about traditional storytelling and while there is a strong narrative flow the hook that keeps you reading is the desire to find out who these people really are and how they'll resolve their relationships within the group i had the pleasure of interviewing nick butler for an on line book show he's a fascinating character and a wonderful voice in american literature he brings his own small town mid west values into his writing and the result is a very readable but profound look at the people in his spotlight highly recommended","992":"i liked the book i liked reading about childhood lifetime friends i enjoyed reading about settings i was familiar with but the book dragged i kept waiting for something to happen i did enjoy the writing and the words but the story needed a little more action","993":"nikolas butler's impressive literary debut 'shotgun lovesongs ' is a love letter to the american midwest it is nostalgic warm and accurately captures the feeling of wisconsin minnesota the minneapolis star tribune's review of the book says it best we all have them right those songs that indelibly mark the milestones in our lives songs that stir up our deepest feelings and remind us of who we are the anthems of our youth our wedding songs the old classics that are as much a part of our lives as our feet beneath us it's what makes music so powerful the head and the heart and the gut all working in concert only the best most emotionally resonant novels work in the same way nickolas butler's \"shotgun lovesongs\" is one of those novels in prose that is as plain spoken and honest as a midwestern farmer he tells the story of five friends and lovers in the fictional little wing wis 4 5 stars","994":"capable writing squandered on bathetic macho claptrap","995":" from dot i am so glad this book was rescued from the slushpile i read it in one day and when i finished i wanted to have a good cathartic cry not because i was sad but because i was so happy to be part of the characters' lives and to have lived their experiences through the book the story is set in the american midwest in a small town where longtime friends some who have left and returned and some who never left are living the story is told in alternating voices and those voices ring true all the heartbreak workaday events marriages divorce financial hardships and some betrayal feel like they are happening to people you know and care about if you like michael chabon i think you will like this too get your hands on a copy from judy as someone who grew up in a small town i identified immediately with the sense of place and the sense of home that pervaded this book i found the characters engaging and realistic and i cared about what happened to them and how they related to each other","996":"disappointed in this debut novel","997":"a good story about friendship and community","998":"3 5 really i enjoyed it writing was really nice i liked the characters not earth shattering but a nice read","999":"the novel contains all of the elements of a classic country western song heartbreak friendships relationship missteps successes and failures along with some singing drinking and riding in the back of pickup trucks the author weaves the stories of 4 close friends from a town in wisconsin as they pursue different ambitions yet retain a deep connection to each other","1000":" enjoyable first novel from an author raised in eau claire wisconsin nickolas butler went to school with justin vernon from bon iver who is the obvious basis for one of the characters in the novel butler has five main characters who are all childhood high school friends growing up in the fictional small town of little wing different chapters are told by different characters the four male characters have all taken very different life paths but all manage to still keep some connection to their small hometown while some of the events in the lives of the characters seem a bit exaggerated the characters themselves come across as very human and believable the writing is good and the books flows fun read","1001":"what a great novel male and female characters so real and compelling the setting beautifully rendered tension artfully built to the very end the plot would not have made sense with any other group of characters or any other setting but was unique to the world the author created and to me that's what made the novel great getting to see the story through the eyes of so many of the compelling characters made it loads of fun","1002":" hadn't realised when i bought this that it's loosely based on justin vernon and i don't think that affected my enjoyment one way or the other i really liked it it's the story of five friends told in five voices it reminded me a little of stand by me some of the writing was lovely my one complaint was that the voices were a little uneven some were definitely better and more authentic than others that was my reason for giving 4 instead of 5 but overall a very satisfying read about friendship and the conflicts within friendship and between normality and celebrity with one friend calling paparazzi to take pictures of another","1003":"well written and fun to read characters were well developed","1004":"in compliance with ftc guidelines i disclose in this review that i received this book for free through goodreads first reads i quite enjoyed this read the story stories surprised me it was a quick read and provided comfort and shock value if that makes any sense at all if it doesn't well you'll have to read the book i think i'll read this one again ooh a re read in less than a week after reading that should say something the stars are meaningless what am i even comparing to","1005":"set in little wing a small town in wisconsin and featuring five friends who grew up together hank who took over his father's farm and his wife beth lee who is a famous singer but keeps a home in the town ronny a former rodeo who has a brain injury from drinking too much and falling and kip who went away and became a successful broker but has returned to buy and restore a mill property in the town different chapters are told from the point of view of different characters and there are frequent flashbacks to the past to explain things that are going on now the book begins strongly and the first third was well plotted and well paced after that it dragged for me in the middle picking up to an extent by the end i found the characters of hank and beth the most clearly drawn and the easiest to relate to ronny and kip were more shadowy for me and i couldn't get a handle on lee at all obviously people are always a mixture of good and bad but i found lee's love for ronny and despair over the failure of his marriage hard to square with his revelations to hank and the backstory of what he did on hank and beth's wedding day what on earth was he hoping to gain another small niggle i don't believe for one moment that chloe would have stayed in touch with lucy and found her a job and a question did lee know the painting he had bought was one of hank's i think as a hymn of praise to small town america this book works very well indeed and the writing was beautiful also the pickled egg episode was very amusing i'm going to pass this on to a friend who is a green bay packers fan","1006":"i really enjoyed this author's writing style the use of words and descriptions each chapter was written from a different character's perspective which created interest and greater understanding i found the story itself ok and gave the 4 stars more for the writing than the story i live in wisconsin and enjoyed that connection","1007":"good book excellent characterizations gave a good description of a very small town and its residents not a formula read","1008":"4 5 stars i did not expect to enjoy this book so much and i was pleasantly surprised the writing is lovely and the story is very engaging the book follows the lives of 4 men who grew up in rural wisconsin and is told in chapters with each character narrating definitely recommend","1009":"very relatable if you grew up in the midwest","1010":"coning of age story with detailed descriptions of small towns and the friendships they foster","1011":"i enjoyed the first half of the book as the characters were being developed and a little drama was unfolding but then it just kind of fell off this book is lacking some depth and the ending was silly and rushed","1012":"this story really pulls you in and is a totally real and human description of lives intertwined i love the description in this book the author has a unique way of describing how one of the characters 'sees' music i feel very inadequate about my perception of music now and wish i could 'see' music like lee thanks for the suggestion kathy","1013":"enjoyed the people of small town but the author makes it difficult to get into the story i was 1 3 of the way through the book before i could somewhat figure out who was talking and who was who although the story was rich in life's trials and tribulations i did not find closure and fulfillment at the end","1014":"one of my favorite books of all time perfect sunday morning read about life in a small town and the interactions of old friends realized several times throughout the book i had stopped reading a was lost in thought about how it related to my own life listening to bon iver in the background is a must","1015":"snapshot of life in small town wisconsin intertwined lives of childhood friends easy read","1016":"4 5 stars the writing was superb and i loved the story detailing the lives of a bunch of 30 somethings that have been friends since high school i think this story would make a great movie too","1017":"a quick and easy read but a bit too sentimental for me kip was definitely the most relatable character but even his storyline was a bit too schmaltzy for me i recommend this as a beach read","1018":"in some ways i enjoyed this book with its bursts of beautiful writing and imagery but in many ways i was bored same old story of rural friendships and the one girl recycled character stereotypes predictable plot i wanted more","1019":" on average i liked this book but my feelings were up and down i loved the first third or so which mainly dealt with the small town lives of a group of friends who grew up together in little wing wisconsin i faltered a bit in the second third and was fairly baffled by the last portion which dealt with a big secret that threatens to tear apart a marriage as well as two best friends i just didn't get why the big secret though hurtful was enough to cause one of the characters to question his marriage and his life maybe it's a guy thing but i just would never react that way to it the audiobook was narrated by different actors for each of the characters that took a turn telling the story a nice feature that i think made the author's fairly uniform writing style seem more differentiated for each character","1020":" i am a midwestern girl have spent time in rural indiana and taught in rural iowa i recognized the characters of this book these tight friends whose relationships sometimes go into auto pilot these young men who can't wait to escape the farm or their tiny town of little wing wi the young men who stay and watch their buddies return for a short time or forever women who love these men must be strong butler has created a story of place and the place is so vivid little wing is a dying town it's too hard to farm as an independent the characters who all speak in their own voices understand the beauty and the harshness of this land the change of seasons the sky even if i thought a farmer and a rodeo rider might not take the time to really observe the beauty of the place i loved all the descriptions i could conjure up little wing in their love four young men four weddings four marriages some successful and some not hank stayed on the land and is now tied forever with his wife beth and their little ones ronnie was the first to leave to go on the rodeo circuit and has the scars to prove it but his brain injury happened right at home and his buddies have become his watchdogs kipp eager to prove himself to prove he can be the town's savior to prove he can single handedly drag little wing into this century then there's leeland a rock star who is drawn toward home whenever the rest of the world comes too close beth holds the four men together more than they know more than hank knows butler was trained at the iowa writers' workshop i have a young friend who also participated in the workshop i can hear the poetry of the place in this book i listened to the audible with five narrators each characterizing these folks in his and her own way through their words and voices i came to really care for these people and for this place this place that has survived and will probably continue to survive because there are people who love it i was taken back to my iowa students farmers' sons and daughters whose views of life were so different from my own whose observations were keener clearer they didn't agonize over the future they knew they were connected to the earth and to the place they were confident in their ability to make a living and a life i recognized these young men and women from my classes this book was a warm welcome home for me","1021":" i read this book in three days so it is safe to say that it is both an easy read and a very engaging book the book follows four male friends in small town little wing wisconsin the characters are all great and you want to know what happens to all of them i expected the book to take certain turns and then it would surprise me in a good way i would not be surprised if this book is eventually made into a movie so many parts of the book made me think 'that sounds just like a scene in a movie '","1022":"both my husband and i thought it was an enjoyable story about small town living long standing friendships and how we all go in different directions in life good development of the characters and the writer gives you a good insight into each of the major characters a quick read","1023":"it could've been better had it just been third person all the way through but it was first person narrative with each of the main characters having several point of view chapters there wasn't enough of a different voice to the characters they all had the same thoughts and feelings and i had to keep going back to the first page of each chapter with the character's initial as the heading to remember who was narrating","1024":" i recieved this book from the goodreads first reads program i enjoyed the book and really felt like i got to know the characters i truly enjoyed the book and the story it told however the swearing was completely unnecessary and randomly started part way through the book not to mention there was really only one word used so it seemed even more out of place also it was difficult to follow the changing narrators until i got to know the cast of characters a little better overall this book was a great read and i will recommend it to friends","1025":"this was a marvelously written book every time i put it down i felt like i had just tasted a decadent chocolate the writing was lyrical and the author totally nailed the description of the midwest this will be one that i recommend to anyone who is looking for a well written book","1026":"good fast read liked the characters looking forward to nickolas butler's book of short stories","1027":"the writing was great and the characters were unique and very well developed throughout the novel readers truly become invested in their lives and futures the only let down was the ending while it was conclusive and left me as a reader with everything i needed to know the pacing felt off the end read slightly rushed and sidetracked other than this the novel was a very enjoyable read","1028":"not what i expected by the title but an easy read great story about the love among small town friends","1029":"really great characters and sense of place fun sad altogether human story really top notch writing","1030":"it's a great novel of intertwined stories and varied perspectives made me miss my hometown a little","1031":"loved this book four friends in their thirties high school friends and their current relationships with each other beautifully written with some lovely descriptive sections but not too many i particularly liked page 151 and 152 description of the seasons","1032":"another 'big chill' type of book and i liked it","1033":"i can understand why people would enjoy nickolas butler's shotgun lovesongs a slow paced homage to friendship and the rural american way of life it felt nostalgic and butler's prose is beautiful and descriptive his characters warm and inviting it is a book however that will not speak to everyone's tastes which is no judgement of butler's clear talent but simply a fact of individual reading tastes set in a rural wisconsin farming town shotgun lovesongs elicits a sense of home the pace is slow teasing a novel from everyday experiences and not much action butler's language is familiar and comfortable like talking to an old friend you've not seen in a while his characters kip ronny henry lee and beth are well realised with their own motivations but for me i simply didn't feel invested each chapter is narrated by a different character who's stories intertwine but although butler's writing style is fluid and easy to read he lacks a clear voice for each of his characters without the convenient initial at the top of each chapter i would have struggled to know who was speaking we meet these characters in a series of small moments around the time of various weddings shotgun lovesongs is a very relationship oriented book both friendships and love interests because of this while i felt i knew the characters my views did not feel well rounded all the characters reactions to certain things are seen only within the snapshot of their immediate relationship dramas if we had got to know the characters within their everyday moments i would have felt a greater sense of them as it was some of the reactions seemed slightly more implausible than i would otherwise have felt them to be and it made the plot slightly too predictable where this novel really fell short for me was the very end it escalated far too quickly and made me think that butler had simply struggled to find a suitable resolution to what was otherwise a slow paced story the slow pace is what had made shotgun lovesongs so good to begin with and the unnecessary action of the last few pages felt forced and unnatural the love and heart he poured in to the rural wisconsin setting almost felt betrayed by this slightly ridiculous ending despite its flaws shotgun lovesongs is a beautifully written book with heart despite its essentially mundane subject matter it was well realised and was never boring however i must admit that it simply wasn't to my taste despite butler's clear talent and obvious love for his subject matter the whole reading experience felt nice but somehow not that special http iblamewizards com review shotg","1034":"i enjoyed this book about small towns and old friends i read it in a day over the weekend but just loved the different friendships that made up the gang and how their relationships became something different but still important in their grown up lives sad and happy nice reflection on a group of friends circle","1035":"this is a beautifully written book although a bit uneven at times i have read very few books about men's friendships this centers around 4 men and one woman who grew up together in a small midwestern town one of the men is a famous singer song writer one a successful businessman the third a brain damaged rodeo star and the last a man who has stayed on the farm and has married the girl they all grew up with their lifelong bonds are strong yet they have all changed as they became adults","1036":"follows the lives and relationships between four lifelong friends in a small town very good library book club selection","1037":"this enjoyable polished novel tells the story of a group of friends growing from adolescence to adulthood in a small wisconsin town although there is a female character the book centers around the friendships and exploits of a small group of men i like regional fiction will weaver donald ray pollock steve weddle set in small towns and this is a worthy addition to that genre","1038":"actual rating 3 5 stars","1039":" as a reader i'm drawn to books written in butler's style plain spoken language characters who aren't overly complicated yet still complex enough to be believable and a setting so true it becomes an integral element to the plot in the hands of a writer like butler an author who's clearly put the time and effort into making the story one with great flow these elements have aligned in such a way to elevate shotgun lovesongs to the five stars favorites shelf-- at least for me anyway on my end i suppose butler gets extra bonus points because he is a midwesterner too someone who also takes pride in that fact i might add and because a few years into my 30s myself i felt a kinship with these characters in a way i probably wouldn't have at 23 or even 25 and i'll admit it probably also stoked my love a bit at the very least it first piqued my interest this whole justin vernon bon iver angle of the book that now everyone can't stop talking about but for all these reasons and more i'm confident shotgun will wind up my favorite read of 2014 a book that as a writer i expect to keep thinking about for much of the rest of the year too for the sake of record keeping in 2013 that title for me went to meg wolitzer's the interestings 2012 i didn't exactly have one fault in our stars perhaps and 2011 was chad harbach's art of fielding there's plenty that's been written already about the plot of this book--five 30 somethings in a small town in wisconsin all trying to find their way in life while figuring out the challenges that accompany it loyalties friendships relationships finances a sense of belonging the most notable of the group is lee who's struck it big as an indie musician here's where that justin vernon comparison comes in butler being from the same town as the bon iver frontman but the characters who ground the entire book and the ones whose chapters i eagerly awaited most were henry and beth the married couple of the book good 'ol salt of the earth people tied to their family farm struggling to stay afloat but content in so many ways i saw in them traits of many of the people i grew up with in my small hometown in indiana you know a book is good when you don't want to quit its characters when they stay with you even off the page and it seems like once or twice a year i experience that with a title i certainly did with shotgun and while occasionally i found butler to want to overwrite a scene the instances were seldom enough and stopped just short of trying too hard for it to really bother me especially when there were so many other wonderful lines to treasure here are a few still on my mind a few weeks after reading * maybe it's a good thing from time to time to spy on other people's lives for me anyway it has the effect of making my own life feel like a well loved thing * i loved this scene of henry and beth in a taxi as throw away as it may seem chiefly because i'm always a little in awe of an author who captures a moment in words something i've experienced before that no one else has ever attempted to put down on the page he looked down at me his chin compressing itself the type of angle you only see on the face of a person you love--his nose hairs the crow's feet about his eyes his hairline gently receding i pulled his face down to me and we kissed * it's a funny thing being married to someone for so long being someone's best friend for so long because on those few occasions when they surprise you it feels like the biggest thing in the world like a crack in the sky like the moon suddenly rising over the horizon twenty times bigger than the last time you looked such a beautiful line and so poignantly true * america i think is about poor people playing music and poor people sharing food and poor people dancing even when everything else in their lives is desperate and so dismal that it doesn't seem that there should be any room for any music any extra food or any extra energy for dancing related with the book being so new after finishing i hopped online to read a few reviews and was lucky enough to catch butler in a live qu0026amp a when i asked about the status of the book being turned into a film fox searchlight is working on the script i brought up actors for characters and suggested that ryan gosling would make one hell of an awesome lee he agreed but mentioned that the hollywood types thought justin timberlake i knew i already liked the guy but when he wrote this made me cringe a little in my soul i laughed out loud yes god please don't let jt the serious actor get his hands on that role where do i start the campaign for the gos as for the others i'm still playing casting director in my mind","1040":"i loved this story i loved the characters i loved the portrayal of small town midwestern life","1041":" a good solid book that highlighted the adult lives of a group of small town wisconsin friends and how each and every one of them had a different life the most famous of their friends was lee a world famous rockstar the book starts with their friend kip's wedding and lee coming back to town with his movie star girlfriend the book highlights lee's friendship with others in the town in a ranging difference of first person narrative from lee to all of his former friends the narrative model worked to allow the reader to see what was in the mind of each character and kept the book moving in an interesting pace the true star of the book in the love one can find in marriage and friendship and how each person in the novel has a different view of it and how it impacts their future in little wing","1042":"very nice story about friendship","1043":"i'm not sure what i thought about this book i generally liked it although a bit amateur feeling like someone may have written this in high school creative writing i think it was endearing maybe because i grew up in a great little town i appreciated the friendships and dynamics between the men it was a quick easy read of colliding interests and the pull of roots","1044":"best book i've read in a year love each and every character the writing will bring you to tears couldn't put this one down","1045":" i received a complimentary copy of shotgun lovesongs a novel by nickolas butler in audio format from st martin's press as part of goodreads first reads program it is written in first person read by ari fliakos maggie hoffman scott shepherd scott sowers and gary wilmes whose voices resonate with hometown simplicity and the intertwined lives of the characters they represent leland the principal character around which the thread of the story is based is a singer his career has rocketed to stardom leaving all of his small town friends like the dust left behind a beat up pickup on a dirt road leland has returned to his roots after a devastating loss as each of the friends tell their story of life with lee as he is known we see a deluge of emotion culminating in final clarity of truth about fame fortune and what it means to be truly content and happy with one's circumstances i have read that this story mirrors the life of a well known performer but i wanted to approach the story without that affecting my judgement if indeed this is true i must comment on the format i don't know that i would have fully embraced the characters had it not been for the accomplished readers of the characters it made me feel like i'd kicked off my own cowboy boots and curled up on a legless couch to hear a story of people i knew as my own friends i found myself longing for the simplicity of a farm porch and a dog the sound of horses or cows in the fields as i remember them lowing or whinnying their voices in the dusk of a fall evening i found myself anxious with the tale of the blizzard remembering whiteouts and winter storm skies i also found myself wondering about whether or not i could have remained in my own small hometown where everyone knows your name and your business this book in any format will be i hope a best seller as readers need the comfort of an old fashioned story told with sincerity and heart no matter who they are or where they live i recommend this book to any displaced city dweller music lover or rodeo fan no spoilers at the risk of sounding cheeky i'll say this book is a little bit country and a little bit rock and roll","1046":"this was a good story about love and friendship and small towns it didn't have me hooked the whole way i most enjoyed when the story was from beth's perspective but it is a nice look into the relationships that take place within a small town","1047":"i began thinking that this was a light chick lit kind of soap opera book but in the last third i really cared about 2 characters who faced medical issues and felt that this was a warm and sweet novel","1048":" frankly i wanted to love this book because i thought it would mean i was cool in that indie rock alternative way i've lived in the south my entire life so like to spend time in other regions travel by page with different people fictional or not i enjoyed the beginning of the story introductions i'd guess you could say i won't get into what they do or ways they change since that's the whole point of reading the book but will say they didn't live up to my first impression i got tired of reading about them and the many words describing their seemingly every move guess i'm not that cool","1049":"after reading a few negative reviews of this book on goodreads i was expecting to be disappointed by one dimensional characters and or a flat storyline but i honestly loved this book yes it had a somewhat neat ending but i thought the story was beautifully almost romantically written butler clearly loves his home state of wisconsin the characters had depth and layers they were complex flawed but relatable it took me longer to get a solid feel for lee the character allegedly based on bon hiver's lead singer songwriter but in the end i thought butler did a good job of developing that character along with the others overall this was a wonderful read and i would recommend it a thousand times over","1050":"a rock star a farmer a bond trader and an ex rodeo star in little wing wisconsin it's a quiet book but the characters are real and deep","1051":" deceptively simple novel but a fun read i'd have given it more stars but think the last few chapters were weak and caused the book to end in a disappointing manner the characters are the strength of the novel and the ability of the author to draw them as individuals wrestling with their pasts and the bumps in their personal dreams make for an authentic story that's entertaining and hard to put down more and more i wish that there might be a bit more aggressive editing of new novels at least i imagine having a conversation with this author who does a fine job throughout the novel but throws in an implausible twist to finish it all off this book could have benefitted from some tough love editing but it will still be popular it's contemporary relatable and undemanding in essence what we demand of a bestseller","1052":"four archetypal male characters the hometown hero the silent strong type the moneymaker and the screw up deal with each other and how to be friends as adults good story maybe more resonant to me if i knew the midwest better","1053":" i've always been kind of a sucker for the music of a country song gone wrong even if i can't stand country music itself but i genuinely prefer stories of everyday people leading everyday lives fiction has gone deranged for stories of the beautiful perfect and monied and not in a fabulous f scott fitzgerald way either so it always feels like a homecoming to me to find a story about more or less average people and this one it has its country music elements love gone wrong bad choices cutting a swath through a community the all too human mistakes that those beautiful perfect and monied would never make but it also has a great deal of poetry some lovely and unexpected passages about a coyote the weight of rose petals in the palm the fierceness of love between friends thoroughly worth a read or a listen i listened to the audiobook and it was very well performed","1054":"i can't stop thinking about this book i loved everything about it the lush wisconsin landscapes the believable honest characters and the reminder that regret can be part of our story","1055":"this review has been hidden because it contains

in wisconsin the narrator's voice alternating between 5 different friends i found the form of the story the writing style and the way it was told more compelling than the main characters lee and henry ronny was my favorite character and i wish he had been the narrator for another chapter as his world view was simple and the least clouded the protagonist henry was totally tiresome with his wounded feelings about an earlier relationship between his wife and his best friend swelling to take over the second half of the book imagine how insufferable he would have been in a case of actual infidelity while henry is portrayed as a traditional person with some insecurities about his conventional life choices his whining to beth and lee made me less sympathetic to him and his position as the story progressed this trend culminates in the ridiculous scene at the end where lee has been shot by someone else and he is still apologizing with limited success to henry who is helping treat his wound although it strains credulity in places this was still a good quick read and thoroughly enjoyable i was raised in and have lived in big cities so it was interesting for me to get this insight into smalltown life i see potential for a screenplay here and given it is bestseller maybe there will be a movie more","1056":" carrie says do you still have friends that have been friends since childhood shotgun lovesongs is about four friends who grew up together in a small wisconsin town henry stayed to work on his family's farm kip became a commodities trader lee traveled the world as a musician and ronny was a champion bull rider no matter how far they strayed they can't stay away from home or each other as they get older they're learning how to navigate adult friendship i couldn't put this book down it reminded me of the friendships i've had and the struggles that friends sometimes go through butler brings each of his characters to life i will be thinking about them for a long time to come if you like this book try the interestings by meg wolitzer","1057":"i think i would have loved this as a brat pack movie but as a book meh","1058":"a beautifully written book about love trust and a very small town satisfying and sweet","1059":"i loved how the guy author was able portray his guy characters in all their small farming town mentality he even did a great job writing from a female perspective this book has some pretty strong language at times","1060":" i lived for two happy years right where this book is set in a small town outside of eau claire wisconsin so part of my really liked it has to be influenced by nostalgia this is fine writing well crafted literary fiction with plenty of sensory detail grounded in the reality of the region 1980's through present well developed believably true to life characters and a realistic story with just enough drama to make it feel like a story a work of the imagination rather than a thinly disguised memoir i skimmed the parts that could be considered r or x rated depending on how graphic an imagination you have the writing was never lewd or gratuitous but sometimes a bit too real for my victorian sensibilities a story of friendship love failure and forgiveness i found it quite stunning but then i love small town wisconsinliterary fiction even with sometimes overly lon bordering on boring descriptions of what things look like smell like feel like stories that lift up faithfulness and forgiveness as good ideasmy main quibble besides the too explicit sex and profanity it took me a while to figure out that there are multiple narrators all narrating in first person each chapter starts with a monogram a single initial h or b for example and the reader is supposed to figure out that h stands for henry and b for beth i thought that was too precious and somewhat annoying","1061":" butler is a very talented and deft writer but this novel about a group of friends born and raised in little wing wisconsin is much too precious it's told in a variety of voices including hank who became a farmer and stayed in the small town to raise a family with his wife beth along with lee the indie rocker who made it big but regularly comes back to little wing kip who traded commodities in chicago but has moved back and ronnie a little \"slow \" damaged by rodeo riding their voices and their memories create a rich overlapping narrative that is at bottom a love letter to the american midwest and its small mostly forgotten towns the characters are in that restless period of their early 30s hank and beth have a family but both long for something different including more money lee gets married and divorced and wrestles with fame the title of the book refers to a bestselling album of his kip is trying to write the next chapter of his life the author romanticizes the landscape and the notions of \"authenticity\" and community-as if such ideals were limited to small town agrarian dreams more seriously his characters sound much too similar-all of them too lyrical and too insightful by half all seemingly mouthpieces for the author butler's prose is often beautiful and the narrative churns along well but there's nothing convincing about the author's convictions march 2014","1062":"i thoroughly enjoyed this tale of life long friends who have reached their 30s and are realizing grown up life is different reading this book felt a little like sitting by a lake listening to a comfortable band playing an intimate concert","1063":"you know i actually enjoyed this more than i thought i would all the recent reviews were pretty negative but i really like small town life and i have a soft spot for the midwest the only reason i'm only giving this a 3 is because some of the characters didn't pull me in they were kinda meh when i was supposed to really care about them","1064":"this book really resonated with me partially because of my love of music and partially because of the setting a great story about friendship through trials and through the years i hope to read more of nickolas butler's work soon","1065":"i am always drawn to books about small towns and this was no exception simple language small town men and women growing up together now in their thirties and trying to move their friendships into adulthood it all takes place in a fabricated town in beautiful wisconsin","1066":"this book spoke to me don't know why","1067":"excellent story of four boys who grow into adult men and the bonds that bind them","1068":"a cute book about a group of close friends in a small town in wisconsin it's told from multiple perspectives and i found myself really liking each one a pretty easy quick read","1069":" shotgun lovesongs is the story of five thirty something year olds who grew up together in little wing wi a small rural town close to minneapolis harry chose to stay in little wing take over the family farm and married his high school sweetheart beth ronny was the first celebrity of the group pursing a bull riding career before suffering from brain damage after a drunken accident lee has hit the big times as a famous musicians traveling the world on tour kip who never quite fit in easily with the town our group moved to chicago where he was a successful broker there really is no plot this is simply a story about life and a group of life long friends told from the five different perspectives the characters and relationships are authentic they are all flawed yet through each story are capable of self reflection recognizing their jealousies and insecurities it was also refreshing to see a story about male friendships i would be interested to know how someone not from a small reacts to this book i grew up in houston and moved to the small town where my mom's family is from when i entered high school there were thirty people in my graduation class i was there enough growing up that once i entered high school i already knew everyone i recognized so many things about myself and people i love in the characters there is truly something special about the people and relationships that form in a small town that is often over looked i certainly connected with lee's need to return home every once in awhile \"this is my home this is the place that first believed in me that still believes in me \" i too need to return home now and then and sit around a bonfire i definitely recommend shotgun lovesongs","1070":"a nice story about childhood friendship and how it evolves as they become adults leave get married come home etc takes place in a small rural farm town but could be a group of lifetime friends anywhere i really enjoyed it a relaxing easy going read","1071":" i am a sucker for small town stories as i grew up in one this book has the authentic small town feeling with the predictable small town people there are always those who stay those who go away those who make it and those who don't that's the way it is i guess what makes this different is that the character lee is based on a real life friendship the author has with bon iver i don't know the group so that made little difference to me this little town is in wisconsin and is told from the viewpoint of five people the married couple henry and beth who stayed the rodeo star ronny who is injured and returns home kip who makes a nice living in chicago and comes home to rejuvenate his hometown and lee the major rock star who can't cut his roots the idea that no matter where you are in life you are still most comfortable with the people you grew up with is an idea that i agree with at age 61 when i am with my childhood friends it is as if no time has passed after all they know all about you they know your families and your secrets this book would have been better if they had explored that relationship more the best part of the book was when lee spent the night at ronny's before henry and beth's wedding the interaction with ronny's father was so perfect and so telling there just wasn't enough of those moments i think it revolved too much around the hero worship of lee yes it's wonderful that he's famous and comes home again if lee is based on bon iver then i suppose henry is based on the author that may be why henry came out too perfect and one dimensional he didn't ring true the ending was absurd it really spoiled the book for me the incident was unlikely and the bro romance was over the top while the writing was good the ending dropped my rating to three stars it could have been so much better","1072":"growing up in the tiny rural town of little wing wisconsin four boys forged a friendship that they hoped would last a lifetime now in their 30's their friendships mostly still intact some have left little wing and some have stayed but all feel the pull of their hometown roots henry took over his father's dairy farm and still lives in little wing with his wife beth and their two children money is tight but they are a happy family ronnie an ex rodeo star returned to little wing after a severe accident left him unable to compete and although a bit slower in mind and body still has a heart of gold and a sincere desire to please everyone kip a commodities trader has moved to chicago where he found the wealth he always coveted the beautiful wife the fancy apartment always feeling a bit of an outsider in the group of four friends he returns to little wing to restore the abandoned mill building and show little wing what an important man he has become the fact that his wealth is quickly dwindling and his marriage is falling apart drives him even harder to present a successful facade lee a grammy winning musician returns to little wing between world wide concert tours and reconnects with his childhood pals but his lonliness and secret longing for henry's beautiful wife beth threatens to end the friendship the story is told in alternating chapters by the four men and beth encompassing the past and present relationships this book started out rather slowly for me but once i got a good feel for the characters i ended up enjoying it very much who wouldn't like henry the steadfast husband father farmer sweet ronnie pulls at the heartstrings lee is the kind of guy you want to fix maybe find him a nice girl so he can settle down and live in the present instead of the past kip is the one who confused me the most and the one i felt the most compassion for he's the kid who never felt good enough or popular enough or handsome enough to be happy within himself the one who always tried too hard all in all this was a good read full of interesting characters","1073":"very good i listened to it and i liked most of the voices the descriptions were beautiful easy to picture and smooth the story was fun living in wisconsin it was fun to hear familiar places and sayings the story is about friendship and a connection so deep that nothing can stand in it's way","1074":"if you grew up in wisconsin north of madison milwaukee preferably there is no better novel for you to read this summer butler's unforced love for his home state results in a natural well paced character driven gem of a book i can't recommend it more highly","1075":"so far i'm not too crazy about this heard an interview with the author on npr and was very interested the author grew up with the lead singer of bon iver i really like that band but the evocative moody feeling of their music hasn't shown up in this novel yet stupid of me to think there would be similarities i know we'll see how it goes","1076":"i checked out this audiobook from the library on a whim and am so happy i did the descriptions of rural wisconsin were lovely and the story really drew me in","1077":"fabulous writing great story of a group of guys who grow up together in rural wisconsin and how things change or don't as they get older in my top 10 for the year maybe top 5","1078":"sweet the wonderful stories of 5 good friends whose lives are intertwined in a small wisconsin town very well paced","1079":"would have rated 3 5 in goodreads allowed a story mainly about friends from a rural town some left the town and made it big while others never left enjoyed it","1080":"cliched disappointing earnest","1081":"i enjoyed reading shotgun lovesongs it's about four boyhood friends who grew up in a small town in wisconsin one of them never left and the other three felt the need to spread their wings then there is beth the woman who has meant something special in each of their lives each one learns the true meaning of friendship and love","1082":"just could not get hooked into caring about these one dimensional characters one character is supposed to be a fictionalized justin vernon of bon iver and once that was in my head i couldn't stop humming his beth rest song while reading which was the only upside","1083":"i won this book as a firstread shotgun love songs tells the story of childhood friends henry lee ronny and kip now in their thirties and working to keep up their friendship amidst the turns their lives have taken in adulthood anyone who grew up in a small town will be able to relate to their experiences the main characters are real and well fleshed out with positive characteristics and flaws i enjoyed reading this book","1084":"3 5 stars being from a small town i related to this book quite a bit nothing earth shattering as far as the plot goes but it was well written and the author does a great job with the setting especially","1085":" nickolas butler takes us to a small town in

which he deeply loves lee found success and is a rockstar but he still loves to come back to this small town and see his friends kip is also successfull a buisinessman but somehow he still wants to impress people back at home and so he buys the old mill puts a lot of money in it and make it a big deal but it puts him deep into depths his marriage is also failing his wife wants children but he doesnt because he doesnt think he would be a good father he considered himself not a nice man and ronny is the wamhearted guy he got a career as a rodeo cowboy but he became addicete to alcohol and after a bleeding in his head he became a little slow but everybody cares about him i am german and this book is very american to me i would immediately move to this lovely littel town in wisconin and live with all this nice people have those kind of friends its all to goog to be true but i liked it this book took me far away in an ideal world with nice people who care for each other even when you make big mistakes you can depend on someone on their forgiveness this book flows like warm honey its sweet and nice and you get to know this people quite well i loved reading it even if there is no place like littel wing as far as i know but i liked the story and i enjoyes it very much thank you for taking me to this place for a couple of hours mr butler","1086":"small town in wisconsin four friends whose lives have changed greatly meet for a wedding","1087":" i'm from a small town myself and was easily swept along into the story i enjoyed the detail of the community the richness in the description of the landscape and i cared about the characters that's what counts most to me don't have to like them but i just have to get them and i got all of these characters its not a tear jerking who dunnit breathless pacer but it isn't supposed to be its a story of friendship among men in a small rural community and i loved it do yourself a favor and read it","1088":" this is one of those novels where you need to be in the right mindset the right mood this was a light read and something i wasn't into very much i think it would have had more of an impact if i was prepared to be an observer reading about a group of close knit friends from a small wisconsin farm town and the bonds of friendship marriage and finding your own self what it takes to make oneself content and happy i found myself skimming over a bit throughout but it was sweet not bad at all","1089":"outstanding and i'm not just saying that because the author is married to one of my cousins it is one of a handful of books that i want to read again and maybe again","1090":"life in a small wisconsin townthis novel explores the personal relationships among a group of friends from a small town in wisconsin including one guy who suffers brain damage in a rodeo accident and another who experiences success as an indie musician but can't adjust to the phoniness of the big city music industry butler tells the story by switching narrators among the principal characters his writing style is engaging and the book has a bit of a big chill feel to it without the dead body i liked it","1091":"i'm not sure if this would be considered dude lit or bro lit but it was a great little story about a group of male friends and one wife from a small town in wisconsin growing up growing apart finding themselves escaping each chapter is told through the pov of one of the main characters and while the voices could be a little similar in style they were different enough that each character feels complete there are some amazing lyrical passages in the book i don't remember the last time i highlighted so many passages just because of the beauty they managed to capture the story maybe jumped the shark with the last two chapters but i easily forgave that because of the beauty of the rest of the book","1092":"thoroughly enjoyed this book it is nice to read a character driven book that could qualify as chick lit written by a man it gives the book a totally different feel and enjoy when the characters are mostly male while the writing was not especially deep it was interesting and i was anxious to finish the book to see how it ended would recommend this book","1093":"great piece of fiction about a group of men and their evolving relationships as they grow older even more interesting is a woman at the center of this with a voice but that has only a small say in the developing relationships and a huge voice in the past this seems to be a yal but would appeal to those young men with some connection to their feelings they also need to understand regret whether they have regrets or not doesn't matter just understand that regret exists and many people let it eat at them or tear them up while others forcefully have no regrets learning from our mistakes is important but what about our regrets these 4 guys do a great job of maintaining a lasting relationship all of them successful in different ways fame financially idolized and in love but the question is what does each one want and how do they live with one another as they attain a success the others want it made me think and i have not seen many books that deal with male relationships in a real and positive manner it is not a guide for male relationships but it lets males know that others are feeling and dealing in similar ways yes i liked it good job mr butler","1094":"wonderful debut novel about living in rural wisconsin and being true to your friends i liked the characters down to earth and caring people","1095":"wonderful story about life in a small town in the midwest the friendships that have evolved through from grade school to adults the importance of family and love are all beautifully depicted","1096":"i loved this book i finished it in about two sittings i rarely make strong connections with male driven fiction but butler does a wonderful job of creating characters that you care about wonderful book","1097":"i want to thank nicholas butler author and goodreads first reads giveaway for my copy of shotgun lovesongs that i won in the giveaway shotgun lovesongs is set in little wing wisconsin and is about four men that grew up together in this small town each has his successes and failures along with the ups and downs of their relationships but they are still a group of supporting friends for a lifetime they emotions and solutions to problems becoming adults and successful or not so successful and all the pressure of becoming fathers and life are addressed but still henry lee ronny and kit find a way to relate to one another in the small town environment that gave them bonds of friendship for life midwest small towns offer a unique environment where people find time to look out for one another and keep home with them even when they travel the world shotgun lovesongs is a moving novel about human relationships","1098":"absolutely hands down my favorite book so far for 2014 not a romance not a thriller just one of the most beautifully written spoken on audible book i have listened to in some time","1099":"i received this book as part of a goodreads giveaway this is my unbiased review this is not quite a 5 star review i don't give many of those but it is close butler's debut novel is a beautiful moving and often insightful story of a group of friends making the transition from youth to full adulthood all in their early thirties some seem younger and others older they are trying to recapture their earlier close friendships or sometimes just move on from them these lives are deeply intertwined perhaps the way only small town lives can be and like all intimates they hold the power to give each other great joy or tremendous pain and they do told in the first person though from the point of view of multiple characters shotgun lovesongs also the title of the first album of the central character an indie rocker named leland takes a little while to get into though the journey is made easer by butler's lyrical writing and deft characterization give it the time it needs to get its hooks into you because once it does they will go in deep these are authentic people from rural america their issues are very basic friendship family survival but deeply important in the end butler manages to say important things about all of those issues about growing up and what that means and maybe about america itself ordinary life made extraordinary","1100":"bravo mr butler bravo you wrote a book that is universally appealing to both men and women with confidence i can recommend this book to anyone who loves to read anyone brilliant little wing wisconsin wasn't known for much they had the mill there but it shut down mostly little wing was known for farming that is until two of their very own became celebrities before his accident ronny taylor got his share of tv time being a champion on the rodeo circuit and then there's leland lee sutton he became a rock star a really big rock star even though lee traveled the world playing his music he always kept little wing as his home base his friends were there there's ronny who after his accident is maybe a little slower than before but he's still the same ronny henry hank brown is married to beth and they own and operate the family farm kip cunningham spread his wings and did the big city thing as a financier but he's back in little wing now with dreams of reopening the mill the friends now in their late twenties early thirties are all back together and sometimes coming home is the hardest thing to do shotgun lovesongs also the title of character lee sutton's first album is told from the viewpoints of lee ronny henry kip and beth with each character telling their version of this story of friendship growing apart and finally growing up and living life i love that the author taps into what must be his own experiences with his own set of peers he nails the many layers of male friendship he also has a grasp on what happens behind the closed doors of marriages there is humor and heartache in this story told with equal finesse these characters are all people that you'd imagine in any small town i imagine beth as someone i'd be friends with henry is probably someone i'd have had a crush on ronny is the class clown lee would be that one guy in study hall that would be a little too cool for me to try to talk to and kip well he was probably senior class president the new york times did an article about this book and interviewed the author as it turns out sometimes art really does imitate life mr butler is from eau claire wisconsin and went to school with justin vernon the lead singer of indie band bon iver this made me very curious about the music not only does debut novelist nickolas butler have a new fan so does bon iver an ecopy of this book was provided to me by the publisher through netgalley the opinions above are expressly my own","1101":" five high school friends come together in their small wisconsin town of little wing 20 years on they've taken different paths in life but that doesn't mean all the things they've been through are forgotten or resolved beth and henry and their solid goodness have stayed with me since the first time i read the manuscript and lee super famous musician kip chicago futures trader who wants to come home again and ronny the injured loyal rodeo star keep intruding on my thoughts shotgun lovesongs is nick butler's debut novel and it's one of those discoveries that readers will be happy to have found","1102":"after reading the synopsis a few times i expected this book to be very grim and plain fortunately for me the novel turned out to be deeper and heartwarming than i thought centered on five main characters the author switches between the characters to propel the story forward i love it when authors do this as not only do we get insight on the characters but it helps us form a deeper attachment to the characters and realize that not everything is black and white a character may seem like a jerk but there are valid reasons for that not that it justifies their actions i take this style of writing as more of a method of disppelling misunderstandings and biased judgments by the readers which really highlights the importance of each character while adding depth to the plot overall a solid book and enjoyed reading it","1103":"this review has been hidden because it contains spoilers to view it click here story of 4 friends growing up in rural wisconsin one becomes a farmer one a chicago business man one a rodeo guy and one a music star in their 30's they struggle to maintain their boyhood friendships","1104":" i wanted to give this book a higher rating simply because i enjoyed the themes the characters and the story kept my interest however there were two glaring problems from my perspective 1 i read lots of books that follows groups of friends or family members and this one just didn't really stand out from the crowd i know i will have forgotten most of it in a month's time 2 the timing was just off henry and beth supposedly have been married ten years and four years in they started having kids but when the kids were very rarely mentioned they were doing things that older kids would be doing the oldest would've been six there were other inconsistencies with time too but i didn't write them down that said i would certainly read more by the author the book was moderately thought provoking but overall pretty ho hum","1105":"a well written and insightful book that did a very good job of conveying a sense of place and time especially in its depiction of life in a small town and marriage still both the ideas conveyed by the author as well as the characters in the book lacked a certain depth also is it necessary to punctuate so much of the conversation and thoughts of your characters with profanity spoiled what was otherwise a solid read","1106":"i could have done without all the chapters of lee waxing poetic about his land his house etc overall it was a good and interesting piece of literary fiction and perhaps the best book out of the iowa writer's workshop that i've read lately","1107":" i've seen some rather negative review of this book here on goodreads but in my eyes this book is so true and so captures life in the midwest i'm a michigan guy that i couldn't help but love it the characters are great and i grew to care about all of them and they all have flaws but they work with and around those flaws to pull what they can out of life it is about friendship and love and home this book deserves a lot of attention when it comes out in march if my 'to read' shelves weren't overflowing i would probably start reading this one right away again i don't ever do that but i would with this book by the way i forgot to mention that i did receive this as a free arc","1108":"i really enjoyed this story of 4 guys who were lifelong friends it is a quiet story well told","1109":" read this book and fall in love with the nice guy lee might be a famous pop star kip has made his fortune in the city and ronny has the body of a greek god from his days as a rodeo star but henry who stayed in his home town to farm marry his childhood sweetheart and raise their family is the rock of this novel and it's heart the landscape and comforts of a small town are beautifully written alongside the itch to get away and the tension between the two is very realistic and affects all the characters and their actions to a greater or lesser extent throughout the novel at its core it is a hopeful book which gives everyone the chance to change and redeem themselves and gives everyone the chance to be happy no matter what life has thrown at them or what their previous choices have been and it's a book which really makes you care for its characters and wish for their happiness","1110":"what makes shotgun lovesongs so special is the story's emotional impact and its ability to fully engage the reader in the lives of this group of friends beth married to henry musician lee bull rider and slightly altered from a nasty bump on the head while drunk but still capable ronny and seemingly selfish though deep down really good guy kip all take a turn telling their stories and how their lives connect with and are changed by their childhood friends the story has such depth vivid and genuine personality open heartedness and raw honesty to it that it was difficult not to like any of the characters the book is written with a majestic beautiful and at times haunting language that lingers in your memory and flows so smoothly you cease to realize exactly how quickly the book is slipping away you're so involved in the story","1111":" i picked up the audiobook for shotgun lovesongs because one of my book clubs is reading it soon it isn't a book i would have otherwise chosen but isn't that why people join book clubs i felt a strong connection to many of the characters and themes in this book which is set in rural wisconsin because i grew up in rural wisconsin i moved to the twin cities 20 years ago now but thanks to the magic of facebook i can still see what my high school classmates who stuck around town are doing these days many of them have grandkids the same age as my youngest child i probably liked this book more than i would have had i not grown up in rural wisconsin i can totally see that enormous jar of pickled eggs at the end of the bar as my dad loves them gross but not nearly as much as he likes pickled pigs feet even more gross hi mom you can tell dad that i'm talking about his pickled pigs' feet on the internet and then he'll want to get some good luck finding them in florida right now i listened to the book on audiobooks and was ok with most of the narration but the voice actor for the ronnie character didn't seem to fit also one of the other voice actors horribly mispronounced \"bratwurst\" and i nearly drove off the road complaining to myself about how someone playing a wisconsinite could mispronounce \"bratwurst\" and it wasn't fixed in production seriously it's an important part of wisconsin bratwurst is right up there with the packers brewers badgers cheese beer and brandy heck i've lived in minnesota for 2 decades now and i had bratwurst just last night there is a pretty awesome german restaurant near us with spaetzel and red cabbage my family loves it i'm the only one in my house that will eat braunschwager though as my dad and i both love it but i've wandered off the point as did the narrative in this book at some spots there were some serious tangents when i was wondering what this topic had to do with anything and rather than being a set up it was really just a mad rambling some of the other reviewers criticised the book for the characters of beth and hank only traveling to new york city once in their lives so far i'm wondering if those reviewers have any idea the lack of out of town travel most actual dairy farmers enjoy my best friend from high school grew up on a dairy farm and those cows need to be milked every twelve hours this isn't a job you can pawn off on just any person you know she milked cows on her wedding day as did most of the wedding party while i entertained the rest of the guests at the reception as we sat drinking brandy old fashions and waiting for the return of the bride and groom it is not easy for dairy farmers to get away especially if most of the other people you know are milking their own herd at the same time every day i liked the characters and the changing perspective i liked the homage to my home state as i too still hear the \"call of the cheese\" and long to return to wisconsin some day the plot could have been a little stronger but the relationships between the five central characters were compelling if this had been written by a woman and if the sexes of the 5 central characters hank lee ronnie kip and beth had been reversed this book definitely would have fallen into the \"chic lit\" genre as it was more about the relationships than any big plot or mystery or anything else there are some universal themes in this book 1 tmarriage is hard 2 tgolf is an awful waste of time 3 trural wisconsin is an amazing place to live there are some real world truism from shotgun lovesongs","1112":"this was interesting but i didn't like the final third of the book it seemed to have more potential than it achieved","1113":"bravo to nicklolas butler on a fantastic first novel and for adding to the list of literary fiction that embraces the midwest for what it is and what it isn't","1114":"so emotional one of my new favorites now","1115":"i really liked this book and all the characters he really developed ea one so that you could imagine what they looked like good storyline","1116":"in a small wisconsin town outside eau claire wisconsin four old friends have followed very different paths but all come back to the small town in which they grew up one became an indie rock star one a farmer one a successful businessman in chicago and one a rodeo star before an accident sidetracked his life the novel explores the relationships between the men and how they try to grow up and move forward in their lives the writing style was occasionally off putting to me for example she subscribed to some of the trashier magazines that i occasionally flipped through at the iga while waiting to pay for my groceries all photographs no articles or stories or poems just pictures of celebrities yeah we know what a tabloid magazine is but i enjoyed reading the book although the ending went somewhat off the rails for me","1117":"loved the characters and that it took place in small town wisconsin","1118":" i truly enjoyed listening to this audio book since i grew up on a farm and went to school in a small town in the midwest i could relate to a lot of situations in this book i enjoyed the journey of four small town boys and how their relationship changed as they grew up there were many times where i laughed out loud in my car and shook my head while remembering similar situations from when i was growing up as well as situations that i find myself in now when i go home to visit my parents thanks to goodreads first reads for a copy of this audio book","1119":" somehow this brief tale of a few years seems kind of epic in scope while being so narrow in focus i would highly recommend shotgun lovesongs to literature fans fiction fans and readers who like character driven stories little wing wisconsin really couldn't be any more stereotypical of rural mid western life but the interweaving stories of locals hank leland kip ronny and beth make for a story both thrilling and peaceful familiar and exotic spanning only a few years in the adult lives of these close childhood friends memories of what once was seamlessly mix with experiences and thoughts of present day for a kaleidoscope of views of the same shared life each chapter narrated by a different character draws a contrast between all of them their histories their fears and wishes the way they act as a group as well as individually and especially the differences and new similarities that have developed over time through each perspective the story of both their friendship and the town's culture progresses for a beautiful tale of friendship loss love dreams anguish and everyday contentment in middle america circa the 21st century i'm not normally a fiction fan particularly stories of everyday american experiences but this book is so expertly drawn together that it's hard to put it down every piece of the story feels harmoniously dichotomous grand and simple friendly and stifling intense and yet still very comfortable it's as though this mid western life of characteristic slowness small victories and everyday routine becomes an anthem something so proud and painstaking that you can't help but feel glad for the characters where almost every other portrayal of this isolated life just makes readers feel depressed and hopeless and gladly wallow in that sorrow despite some of the terrible things that can so change someone just by living a normal life there's always a sense of hope a sense of everyone being exactly where they're supposed to be even if they don't know how satisfied they are at the time i hate to call his a brilliant study on the human condition but rather i think it's more accurately a study on american humanity there's a sense of pride and particularly a strong sense of self and place that pervades every experience no matter the time or circumstance reading this story is kind of like looking at a polaroid that changes a little each time you look at it it fades in places while other parts are left in focus and you can never go back to the crisp sharpness it once had too faded and complicated kind of like a folk song from a far off place this is one of those books that feels familiar until you really listen and realize that it's a beautiful song you've never heard anything like before at all i would definitely pick up anything by nikolas butler in future","1120":"i'd give this book 3 5 stars i enjoyed the small town feel and nostalgia this book provides a story about friendship love heartbreak and growing up almost like a second coming of age","1121":"i enjoyed the rawness and authenticity of what life is like in small town wisconsin as a young adult it also gave me as a female a better perspective into the minds of adult males boy is my mind sooooo different","1122":"it took me a while to get into this book i enjoyed the story although not as much as i thought i would the switching back and forth from history to the present in the chapters wasn't really my thing","1123":"i liked this book it was a toss up between a 3 and 4 star it was interesting it takes place mainly in wisconsin i am sure some people from smaller towns or any farming area might relate more closely with the book it is a nice feel good book definitely worth reading","1124":"i enjoyed this book more than i anticipated maybe being from western wisconsin made a big difference but i felt i knew each of the characters portrayed thank you mr butler","1125":"i had to think about this book for awhile before reviewing i liked it although it wasn't really about anything in particular other than friendships this is a book that i might consider reading again just to be able to take it all in with a different insight than i did the first time i would recommend this book but couldn't exactly explain why guess you would have to figure that out for yourselves","1126":"having this book read to me over the past few days was such a nice experience the sense of place was so strong and so familiar oh right i am a lifelong wisconsinite is that why i am so enamored not entirely there is much to love here each character's distinctive voice and individual perspective on the events and on other characters and how they all fit together beautiful writing and true to my ear dialogue and a good story with love betrayal forgiveness and reshaping relationships at its core although not the main character ronny was most endearing to me i loved beth too and would enjoy her as a friend i think the only reason i could not go with 5 stars is because the final climactic game changing event was so unlikely that i could not suspend my disbelief and instead was intensely aware that this had been crafted for a specific audience whereas the rest of the novel just unfolded at ease and had me entranced","1127":"butler's novel offers an engaging insight into the lives of four men and one woman who grew up together in a small wisconsin town who mostly went different ways as adults but always came back home it's about boys becoming men finding themselves and each other even as they lose themselves and each other it's also about love there are some bits about music that are good too","1128":"small town dynamic driven by 4 boyhood friends who have come home for a wedding easy read about friendship regrets truth telling i heard a movie is in the works","1129":"i loved the voices in this novel of five friends from small town wisconsin the characters and narrators felt like real people each voice unique with particular yearnings but each was grounded in love for the influence of growing up in a small farming town it's a books about how the dreams and people and landscape of our youth echo and shape us forever it's about finding a home in the world i loved every page","1130":" little wing wisconsin was nothing more than empty space on a map until singer songwriter corvus' album shotgun lovesongs is recorded in a little wing chicken coop and shoot the town to stardom but regardless of the money he makes or the actress he marries corvus will always be leland to hank kip and ronny the friends he grew up with all suddenly converged back in their hometown at various stages in their lives and careers the friends discover changes in the bond they once shared and uncover secrets they have tried to keep hidden for years shotgun lovesongs drips midwest i grew up in a suburb of detroit closer to kip's chicago highrise than little wing but i still felt a certain closeness to butler's characters and their situations i've seen the reunions the weddings the far strung friends that circle back and attempt to fall into place like they never left though the characters in his novel inch toward stereotypical butler captures the essence of those friendships and emotions in each one there's more than one layer to shotgun lovesongs the book's story is told from several perspectives and not just those of leland hank kip and ronny woven into the narrative is hank's wife beth who becomes both a catalyst for much of the novel's conflict and an olive branch for mending it compared to their male counterparts beth and the other female characters in shotgun lovesongs feel slightly two dimensional as some of their story lines are touched on but don't feel fully explored perhaps it's sentimental or just a longing for home but i found myself overlooking flaws in nickolas butler's novel that i would have found distracting in other books easily swept up in the characters and story though some readers without a connection to the midwest may not feel so forgiving shotgun lovesongs is a deeply truthful personal reading experience that gets to the core of friendship and love see more at www rivercityreading com","1131":"maybe it's because i grew up in the midwest but i loved this audiobook this is the story of who we were in our youth and who we are now the friendships we maintain the relationships in our life the audiobook uses five different narrators and they make this a wonderful listening experience the characterizations were spot on i knew and loved each of them despite and sometimes even because of their flaws highly recommended","1132":" i'm not sure what made 'shotgun lovesongs' such a remarkably resonant read for me maybe it was the familiar midwestern setting little wing wi reminded me of the wisconsin minnesota mississippi river valley i grew up in near red wing mn or the small town flavor grain elevators neighborhood bars and pickled egg jars or the unpretentious goodness good things do happen to good people maybe it was the beautiful clear eyed big hearted writing butler is a poetic observer and creates characters any of us would recognize one of them leeland is loosely based on eau claire wi native justin vernon of bon iver fame nickolas butler's former classmate that alone was intriguing enough to make me take note but the writing kept me hooked an excellent debut by a writer who should be on any reader's radar","1133":"received an advanced reader's copy of this book and couldn't put it down the characters and story move along but my attraction came from the story's home in small town wisconsin a beautiful read for anyone who loves the midwest and wants to be moved by literary pictures of home","1134":" i enjoyed the story i like things that i can relate to coming from a small midwest town i can see a lot of these things happening in real life people change but they're also still the same nostalgia is a good feeling so thats probably what i liked most about this book more than anything else thinking of my friends and experiences and what our book would be what part would i play would i be a likable character actually i didn't hate any of the characters or even have a favorite which is strange for me usually i'm rooting for someone but i was really rooting for all of them even kip who started out to be such a d#% the ending was pretty far fetched but also a little bit hilarious actually maybe not far fetched these days","1135":"good old fashioned small town wisconsin setting nicely written kinda funny and sad just like real life great characters that are easy to care about and hard to leave nickolas butler knows this existence and describes it beautifully for green bay packer fans and all readers who like good writing about friendships marriage and the close bonds of little communities","1136":"the story of the tangled lives of 4 men and a woman who grew up in the same small town in wisconsin they leave return fall in and out of love argue get in trouble sounds sort of like women's fiction doesn't it but nickolas butler adds the fresh spice of a male perspective i hope he keeps writing","1137":"really liked it","1138":"a fantastic novel the characters are so well drawn and little wing feels totally real i am hoping that nickolas butler has another novel coming out in the near future as i could not put this one down","1139":" i received this book for free through goodreads first reads i normally don't read this genre but i was pleasantly surprised this book is about a group of friends from a small community and shows us a glimpse of some real life struggles that friends go through it's a book about love and heartbreak mistakes and forgiveness and what friendship is really all about if you're someone who uses every social media site to stay connected to your so called friends you probably won't understand this book much however if you still value intentional relationships or are homesick for some of your good old friends this book would fit you perfectly","1140":"i haven't enjoyed a book this much in a long long time maybe it's because i've lived in the midwest my whole life i relate to midwest values hard working honest people who say what they mean people who know what it's like to wait for that small paycheck to wait for that crop to come in friends are friends for life they grew up together and always are in one another's lives this book is marvelous","1141":"i really enjoyed the story and how it was told though each character though at times i thought it was overly descriptive especially when i first started reading it i almost gave up on it but glad that i stayed with it because it turned out to be a great read","1142":" it easy to tell this is a first novel the author has a great deal of potential again if 1 2 stars were possible i would give this book a 3 1 2 star rating the first three quarters of the story moved along at a pretty good clip the story involves several people and each chapter is in the voice of one of the those persons it is a valid method of getting the reader into the mind of the character and giving the reader a nice connection to that person i liked certain chapters much more than others some just needed a little good editing because they really went on and on a bit too long the last one fourth of the book was critical to the story but it was a little slow and i just wanted to get the story over with the very end was a little abrupt","1143":"i really enjoyed the first half of this book and might have given it 5 stars but was disappointed in the direction it took in the second half of the book the book is about a small town in southwestern wisconsin and focuses primarily on five main characters who grew up there themes of what if and the desire of some people to leave the small town they grew up in versus the inexplicable pull to either stay or return to a small town four men and one woman are the five main characters the woman marries the farmer who never left town but while they were briefly broken up after college she sleeps with one of the other characters in the first half it was no secret that this guy harbored unresolved lingering feelings toward this woman however the second half of the book seems to obsess over these unresolved feelings and the relationships that are damaged because of this when i thought other relationships and characters could have been explored further","1144":"i have been disappointed in books lately or it could be my skittish mind refusing to get hooked but this one was a sight for sore eyes it is part scenic description of what it would feel like to be from a midwestern town but not overboard steinbeck anyone and it's also part family and friendship in fact i'd go as far as to say it could have been written about 4 women as instead of the 4 leading men henry lee kip and ronny i don't need to summarize the story but it's just good to know that it's from different points of view all adding the necessary ingredient to bring the richness to the story how each of the men's lives mix in and effect each other we get to see lines blurred and crossed and the aftermath i have read that some people questioned the ending it's sort of open ended abrupt but i didn't think it detracted anything i loved the writing and seeing what led the characters to where they stood do know that it jumps back and forth a bit but it's no confusing if you're a close reader","1145":"different kind of friend story four guys who grew up together in a small wisconsin town reunite for a wedding and realize how their different life experiences have changed them and question whether it has changed their relationships with each other well written and easy to read for all of us who have left our small town hometowns but still have ties there it will take you back to the life you left behind","1146":"loved this book very typical small town americana reminded me of my summers in northern michigan even though it is set in small town wisconsin","1147":"really enjoyed this book which takes place in wisconsin i liked the character viewpoint aspect of it","1148":"nickolas butler captures wisconsin beautifully in this lovely novel about time and friendship and what endures unlike so many novels i pick up by younger writers these days this one made me like the characters and put me firmly in time and place i live in wisconsin and he nailed it beautiful writing highly recommended my only critique is that the end came up on me too fast i felt like he chopped it off a bit too quickly i needed to ease into it and i wish he'd have returned to place as his jumping off point for end","1149":"a small town book with a chick lit feel except the main characters were guys a bit of a bromance it was just okay","1150":"great book about a group of lifelong friends from a small town in wisconsin told from from five friends viewpoints all come across as believable and likable two downsides to the book 1 you don't want it to end 2 it will be awfully hard for the author to write his follow up to this book","1151":"sometimes the reading gods answer our prayers and for me they delivered nickolas butler's debut novel 'shotgun lovesongs' for the last couple of years i have been a little bit obsessed with tv show 'nashville' which in it's most basic tagline on imdb is described as being about - \"a fading country music star comes into conflict with a rising teen star \" which does the show no justice at all 'nashville' follows the lives of famous country music stars and the complicated histories that helped write their most famous songs we also see up and coming stars in their eyes singers as they start learning the same lessons as their idols when it comes to heartache being a solid muse connie britton as rayna jaymes her hair is my spirit animal hayden panettiere as juliette barnes and the delicious charles esten as deacon claybourne i freakin' love this show but because i am a reader first and foremost i often think after nearly every episode how much i wish there was a book like 'nashville' ... and then 'shotgun lovesongs' came along set in little wing wisconsin - 'shotgun lovesongs' is told from the alternating perspectives of life long friends henry lee kip and ronnie and henry's wife beth henry is a farmer real salt of the earth type who married his highschool sweetheart who he'd known since kindergarten and has three beautiful children with her kip left little wing and made it big in chicago working numbers - but he's recently returned and poured all his money into a run down mill and silos that he envisions turning into a landmark that will revitalize his old beloved town ronnie was big on the rodeo circuit a real heartthrob with a little fanbase - until drinking fried his brain and now while he gets along just fine people feel the need to keep an eye on him lee is 'corvus' - a big country music star whose first album \"shotgun lovesongs\" sky rocketed him to fame but little wing has always been his home base the place he comes to unwind after the world tours and press gigs studio sessions and failed relationships splashed all over the tabloids everyone is returning to little wing to see kip get married - but what happens at the wedding sets off a domino effect amongst these friends who suddenly find themselves tied up in secrets and confessions frayed relationships and drifting apart i so loved that the pivot point of this novel is the friendship of these four men it's something very rarely represented outside of ya and children's novels - men whose histories are entwined with one another who feel a deep bond of brotherhood and need each other's presence in their lives to feel right and orientated in this world when i reviewed the book 'just between us australian writers tell the truth about female friendship' last year i expressed a wish for a male equivalent short story collection ... and i think i got it in 'shotgun lovesongs' lee in particular relies on his little wing friends to be his calm after the storm of fame coming home for him is less about the house he owns and bed he sleeps in but rather getting invited round to henry and beth's place for dinner lee speaks so eloquently if internally about what henry means to him even a phone call from his best friend henry's voice - the voice of an old friend - like finding a wall to orient you in some strange dark hotel room the world is still out there henry is still out there real as a fencepost and these men have a complicated friendship in the beginning kip is seemingly cruel for the way he tries to distance himself from ronnie clearly embarrassed and unsure of how to treat his friend who isn't quite the guy he used to be henry and lee meanwhile are more open and physically affectionate with ronnie whether that's something that changed since ronnie's hospitalization i was never sure happy to hug him place a hand on the back of his neck for reassurance and as a result henry and lee's relationship with kip is frosty - but this is something he muses on while looking over little wing from his silo something all four did as boys growing up the sun is rising soon the day's first customers will begin to trickle in lee used to hear music in sunsets - jazz i don't know about that and the sunrise i don't think sunrise has a musical sound to me it's like a beautiful woman yawning as she first wakes up or maybe i don't know a baby a baby opening her eyes maybe both either way i feel less and less that i deserve another day another dawn like this one a lot of what we learn about these men is internal and kept from other characters' knowledge- only readers know that henry has started painting again after being encouraged by his high school art teacher only to burn the canvases and hide the evidence kip seemingly so cruel has a private story about once sharing a close resemblance to an elderly couple's deceased son who died while in afghanistan ... characters open up to readers in their narrated sections beautiful vignettes that are pulled out like campfire stories while the bigger arc of the plot plays out around them but the focus in this book is on lee many of the characters muse throughout how proud they are of his success and how much of his album 'shotgun lovesongs' is based on their childhood and shared history with the great lee corvus even lee acknowledges the role little wing has played as his muse and key to his success sing like you've got no audience sing like you don't know what a critic is sing about your hometown sing about your prom sing about deer sing about the seasons sing about your mother sing about chainsaws sing about the thaw sing about the rivers sing about forests sing about the prairies but whatever you do start signing early in the morning if only just to keep warm and if you happen to live in a warm beautiful place ... move to wisconsin buy a woodstove and spend a week splitting wood it worked for me and as life changing events unfold not always dramatically but in little increments as they do - drunken secrets admitted the silence that grows in a marriage we as readers start to see that there is inspiration coming lee's way - maybe for a new album we may be privy as his friends once were to the groundwork that's being laid for lee's next creative endeavour i loved this book nickolas butler writes with such a steady assured voice that is at once tough and lyrical he doesn't sound like a debut author but a rather accomplished storyteller ... and sometimes that is what forgiveness is anyway - a deep sigh i loved that this book first and foremost is about the love between four grown male friends and the fractures and fights that would threaten to tear them apart if they weren't so damn dedicated to one another i want to read anything and everything else that nickolas butler puts his name to","1152":"i found this very dull like reading a journal of someone who is an above average writer but has the same basic life i do","1153":"great story of several people in a small town told from a variety of perspectives","1154":"i received a review copy of this book from netgalley i didn't expect to like this book the hokey sounding title the graphic design of the book cover both said no this is not your kind of book however it had excellent reviews and i figured i would give it a try so glad that i did it is a story of 4 men who grew up in a small town in wisconsin they are all very different as men but were best friends growing up the novel goes back and forth between the present and the past with chapters from the point of view of the men and their wives lovers what drew me in was the honesty of men in the story and the description of the town and surroundings growing up in small towns of the northeast many descriptions resonated perhaps not the wide open spaces but the feelings expressed by the characters as we were brought back in time felt real to me i enjoyed the stories of the big fish in the small pond and the various roads they each took to success in their own right","1155":"a great book about small town america and four friends who grew up in it butler writes with true emotions for the characters i thought kip was a little bit left out of the story but the other three men easily made up for it a great story about friendship even when mistakes happen and everything could be lost","1156":" butler paints a vivid and realistic picture of what it is like growing up and living in a small mid western town very typical warm and comforting the friendships relationships and dynamics that happen when the friends take different paths and have to interact as much different people than they once were are realistic and compelling i enjoyed the backgrounds and stories of the paths these 4 friends took as well as the people and places that help construct their hometown past and present the story interweaves and flows well throughout i never really hit a lull and moved along quickly with the story definitely a fun light read to start the summer","1157":"i loved this book a story written from mainly 4 povs all best friends in a tiny town in the middle of wisconsin it tells of their friendships and loves and winds the story beautifully never letting you go never letting you get bored with their small town mid western lives read this book to see that everyday ordinary love and friendships are more interesting and longer lasting than the shotgun relationships of celebrity and money we knew that already but this book reiterates this in a big hearted way","1158":" i requested shotgun lovesongs by nickolas butler from netgalley because jojo moyes recommended it on twitter weeks went by and then after i had accepted that i wouldn't get approved for it there was the email in my inbox saying i could download it and i'm so happy i did i loved this story it is centered around five friends from wisconsin and one of them lee becomes a famous musician who goes by the name corvus his story i'm sure is inspired by the real musician bon iver lee never loses his ties to his hometown when he's not touring that's where he lives he returns to his roots because that's where his inspiration comes from i think i loved this story so much because butler wove such a beautiful tapestry of what it's like being from the midwest i also loved these characters and was thinking about them when i wasn't reading the book it's been awhile since that happened i loved how beautifully the story wove in and out of their present and their past this book might not feel perfect for everybody but it was for me so thank you jojo moyes and netgalley","1159":" could go with 3 stars today but since i found this quite enjoyable if not absolutely enthralling i'll go with 4 stars i liked the setting rural wisconsin in a small town named little wing four friends now adults grew up together in this farming town two of the men henry and ronnie have chosen to live in little wing henry as a dairy farmer and ronnie as a retired rodeo star kip some kind of financial investor and len a famous musician each travelled away from little wing but have now headed back to reconnect with friends and a quieter lifestyle offered by the tiny town beth henry's wife is also a primary character each chapter is narrated by one of the main characters as they struggle to reconnect with old friends deal with past secrets and enjoy their family and friends somehow i missed until almost the very 3end that the narrator of each chapter is denoted by the letter of the chapter h for henry for example but i kind of liked having to read each chapter a bit to figure out who was speaking it's a quiet but not too quiet story of decades long friendships families love and kind people trying to figure it all out","1160":"on the one hand i definitely skimmed through some of the boring introspective crap in this book especially lee's crap on the other hand i picked it up to finish a chapter before i watched some project runway and sewed and i ended up just finishing the book so there's that also the ending sucked a lot but they often do so meh can't hold that too much against it","1161":"i thought this book was a simple day in the life story told by a group of childhood friends","1162":" this book really walks the fine line between overly sentimental and honesty and sometimes i couldn't tell from moment to moment which was which sometimes it seemed to be touching on real issues and capturing life in the upper midwest without artifice or detached sense of irony others it felt butler was trying to hard and forcing everything into a sort of poetic sentimentality listening to it helped because each character had their own voice and therefore stood out a little more i think that is why i ended up enjoy it and listening all the way to the end there was a cinematic quality to the audio version which kept pulling me forward as a debut novel there are definitely promising aspects and it will be interesting to see if butler can explore similar territory and issues with more subtlety in the future","1163":"this is one of the most powerful books i've ever read and i read a lot in some parts i'd realize that i felt like i was part of the story especially in the last 30 or so pages butler's command of the language in fantastic i easily see his world through his words other authors have this gift but he is so clear pulling me along by his side through his tale i'll be anxiously waiting for his next full length novel and pray that it will measure well against shotgun lovesongs carol in san antonio","1164":"this book is an honest exploration of human relationships and conflict love and well life it is told through the eyes of a group of friends from a small town in wisconsin the author skillfully writes from the point of view of the many characters this is effective and makes the book a delight to read i recommend it","1165":"very good enjoyed it","1166":"a quick and pleasurable read this novel nonetheless has a number of passages that reverberate like the colors lee hears as the sun rises these characters are likable people more human than heroic their flaws minimal and as easily forgiven as the book's","1167":"a love song to male friendships small town living and my beloved wisconsin interesting characters spot on description and strong writing that gives you something to think about as a wisconsinite i may be slightly biased but i loved it","1168":"or four weddings and a firearms accident i relished this story about four guys and their struggles to leave the little wisconsin hometown and make a name for themselves there's a dependable farmer an a hole daytrader an alcoholic rodeo rider who's not quite all there anymore and a fictionalized justin vernon from bon iver which i kept thinking was supposed to be bon iver and after the fact learned the author had grown up with him of the four men only the farmer and the rockstar are given more than cursory page time and the second half of the book is almost all about their fight over a woman the book loses steam as it progresses but it's got a few great vignettes along the way","1169":" i'm not the biggest bon iver fan which might make me the right guy to read this the rock star character is apparently based on him u0026amp i don't have strong feelings about him at all i liked this ok u0026amp there will be a movie in a couple of years a bit sentimental for my taste but if you're into novels about friendship u0026amp romantic relationships u0026amp sometimes both this may be for you it does shift narrators but the first time it does it i found it a bit jarring u0026amp the voices are often a little too similar but that's a small complaint oh one more small complaint a major plot point is very predictable diner or the big chill for midwest rural folks u0026amp or hipsters if you like richard russo you'd probably like this maybe after a few more books butler will be as good as russo","1170":"recommended by andrea ellen j connie and jo andrea writes this book is a beautiful study of love and friendship but it's also a love song to small town america '' read her review https www goodreads com review show check our catalog http encore cooklib org iii encore","1171":"it is hard to believe this is a first novel set in wisconsin you will enjoy reading about this group of friends growing up in a small town beautifully written a treat","1172":" i received this book through goodreads first reads i thought this book had a lot of potential but i felt like there was no point to the book just a bunch of stories about some guys that have been friends forever it was still a quick read because the stories are intriguing i really like the small town setting because it reminded me of my hometown it's told through five different points of view which i usually like but i think that five is a couple too many my only problem with this book was that most of the book is stories about the past and didn't leave a lot of room for things to happen in the future","1173":"i might rate this slightly higher than a 3 it was overall enjoyable but i found the alternating narration of the characters to be more of a distraction than an effective storytelling method at times the characters seemed a little flat","1174":"well written and i liked the midwestern setting but it fell short in the character department for me the characters felt real but i still didn't really care what happened to them much","1175":"great wisconsin novel lyrical view of our corner of the world","1176":"butler is a poet loved it great understanding of small town life and a great sense of place","1177":"maybe it's the midwesterner in me yes i'm already apologizing in midwestern fashion but i loved this novel set in modern day small town wisconsin it profiles the friendship between four late 20's guys who have been pals since childhood one hits it particularly big becoming a bon iver like musician which alters the dynamics and takes us on an interesting dip into the new york celebrity scene the other hometown boys are a farmer a washed up rodeo rider and a guy who's returned home after making it big in chicago's commodities market there are women too but only the farmer's wife is fully developed and integral to the story but what i liked most was reading about four full bodied male characters' close unabashedly loving but complicated relationships with each other and with the place they grew up i often read novels that explore women's friendships relationships but seldom men's let alone youngish men so it seemed fresh territory and even though some might consider the author's depiction of these relationships a bit sappy or self glorifying it struck me as refreshingly and unapologetically honest","1178":" gut wrenching according to some reviewers so i spent much of the book yelling in my head don't you dare die on me while reading way too fast to make sure nobody did stories of 4 friends struggling with the american dream and change in small town wisconsin are really lovesongs to friendship and home framed by midwestern locale talented happy sad writing comes laced with questions i've asked myself this long cold winter how many deer make a quorum and how do we get rid of this coyote think i'll read this one again slowly","1179":"it's like a really long country u0026amp western song landscape and setting prevail","1180":"easily one of my top 5 reads of all time i absolutely loved this book it captured small town midwestern life perfectly and it was nice to read from each friend's point of view i would recommend this book to anyone","1181":" this is apparently a novel about the musician who is known as bon iver i've heard a few songs by bon iver before but i know very little about him yeah i know he has a real name and maybe bon iver is the name of the whole project i'm not a fan i'm probably not the intended audience for this book if i were a fan or even mildly interested in bon iver i'd probably find the book interesting despite it's flaws where to start this review the novel takes place in a small wisconsin town the hometown of the musician at the center of the story it's the town he grew up in and returned to in a low point of his life after some bands he had been trying to get going had failed and then in the winter isolation recorded an album in seclusion an album that would make him a star the novel takes place after he's a star and is told from the viewpoint of him his best friend his best friend's wife his brain damaged ex rodeo friend and his ex commodity trader friend five different viewpoints tell the story of living in this small town each character in their thirties and living their adult lives that have left some in the small town taken others away but in one way of another brought them back to the town problem one the voices of these five different narrators aren't all that different from one another they all actually kind of sound alike problem two the story is fairly predictable the characters while possibly based on real people they feel like stock characters the farmer best friend is the good guy the all around good guy the brain damaged friend is the man with the heart of gold the musician is the overly sincere artist who maybe does a few things that flirts with the excess of celebrity culture but is really just a country boy who only feels at home and honest in his hometown maybe splitting some wood or just aimlessly driving his john deere around while wearing his red wings and carhartts and waving to his buddy in the wranglers while his other buddy uses his craftsmans to repair his own john deere did you see what i just did that is problem three to me authenticity in this novel feels bought with product placements sort of the same way us city hipsters buy our own authenticity by donning our brand name clothes to set us apart and drinking some pbr at some dive bar and speaking of city folk the first person observations made when some of the characters travel to new york city seem a little too 'sophisticated' for a person not attuned to the ways of the city except that the book is about an indie rock god it doesn't feel all that different from a lot of other books out there i think it would have been a stronger novel if there hadn't been so many first person perspectives telling the story as i mentioned above the voices all sounded too similar and it kind of gave the feeling that the author was a little too timid to leave the first person behind which is understandable it is much easier to write in this style than in the third person but you well i want to see authors being daring no one goes to the circus to see a high wire act done with the tightrope walker wearing a safety harness","1182":"a novel as entrancing and moving as a well crafted song","1183":"great read especially if you grew up in small town wisconsin this book pulls at the hometown heart strings","1184":"really enjoyed this one really great","1185":"i picked this up off of the clearance table at barnes and noble without knowing anything about it i was pleasantly surprised one reviewer described it at women's fiction for men which seemed spot on","1186":" the audio is pretty well done i like how the author really did shift voices in his writing of each character and having different narrators for each character enhanced that aspect i thought the plot and setting were fantastic my only quibble is that sometimes it felt like it was a little overwritten like the author is really stretching to make the lee character have these deep insights about america that just felt a little unnecessary i enjoyed that it was literary fiction but had so many masculine aspects and like many of the reviews i appreciated that it wasn't afraid to be sentimental","1187":"great beach read","1188":"3 5 stars there were many parts of this book that rang true for me having grown up in a small town in michigan just one state over and having a sister who has lived in the eau claire area for 30 years but then there would be places where things didn't work so well this would be a good one for book club discussion","1189":"i think this novel tried to be charming but reading it was like being stuck in a mud puddle the author clearly adores wisconsin and all things small town but i could not get over my impatience with the fact that the characters were technically adults but were still mentally in high school i don't think a single character moved past the emotional age of 16 they needed to move out and move up i think my breaking point was when two grown men stole a jar of pickled eggs from a local bar and proceeded to throw them off a bridge including onto an oncoming car that was it for me i wouldn't recommend this unless you have a strong desire to revisit every detail of your teenage years in exhausting detail","1190":"beautiful narrative captured small town life and especially wisconsin very well but the characters were flat dull and just too stereo typical for my taste didn't finish","1191":"the air perfumed with the sweet aroma of cheap american beer it was the smell of our childhood the smell of silos and of barns and harvest time fields beer was our tonic and i understood ronny's torment his brain wasn't so damaged that he couldn't recall the dim lights of our favorite bars and the boom of our favorite jukeboxes the nights we had spent parked in the countryside laying in the bed of an ancient pickup truck emptying dozens of cans of beer and throwing the empties out into ditches into those intimate fields of corn every so often an author comes along and writes words that literally hum inside my head make me reread again and again making sure that i haven't just read a written memory of my own there were pieces of this novel that simply felt intimate a clear cut piece of my past unburied and set out for all to see butler did this with this book i felt transported back to my youth four friends all re merging in a small town after life has given them different paths changed them into different people but the landscape is a constant and the town pulls them together makes them fight for their friendships and although the story is simplistic it's worth telling here i can hear things the world throbs differently silence thrums like a chord strummed eons ago music in the aspen trees and in the firs and burr oaks and even in the fields of drying corn how do you explain that to someone how do you explain it to someone you love what if they don't understand butler simply understands the midwest and obviously the rural small town is his muse his descriptions of the surrounding area are beautiful intricate and spot on and even though i could possibly point out a few faults with the story i simply cannot because for most of it butler held me in spell as he in his own way recounted my youth and gave words to some of my own childhood memories little wing could have been stella nebraska and these four friends could have been my high school classmates","1192":" this charming book is about a group of lifelong friends whose lives all orbit around their small town in wisconsin their group of friends and their constant search for a place or person to call home the prose is very genuine and while the chapters are told in the voice of each of the main characters somehow i started to equate henry with the author each friend has different forces pulling them towards and away from their hometown and the book explores the relationships that cause this imbalance it's definitely the kind of book that makes you want to pick up the phone and call an old friend because it many ways it could have been written about you","1193":"four boyhood friends from a small wisconsin town come together for a wedding fun story as i am from wisconsin i could so relate to the pickled eggs on the bar also rare to read about male comradely","1194":"i wish i'd written this","1195":"i really liked a lot about this book i so badly wanted to love it and had very high hopes for it which for me it didn't completely live up to when i spotted this book on the shelf it had a lot going for it in my eyes... to begin with i absolutely loved the title it sounded like my ideal book based on title alone and then there was the way i found it it was a staff recommended book at the incredible mclean and eakin in petoskey michigan if you're ever anywhere close to there you must check it out and the description and cover art were right up my alley as well the author even spelled his first name nickolas with a c and a k which i guess made him seem more interesting to me than say your run of the mill nicolas or nicholas or even nikolas so anyway i couldn't wait to curl up with this book during my northern michigan vacation however the book started pretty slowly for me and i didn't read much of it on my vacation i liked the main character henry hank but i was never totally invested in him or completely sure of who he was that was kind of true for me with all the characters i liked lee i liked beth i really liked ronnie but i was never desperate to see how life shook out for them their town little wing wi reminded me quite a lot of the small michigan town where my husband grew up so i could definitely relate to the setting however i thought little wing was painted in an unrealistically idyllic way at least based on my experience with similar towns most of the characters seemed to absolutely love and adore this town in nearly every way with the town itself essentially being a character and focus of the book i liked the complicated relationships between the long time friends as well as the beth hank lee triangle and i loved nickolas butler's writing style once i got into the book i wanted to keep reading for me it was a really enjoyable book but not one of my very favorites definitely worth checking out","1196":" it is easier to write my reviews as i read i'm on page 86 at the moment this is the second time i have read these pages a testament to my level of interest in the story stories u0026amp also a comment on the confusion the format causes after reading the first chapter i almost put the book away but i was intrigued growing up in a small town in az is a lot like growing up in a small town in wisconsin finally i wrote out a list of the characters so the story would make more sense u0026amp i finally noticed that each chapter has the initial of the character who is narrating then i started over at the beginning an addition of the character names instead of initials would have been helpful i had no idea who was speaking the first time i read it more later thank you to first reads four boys best friends growing up in a small town story told from their perspective u0026amp from the perspective of beth one of their wives good story but format needs some work","1197":"this review has been hidden because it contains spoilers to view it click here coming from a rural area myself i really wanted to love this book but somehow it just didn't feel genuine i mean really does someone have their friend remove a bullet from their leg with needle nose pliers then again there has never been anyone here who became a celebrity millionaire either maybe that's the problem in a book with so many characters beth and henry were the only ones who were actually believable","1198":"i thoroughly enjoyed this book i loved that it was about the friendship of four men loved that it was set in a small town loved how the story unfolded and really enjoyed the writer's way with words i will probably read it again","1199":"must say i was disappointed had expected it to be a bit like comfort food based on the reviews that i read perhaps i was put off by the amount of booze perhaps it was the cliches one dimensional characters i don't know but it didn't work for me there was one particularly moving chapter about an encounter at a gas station but the rest left me unmoved maybe i need to be from wisconsin small town","1200":" wow

and an all around great read shotgun lovesongs is a story of small town usa where everybody knows everybody and like many small towns including the one i am from everyone always rants about how they

heartache certainly some sadness and a whole lot of appreciation for the one's you love it's a reminder that life is hard and often unfair but in the end love is all you need","1201":" this is my

book to sit down and read and find yourself being able to relate your own story growing up in your community family and friends","1202":"if you like books in which the characters are likeable and everything turns out well in the end this book is for you if you long for more complex characters and an ending that isn't sugar coated then this book might frustrate you both were true for me would have rated it 3 and a half stars if i could have","1203":"i enjoyed this but am not sure it was worth the fuss it's a good story with excellent character development follows a group of young people through a series of events which is just my kind of story","1204":"i have it a four instead if a three because it's small town wisconsin","1205":"who is nickolas butler where has this guy been he just penned one of the nation's best novels shotgun lovesongs every five or ten years i'll become attached to a certain book or album an object possessing excellence reliability and permanence with shotgun lovesongs maybe it's because i grew up in a small town maybe it's because i ate a coffee cup diner in perrysburg oh maybe it's because i too bonded with lifelong friends atop a forbidden grain tower but i absolutely loved this book its characters and its relevance butler expertly navigates the source of the novel's central underlying tension and its nuanced intricate layers interchanging chapters each from another character's perspective lend freshness to shotgun lovesongs i cared about these characters that's cliche i know however it's true and there's no need to fabricate a fancier sentence to relate that truth providing each character's perspective enables the reader to better and more deeply understand the genuine motivations of each which enabled me to internalize this book i found myself reflecting upon my own relationships as well as the manner in which they've been solidified or weakened over decades' time anytime that happens you know you've read a good book i look forward to more from nickolas butler the man's a talent and he's captured the midwestern soul a rare accomplishment while our country celebrates its coasts the men and women populating flyover country build feed and maintain this land a secret shotgun lovesongs shares while reminding us of the strengths and passions such burdens require","1206":"very easy read centering around a group of friends from a very small farming town i really enjoyed it","1207":"what a great book set in a very small is wisconsin this book tells the story of kip the hot chicago trader beth the beautiful hometown girl and her movie star handsome husband hank lee and very successful and famous rock star and ronny the rodeo star they have been friends scene grade school and their lives keep intersecting as they grow up it's about love and friendship and small town values it is beautifully written at times very poetic it's about life in the heartland","1208":"first the audiobook was really well done i enjoyed the narration switching among the 5 characters whose lives moved in different directions yet intersected in their hometown of little wing wisconsin i felt like i was reading about real people who i would recognize if i visited their small town when best friends hank and lee have a falling out it seemed that their friendship couldn't be repaired but i thought butler wrote a perfect ending i loved this book","1209":"i was excited to receive this book as a first read i read 100 pages i found the characters valueless and could not connect with any of them in summary i found this novel inefficacious i don't believe it would have gotten any better for me had i finished it","1210":"about four guys and a girl who grew up together and what happened to them in their late twenties good story told from the different characters' perspectives i liked the first guy so much i was almost sorry it went on to the next one","1211":"i think this book might have been less good for someone who did not grow up in western wi or maybe someone who didn't grow up in a small town the characters in this book were so familiar to me like everyone i went to hs with since i haven't been home in a couple years i had to stop a few times because i got so homesick i do wish more of the narrators i read this book in audio form had a true wisconsin accent but they did manage to get pretty close","1212":" disclaimer i received an advance copy of this book from the publisher in exchange for an honest review i didn't love everything about this book but i loved almost everything and blast you goodreads for not letting me give this 4 5 stars before cracking the cover on this book i perused a few reviews on goodreads to see if it was indeed worth my time the blurb said small town wisconsin so i was fairly committed even then i have to say there are a few reviews i disagree with not because reviewers are not entitled to their own opinion but because i found them to be completely untrue for example a review states that this is basically the story of bon iver and if you don't get that you won't get the story or won't care about the book well i know next to nothing about bon iver and if i hadn't read that review i would have made it through the book just fine thanks the setting was beautifully done the characters were finely drawn and it was a pleasure to read in three straight one hour sessions on the treadmill also i read another review that suggested that nothing happened in this book each reader is different of course and some do expect vampires and werewolves or burning buildings with people trapped inside or earthquakes or landslides or the apocalypse or school shootings if that is your preference shotgun lovesongs is not the book for you what i admire deeply about this book is the thread of history that runs between these friends and how butler revealed the details from the past that i was dying to know at just the right moments quiet moments subtly rendered the sort that stay with this reader far longer than a flash and a bang i always feel a sense of regret when i finish a book i've really loved who wants to go back to regular life after the magic of the story but i do feel okay about leaving this book because i know that henry and beth and leland and ronny and lucy and kip and felicia will be okay wherever they are they're doing just fine","1213":"beautiful a sweet little metaphor sneaked in at the end","1214":"this is a well loved novel and i can see why i tend to seek out books set in the midwest and yet i don't know that i've ever read one that is so self consciously a celebration of the virtues of the rural midwest this one is set in a fictional small town near eau claire wisconsin and yet i don't know this strikes me as a mythological sentimental midwest the one we'd like to believe in to make it seem more down to earth the story is filled with frequent bouts of binge drinking lots of swearing occasional casual drug use and a little sex outside marriage but that's just superficial cover for more intense focus on the sweet though occasionally conflicted relationships among five friends since childhood the narration shifts among the five of them and their love for their little town it didn't really work for me but i'm not surprised that it does for many readers","1215":"what did i think i'm not sure it's largely about the progress of friendships as kids grow into men but retain their links to their hometowns for some people they can probably connect i look forward to my bookclub's discussion to see what the rest of the group felt it was a bit like the big chill in book form in some respects","1216":"this book goes nowhere i started skimming about halfway to confirm that fact","1217":"i grew up in a very small town in a rural area so i am no stranger to the kinds of places and people in this book i really wanted to like it more but the characters are just so much about themselves and way too introspective toward the end of the book things happened to ronny and then to lee and i wanted to cheer that finally these people were actually doing something instead of thinking about how they feel","1218":"okay okay this is not a literary masterpiece but it's not half bad either and i loved it maybe a bit broro for some there's a lot of 'buddy' and babes but who needs toff lit all the time","1219":"beautiful descriptive language perfectly encapsulates life in a tiny town","1220":"big hearted and charming midwestern references i could truly appreciate a good solid story of friendship among men a nice break away from all the stories available about women and friendship good stuff","1221":"not sure if it's because i'm from the midwest but i really enjoyed this book great story","1222":"very enjoyable read stories of a friendship of kip lee hank beth and ronnie it was interesting the different voices and their feelings the author has a way of weaving a tapestry of words that gets your emotions going being vegan i didn't enjoy much the parts about the rodeos or farming but i did like the friendship tale","1223":"i was encouraged as i started this book but as i progressed the characters became more and more shallow and the plot became more and more schmaltzy the story is told from the viewpoints of five main characters but they all sounded like the same voice and the ending left me with a furrowed brow and a huh i don't recommend","1224":"a sleepy novel with redeeming if not lovable characters it reads like a series of short stories","1225":"simply put gorgeous book i loved every word","1226":" bk and kenze this one was for you guys i promised i'd have this book read by the end of 2015 and i wanted to keep that promise because i've been telling you guys i'd read it for the past like year and a half so i've done it i've finished it and i really really enjoyed this one apparently this book is supposed to be based on bon iver right the whole wisconsin musician recording music with fire crackling in the background beautiful falsetto super achy breaky heart type vibes kind of makes that abundantly clear it seems like everyone's obsessed with the midwest these days that whole out on the range by yourself swallowing your feelings and then regurgitating them years later very in right now and i'm always down for a soul searching multi storyline exploration of character too so by all accounts this was the perfect book for me the exploration of character was fast paced well thought out and articulately written and i loved all of the characters except lee because he was kind of an ass hat sorry guys but it's true yeah he stood up for ronny but like everyone loved ronny and that can't be the reason i love someone the whole fight with henry and his fight with kip and everything else wasn't handled all that well and yeah the fault isn't entirely lee's but it's definitely largely his fault in both cases if only because he's a poor communicator but i digress back to the book as a whole i know this book would be slow for some people but i devoured it in a couple of days would have been two if i wasn't in florida with my best friend #holla it's a nice human interest story with some lovely overlapping plotlines and the ability to make you want to listen to bon iver all day curl up in a ball and cry at it's beauty maybe it's because it's almost christmas and half of takes place in the past in the wintertime but it felt like a christmas read and i like those #bless","1227":" ugh there was potential here but the author didn't follow through this read like a first draft chapters alternate first person narration between five different characters but all the characters sound the same butler would have been better off going with third person narration the author really wanted to set up wisconsin as a character in itself and he sometimes succeeded but so many times he just referenced carhartts or john deere or leinenkugels like hey you know they're really legit midwesterners because they're drinking leinie's while wearing carhartts on the farm and as long as we're on the topic of portraying midwesterners can new york publishers please stop thinking that we're all a bunch of country bumpkins who rarely visit big cities and who are awed by skyscrapers and dress boutiques when we do halfway through i looked up the author's bio because i couldn't believe that someone who actually grew up in wisconsin would write wisconsinites as such unsophisticated simpletons who dream of having a dress that doesn't fit like a shower curtain i did enjoy parts of the story but it really went off the rails for me near the end where it just turned into a ridiculous show of idiotic machismo and male love i've never read hemingway but based on what i know of him i started to think maybe the author has read too much hemingway so you know if you like hemingway you may very well dig this but for me it was just men behaving stupidly in some attempt to re kindle their adolescence and the uncomplicated loyalties of adolescent friendships the disappointment is that that's a theme worth exploring but this didn't live up to the potential i wouldn't recommend this book but i would read nickolas butler again because i really do think he can do better than this with a little time and polish i hope the over hype of this debut doesn't lead him to rush his second novel because he would be better served taking a little more time to work on his craft the ideas are there he just wasn't quite able to pull them off","1228":"read my thoughts about nickolas butler's shotgun lovesongs at mylittleheartmelodies com","1229":"sweet and solid beach read bromance","1230":"three stars means i liked it and i did butler captures the relationships and confinements of a small town in wisconsin like the author and the fraught relationships there are four central male characters the singer songwriter who makes it pretty big the financier who moved to chicago the brain damaged member who is still part of the gang and the one who stays in little wing to farm nice writing i listened to it and i believe there were five performers the four men and the woman they all know and the farmer married the title comes from the songwriters first album","1231":"this is a wisconsin author and the book was about friends in a small community in western wisconsin there were midwest references that made me laugh out loud i enjoyed reading this book and am looking forward to the author visiting our waupaca library book festival the story focused on friendships in our lives and made you think about long time friends and how we relate to each other and the importance of good friends","1232":"i really love books where you stop thinking of the characters as characters and start thinking about them as people you know at times i had to remind myself that these people weren't actually my friends even though at times i wanted them to be i liked hearing from their different perspectives and learning that even the more questionable decisions made were never out of malice though maybe a touch of jealousy and i loved that each had their own distinct personality and set of values i never grew up in a small town but if they're anything like little wing then i really missed out","1233":"i loved this it's a gorgeous ode to small town life and to the midwest in particular i loved the characters especially beth several of the characters ruminate about the great passage of time and years but they are supposed to be younger than me not that young people can't ruminate on the passage of time or anything but it just felt weird these characters are supposed to be in their thirties i think but it seemed like they felt older in those bits which doesn't make any sense i liked the narrative switches although the voices are not terribly distinct overall excellent","1234":"i loved this book a lot of reviewers here that liked the book a lot seem to have come from small towns in the midwest i was born and raised in california have never visited the midwest and thoroughly enjoyed reading about the people and the place i like the author's style of writing so that you know what each character is thinking and feeling and how they differ from each other the story line was good and the book was easy to read i read it in just two days i would highly recommend this book","1235":"just an amazing first novel about a tight group of friends and their growing up over time unique to include to good bad and ugly of their lives and the complex way in which 'home' attracts and repels us throughout our lives having been blessed with a tyight group of friands from childhood and a memorable hometown i could totally relate to the authentic style of writing the characters and the plot moved along by the various voices kudos","1236":"describes the lives and fate of four male childhood friends one who stayed in the small town working his family farm one who became a famous singer one who has borderline brain damage one who moved back to the small town after a career in investment banking","1237":"received through goodreads firstreads program very much enjoyed this book the writing is tight characters were both interesting and fully developed i look forward to more from this author","1238":"being from the area of wisconsin where this book is set i feel like i have to give this book at least two stars other wise i might be kicked out of the state this book felt a little like an overwrought country song but it entertained me for 4 hours while on a flight so it wasn't horrible it just wasn't that great","1239":"i enjoyed this story mostly because it took place in wisconsin","1240":"if you are from a small town anywhere this is a must read one reviewer wrote that it was a book that made you want to call old friends and that is exactly how i felt","1241":"what can i say i wanted to like it and i liked parts of it but it never came together for me disappointed","1242":"a nice story but a bit unremarkable i have a feeling i won't remember much about this one 6 months from now","1243":"this is the story of four friends from a small mid western town in wisconsin henry is a farmer who has never left ronnie is a former rodeo rider lee went to chicago and made money in the markets lee became a well known singer who still feels a failure","1244":"set in the heart of wisconsin four unlikely friends go separate ways after high school always returning to the town that helped mold them an interesting adult read uniquely written from multiple first person point of views to help the reader gain multiple understandings of each characters' perspective","1245":"starts slow but so worth seeing through to the finish","1246":"well written story fun to try to figure out where in wisconsin his town is located","1247":"i enjoyed reading shotgun love songs the author captures small town wisconsin life with the complexity of relationships dialogues contain pretty tough language it is a very good fun and painful read that reflects friendship hopes and expectations outstanding character development with the main characters","1248":"butler's novel is really a love letter to his home town to rural life in wisconsin and the life long friendships between men it is a nice story of men from the same small town growing up together becoming their own men moving away changing building lives but still treasuring what they had as teenagers the bromance went a bit too far for my tastes butler writes from the perspective of 5 different characters but unfortunately all the voices sound the same only the heading of each section lets you know who is speaking now considering one character is a woman and one is supposedly slightly brain damaged their thoughts all sound startlingly alike this is what spoiled this novel for me really third person narration would have been better it reads like a movie and i read that the rights have unsurprisingly already been snapped up i am not someone who typically imagines actors when reading but in this case i could see who casting directors would want towards the end it felt as though butler was trying to make sure that each character had something 'dramatic' happen to them except the one female character of course what could possibly be interesting about her apart from one sexual encounter 10 years ago this felt a bit forced and the events seemed to get stranger and stranger again perhaps they would work in the movie version but reading them felt strange all in all there were parts of this book i liked life in a rural community passion for a home town family and friends but the writing really let it down for me it felt like a draft in need of some work thank you to netgalley for the arc","1249":"i was immediately hooked on this book the entire time just wanting to hang out at the vfw in little wing with this whole small town american crew it lost some of its steam and some of its legitimacy in the last quarter of the book so i didn't end up loving it quite as much as i thought i would still so glad i read it can i call it 3 5","1250":"great quick read about an area of the country that is familiar to me","1251":"really enjoyed this book the wisconsin angle obviously made it more appealing didn't know the lee character was based on bon iver until i was almost done with it","1252":"i really enjoyed finding a book like this i have never heard this book or the author i thought it was well written i enjoyed the characters and the story","1253":"that was one hell of an audiobook each character was narrated beautifully by a different voice and the end result is amazing superbly done shotgun lovesongs is a story about a group of friends in a small town in wisconsin though their lives have all changed drastically throughout the years one became a famous musician two got married one suffered brain damage and one became fabulously wealthy their lives still all intercept and the raw emotion and feeling that they all have is stunning a must listen or read hard to put down gritty real and heartfelt this novel has something to offer for everyone","1254":"i am primarily a nonfiction reader and that said i couldn't really get into the story i've seen this story in person after living in many small towns so i felt i knew where the story was going and it was a little depressing maybe i'll pick it up again later on in life","1255":"i really fell headlong into this book grateful that i had left in on my tbr shelf for so long it's been a hideous winter here in new england so a story like this can be an escape it is a simple one told about the lives of four friends and one of the excerpts shown here were right on the mark i tell my children when you are caught in a lie or when you do something wrong just stop don't make excuses don't keep talking don't try to explain yourself just own up to what you've done wrong when you do that things inevitably work out better you look and feel better more likely than not you also catch the other person off guard so eloquently put and so true enjoy the story","1256":"i agree with the review that said this is the kind of book that you want to pass on to a friend and tell them to just read it very satisfying","1257":"3 5 stars good read i liked the setting and the characters it is a story about relationships friendships written by a man which i think is why other reviews say it's like chick lit maybe so perhaps if you believe that relationships are the sole territory of chicks this book is not for you for me the setting and the diversity of class status of the characters greatly appealed to me i read too many books about rich or at least very comfortable people who live on the east coast and this was much more relatable and enjoyable for me","1258":"this was a fast read and i really enjoyed this story the book is set in a small made up town in wisconsin it tells the stories of a small group of friends i thought each character was well written and believable i look forward to discussing this book in my library book club and i would definitely recommend this one to others","1259":" there are five narrators in the novel all friends that grew up together in a small wisconsin town now adults in their 30s they look back on their relationships with each other their decisions in life and what might have been if they had done things differently each has their own story but the stories overlap and we see the same events from a different perspective lee is a successful musician a rock star he now travels extensively sees the world but still feels the pull back to his home town he envies his friend henry's life running the family farm with wife beth and their children but beth has a secret she had a brief fling with lee before she and henry were married they never told henry and she still wonders what life would have been like if she had stayed with lee kip has recently moved back to little wing after a successful career as a stockbroker in chicago he bought an old deteriorating feedmill with the goal of renovating it and turning it into a restaurant but things aren't working out as he planned he is running out of money and doesn't want to ask friends for a loan ronny worked the rodeo circuit until a drunken fall caused a head injury leaving him unable to work his friends feel it is their duty to watch out for him and keep him safe the story was pleasant flowed well and held my interest i enjoyed the setting and the depiction of small town rural life there was not a lot of 'plot' no twists or big reveals it was a slow and steady exploration of the friendship between four young men and their uniquely different personalities and life choices - and beth who had a relationship with each of them and while i could not relate to any of the characters personally their eventual realization that you can't bring back or relive the past resonated with me audio production i'm a fan of multiple narrators and in this book the use of a separate narrator for each of the five friends worked very well they did an excellent job in giving a unique voice to each character with just the right amount of feeling and emotion i recommend the audio to everyone - new and experienced listeners alike","1260":"i'm not sure if it is because it reminds me of my hometown or what but i loved this book it bordered on fluffy and sentimental but it never fully crossed that line instead butler presented me with lovable characters a real and subtle plot and a charming account of the midwest i couldn't put it down","1261":"a story about the evolving friendships of lifelong friends from a small wisconsin town","1262":"great story from a wisconsin voice the affect of the dialogue and the setting really make you feel nostalgic about wisconsin","1263":"my community selected this book for a village wide read and i'm glad because i wouldn't have otherwise picked it up the author handled the perils of a multiple narrator story well i never skipped one narrator's chapter to get to another which is what i normally do in books like this","1264":"although i am from wisconsin i could not relate to this book because it wasn't about my wisconsin and my experiences in this wonderful state it was an okay story it seemed slightly typical of what people's perception of wisconsin is if they haven't been here don't know anything about wisconsin and it made the guy from bon iver seem so sad","1265":"the writing was adequate but it was not for me i felt no connection to the characters and the plot did not intrigue me so i gave up about 50 pages in it supposedly takes place right near where i grew up but the characters' lives bear no resemblance to my own that's probably because i was a city kid and they lived in the country somewhere not too far from that city","1266":"a different style of penmanship beautifully told and very nostalgic","1267":" this book just wasn't as good as i wanted it to be i liked the idea of high school friends who have chosen diverse paths reuniting in their small hometown as thirty somethings and i don't usually read about male friends so i enjoyed that aspect too but i just didn't find the characterization very deep it seemed unrealistic for henry to hate lee for having a short romance with his wife beth it happened before their marriage and during a time when beth and henry had broken up i also found the climax pretty hokey the superficial characterization and far fetched plot device gave it a made for movie feel","1268":"i really enjoyed this book it made you think about small towns friendship love and community","1269":"i really enjoy when an author brings to life the place where he lives as well as the kind of people who live there shotgun lovesongs is that book it tells the stories of four really good male friends all bound to the place they call home henry and beth the farmer and his wife who contentedly stay on his family's farm their famous and internationally known musician and childhood friend lee sutton who always sends gifts but rarely makes it home for important occasions kip cunningham who has moved home from a lucrative financial career in chicago and who feels compelled to make his mark on the town to which he never felt connected and ronny who left school and rode the rodeo until too many bulls took a toll on his body the four men are likable and somewhat flawed characters lush descriptions of the land surrounding this town and the closeness of the townspeople paints a picture of a place that sounds like a nice place to live the manner in which the story unfolds reminds me of spoon river anthology not written in autobiographic poems as is spoon river the lives of the residents in little wing wisconsin are revealed in short narratives about past and present relationships rivalries that were not forgotten and a faith in the power of friendship however as the men move through adolescence and to adulthood secret pasts do not remain secret and how much can one trust friends comes into question as each of the men's families come together in this story so will they part but not unhappily they will simply move beyond little wing and the power of their friendship and memories will always bind them together i think the book will remind readers of their own hometowns and their friends whom they might see once every so often whom they might keep in touch with through an occasional christmas card or email but who when they do see each other can pick up where they left off years before a word of caution is also to those readers who might travel this same path it is best not to reveal deep secrets in the hopes of clearing one's conscience","1270":"i liked the characters in this book and i enjoyed that each chapter switched to a different character's perception of what was going on there were parts that were a little slow it took me a while to read it but overall i enjoyed it","1271":"i loved this book it is a look at small town friends where each chapter is told by one of the friends it is also a look at what success and happiness really is","1272":"i truly wanted to love this book it has all the makings of what i like to read parts of this novel are tender and brilliant yet parts are too flawed to be believable butlers writing is worth looking to his future books because he is extremely talented","1273":"well written story of small town friends who sometimes shine and sometimes let each other down forgiveness redemption and self acceptance","1274":"childhood friends from a small town in wisconsin leave home for work in other parts of the country returning home for a wedding conflicts arise well written story with great dialog and characters you care about the audio version is amazing different narrators for different characters and they don't just read the words they act","1275":"at times the writing is clever the story is compelling but the content is thin and about 3 4 of the way i began hoping the book would be over soon","1276":"there were parts of this book that i liked but i think overall the book would have been better served told in the third person there are 5 first person narrators in this book and after a while they all sounded the same some of the plot was overly predictable and a couple of plot points toward the end seemed to serve no purpose whatsoever","1277":" shotgun love songs is the story of five young adults who grew up together in a small town in the north of the midwest in turn each of them farmer henry wife beth broker kip injured rodeo rider ronny and musician lee tell aspects of the story of their lives loves and aspirations it is a story of four weddings and a near funeral as each approaches marriage in a different way and with differing levels of success while in the background a buried secret threatens to blow it all apart i got the feeling that the seed of the book must have been the author thinking that shotgun love songs would make a great name for an album and such a record made by lee is indeed at the heart of the book it is a very successful heart as butler pulls off the trick of giving the feel of a fictional work of art without going in to too much detail the closest analogy i can think of is the way iain m banks describes the game in the player of games without ever fully explaining the rules whatever i finished the book wanting to be able to download my copy of shotgun love songs this is a book which is painted on the huge canvas of the american prairies but in fact works on a very small scale the various crises faced by the cast are all small everyday ones about relationships children the desire to escape from a small town the need to return to one's roots there are no great earth shattering revelations no great scenes of violence no real sense of darkness or evil just ordinary people facing ordinary challenges if that sounds like an underselling it shouldn't do the fact that this is a straightforward story about believable characters is absolutely a strength there are enough books out there featuring psychopaths and serial killers to make this warm hearted little book a rather refreshing change while it is not a complex tale it is very skilfully put together i found the experience of reading it a bit like doing a jigsaw the full picture only appeared slowly as each chapter slotted into place and the final threads only joined up right at the end as well as providing an endearing set of characters i'd really like to meet these people butler is also a very fine descriptive writer in particular one section near the centre of the book where lee describes the changing seasons in the big country is absolutely top notch and it is right that lee is at the heart of the book one feels for the other characters but it is charismatic troubled frustrating lee who really gives the novel its emotional heft in tune with everything else lee's tale is a heartbreaking one but only in a very gentle sort of way if i had a criticism it would be that it veers somewhat in the direction of being a bit too folksy a bit too mom and apple pie but that is forgivable in what is basically one of the most feel good books without being schmaltzy books i've read in quite some time so in summary this is a really impressive debut novel which tells a gentle story which leaves you at the end with a smile on your face recommended","1278":"i thought this book was wonderful great character development and great writing style i look forward to his next book highly recommend","1279":"not great literature but an engaging read a slice of small town midwestern life amongst a group of 30 year old friends satisfyingly narrated by different voices sometimes a bit long winded and repetetive in its themes","1280":" butler wrote a debut novel worth reading he was born in allentown but grew up in wisconsin it is his description of this heartland and his exploration of the hearts of his characters that charmed me his palpable love of the land and his inclusion of details like the pickled eggs at the vfw drew me in as i read chapters alternately written by the main characters i thought about whether or not you can ever really can go home again an age old question but done in a uniquely interesting way high school buddies return home for a wedding and try to pick up their friendships all sorts of male posturing comes into play at their buddy's wedding thank heavens for hank's wife beth who adds a female voice to the testosterone bravado unlike hank who stayed in little cloud lee left and became a well known musician this character is supposedly based on butler's high school connection to the indie folk group bon iver some reviewers felt that you had to have this background to understand the novel not so for me i also liked the title's juxtaposition of gunshots and lovesongs for me it set up other contrasts in the story such as the earthy appeal yet harshness of the land the character excesses side by side with a yearning for the simple life there are no huge riveting events to anchor the book it's rather a slowly paced unveiling of pasts and presents told alternately by each of the main characters hank says to beth at one point i know you better than you know yourself and this i think is what marriage is all about i don't particularly agree with this thought but it's just laid out there for the reader to ponder simple prose simply stated there are times however when butler tries too hard to be poetic here i can hear things the world throbs differently silence thrums like a chord strummed eons ago music in the aspen trees and in the firs and burr oaks and even in the fields of drying corn i plan to read this author's next book ready to once again appreciate his unique nuanced voice just hoping for a little more editing of occasional overwrought language","1281":"i got snookered on this one i read about it on some book club website got five stars or something this is a movie of the week book and not a very good one at that formulaic tripe yuck","1282":"a gripping love story that touched my roots in wisconsin and made me home sick for the love i saw my parents share between themselves and their friends a book i couldn't simply read i had to experience it breathe it in and out and live with it for a while before i could let it go","1283":"having grown up in a town of 500 that is talked about in the book i completely relate to this book and love it therefore knowing i may have a biased opinion many reviews state that there is too much predictability characters are the same too much product placement however to me it was authentic visit west central wisconsin and you will know","1284":" a book about five friends and how their lives intertwine as adults each chapter is told from a different character's point of view and voice which can be difficult to pull off i'm happy to report that it worked well in this book it's really a love song to the midwest wisconsin in particular with beautiful prose here's one of my favorite passages that i had to stop and read to my mom just to be able to hear it aloud an eagle landed in the boughs of a huge cottonwood just across from us and we saw him and we were happy for his company then a crow landed on a huge rock in the middle of the creek and you might have thought it was his pulpit and we were happy to see him too finally a seagull blown about as far off course from any saltwater sea as could be set down on the peak of a tall white pine three such different birds and they forms a kind of quorum evenly spaced along the water before us we waited watched said nothing as they began talking to one another first the eagle gave his high whistling sound then the crow's gruff caw then the garish squawk of the gull back and forth they went never leaving their perches never interrupting one another each in turn how could it have been anything other than a conversation we watched listened and i could not tell you how much time passed before finally the gull rose up off the white pine made three lazy pirouettes in the air and then skimmed the surface of the river with one wingtip before disappearing over the trees like a ribbon dancer showing off beautifully written kept me interested the entire time some twists and turns and i had to run back to it after dinner to find out what happened","1285":"the thing that surprised me most about this book was how it made me feel nostalgic about being an american i'm usually in the we're loud obese consumers camp but this book helped me to remember how there are some great aspects to being a person living in this country but i wasn't crying or anything just some warm fuzzy feelings","1286":" i received this advanced listening copy from a goodreads giveaway i'm very excited to actually sit down and read the book but the actors did a great job bringing this book to life i am so impressed with nickolas butler's debut novel i loved the story i loved the characters i loved the friendships and relationships i wanted to be part of this circle of friends to me a good book is one that draws you in and won't let you go it's one that you're sad to see end this is a good book i highly recommend shotgun lovesongs and hope you pick it up i can't wait to read more from mr butler","1287":"there was a comfortable familiarity to this story that instantly had my attention and admiration it's real it's honest and it feels like home","1288":"a good start to a hopefully long writing career author clearly loves the midwest by the rendering of the small town the male characters are a little too too and the females are almost stereotypical but give it a whirl you won't be really disappointed","1289":"i really enjoyed this book the writing is compelling and lyrical without ever trying too hard the characters are well drawn even the minor ones with a deftness that is spare but perfect the book started slow for me but i found myself sucked into the lives of the characters and the wild of wisconsin with something approaching urgency as the book progressed i thought i would be sad when it was over but instead i felt a contentment and satisfaction that one does not often get when finishing a great book i felt pleased to have known henry beth lee and ronny and even kip and it makes me smile to think these archetypes are out there living good sometimes fractured honest lives thoroughly recommend","1290":"small town living with some who left some who remained but friendships endured easy and gentle read that i enjoyed","1291":" i am a sucker for novels set in small towns in this story we drop in on little wing wisconsin loved the image of the old men sitting in front of the mill passing the time of day and smelling of cheap cologne and halitosis the old vfw hall constructed of old painted cinder blocks was right on as was the ancient mahogany bar inside and the requisite oversized jar of pickled eggs really liked the comparison of the barren perfection of kip u0026amp felicia's house to henry u0026amp beth's home a place well lived in and loved it wasn't hard to imagine the pair of tired old cowboy boots resting just inside the door or the sound of mourning doves cooing outside in the early morning i found this to be an enjoyable story in a low key slice of life way you will have to look further if you want a lot of action but for the love and familiarity of friends and family you could do much worse my heart was touched when henry stated 'i love our home everything we need is right here 'this was a first reads audio giveaway thank you","1292":"may have just been the midwesterner in me connecting with this story but i loved it","1293":"if this is realistic fiction i don't know of such too many f bombs","1294":"this was a great sleeper of a book i loved everything about it","1295":"very well written coming into adulthood story","1296":"i liked the simplicity of his writing style loved the characters and felt i was with them during this story great story of friendship and life in a small town","1297":" the big chill revisited in wisconsin farm country entertaining yes fulfilling no near the end of the novel then it was cecil taylor's turn and he handed the maid of honor some money and went out to dance with beth he bowed deeply to her a thing i've never seen duplicated at any wedding and such a regal gesture you'd never have expected it from cecil the construction worker and skynyrd fanatic i don't know whether the cecil taylor reference was intended or not but it gave me a chuckle","1298":"i enjoyed this book very much i grew up in minnesota i thought butler's descriptions of winter yes a capital w were amazing as well as the portrayal of small town life it may be difficult for non midwestern non small town people to understand relate to little wing to understand for example how the vfw brings folks together but butler understands and writes it","1299":"well i loved this i finished it a few weeks ago and i'm actually almost done with the next book i'm reading because i am a person who can only handle one at a time because of how engrossed i get and i'm still thinking about this one my initial reaction when i read it was that i was actually kind of pissed because it was so good and i felt like yeah i'll never write anything this good it was the book i wanted to read you know and maybe every generation of people feels about the same when they're in their early 30's but it felt very generational to me that said i've also found myself kind of in love with these midwestern books lately most notably rainbow rowell i don't know if it's homesickness or just that i realize how much i identify and how specific an upbringing that is or what i just know i've been connecting with it i do like to read a variety of reviews just so i can think about all the criticisms and if i agree or not one of the things that kept coming up was that the author was name dropping and product placement ing i thought that was sort of weird i mean in hindsight i suppose leinenkugel and john deere and carhartts were all mentioned but it didn't seem out of place to me i mean my grandpa always called his lawnmower his john deere and carhartts are a pretty specific thing i guess you could make an argument about leinie's but why would you i guess it just really didn't bother me now on the other hand i think there's some validity to point that the characters were kind of cliches good ol' farm boy girl next door socially awkward rich guy homesick rockstar brain damaged rodeo with a heart of gold and it would've bothered me more maybe if a i didn't know those people and b that's all there had been to them as it was i found them to be extremely realistic in a subtle way before i mention a couple specifics let me also just say that i loved loved where the title shotgun lovesongs came from perfect now a few specifics so stop reading if you don't want to be spoiled albeit probably minorly i couldn't figure out for a long time what the story was about but i also pretty much didn't care was it friendship small town living dealing with your 30's something else and the answer was yes but it was also really about beth and something kind of like a love triangle but more like a couple of real considerations of what might have been if something had gone differently and for the record see what i did there part of what made this whole thing not a cliche was that you could see why beth would sometimes think about things with lee how her life might have been different but you also really got to see why she picked henry and that he was the right choice and the better man and not a decision she should regret i know people thought the ending was stupid but i liked it because sometimes friendship is stupid and it would've been really easy for the book to just let henry be a good dude and forgive lee or for henry to just write him off forever but those lifelong friendships are sometimes more complicated than that and sometimes less complicated i guess so i was satisfied with the ending i felt like the book went on for just the right about of time there didn't seem to be a lot of waste in it if that makes sense i had the right amount of everything and all the stories laid out in the book seemed like they needed to be there and when it was over yeah i could've read more for sure but it was enough and i felt like i had the perfect little snapshot of each life and their collective lives and that space and time and that seems like one of those things that looks really easy but is hard to do well and i was impressed","1300":"4 5 best contemporary fiction i've read since stoner","1301":"i did not love the ending but i did love most of the rest of it","1302":"finally i'm finished this was an audio book and since i only have a cd player in my car that is where i listened to this wonderful story i loved the characters and the setting i must say if this had been in paper form i don't think i would have loved it as much but the people reading it just made it come alive and it was great to get lost in the book","1303":"great story of four friends growing up in a small wisconsin town a favorite for the year","1304":"please read kent haruf annie proulx or david rhodes a wonderful voice from the same part of wi as nickolas butler and also an iowa writers' workshop grad for riveting depictions of rural small town life and characters butler can't touch them agree with so many other reviewers that 1 if you're going to employ various narrators make sure their voices are different 2 show us character through their interactions don't have the narrator tell us 3 know what you're talking about if you are going to depict a rodeo cowboy and a dairy farmer i was a bit disturbed by the similarities between rhodes's novel driftless and this newer one almost to the point of well let's just say both employ a wild animal venturing into human buildings both have a blizzard rescue both have a musician in a major role","1305":"a good easy read with some interesting midwest background","1306":" nickolas butler transported me to the small town of little wing and into the lives of beth lee henry ronny and kip the way an author rarely can these characters will haunt me a year from now two years from now i will forever wonder how they are doing what they are up to i felt their joy in my heart of hearts when my heart crashed to the floor i picked up the pieces along with them shotgun lovesongs will sing to you of life from the first page to the last i received this book for free through the goodreads first reads program","1307":"this novel was chosen was my local library book club to end the season i am giving it four stars mostly because it is not as interesting to me thematically but nickolas butler's writing is worthy of five stars it's both tender and raw butler can make you feel the emotions which i found surprising in their sentimentality and were still quite lovely at times those emotional expressions were even the highlights of the novel the theme deals with friendship four young men from a small town who grow up together and what they make of their futures and how their lives intertwine and affect their relationships with themselves and others i was not happy with the format of multiple narrators but to each one's preference it 'works' in showing individual perspectives of course and exemplifies how attitudes differ within this group of individuals the novel is never boring because of the good writing however the landscape of rodeo riders and country singers is not my area of interest yet i am sure many will love this novel for its craft and because of butler's subject matter it would probably make a nice gift for somebody's hubby or folks from the region of wisconsin for starters i just want to add that my favorite fella out of the four is henry he seems a bit too ideal but that just may be due to my own cynicism but i still admired him he is worthy of five stars plus","1308":"i have no critical distance so this isn't a review really i knew this guy grew up and taught in eau claire i'm proud to have known nick butler and am happy for his success with this novel","1309":" shotgun lovesongs is one of the best written books i've read in a while the characters and town come alive in the writing they feel real the writing makes you nostalgic for a place you've never been and won't really want to visit and for people you've never met heck they aren't even real the story is told by a group of friends who have known each other since elementary school ronny is a brain damaged but lovable ex rodeo star lee is a famous singer henry and beth are the couple destined to be together and kip is the small town big shot the story starts at kip's wedding but the story is really about growing up finding yourself while being drawn to the small town you always dreamed of leaving i was very surprised by how quickly i was drawn into the story and how quickly i feel in love with them i honestly didn't expect to like the book but i loved it it did fall apart a little at the end after a slow this is life beginning and middle there was too much action at the end almost felt unbelievable after such a great beginning while i said it was slow it doesn't feel that way it is just slow in the way that life is slow life doesn't happen like a movie plot this book feels like reading about a slice of life highly recommend it","1310":"good story liked how it was woven together everyone was likable and relatable","1311":" a bit of a rant before the review i've come to admit that i like a book with a story that carries me characters who act like you would expect real humans to act and one that elicits an emotional response and i want it written well as an english major four decades ago i read lots of book which rebelled against plot character sentimentality it was all about intellectual stimulation i think i understood and was challenged by a lot of joyce but i loved dickens nothing wrong with intellectual stimulation of course but fancy language tortured sentence structure slavery to style or breaking style and the need to prove that a work is intellectually and artistically stimulating in the end just bores the hell out of me i close those books and put them down now of course there are books that are written beautifully plotted well with strong characters and lovely use of language that are intellectually stimulating and that's the best of all worlds this is a damned good book it's got a great plot and characters written well with straightforward american english and it touched me i picked it up because butler lives in the town in wisconsin where justin vernon bon iver wrote for emma forever ago there's a character in the book who was obviously inspired by vernon the idea of reading about a long suffering musician who finds fame after holing up in his old hometown and then returning a star seemed an intriguing read it is it's about friendship family love and love of place i liked it","1312":"i don't know if i would have found this book on my own but i was invited to a beers u0026amp books book club meeting this tuesday this book is great kind of a modern day upper midwest catcher in the rye can't wait to meet the author","1313":"i really enjoyed this book first and foremost i must thank michael raleigh author of one of my favorite books the blue moon circus for suggesting it to me welcome to little wing wisconsin growing up myself in rural north dakota little wing could have easily been any one of the small towns near where i grew up i think the author did a wonderful job of capturing that small town feeling even down to the giant jar of pickled eggs that adorns most bars in the midwest i also loved the book cover with the water tower and old fashioned store fronts drive down any main street of a rural town in the midwest and you are likely to see the same scene shotgun lovesongs is the tale of friendship love heartbreak and betrayal and after reading it i am seriously homesick and feel like talking to my childhood best friend kaye i look forward to reading more from author nickolas butler","1314":"having grown up in a small midwestern town i really related to the characters and themes didn't want it to end could see it as a television show","1315":"too many swear words for god the story was charming the descriptions beautiful but overall not a favorite","1316":"i loved this book i grew up in a small town u0026amp so many of the things he wrote about reminded me of home it really made me miss my old high school friends had me thinking about what could have been etc it ended perfectly too","1317":"this isn't a type of book i normally pick up but it was recommended in some magazine i read and i'm glad i plowed through it i really enjoyed the small town references it reminded me of summers i would spend at my grandparents' farm where everyone knew everyone as a kid that wasn't a big deal but i could see as a young adult how that could be disconcerting the main characters in this story all grew up together and there are events throughout their lives that cause them to reconnect one has made it big in music another married a girl in their grade and farms while another moved to chicago and became a broker and still another rode on the rodeo circuit until he had an accident oddly enough while not riding the book examines their lives and each snippet involves points of view from all the main characters the book was a great change of pace for me there were times it really drew me in while there were other instances where i found myself skimming it's definitely a book about long lasting friendships and the trials we all deal with it was an overall decent read","1318":"this was a book to just breeze through enjoyable but not overly engaging the characters seemed just on the verge of depth just a bit more and they would be truly rememberable but i am not quite there","1319":"i love the way this story is told from four different points of view more of a character study of the four different narrators than a heavily plotted novel the writing is just lovely and the characters are very enjoyable three of the four narrators are men and my general thought of this book is that it's just like chick lit but about men","1320":"i loved this book when i finished it i felt like i was saying goodbye to old friends","1321":"liked the characters i'm from wisconsin so i could relate to a lot in the book good writing style","1322":"this was a wonderful book the story was written from the point of view of several of the characters this can be annoying in a book because the author doesn't seem to have the voice for some of the characters but in this book all the characters came alive for me and i was sorry to see the story end i look forward to reading more by nickolas butler","1323":"a very nice small scale domestic drama about living in a small town in wisconsin for fans of living in small towns in the upper midwest","1324":"love this story great tale of friendship and growing up and all the eau claire references were pretty cool","1325":"i recommend this book to any reader there is beautiful story development among a group of lifetime friends who have supported one another throughout their childhood and then we are treated to the experience of watching them develop in their adult years it kept me engaged and i was happy to have read it","1326":"bookseller erickirkus review noted that shotgun lovesongs will strike a responsive cord for any reader who has found his life reflected in a bob seeger song well i certainly related old high school buddies small town life dreams unlived heartaches and joys unimagined a beautifully written love letter to the mid west reminiscent in many ways to richard russo's best novels give it a look","1327":"liked the midwest rural setting as someone who grew up in a similar area i could easily relate the audiobook was great to listen to with new actors for each narrator but the story did jump between past and present quite frequently making it a bit hard to follow along especially when there are multiple narrators as well","1328":"this novel is about four young men that grew up together in a small town in america's heartland they are endearing and flawed which is part of their charm they had me laughing and cheering them on my only criticism is that a few scenes were over the top overwritten by the author this is butler's debut novel he has talent i look forward to seeing what he does next","1329":"parts of the book were 4 star quality but i found myself skipping over other parts of the book i read this book in a few days so it's pretty readable but there are parts that seem plotless or meandering overall it was an interesting view into male friendship and small town life i would read another book from this author","1330":"it's not a bad book i didn't get pulled in and feel that connection to any one of the characters that i enjoy in other books the book moved slow at times the author also jumped between the past and present a lot which made it hard to keep up at times","1331":"really enjoyed this book it's not fast paced or action filled heartfelt depiction of small town life family and friendship","1332":"loved this book thank you to my good friend who got me the arc","1333":"a midwestern love song except for the ending","1334":"decent writing stupid unbelievable story kirkus was right preposterous ending","1335":"wisconsin small town life friendships slow at times but small town life is slow much of the time","1336":"i adored this book the setting plot and pace took me so far away from my daily commute and from my bedroom into the lives of these ordinary people and their relationships showing that nothing is as ordinary as it seems once you look deeper a book i didn't want to end a book i didn't want to stop reading as the train pulled into my stop highly recommended","1337":"i received this book as an arc from the publisher sometimes you feel like watching a blockbuster movie like iron man and sometimes you feel like taking a timeout and watching an indie movie like nebraska or juno this book reminds of an indie movie it plopped me into someone else's life for a few hours the people who populate this book are completely different from my born and bred in los angeles lifestyle but that's a good thing since we only get one life it is nice to see how other choices could have turned out this book is about a group of friends from a small farming town in wisconsin it is about how your choices define what your entire life will be like and that one bad decision might lead to a lifetime of regrets i felt like i knew these people better than most of my friends at the end of this novel i was already missing the people within it i would recommend this book to anyone who has regrets about the decisions they made early in their life it would also be excellent for people who like literary fiction i'm sure we will be hearing more from mr butler as he has a strong writing voice","1338":" i was emotionally sucked into this novel from the first page here is a group of friends who behave like well friends they are close then move apart then get together again and find that they have changed or an old problem re surfaces etc for the first two thirds of the novel i believed that this is how a group of high school friends from a small town could go their own ways regroup bring in a new face from time to time leave again regroup again and on and on and i pretty much understood them that they were not perfect that they screwed up big time that they could be mostly kind and neighborly even when events were going a little strangely the draw of the hometown is strong for all of these characters it isn't my reality but i could get it but i thought that the novel began to fall apart in its final chapters as the male friends regressed back to adolescent behavior and the worldly musician blabs his feelings all over the place and the author seemed to loose the pleasant control he had in the first chapters i thought the ending was weak stupid even and way too sentimental but this author is good i know by reading the first part of this book and loving it that he can do better","1339":" i thought this was beautiful it's not perfect and i get the criticism of some of the other reviews but for me while i see flaws when i read it as a writer the overall effect lifts it to my favourite read of the year so far the thing i loved unusually for me it was the description and the language it may be the story of 5 friends as they reach their 30s but the biggest character for me was little wing the small town they live it i feel like i've spent a couple of days there even though i'm one of those people described in the book who doesn't even really know where wisconsin is if i was asked to point to it on a map disclaimer i'm from the uk and i do now because i looked it up i thought that was so beautifully done i wish i could write description like that i liked the characters and the story yes not a huge amount happens yes the 5 first person point of view characters were not especially distinguishable i'm not sure i totally believed in lee a world famous musician who seemed entirely unchanged by his fame or money it would be nice to think that there are people in that world who remain so down to earth but i'm not sure i was convinced but you know what none of that mattered it was a pleasure to read and it took me to another place that's what a five star book is for me","1340":"superb nickolas butler just gets it the characters the life stories the love stories life in a small town everything the story unfolds as each character speaks but it is so smooth like your turning from one friend to another as each takes a turn to speak when you gather over coffee or drinks when it ended i didn't want to leave my new friends but the time had come to say good bye","1341":" it's a book like hundreds of others nothing special really i got halfway through this audiobook thinking about abandoning it several times along the way but feeling like i should finish it since i won it in a gr first reads giveaway then it occurred to me that i'm going to die someday and that i should move on to a good book i'm giving my review based on what i've noticed of the first half of the audiobook so this is the story of a bunch of guys in their 30s who grew up together in rural wisconsin one of them grows up to be a struggling farmer one a struggling businessman one a failed rodeo star and one bon iver or a fictionalized version of bon iver who i've learned is not a group just a guy there are a couple of women in there but unfortunately the author can't write women struggling farmer is married to a woman who may have been in love with bon iver and may still be it doesn't really matter it's the story of a bromance it's sort of chick lit y but with guys in the main roles wasn't there a rita wilson movie that had flashbacks with her and her friends when they were teenagers or the yaya sisterhood only not so old imagine that but cast with dudes and set in the midwest instead of the south however i've read many wonderful novels about male friendships fortress of solitude comes to mind so i think the primary problem is that the characters just have no resonance we get a lot of information about their backgrounds but i still never felt they seemed real or cared what might happen to them the narrative is told in chapters from the perspective of each of the five main characters in the audiobook each character's chapters are read by a different voice actor most of them were okay neither adding nor detracting to the story with the exception of the rodeo guy he's described as having suffered a brain injury a gentle soul and hot with a chiseled body unfortunately they chose to cast a guy with a voice like artie lang to read this part totally took me out of the story to have what sounded like an angry new yorker reading shouting these chapters the different first person narrative doesn't really work in this book mainly because all the characters sound the same have the same inner voice the woman character is absurd and some of the language just doesn't sound authentic coming from these characters as they're described the attempts at poetic flowery language is kind of embarrassing the rich rich manure but ultimately nothing very interesting happens in the plot there are a couple of tense moments but not as tense as they could be this book wasn't terrible it was mediocre but like i said i'm going to die some day i can't waste time on books that are just okay there are way too many great ones out there","1342":"i won this for free from good read first reads hope mixed with drama and a little humor on the side is how i would serve up the description of this book","1343":"this book was wonderful maybe it's because i grew up on a farm and in a small town but this really caught my attention and kept me interested the entire novel","1344":"loved this big hearted midwestern love story as much for it's characters' vulnerability as for its clear adoration of wisconsin which i share a predominantly male perspective is refreshingly offered without all the violence u0026amp mayhem that so frequently accompany that choice my husband enjoyed the book as much as i did there is a tenderness the author evokes for his characters that reflects the genuineness i associate with small town wisconsin so glad i read this","1345":"a very sweet well described story i felt i was in the small town with the characters this novel was a nice break from reality","1346":"i really enjoyed this book until the end where it felt like the author just dropped the ball and left it there in the middle of nowhere","1347":"i won this book from goodreads thank you it took a while to finish this book not because of the story but due to lack of down time on my part this is a heartfelt book about success and hometown roots friends life long friends love and real it is so true to life makes you think about your friends friendship life in general a very thought provoking book and a wonderful read","1348":"i was not planning to read this book then a friend posted a video interview with nickolas butler on her fb page and i fell hard for his voice reading the first lines of the first chapter so i caved this quiet unassuming novel about friends in rural wisconsin grabbed me from word one i have been there seen those farms sat at a table in the vfw driven down the main street smelled the hay felt the bitter cold i was left feeling that i had been in the corner watching these friends as they lived their lives made their mistakes and found what they had lost this is not a novel for the reader who wants big or action or mystery or vampires or kink it is for the reader who wants to feel they have known those people or been in that place a friend who read it said it felt like a the big chill and he was very right this is one i will read again","1349":"from james i'm familiar with the term lad lit but i don't think i've read any until shotgun lovesongs maybe i still haven't a quick look at wikipedia says lad lit aka fratire is a satirical celebration of traditional masculinity this isn't satirical it is about the endurance of friendship between men with one major female character in the mix lovesongs is more literary but still feels comparable to what i think of as chick lit and i'm not using that term pejoratively chick lit implies certain expectations common literary devices and that's this book if nancy thayer or judy blume wrote a book that took place in wisconsin about 4 men it'd probably be a lot like this i suspect there's a lot in this book that a lot of readers can relate too small town life never leaving that small town and or leaving and coming home entanglements of a small town and the closeness and or isolation that can result anyway i enjoyed the book butler's a good writer of characters and places you care about and maybe it's not a book just for men as a side note if you haven't seen the movie beautiful girls starting timothy hutton you should for some reason that movie and this book remind me of each other","1350":"truly enjoyed this one it made me a little homesick even though i am from indiana and not from wisconsin","1351":"great depiction of small town life maybe i'm biased after living 4 years in a rural illinois farming community but i really liked this the only thing that was slightly less than fabulous was the set up 4 guys who were friends in a rural town become internationally renowned musician high paid broker farmer and recovering alcoholic former rodeo star could 4 young men be so close and have their paths diverge quite that far","1352":" cd unabridged fiction this book hasn't come out yet so i don't want to give too much of the plot away i will say that it is just a novel not a thriller murder mystery or as i say no vampires and she wolves it is about a five people in a small town in wisconsin two have stayed behind got married and are farmers the other three go away but always find a way back there is some comedy and romance but it is mostly about people and how they grow up and when i say grow up i mean mature and grow up in adulthood yes there is an unevenness to the book but that is the way life is narration when i saw that there were five readers i was weary because usually more than one reader takes the listener out of the moment it worked really well in this book all the readers do a fine job of getting into character i like ronnie the best because he got hit in the head once too many and just doesn't care pov i liked the pov it reminded me of the ruins my favorite book and how one character will harp on a moment in time and the another barely mentions it the bi factor i saw some reviews that are saying that is book is about bon iver it is not while the author grew up in the same town as bon iver he only used a small fact in iver's life iver did have issues and recorded two albums in rural areas with no engineers in the book that fact is only inspiration because the album shotgun lovesongs is recorded in a chicken coup during a long cold winter not giving anything away here you find that out really early in the book the character of lee is more like a rock version of keith urban the only problem i found was that the book ended for two of the characters but not the other three when i saw where i was on the discs i was thinking there might be another one i missed nope it just kinda leaves the other three out in the cold i do recommend this book i listened to it while doing my lunchtime walks so it was about 40 minute increments i did find myself looking forward to listening to it everyday i did receive this book from goodreads for an honest review","1353":" shotgun lovesongs is a love letter to the heartland of the united states if bruce springsteen wrote a book about people living in wisconsin this would be it an unabashedly straightforward american story that is thankfully devoid of any jingoistic rhetoric or chest beating chants of u s a u s a it is a strikingly honest and intimate window into the lives of four childhood friends who grew up in little wing wisconsin and how they struggle to relate to each other as they age into their thirties and at the center of it all the hub around which the spokes rotate is a woman named beth who has affected each of their lives in a significant way including marrying one of them what impressed me most about nickolas butler's writing was how quickly i became familiar with the main characters from the beginning these were people i'd known my whole life people i've worked with gone to school with met at family functions henry ronny lee and kip are all crafted with such realism that it's hard not to immediately relate to them as these childhood friends age they become jealous of each other's success become aware that they are changing as people and struggle to adjust to married life their intra personal dynamics are at once commonplace and fascinating in a peek over the neighbor's fence sort of way there is no plot usually i find a lack of plot to be a hinderance with characters wandering aimlessly for reasons unknown but with shotgun lovesongs a plot would seem to only get in the way it would seem contrived because the book is a view into the personal lives the sex lives and the friendships of contemporary midwestern americans there is no need for a plot the most impressive part was how well butler was able to write from a woman's perspective when he steps into the voice of beth henry's wife it sounds and feels like a fleshed out three dimensional woman there is no superficial talk about nail salons getting your hair done or bitching about co workers the chapters written in beth's voice are authentic full of worries about raising children maintaining finances and whether or not she is fully in love with her husband or if she still has feelings for one of his closest friends this type of romantic confusion is what gives shotgun lovesongs its bruised but still beating heart none of the characters are presented as having answers to their own problems they question their spouses struggle to get over old flames and fracture lifelong friendships over revelations of things that happened over a decade prior in short the book is full of the quiet truths and silent sufferings of the modern american family marriages that falter when people change through the years financial fronts that are bent to the point of breaking jealousy over the perceived successes of one's peers repressed romantic feelings that still bubble just below the surface and the balance of raising kids while still maintaining one's individual identity when set against butler's gorgeous wintery backdrop of the northern wilds shotgun lovesongs is an easy book to fall in love with you will feel welcome with the main cast sitting atop old mills and throwing rocks at the passing trains you will feel a sense of belonging and wonderment as you amble down icy backroads talking about everything and nothing and if you listen close enough you'll hear the music playing in the sunset and maybe everything will make sense if only for a moment","1354":"great to read a novel on men friendships as they run the course of life i recieved a copy from goodreads","1355":"slow start but great","1356":"somewhere between i liked it and i really liked it the story was about four guys and it was written by a guy but somehow it all came together feeling pretty girly kind of like sisterhood of the traveling pants for the quarter life crisis generation","1357":"beautifully written and great character development you really love them all by the end","1358":"nicely told story of a small town group of friends in rural wisconsin moving depictions of loneliness fear of failure unrequited love what it means to be married success","1359":"an outstanding book about friendship and tight community binds that bind communities together an outstanding book from this first time author","1360":" audiobook performed by ari fliakos maggie hoffman scott shepherd scott sowers and gary wilmeshenry kip lee ronny and beth henry's wife have known each other since they were children growing up in the same small town of little wing wisconsin all but henry who stayed on his family's dairy farm have left for a time beth went to college kip worked as a commodities broker in chicago ronny rode the rodeo circuit and lee is a hugely successful folk rock musician with a number of hit records now they've all come home to little wing kip has purchased the old feed mill with plans to turn it into a destination in that corner of wisconsin ronny his rodeo career ended after he suffered a traumatic brain injury is looked out for by everyone in town lee has a recording studio in the converted schoolhouse on the outskirts of town where he comes home to recuperate after a tour this is a distinctly midwest novel butler writes prose that is poetic and atmospheric his descriptions of the landscape make this fictitious town an important character in the novel the october air filled with corn dust enough to make each sunset a postcard with colors like a benign nuclear explosion and then snow snow to cover the world to cover us our world left to sleep and rest and heal underneath those white winter blankets the forests that in october threw hallucinogenic confetti at the world now withdrawn bereft composed and suddenly much thinner looking like old people who know their time has just about come more importantly this is a novel of friendship and of men growing to adulthood each of the characters including beth has a chance to narrate so the reader gets some insight into each of their inner thoughts and feelings the ways they interpret one another's actions and why they react as they do the reader also has the opportunity to hear their observations on the others in the quintet it seems that the central relationship being explored is that of hank and lee - best friends despite their very different lifestyles loyal to one another without question loving one another despite a major falling out kip seemed to me to be nearly an outsider his concerted efforts to leave little wing and be a big shot in chicago has changed his perspective in such a way that he doesn't seem able to fit in whatever effort he makes just misses the mark and seems to come only from his own need to be recognized rather from any genuine concern for his friends or the community as the only woman with a voice in the novel beth provides an interesting counterpoint and it is through beth's eyes that the men's wives girlfriends are shown and then there is ronny - my favorite character in the group a handsome strong man with an injured brain an alcoholic kept from drinking by all his friends who seem to do nothing but consume alcohol he longs to get back some independence i want to break out of here so bad and i don't even know where i want to go maybe anyplace i guess i know they think i can't take care of myself but i sure as hell can i'm not a smart man - i know that - but i ain't dumb and the way things are it's like i'm in a cage ... i am a man i'm a goddamned person and i'm restless as hell my heart just breaks for him highly recommended for readers who enjoy character driven novels the audiobook employs five different performers - each taking on one of the major characters i found this very effective it really helped to make each of the men unique and having a woman voice beth's chapters lent a quality of gentleness and femininity to an otherwise tough and masculine book","1361":"4 5 stars this debut novel makes me appreciate growing up on a small town where friendship is meaningful and home and family mean everything i honestly fell in love with the characters the storyline and the beautiful honest writing of the author great book and i highly recommend","1362":"an entertaining audio each chapter is told from the perspective of a different character and read by a different person it's not a dramatization thank goodness and extremely well done the story was rich and suspenseful i am very glad this audio was recommended and loaned to me by my trusted audio advisor greg","1363":"great well written novel about a group of friends who grew up together and deal with the changes that happen when you grow up between those friendships and between themselves reminded me of the types of friendships that pat conroy writes about but more succinct","1364":"nice quick read i enjoyed seeing each character's perspective","1365":"this was the most beautiful soulful book i've read in a very long time the audiobook is extremely well performed by a cast of narrators who capture the essence of growing up and trying to find yourself in a small town highly recommended","1366":" cheese curds \"shotgun lovesongs\" by nicholas butler is one of those novels whose characters just seem to walk up to you look you in the eye and embrace you the storytelling style is first person narratives of each major character addressing the reader as \"you\" which lends itself to an intimate confessional relationship between character and reader we readers become one of the gang henry lee ronny and kip who have been friends since boyhood and henry's wife beth who all live in a fictional little town in rural wisconsin called little wing you can get cheese curds at the local fast food place cheese curds sigh nothing brings back wisconsin to me like those two words my father grew up in a small town near madison and i spent part of each summer there it was idyllic we children ran and played all over town in and out of relatives' houses we walked downtown to the drugstore for ice cream cones and sodas everyone knew we were the lins grandchildren even when we didn't know who they were what a change from our life in houston wisconsin is as beautiful as butler describes it i've just read two crime novels that are set in small towns that do not reflect well on small town insulation and xenophobia so it was utterly refreshing to read a novel that is a \"love song\" about small communities and \"home\" there is a reason they call it the \"heartland\" but even in a perfect bucolic setting people's lives are messy these characters are now in their mid thirties and life's natural failures and disappointments have begun to appear in each life the \"in bad times\" and \"forsaking all others\" in their marriage vows are not just abstract concepts any longer while there were undeniably touching and heart wrenching parts of the story i can't imagine another novel where the climax revolves around a giant jar of pickled eggs i had so much fun reading about these people \"shotgun lovesongs\" is a quick read not just because of the intimate storytelling style but also because we readers are compelled to keep turning the pages to find out what happens to these friends who have suddenly come to matter us","1367":"i actually liked this book more than i thought i would it was picked for our book club by a friend who thought we needed a lighter read for this month well it was but it also is very well written and easy to read","1368":"great characters particularly ronny lee and beth some wonderfully descriptive scenes that ring true for me as someone who grew up in a small rural town in the midwest it took me awhile to get hooked by the book but in the end i was walking down the sidewalk reading it","1369":"friendship love marriage fame the notion of what it means to be home in this gorgeous atmospheric novel butler writes with such clear eyes and with such a big heart this is a novel i will be recommending a lot this spring","1370":"looks like i'm in the minority but i loved this book the way the author perfectly discribed love had me in tears and sharing exerpts with my husband a man who resembles henry these characters people real to me will stay with me for quite sometime","1371":" 4 5 stars this book has been everywhere reviewed glowingly side note one of the best covers ever and it did not disappoint it centers around four childhood friends now adults who grew up in the tiny town of little wing wisconsin we have henry who stayed in wisconsin to raise his family and farm kip who went to chicago to become a commodities trader i loved how he used his connection to farming in little wing to do this former rodeo star ronny who has experienced a head injury that makes him a little \"slow \" and then leland who has become a famous musician henry's wife beth also narrates i loved the shifting narrative the feel of the small town the bond these men share and the secrets they've kept many of these characters have major struggles but the quieter ones are as keenly felt if not more so i've been slammed with work and with my own book coming out next week but last night i had to sit down and read the last 200 pages in one sitting i was so invested in the characters bonus as it turns out and i had no idea until the acknowledgments same editor as mine a thoroughly enjoyable read and i adored every minute of it every character not for everyone this is a specific type of book but it was right up my alley","1372":"wow did i like this book even though it is set in wisconsin i'm from minnesota i'd like to expand on why but we are discussing this book in book club next week so i don't want to spoil that","1373":"very american straight forward writing nice story of five hometown friends told by them separately chapter by chapter not lyrically written and without complex psychological characters just plain hometown lives with enough to make it a good read","1374":" in a word awesome i can't recommend this novel enough a powerful story about the wildly differing lives of a group of 30 somethings who all grew up in the same small town little wing in wisconsin there's henry the farmer who took on his family's farm marrying his childhood sweetheart beth kip the mill owner who never really fit in and his wife felicia ronny the rodeo king and his stripper girlfriend and lee the famous singer dating famous actresses but who is never happier than when he's home the story follows this unlikely group of friends through weddings divorces secrets from the past and several heart in the mouth moments and does so wonderfully the characters are beautifully imagined vivid and engaging the natural wild world ever present and so evocatively described that you can almost feel the bite of winter in your fingers and toes and the dust of summer in the back of your throat i fell in love with the characters and feel bereft now i've finished reading the book a truly wonderful read","1375":"this novel is a beautiful love song to the midwest it's slow sweet and sometimes sad but with real characters you wish were your friends i enjoyed this novel and was sad when it ended","1376":"i adored this book so much i read it twice back to back i plan to read it again in fact i randomly selected this title out at target on my lunch break started reading it and finished the next day the author apparently is from the same hometown where the book is staged as justin vernon aka bon iver so that definitely let caught my attention he said the main character wasn't entirely based on vernon but have similarities regardless i kept imaging eddie vedder through the entire novel wonderful wonderful wonderful","1377":"about 4 guys from a small town and the different paths they took supposedly about a woman too but of course she is a completely secondary character to all of the amazing men read sarcasm here she is the beauty that they all covet typical misogynistic story disguised as a beautiful tale about four friends clearly this author is a man's man and is in love with our society's definition of masculinity found that hard to swallow","1378":"i can't say i've read too many books set in wisconsin but this one really gave me a feel for the area a great cast of childhood friends who face various challenges in their 30's","1379":" an engrossing and spectacular story of five people in their early to mid thirties navigating their lives in a small town in the mid west told through first person perspective each character is unique and defined and well thought out i really could not stop read this book since i picked it up 30 hours ago parts of it reminded me of philip roth with the narratives ability to start in one place but end up in a completely different place yet it does not meander or trail off or cause you to wander from the text great great book","1380":"loved the characters and the story","1381":"a good 3 but a 3 nonetheless beautifully written the plot line only got interesting in the last 100 pages or so a little summer read not a wild page turner","1382":" the thing about small towns is that while people continually extol their virtues of community the one thing that most young people want to do is to escape from them and so it is with this wonderful novel about four friends set in a small wisconsin farming community hank never has left staying in town and working his family's dairy farm but the others have all headed out into the wider world ronny on the rodeo circuit kip to the commodity markets of chicago and lee into the wide world of fame as a rock singer the fifth character in this story is beth who grew up with all of them and married hank but still arouses deep feeling with the rest of the friends especially lee they are all reunited about fifteen years after high school for kip's wedding kip has become wealthy and pretty insufferable ias a commodity trader in chicago and has returned home and bought the abandoned feed mill and turned it into a commercial venture with varying measures of success ronny is also back home due to an accident that happened after a night of hard drinking that has left him fit for little other than living off lee's charity and lee the boy who made more than good is back in town for the wedding along with his glamorous movie star fiance the four still share the bonds of childhood friendship but things have changed between them with the passing of time and as the story plays out we see them at their best and the worst as they deal with joy heartbreak jealousy and forgiveness as they evolve from boyhood pals to true adult friends the location here too plays an important character the lush wisconsin farmland with its cold unforgiving winters is just as important a character as the human being who inhabit its landscape this is a brilliant book","1383":" before diving in i should note that i grew up in eau claire wisconsin which is the neighboring city of the fictional community where shotgun lovesongs nickolas butler's debut novel takes place community and a sense of place are such important themes in this book so you could say that my heartstrings were adequately tugged throughout not only from the novel itself but also from mundane scenery building paragraphs like the one describing the evolution and slow decay of the businesses along highway 53 the book resonated in a familiar comforting way that matched the narrative arc so i'm probably a bit biased in its favor the book tells its story by cycling through the perspectives of a handful of friends who grew up together and went their separate ways as they got older but always remained tethered to each other and to their hometown the pace of this book was slow but it almost seemed intentional when you spend all of your time with a small group of people in a small town it isn't necessarily about what happens it's about how alliances among friends wax and wane how trust is built lost and rebuilt and how you get to know your friends better than you know yourself the big star who made it out of the group of friends is lee a singer songwriter who in my opinion too closely echoed real life local hero bon iver justin vernon everything from the pseudonym he uses on tour to hiding out in the woods to lay down the tracks of his debut album to the scraggly beard to the part where he transforms an abandoned building in town into a music studio you forget for a moment that you're actually reading about a fictional character that quibble aside the conflicted and lonely portrait of lee was very affecting as was the goodness for lack of a better word of henry whose presence and embodiment of the community jumped off the page you could envision the warm meaty calloused handshake of a guy like henry within the first 20 pages modest is the word that keeps coming to mind when trying to encapsulate the book but that word isn't quite as laudatory as i mean it to be it's modest and spare in its plot and language in a soothing way with an occasional surprise or melodic turn of phrase in a sense the book is a lot like how butler describes being married to someone for so long or being someone's best friend for so long \"on those few occasions when they surprise you it feels like the biggest thing in the world like a crack in the sky like the moon suddenly rising over the horizon twenty times bigger than the last time you looked \" every time i opened the book i felt like i was walking back into a small town bar and it probably makes sense that such a bar is the setting of the last scene a place where nothing really happened but for some reason i kept coming back always seemed to enjoy myself and welcomed the occasional authentic moment that reminded me why i was there in the first place","1384":" this is an entertaining while not super technical story that is rumored to be and i've talked to the author so i know there is something to that loosely related to baroque pop star wikipedia's term justin vernon who is best known as the front man of bon iver i love his music and admittedly that back of mind thought probably earned an extra star from me google blood bank for a sample as a story it was your somewhat typical coming of age through adulthood love story in this case there is your expected love triangle but it's also a story of friendships questions of how our lives are molded by fame failure insecurity greed and the like he's a crafty author and i enjoyed the wisconsin rural setting worth a read","1385":"my husband and i listened to this together on a holiday road trip at the recommendation of a friend it was the perfect mix of friendship and love story and small town for me with mostly male characters to keep him interested we liked the characters they were well developed and complex believable we loved the narration","1386":"pompous and pretentious not a good story but decent writing","1387":"the structure of this book is built around a series of weddings that whole conceit was pretty boring author spent too much time describing the wrong things characters induced a lot of eye rolling i felt touched by the ending though so maybe i enjoyed this book more than i thought","1388":"really enjoyed hearing the perspectives of different characters and loved that it was based in wisconsin had a hard time putting this book down","1389":"this book captured me right away and kept me going it is the story of 4 men who have grown up together in a small town and come back together later in life where all of their stories intertwine again i loved how butler has the story set in the present but almost seamlessly takes you back in the past to give you more details on the lives of the men it has themes that should resonate with most readers a strong story that focuses on friendships and what they mean to us","1390":"fantastic reminds me of kent haruf captures small town america beautifully","1391":"i loved this book loved it i don't even feel like summarizing the plot and characters and what worked for me and what didn't i just loved it and not even in a can't put it down way i actually liked savoring it spreading it out over the course of a few sittings sometimes after one of those sittings i would just feel good in general grateful happy for the people i have in my life how my life was going the story made me feel like the things i worry about are both appropriate and yet nothing to lose sleep over all at the same time i can't even say why that is but it did i didn't realize it had been overhyped i knew next to nothing about bon iver going in still don't really and was never bored i can see how it's not for everyone but this book was just so damn comfortable i will definitely go back to it again someday","1392":"if your 16 or 46 and looking for a good cry this is for you quick read a sweet but sad story @ teenage cancer and teenage love","1393":"so wonderful to read a book set in sw wisconsin the small town becomes a character in the book this is a first novel the guy can really write he spins a fine yard and the main characters feel very 3d very real these are four guys who grew up together now in their thirties you see books about female friendship but seldom about male friendship frankly i was disappointed this book had to end","1394":" heartfelt very well written ode to small town american midwest and lifelong male friendships the imagery and characters are very well done and the wisconsin setting appealed to my midwestern roots i spent every summer as a kid in small town wisconsin and i'll attest people really are that nice pure wholesome i loved the hero worship of lee the resident rockstar who returns home and believes in the small town and its residents this is a quiet book of the bonds between 4 men from little wing wisconsin the rockstar a former rodeo cowboy career cut short due to injury a farmer who married the high school sweetheart and a chicago commodities trader but it still moved quickly for me as i grew to love each of the characters and became so invested in where life led them great portrayal of the bonds between men loyalty and family that a small town breeds told in shifting viewpoints my only critique is that the voices all sounded the same actually sometimes hard to remember which character you're reading particularly when 2 love the same women the female characters namely beth and felicia were well done and i would have loved more time with them oh one more critique hated the ending and i'd almost round down to 3 stars for that completely abrupt as if he suddenly ran out of paper disappointing when i would have loved to hear more not the kind of book you'd expect to have a sequel but it ended that way still highly recommend full of heart and american roots","1395":"another truly enjoyable novel quick fun read great character development of people you really get to know and love coming of age story about 4 friends born and raised in a small midwest town interesting and different for me because the main characters were men","1396":"4 5 starsthank goodness for book clubs many times you're reading the same books that everyone is raving about not that that's bad but every once in a while you end up reading a book that you would never have made the time for on your own and discover an absolute gem that's this book go get it and read it you won't regret it","1397":"an easy read made me laugh at times","1398":"having been raised in a small town i found this work of fiction to be especially impressive all my friends moved away from the small community with farmlands all around it all of us had different careers with success an f b i agent professor professional baseball player ceo's cfo's and many other vocations but one stayed and worked his family farm that had been tilled for generations we were all brought back for a reunion because of lifelong bonds established many years before i was surprised when i went back and found the small town had shrunk to almost no town for some reason i came back to the small town to try to breathe life into it we now have a four star general who also lives here and recently placed put his museum here that has been featured on national tv which brings me back to this amazing work that i thoroughly enjoyed there are spirited full of life interesting and strong characters in \"shotgun lovesongs\" reading it was like coming home again renewing friendships of long lost friends finding out how complicated life has become i felt i knew the people in the novel and found new friends we can never get enough friends can we i hope you get a chance to experience the nostalgia of small town living and the wonderful people who grew up in america's heartland lean back in your chair wolf down some food if you want take a sip of wine the stars are out and the milky way is overhead take a chance and read about a small place on earth and the characters who lived against a backdrop of stars jeannie walker award winning author","1399":"i'd give this book 4 1 2 stars i loved it it is really well written and i enjoyed reading a book that is set right where i live even without eau claire as the setting though i'd still enjoy the book i read so many books about women it was nice to read about relationships between men the characters were very real flawed yet admirable and i felt like they were people who could live right down my street i highly recommend shotgun lovesongs","1400":"it was fine i don't enjoy reading 3 f bombs in one sentence it adds nothing to the story and actually detracts imo it wasn't bad at the beginning of the book but by the end it was","1401":" i loved this debut novel and i thank bookerpoter com for sending it to me the rich detail the author uses to unfold this story and to describe the wisconsin farming landscape pulled me in immediately this is a tale of a rural way of life a farming community where neighbors help each other and know each others past history as they do their own this author carefully develops each character even the character that i first thought pretentious and shallow beings to emerge as full of self doubt and loneliness longing for connection and acceptance this is also a tale of male friendships that begin in childhood and endure through the struggles of early adulthood and though those early bonds are stretched and fragmented the reader observes the slow mending and resurgence of friendship and love this is also a tale of a marriage of envy and compromise this is a book that will stay with me for the wonderful realistic characters as well as an engaging story","1402":"i received this book for free through goodreads first read i really liked this book almost heart breaking at times","1403":"shotgun lovesongs may not have you on the edge of your seat as you tear through chapter after chapter but it's a moving and bittersweet novel about friendship and growing up read the full review on nightsandweekends com or listen to the audio review on shelf discovery","1404":"an \"ain't that america\" story about four longtime friends in small town wisconsin as a midwesterner i probably should have liked it more than i did it's a quick read with a big heart and while it goes down easy it doesn't exactly fill you up i expect a film version any second now","1405":"this book was an unexpected good read written from the point of view of four characters it takes place in rural wisconsin i normally don't choose books about farmers and rodeo stars but this book was exceptionally well written and i couldn't put it down","1406":"involving story centered around four very different weddings of four guys who grew up in small town wisconsin nice look at male friendship","1407":"butler layers the lives of young men grown into fast adult friends who are changed through growing up different goals and desires different career paths widely different errors in judgement i like a small town setting maybe more than a big city there is less anonymity available to the characters perhaps that's why murder mysteries take place in big cities the better to hide the deed my dear and butler takes full advantage the loving male friendships are the best i've read and there's one fully formed marital love that's so solid and satisfying i found myself rooting for it to weather the story's storm all in all a satisfying read","1408":" i just finished the audio book and thoroughly enjoyed it so much so that i immediately looked to see if there are other books by the author as audio books go i thought this one was particularly well done with multiple readers maybe it's because i grew up in a small town in the south not midwest but this book resonated with me the descriptions of the rural farming area quirky characters often found in a small town and stories of growing up with the same kids from birth to high school graduation rang true and made me a little homesick but most of all i enjoyed the author's turn of phrase i recommend this book","1409":"i think i'd really give this a 4 5 it's not one of my all time favorites but it is so much better written than all the mystery novels that i like and give a 4 having some of the story take place in eau claire made it interesting to me as well","1410":"loved loved loved this book an easy summer read wisconsin small town 5 good friends including one rock star as they've grown up and discovered their foibles and true friendships","1411":" 3 5 being from a small town i can never resist these types of books butler's lyricism and sense of atmosphere are fantastic just a few parts didn't quite ring true to me for a town of just 1 000 people i've lived in one and also beth's narration seems a bit irrelevant as she's not a very dynamic character and mostly served to move along the male friendship storyline but it's great to read a thoughtful nuanced book about male friendships to begin with so that's not really an issue i look forward to reading more of nickolas butler's work","1412":"the story of four grown male friends from the small town of little wing wisconsin one never left and three moved on they reunite for a wedding in their home town it was refreshing to read a story of male friends with lifelong bonds what made it more enjoyable was the small town farmland setting very nice book","1413":" you can read my entire review and click links to book here on my blog here we are going http herewearegoing wordpress com 2 shotgun lovesongs by nickolas butlerfull disclosure i've an unreasonable irrational and slightly preposterous grudge against those authors who've attended the iowa writers' workshop and those writers whose debut novels are the subject of bidding wars and sold to filmmakers and those authors who are published by particular imprints one of which is st martin's press -- even though i know it is now a subsidiary of one of the five publishing behemoths and means virtually nothing -- still these things incur in me enmity resentment even i am ashamed to admit malice and rancor so it is the bad luck or good fortune of nickolas butler that he falls into all of the above categories shotgun lovesongs is mr butler's debut novel begun during his study at the iowa workshop published by st martin's otherwise known as macmillan publishers and -- dammit to hell -- it's awfully good you ought really to go here to mr butler's very own website where there are links to reviews about the book and author profiles this debut novel is an orgy of bildungsroman about a group of friends fated to tight knittedness by the nature of small town american life the novel has been heralded as a throwback love story absent the snarky irony of so much modern lit and it's true lovesongs - on its surface - limns an unadorned tale of the various trajectories and machinations of this group of friends as they head for a the pile up slam demolition derby of early middle life wondering and wandering that results in the question \"how much choice did i really have in this me i have become \"be warned this wandering and wondering is the tale of america abstracted using the town of little wing as microcosm too little wing's large looming never much used long neglected and now nearly disastrously restored mill a town guarding sentinel which characters frequently ascend gazing over the town whilst thinking and conversing deeply about \"life\" or to consider hurtling themselves to the ground serves as symbolic center for the decline and fall and shoring up of a world meant to be portrayed as worth keeping worth living in worth returning to worth staying for i'm not so sure of that premise told by a quintet of first person narrators this is a love story not so much between two people -- though there are elements of romance -- but rather one of those love stories that occur between groups of dear long friends who survive the ups downs nearnesses distances changes petty and not so petty grievances and betrayals and manage to discover that they are forever joined forever bound a soul family having lived long enough one learns that becoming family -- truly accepting the foreverness of such a bond -- comes only with the accumulation of courage enough to accept what is there is a great deal in this novel about forgiveness the journey there but forgiving is only the first step in becoming one with another or others -- forgiveness still implies judgment whereas real acceptance is born of a unity beyond judging it is a matter of being able to live with the \"all that is\" of those others and knowing they will reciprocate these people come together and go their separate ways and re unite and stay and leave and love and cheat and disappoint and betray and apologize and literally take a bullet and suffer brain damage and near freeze to death for their troubles they are rich and poor and talented and not so much and famous and unknown and -- the gamut of a particular white hetero privileged world that is spending a lot of time nowadays wondering why it isn't all it was cracked up to be not quite what they were promised but still and all the while little wing remains at the center of who they are dammit yes it does forgive me my snarky irony i really did like this book mr butler really is a gifted prose stylist but the central conflict between three of its characters struck me as a soapy sort of conceit i can't get all excited over who had sex with whom and who told whom in the sort of bro code way that causes relationship implosion in the last half of this novel i get the whole \"it was a betrayal not to tell me even though it wasn't technically cheating\" thing -- but i think it's an idiotic demeaning patriarchal throwback a opposed to justification for behavior so -- when late in the story a man with a gun showed up -- i was hoping he'd have better aim then again mr butler went to iowa workshop and sold the movie rights and is all the rage and i'm on top of a mill of my own thinking about jumping so read the book decide for yourself","1414":"an enjoyable book with plenty of characters to root for but i felt the writing style was patchy some passages were lovely clear and sharp in other sections it made me wince a little at the cliches drinks were 'nursed' the town was 'abuzz' and girls looked 'resplendent'","1415":"to be fair i listened to the audiobook it was a mazing in my humble opinion i enjoyed that the story was told from the perspective of each of the main characters and that it wasn't all men or all women but a mix of the 4 male friends hank lee kip and ronnie and beth i think anyone who enjoys a feel good laugh out loud story will enjoy this novel","1416":" i have to say that i was suitably surprised by this book because it impressed me usually i approach fiction written by local authors as something to be wary of there are few i've read that i've liked i typically find a trite story with some characters who are all too stereotypical and lame references to local distinctions that was this book too in some ways but it was so much more than that the characters felt real the feelings and situations universal and this book could have taken place just about anywhere but it didn't take place anywhere it took place in a little town just like mine yet situated on the other side of the state i was somewhat disappointed in the anti climactic climax but i can forgive it that because it was an otherwise enjoyable read i'm impressed mr butler you get to join the extremely short list with only larry watson on it of wisconsin authors i'll pick up a second book from","1417":"i enjoyed this quick read it really grabbed my attention in the begging and just held me my attention throughout the story however i felt like the ending was thrown together real quick like and left a few strands dangling the ending felt rushed and i feel such a disconnect with some of the characters' ending stories that i couldn't even give this a 4star rating it's going to sit with a 3 for me","1418":"this book was like a mix of edwin arlington robinson and larry mcmurty in my opinion like richard cory meets the last picture show i have no idea why i was reminded of richard cory but i was this book is about four men henry lee kip and ronny who have been friends with each other and devoted to their friendships since they were boys it is written from the multiple viewpoints from each of the men and henry's wife beth this book is filled with weddings but i think the real committment is between the four friends they are friends for richer or poorer in sickness and in health for better or worse some of them are better friends than others but these men have an unshakable bond that is tested between the pages of this story all four men are vastly different from solid and dependable salt of the earth henry yuppie business man big city dreams kip damaged pure of heart rodeo cowboy ronny and fey dreamer musician fringe dweller lee yet maybe this is their strength i loved the midwest setting while i am not from wisconsin i am just over the lake in michigan and the descriptions of their lives and locations were so familiar i have sat around bonfires drinking beer with these people visited these landscapes walked down similar streets butler's descriptions were dreamy and evocative if sometimes just a little too much i really really enjoyed this book the only thing keeping it from straight up love is the end i hated the end it was bad and disappointing it wasn't enough to keep me from hating the book though i still really liked it and i told my husband he should read it too overall this book is definitely worth reading you just might hate the end","1419":"i didn't think i had room in my heart for another wi writer besides michael perry but i guess i do","1420":"probably my favourite novel this year i hadn't read any reviews for it before buying so the flow and the way the book is put together was definitely a surprise wanted a good american story and this one gave it to me","1421":" four and a half stars a group of close friends have grown up together in the small farming town of little wing wisconsin though some of them have moved away and had various successes they all seem pulled back to their roots and each other in this moving and bighearted novel each chapter is told in the first person of different members of the group which i found to be perfectly effective in communicating to the reader i loved being able to get each friend's individual thoughts feelings details and opinions getting inside the minds of each character really made the book more heartfelt and emotional i noticed some reviewers commented on the similarity of the friends voices being too much the same as if they all had the same voice and were not different enough yes i do agree that there are similarities but they all grew up together in the same teeny town they all lived very parallel lives and shared many of the same experiences in the same place naturally they will speak think closely right i thought everything was believable and was personally very drawn in to each friend and the plot it is obvious that mr butler has spent lots of time in wisconsin himself his detailed perceptions of the landscape seasons and people can only have come from someone who is in love with the place this book is all heart and soul and i was hooked from the first chapter the only reason i didn't give five stars is because when we get the female first person our author almost got it right but not completely sometimes beth had a thought or feeling that wasn't quite on target it was a very good effort but not quite for real that being said this story and the people were captivating and i loved it from beginning to end i will keep my eye out for nickolas butler in the future","1422":" sometimes you read a novel at just the right time in your life and it resonates immensely that was the case with butler's debut but even if this hadn't been the perfect novel for the perfect time it's still an incredibly good read -- my favorite of the year so far it's about a group of childhood friends who return to their small town wisconsin homes it's told from the varying perspectives of the characters as we see how their pasts inform their present relationships to each other and others it's a novel about loyalty and love and it's effing fantastic highly highly recommended","1423":"this is a story of 5 friends told through alternating pov's the story flows seamlessly through the various points of view i enjoyed the rhythm of the story don't really know how else to describe it each of the main characters is fully realized and multi dimensional it is primarily a story of male friendships and thus would be called chick lit for guys i consider that a compliment that gals would also enjoy it is heartwarming small town tale","1424":"i was torn between a three a four star rating ready its a seven out of ten for me at some points i really liked it then at other parts i found my self thinking about doing the laundry","1425":"okay 4 5 but so perfect and such a great tale of friends in the midwest","1426":"3 1 4 stars ran a bit long winded in places showed some promise but didn't quite deliver","1427":"shotgun lovesongs is a well done ode to small town wisconsin living and friends you grew up with the ones that move away the ones who come back childhood sweethearts new romances and the friends you can always forgive no matter what's happened between you good for book groups and solo reading","1428":"great read full of honest and universal experiences the mark of a great novel fantastic first book nick i look forward to your next","1429":" just great storytelling about a group of high school friends and the changes in their relationships as they get older it is a sentimental and poignant story about ordinary people in ordinary lives made extraordinary in the telling told in interesting first person narratives of each major character addressing the reader as \"you\" which lends itself to an intimate confessional relationship between character and reader these characters are multidimensional and every detail the time location and events of the story are finely wrought and realized in the end butler manages to say important things about growing up and what that means and maybe about america itself audio version is great performance of the readers is just very enjoyable favorite quote i tell my children when you are caught in a lie or when you do something wrong just stop don't make excuses don't keep talking don't try to explain yourself just own up to what you've done wrong when you do that things inevitably work out better you look and feel better more likely than not you also catch the other person off guard","1430":"i think i was expecting to love this book more i liked the characters enough but i wasn't invested enough and at time i was wishing it was edited down a bit overall the small town and the struggles each character went through was well written i liked the alternative perspectives in each chapter but i think it also led to not enough development in some characters","1431":"this ws enjoyable to read but i was hoping for more","1432":"i really wish there was a 5 star option because this wasn't quite a 4 however since i read this in only a few days despite being buried in the crush of tax season i'll round up it was an satisfying novel that explores the adult friendships between five friends who grew up in a small wisconsin town there were some flaws but overall i enjoyed the complexity of the characters as well as butler's writing style","1433":"i loved all of the characters in this book perhaps b c they are all right around my own age i love they way he explored how relationships and friendships change but at the core there is something about being back in your hometown that defines you","1434":" i scored an advanced copy of this one so thought i would share my views the writing first off reminded me very much of east of eden only in the midwest the author went to school with bon iver and it shows as one of the main characters is also an indie rock superstar who has sold millions of albums but that part of his life is not imperative to the whole story what's imperative is this book reads soooo much like real life it feels authentic and gritty almost uncomfortably so because this could be me or you or someone we know set in the midwest farming town this story is told from a few different perspectives but all friends who grew up in the same small town some left some didn't some escaped some didn't some came back but it's their everyday homegrown american story and definitely worth a read","1435":"loved this book explores complex relationships especially among a group of male friends you don't often see bro mance being explored in fiction as openly as butler manages to do here the rural wisconsin setting also charmed me no doubt because it brought me back to my own roots in a rural midwestern community where everybody knows everybody and things are sometimes a little too close for comfort","1436":"liked style of writing ending was a bit disappointing bit cliche","1437":"more like 3 stars i liked this book partly because i call a northern place with very distinct seasons home as well something not understood by all and i just liked the dialogue and genuine characters even when the story went a little off the rails at times","1438":" disclaimer i received a free copy of this book on netgalley from the publisher in return for an honest review authornickolas butler was born in allentown pennsylvania and raised in eau claire wisconsin he was educated at the university of wisconsin madison and the university of iowa writer's workshop his work has appeared in ploughshares the christian science monitor the kenyon review online narrative the progressive and many other publications along the way he has worked as a meatpacker a burger king maintenance man a liquor store clerk a coffee roaster an office manager an author escort an inn keeper twice and several other odd vocations he presently lives on 16 acres of land in rural wisconsin adjacent to a buffalo farm he is married with and has two children reviewi saw this book over at river city reading where shannon wrote a lot of good things about this book i fell for the cover in one go the atmosphere was just jumping from it reading the synopsis got me even more enthusiastic for this book so i was really happy to get approved to review it it was not easy to put this book down the book is told from multiple points of view but i could not care less though this is usually one of my pet peeves the writing is very engaging and though the different voices were clear the story flow never felt interrupted there are a lot of things happening in the book things that happen in a group of friends secrets being revealed due to circumstances still the book does not really have a big bang which made it even more real for me though the characters are all very different i did not really have a problem connecting to all if i have to choose one who i had a bigger problem with it was kip but i did feel we missed out on a lot of information on him for most of the book which is the only thing that disturbed me a bit some of the information comes to the story late explaining decisions or reactions that happened earlier that made me very angry while reading them i felt some of the characters did not really get a fair chance to prove themselves before the end of the book","1439":"note this book was won from giveaway i want to give this 4 8 stars to be brutally honest i did not want this book but i entered the contest for my friend who really want this book lucky i won it and the original wanter has not gotten around to reading it and i figured might as well read and review it as it is a part of commitment to the giveaway contest and to catch up on the pile of first read books i sat and started reading what i thought is going to be a rather dull reading as it is not my kind of genre to read i started around 2 3pm in the afternoon ended up finishing the book by midnight in a near one sit session moved to bed to wrap it up not a single distraction or calling of video games and tv lured me away from this book lo and behold the book has me in a solid grip i was able to image the setting very well characters were interesting and fun to follow every chapter is different person point of view denoted by simple initial of the pov character's name ronny has to be my favorite character the book is about a group of friends living together for a long time and each of them have their own wanderlust moments of bigger dreams and only the little town that kept bringing all of them back together the emotion and the love for the hometown described in the book does makes me miss my little hometown village of 1300 people as i live in a city of millions if this is your kind of genre its going to enthrall you seeing how this book had me in a good solid grip and did not let up until i finished it i have added his name to my authors to watch list the book's that damn impressive to reach out and grab this non genre reader's attention","1440":"boring not recommendable shouldn't buy a book on the spur of the moment","1441":"a lovely book it reminds me of the landscape of wisconsin where the book is set it rambles along fertile and green it seems simple yet there are characters and you get to know each one in depth and i loved them all i just finished it and miss them already the author weaves a tale of lifetime friendships with each character taking a few chapters so you get different viewpoints and a chance to get to know each one they act as a chorus they are lines of a song that create a harmony and at times discordance read it well written filled with the love and heartache of life farming friendship and love thoroughly enjoyed it","1442":"i really enjoyed this book it was a recommendation for a goodreads friend anyone with any kind of link to the midwest would probably like it","1443":"overall it was fine for an obligatory read wi connection u0026amp the whole bon iver thing but a little too on wisconsin close to home to really rock my world","1444":" i made a split second decision to take shotgun lovesongs on a plane ride instead of one of the other 3 books on by bedside it was the right decision i read the entire book in one sitting and i am tempted to go back and read it again set in a small town in wisconsin shotgun lovesongs tells the story of a tight knit group of high school friends who find their way back to each other after successes and failures on their own it's a story about the the unconditional love of friends the boundaries of friendship and forgiveness i really enjoyed reading it","1445":" i read shotgun lovesongs on my kindle during a long weekend vacation in tampa bay it was great it's light reading and is mostly a character study of a group of friends that grew up together in wisconsin the descriptions of the characters and their relationships is very engaging each chapter starts with a letter signifying which character is in the first person h for henry l for lee b for beth and so on that is an interesting device to stay in the first person voice more tension more interesting but still have an ensemble novel the weakest part of shotgun is the ending the last quarter of the book or so gets very plot ty also i'm all for cliche but i could have done without the stripper with a heart of gold character he he qotd we'll have to rush henry said the liquor store closes at nine then rush i said shotgun lovesongsoh one last thing great new word narthex an antechamber porch or distinct area at the western entrance of some early christian churches separated off by a railinggood read yow bill","1446":"i liked this story of friendship and people growing up and making the right choices","1447":"excellent book i llove the way he writes i feel like i know the characters and i have always wondered about the people who you grew up with they help define you and there is a bond like no other this got me to thinking about my childhood friends loved loved loved this book","1448":"actual rating 2 5 i read this book because of all the glowing reviews by respected writers i should have known better the author went to the iowa writers workshop and these folks all write glowing blurbs for each other with that said the author does write beautiful descriptions but it still did not make rural wisconsin that appealing the first half of the book was somewhat interesting but the plot evaporated into unbelievable nonsense about half way through","1449":"rather slow plot but a good book about friendship i enjoyed it","1450":"such wonderful characters i could not decide who i loved most wonderful snapshot of old time america too","1451":"narrated in part by five childhood friends from a small mid western american town 'shotgun lovesongs' introduces us to a small band of characters that we all can relate to whose loves and fears and hopes are our own this is a story of love and friendship of heartache and hometown a book that is lyrically descriptive but deceptively sparse such that the heart of it there in raw aching abundance leeches out from the pages emoted by osmosis it is a clever writer that achieves that level of connection with me i felt like a husk of a person when i finally put it down but i also wanted to drink a few beers with it and stay up 'til dawn playing records i wanted to make it a mix tape it broke my heart but i couldn't bear to let it go this book reads like cradling a fallen bird - it is delicate and tragic but there is warmth and heart and hope i am so excited by debuts this good it is perfect as it rightly claims for fans of chad harbach nick hornby michael chabon and john irving nickolas butler is a superstar","1452":"i enjoyed shotgun lovesongs very much i think butler captures the feeling of small town middle america i spend quite a lot of time in butler's wisconsin and his portrayal feels right to me i also enjoyed his use of shifting points of view giving us more than one version of the story's events at the beginning i did not find this strategy very effective because a couple of the men's voices sound nearly identical they need a few verbal ticks to distinguish them on the other hand i thought he did an excellent job creating a voice for beth seeing how well he did this i think the book might have been even better with another major female character that said i would still highly recommend shotgun lovesongs michael r","1453":"very enjoyable light summer book from the summer reads shelf found at the library","1454":"wi author","1455":" 3 5 starsi liked it i really did i enjoyed the characters and the writing but towards the end i felt i was missing a story though there are many stories this is the telling of the current lives and the memories of 5 friends 4 men and 1 woman who grew up together in small town wisconsin each character is well developed and the stories are enjoyable to read there's even some suspense thrown in i never hesitated to pick it up there were times i hurried back to it and there were occasional times when i couldn't put it down and yet as i neared the end it just seemed to be missing something","1456":"3 5 stars review to follow","1457":"easy listen good not great","1458":" okay i'm going to stand alone in saying i wasn't crazy about this i thought the subject matter would resonate setting wisconsin farmland characters high school friends post high school but i found the characters cliched and the sentimentality maudlin and undeserved like he wanted me to cry at a scene but i just wasn't nearly invested enough in the characters or their implausible situation critically acclaimed as a lovely american novel and a tribute to the heartland i'm just not buying it actually i did buy it but i quit","1459":"this is a wonderfully simple novel about the friendship between four guys and one girl who all grew up in the same small wisconsin town it's dialog is very authentic nothing is perfect when you've know someone from the time of their youth until far into adulthood it rang true to me sometimes sad but real this is a very quick and engaging listen","1460":" this book caught my attention right away because it is based off of a fictional version of my hometown in wisconsin i didn't know what to expect from the story only that i was intrigued by the fact that i might find some comfort in a familiar wisconsin setting i was pleasantly surprised by this novel the language throughout was simply beautiful even if you have never seen the beauty of wisconsin's farm land you will feel as though you are right at home in this book just as i did shotgun lovesongs is a story about real life real friendships real challenges and real love i enjoyed it very much and would recommend it to anyone who is looking for a refreshing take on small town life","1461":"the midwestern landscape and sense of place resonated with me but the characters felt like cliches and the author struggled to differentiate their voices","1462":" i picked up this book because the of the title and the cover art i was drawn to it immediately i just had to read it once i began reading the story pulled me in too i loved all of the characters henry was my favorite this book makes you feel like you are home and these are your friends i want to have them over for dinner this book was all about love and that's always nice to read about love endures the descriptions of the small town were great and the obvious pull the town has on its people is evident little wing is home the bonds of friendship between these men and one woman were strong which i loved reading about it is not often where you read about men having these kinds of thoughts feelings and relationships it reminds me that men are people too ha of course maybe this is a theme in many books just not ones i apparently read that much actual rating 3 8 stars","1463":"i enjoyed this book part of the reason is that it takes place in part of wisconsin where i spent a good chunk of my life and that usually adds to the enjoyment not so sure that i am wild about using the first person of the major characters in the telling of a good story","1464":"fiction","1465":" i became so totally immersed in the lives of these four friends and the women who come into and sometimes out of their lives that i didn't want the book to end the author invokes the simplicity and dare i say purity of rural life in western wisconsin the four men grew up together and though they almost all have left for careers elsewhere trading in chicago kip rodeo riding ronny and professional musician lee henry has stayed to run his family's dairy farm married beth and is helping to raise their two children each of the other three return to little wing to recoup energy renew creativity or reinvest in the local economy marriages happen and sometimes end the story takes place over years and also flashes back to their early years of friendship one thing i liked about this book was the language the descriptions and the pacing also i felt that the author captured the essence of friendship where our friends fit into our totality of relationships how those relationships and friendships change over time as people and circumstances and priorities change this book was heartwarming sad empathetic and loving about place and about people little wing wisconsin is one of my new favorite places","1466":"this book was incredibly addictive compelling but i'm not sure how i feel about it still chewing it over","1467":"great piece of americana got to meet the author","1468":"i really enjoyed the small town setting maybe living in wisconsin makes this a little subjective the ending i'm sure had some deep meaning that i missed i could have done without it","1469":"i love this book the authors lyrical yet relatable language and characters populate en enviable setting funny fun real","1470":"i really love this book it's a first novel and i hope the author has many more novels in him","1471":"in a small town several young men and one woman live out their lives simply with some secrets some issues and some good writing thrown in the main characters an aging rocker a family man and his wife a man who suffered an accident and a man who doesn't know his place in life all live in wisconsin the characters are well developed and intersting and the book was an overall good read","1472":" this novel set in rural wisconsin and following the lives for five childhood friends who have all taken different paths in life but ended back in little wing the town of 1000 inhabitants where they grew up is the sort of book that i will always pick up and while it was an enjoyable read it wasn't a novel that blew me away told from the point of view of each character henry a farmer and his wife childhood sweetheart beth lee a musician supposedly based on bon iver who went to school with the author kip a commodities broker who has returned to refurbish the town's derelict mill and former rodeo star ronny the book begins with kip's wedding and follows each character through a number of life events that are coloured by their past and in turn help shape them moving forward butler's writing was on many occasions almost poetic particularly in his description of setting and the characters' individual voices were distinct and believable but having read a number of similar tales with similar characters this one wasn't anything amazingly special close to a 4 star but not quite","1473":" not a review just some comments but since a book can't be centered around anything i'm compelled to put in a few remarks for whatever reason very few writers are able to get musicians or write for me a believable character or describe the creativity and lifestyle very well at all and while butler didn't completely win a prize he did a fairly decent job with his musician character i suppose this difficulty dancing about architecture is why so many novels are filled with aspiring or famous photographers and painters and writers for me this book's success came from its sense of place and butler's depiction of wisconsin obviously a place he knows and for whatever reason loves and a book that takes me to a new place so vividly can get away with a lot i felt like i was looking out the windows driving down the roads and for me the caliber of that writing made up for some of the not major but there nonetheless flaws in the book in terms of the other characters and plot problems soapy at times which others have covered in their reviews not that i'm gonna jump in my car and move to wisconsin but decent job here with the musician character and the rough life of the declining family farm which he actually handled pretty well and the good and bad sense of small town itis sticky tablecloths in the diner and all i'll watch for his next book and read it","1474":"maybe it's because i recognize several of the characters in the town i grew up in but i really enjoyed reading this book","1475":"4 5 stars first i must say that i received an arc of this book through the goodreads giveaway program and i am very thankful that i did shotgun weddings leland lee corvus tells us are those where the groom has a shotgun usually from the bride's father to his back the weddings arise from an event usually pregnancy and are hurried and unplanned shotgun lovesongs arises as a hurried unplanned musical recording due to leland's love for his best friend's soul mate a hurried unplanned recording that makes leland famous the world over this along with other examples set the stage for a novel about a group of friends now in their 30's and their interconnected lives in the small town of little wing wisconsin population approximately 1 000 their is an old adage that says authors should write what they know and certainly this is what nickolas butler in his debut novel has done here but one could also say that you should read what you know there is a sense of comfort for me in reading this book as i too grew up in a small town much like little wing in rural michigan i read this book in one day while my life doesn't exactly exemplify the characters in the book i found myself seeing pieces of my life and the friends i have from home at many points in the novel my life isn't like theirs though none of my closest friends moved back home after college and i'm certain if you asked them none of them would return yet like the characters in this novel my small town has the same gravitational pull that sense that this is always somewhere where we can be ourselves and share a common bond in butler's novel many of the central characters leave return and some leave again yet they will always remember little wing and their life there as home at 34 i still call my small town home when i have not lived there since i was 22 years old interestingly i found myself drawn to the themes of time and age in little wing time seems to stand still and yet for those that never leave little wing they are the oldest characters of the book henry and beth seem much older much more aged by time than kip or ronny and especially aged compared to leland i have been trying to decide whether butler intends to show us that small towns age us in a way that other places cannot or if he is merely trying to show us the varying maturity levels of those in their 30's i suspect a little of both like the characters in this book i see my friends that have children have been married for several years and while sometimes i think they have it all figured out i also think how tiring and permanent that life must be whenever i go home to visit i feel old in chicago among so many single 30 somethings with no responsibilities except maybe to a select few i never feel the sense of my age weighing down on me nickolas butler left my a bit nostalgic for the life i have in my own small town a small town i will visit next week and will be instantly welcomed to as though i never left i am thankful to butler for writing such an honest portrayal for those of us that understand the intricacies of a small town life and the unorthodox relationships and bonds that are forged from such an upbringing i did not realize before reading this novel that this was a book about the musical artist bon iver justin vernon to me that would not have made any difference as i don't listen to bon iver the story stands tall without that knowledge especially for those of us feeling a bit homesick from time to time appreciative we always have a place to call home","1476":" an interesting look at a group of friends from their time of growing up together to all meeting after so many years later some are still living in the same town others went on to make a name for themselves one couple is letting their friend an ex rodeo star who got severely injured live on their ranch and still a few others are still jealous of the girl who is now women as they were when they were in high school this is a very good story at a look at can you go home again at least with the idea of how some people have changed and some are still trying to grow up i thought this to be a good book well written and the characters seemed real i got this book from net galley","1477":"i loved this book not because i live in wisconsin not because i have a connection to nick's wife i started reading the first few pages when i had it sent off to be signed and could not wait to get it back because i couldn't put it down i fell in love with the characters and wanted to have them as friends i love sarah addison allen's books and this was like a male version of one of hers set in the north it's about friends relationships and nostalgia loved it","1478":"loved the writing and butler knows how to develop a character but going after a novel this broad reaching and self contained is taking a swing for the fences the rock star character felt extremely deus ex machina designed to test the character of the rest of the cast in general the well to do lives of two of the characters detracted from the small town feel i think he was going for you can have big stars or real people but when you try to combine them it can get unbelievable quickly i get that that was the point but it just wasn't quite there","1479":"excellent book a book that makes me nostalgic for my childhood and contemplative about the future that we could all have had","1480":"it's larry mcmurtry meets billy lynn's long halftime walk and it's wonderful a love letter to friendship to life in small town wisconsin to promises kept when it comes out in march get this book if you live in los angeles get it at vromans","1481":"great title and fun read about long friendships","1482":"a glorious and heartfelt homage to childhood friendships and small town america absolutely loved this book","1483":"i won this by way of first reads i read this in just under 4 hours just finished it moments ago it was a good novel midwestern i grew up and currently live in minnesota so imagining this small town was almost too easy for me i just have to open my door and a drive a few miles to the nearest small town the characters were believable it was just a good coming of age in your thirties novel i read from various places and from other goodreads reviews that this sort of follows bon iver justin vernon and that the author went to high school with him i did listen to bon iver and the civil wars while reading and it was a perfect background noise to the novel","1484":"a true representation of wisconsin along with an amazing story of friendship","1485":"i really liked this book about five friends who grew up in rural wisconsin there were so many sweet and touching things about the story and the characters it was just lovely the ending had me in tears and was absolutely perfect for the book my only complaint is that i don't think the female characters were written in a believable way most are just supporting players so they weren't fully fleshed out by definition but beth was a main character i feel like she seemed more like a man trying to speak and think like a woman than a real woman in her point of view chapters but i think it only really stands out because butler got so many things right in the book the men felt so real the friendships were absolutely believable and the small town and love of home felt right because of this the fact that beth's voice seemed off stood out to me as a false note in the hands of a lesser writer where everything else things didn't feel so spot on i might not have noticed as it stands i think the book would have been better served by eliminating the beth chapters and just sticking with the story of the male friends but all and all i really enjoyed this sweet quiet story of friendship and home","1486":"enjoyed reading this book from beginning to end i wanted the characters to become my friends and see and adventure into their town little wing","1487":"this book was very good i enjoyed reading passages from the book and then pausing to ponder the emotions of the characters it's not often you read books that deal with male friendship jealousy and envy this was a book written by a guy primarily for guys any guy who ever had the hots for his best friend's girl can relate to the emotions of the characters we like to think life can be simple and easy but this book shows basic human emotions can complicate matters","1488":" 2 5there is an ebb and flow to life this book follows the lives of four friends in small town wisconsin - they succeed they fail they sometimes drink too much they love they fight they leave they come home they know who their friends are even when they don't like each other very much in the moment mirroring most lives this book is not action packed or full of major plot twists it is an endearing and touching or as we say in the south - sweet one note each chapter is told by a different character sometimes it can be confusing i turned it into to a game to see how well i knew the characters and how quickly i could figure out who was progressing the story","1489":"beautifully written novel about growing up and living in a small town in wisconsin","1490":" this book is about love friendship and finding your place in the world which is no easy task for anyone rich or poor urban or rural smart or simple man or woman it is about how we relate to each other the land and modern culture it is solidly midwestern and i am glad to see that readers and critics appear to be hungry for this story about a part of america that still inexplicably flies under the national radar i thought it was a good debut not great there is something about it that seems underdeveloped the book is very much about belonging but it's also about freedom and the tension between the two henry leland ronny kip and beth are all childhood friends who belong to little wing wisconsin and to each other they all go about growing up in different ways getting rich traveling the world following the music farming the land when the tension between their past and future hits crisis point henry seemingly the most solid among them suffers most unfortunately the resolution to me is very superficial henry beth and leland attempt to patch things up in what seem to me to be rather outrageous and stereotypical ways the book ends with some macho bonhomie that while amusing might have worked better had it been coupled with moments of deeper introspection","1491":" there are a million things i loved about this book from the writing and the storyline to the depth and honesty of the characters' troubles and successes but my favorite part is that butler does an incredible job of creating three dimensional characters several of his characters are in all honesty portrayed as brutal stereotypes in most books whether it be an alcoholic rodeo man who didn't have much formal education being portrayed as \"less than\" or a musician portrayed as a jerk butler however not only kicks aside the stereotypes but he actually leans in the opposite direction by taking greater care with writing these characters by bringing them fully into the fold it adds to the richness of the story and is what makes the book so great for the full review visit the book wheel","1492":"really good story i enjoyed the characters and how the author could switch voices so seamlessly in chapters","1493":"i fell in love with these buddies from little wing wi and was sad to finish the book friendship love family and home from a male's perspective was refreshing and heartwarming","1494":"this book as excellent i picked this book up without knowing anything about it and was hooked after the first couple of paragraphs the only complaint i have about shotgun lovesongs is that the book ended","1495":"this was just a middle of the road book for me i enjoyed it while i was reading it but once i finished i realized it was nothing to write home about i never really felt invested in the characters and that led to me not really caring much about the story","1496":"http www ondbookshelf com p 364","1497":"i loved this book","1498":"it's 4 5 stars but we won't go into the whole 1 2 star thing i really loved this book and was set for a 5 star rating until the last few chapters i still really enjoyed the book i think the writing is beautiful i just felt parts of the story dragged at the end there was too much detail for some of the characters and not enough for others even saying that however i highly recommend this book it's a great story","1499":"coming from a small town with a group of friends i've known forever this book was a lot like real life for me friends move away become successful fail at love and then there is the couple with the facade of a perfect life but even they have secrets and problems great book for lovers of the midwest it made me want to pack up and go back to my hometown","1500":"2 5 starsthe writing style kind of bugged me but i was interested in the characters and the story","1501":"read in 2 days entertaining easy read","1502":"a unique point of view and very americana being from the midwest i thought the imagery was spot on","1503":"easy to read liked the authors style but i kept waiting for something to happen i didn't feel anything happened just a story about guys in a small town and their relationships it was an enjoyable read maybe i missed something the ladies in my book discussion loved it","1504":"an interesting quick read i've grown up in a small town butler did a great job of getting the feel of relationships and life in small town mid america i was worried by the title that it might be a sappy romance novel but thankfully it was not","1505":"i won this book on a good reads first read give away and i enjoyed the book and recommend it for adults 18 readers under 18 will probably toss the book aside because although the plot line is interesting it is kind of all over the place and at times it looks like a whole new plot is starting the story is set in little wing wisconsin you finally midway through the book find out that the main characters have been friends or acquaintances since child hood ronny the town drunk is a former rodeo rider that has been a recovering alcoholic that is supported financially by leland who is a musician but you never really understand why beth and henry were childhood sweethearts and so on this book would be much better if the relationships between the characters were explained at the very beginning i wont say more because the book is over all an interesting story","1506":"simple in a good way simple characters simple plot simple motives simple like small town midwest where the book is set and where i grew up the characters town and landscape all feel authentic","1507":"it took me a while to read this book but mostly because i have been spending the majority of my spare time browsing through real estate listings it was a little slow at times but so is life i like butler's style this book felt like sitting around a table with henry beth lee ronny and kip listening to them tell their stories over a couple of beers","1508":" i really did enjoy this book i wish i hadn't read some of the other books reviews that were written on here i had not idea the books was inspired by bon iver nor do i care some of the reviews were just negative because they don't like the man's music seriously wtf while the author could get a bit wordy at times this is a story that i and many of the people grew up with can understand and appreciate we have lived these stories wisconsin is more than just a state you live in it is a way of life that takes over your soul","1509":"shotgun lovesongs is a story about lifelong friendships the narration alternates between characters in a small town in wisconson the friends are all adults at the opening of the book hank and beth are married with kids lee has a successful career in music kip made his money in chicago and then came home rob made a career on the rodeo circuit until the accident that nearly killed him butler gets each voice right as they alternately narrate the events of the story each one adds nuance and depth to the others hank describing how lee takes care of rob quietly paying bills shows that lee is not just a cliched shallow celebrity lee describing drinking with hank keeps hank from being a cardboard cutout perfect family man rob seems to be weak a near invalid but his narration reveals that he is still the strong willed man he was before he is also the angel of the story the friend who helps keep them all together even when that seems to be impossible beth the only female central character has a wonderful speech celebrating male friendship this is a very warm book which celebrates friendship forgiveness and family","1510":"i liked this one reminded me a bit of larry mcmurtry although not as funny i'd definitely read another book by this author","1511":"oh how i loved this very wonderfully written debut novel by nickolas butler it is the story of the friendship between four friends from a small wisconsin town who have known each other since childhood the characters are so endearing and engaging butler's descriptions of small town america are absolutely perfect i loved this book in some of the same ways that i love kent haruf's novels and as with haruf's books i laughed outloud and cried in several places of shotgun lovesongs two signs of a good book i received this via the publisher and netgally and thank them for allowing me to read a galley of this very fine book i look forward to more from this author","1512":"i loved this book beautifully written with wonderful descriptions of the wisconsin rural countryside and a really compelling story","1513":"this was a great read can't wait for book club","1514":"i cried twice while i read this book and not even at the end the end was too much for squeamish me although the sensitivity got to be a little much at times for example i get it the midwest is a peaceful relaxing place however i loved ronnie loved him also lucy and eddy they balanced out some of the sanctimony of beth and henry a pretty quick read totally worth it","1515":"probably 3 5 stars good little read about a group of four men from a small town in wisconsin who have been friends since childhood i read somewhere that the protagonist is bon iver which i would believe didn't knock my socks off but did keep my interest","1516":"i enjoyed this book it's very american it's not terribly unique but i found the narrative descriptive and able to bring me into the location of small town america the characters were believable and the story able to draw the connections between a small group of friends over time","1517":" this book would not have caught my eye in the ordinary course but a colleague highly recommended it as being set in his wife's home town and authored by a friend it turned out to be a wonderful novel with incredibly sympathetic characters who share the role of first person narrators and vivid and sophisticated descriptions of small town wisconsin it reads like a 'first novel ' as those various narrative voices aren't that well differentiated and the lone female narrator character is perhaps too perfect but those are nitpicks of an otherwise great story","1518":" i want to love shotgun lovesongs but alas i can only like it as a near twenty year wisconsin resident i appreciated butler's flinty loyal descriptions of the land's beauty but if i wasn't from this state i doubt i'd give a rat's ass the author is strongest on a paragraph to paragraph scale when butler approaches huge sweeping ideas he gets bogged down in unrealistic eventualities and or canned characterizations sure some of the cliches are true but when you frame the cliches as authentic as a novel's framework well you need more than that while i didn't mind the bon iver thing i felt like i was reading a novel by a guy who really needed to sell a lot of books nothing wrong with that and maybe relax a little and let go of the worry to write a perfect book nothing wrong with that either although shotgun lovesongs is flawed i caught the novel's flow and plowed through the second half on a dreary sunday good but not great three stars not four even with the home state boost","1519":" this is a book about five people who grew up in the small town of little wing wisconsin most of the book takes place now that the five are in their 30's although there were quite a few reminiscences each character has various chapters written from their own perspective the characters are

was sad sad sad unfortunately this is life for many people heartbreaking","2":"grim grim grim i had a hard time with this novel for the first three quarters or so it unrelenting in its grimness when katrina nears and then comes ashore you can not help but root for this family no matter how you felt about them beforehand the section during which they elude the storm for the most part is brilliant hallucinatory scary fast paced like the storm itself","3":"beautifully and painfully written this story of an impoverished family in the days leading up to katrina and ending one day after the hurricane describes an american way of life most of us will never know i will long remember this book","4":" i was kind of bummed that the tiger's wife didn't win the national book award but salvage the bones is very deserving of the prize i particularly enjoyed the relationships between esch and her three very different brothers they feel very true the glimpse into the dogfighting culture among bois sauvage's young men was gruesome and fascinating the boys love their dogs more than almost anything yet will pit them against each other at almost any cost we know from the outset of the book that hurricane katrina is on the way and ward skillfully builds toward the imminent disaster as well as a series of human dramas","5":" salvage the bones wowed me it is everything i want from fiction tender and brutal totally unrelenting and with gorgeous language and inventive methaphors to boot told in the first person perspective of a 14 year old black girl in rural mississippi a chapter for each of twelve days the only significant female characters are the narrator a pit bull her brother owns loves and trains to fight and memories of her dead mother the plot spins a lot around tensions of sexism abuse and survival all against the backdrop of an approaching hurricane truly great stuff a heart splitting read","6":"this was a grim read this family has a lot of problems you keep waiting and hoping for something to go right for them and it doesn't unless you count mere survival as things going right however i thoroughly enjoyed this book the themes of strong family ties and motherhood and nurturing by both females and males and humans and dogs are powerfully prominent and subtle at the same time from a feminist perspective the female characters esch and the dog china are both fighters used by the males in the story for their sexual reproductive and nurturing abilities as china feeds her pups esch tries to feed her family filling the role left vacant by her deceased mother who ironically died in childbirth this is a compelling but subtle commentary on being female it's easy to identify with and have sympathy for the main character esch you end up rooting for her and her family as the story builds to a dramatic conclusion i don't want to spoil the ending but one of the most interesting scenes comes near the end when china is washed away in hurricane katrina's waters did she drown survive and find a new home just as with esch it's up to the reader to guess at what's in store for these two female characters as the waves of a stormy life carry them away","7":"this is a wonderful window on a black family's life in a poor inland town near the mississippi coast told from the voice of esch a 15 year old girl who soon learns she is pregnant she is steadily lifted above the fray of daily existence by the secret joys of sex and her deep concerns for her three brothers and father who each have one main obsession her father generally kind but mentally absent due to drinking focuses on preparing for the threat of a hurricane brother beloved skeeta puts all his heart and energies into his pit bull and in saving her new puppies randall thrives on basketball as a ticket to a better life a younger brother fixates on food and being included in the older siblings affairs the sense of scattered movement along different paths transforms into a common purpose in the days before hurricane katrina bears down on them and the family pulls together in its immediate aftermath","8":"well written story and excellent character development i felt the hurricane beginning to develop as a looming presence that would ultimately reveal itself but never quite does although one can speculate the outcome i felt the consistent sense of poverty and sadness needed either a distinct crescendo that was lacking in the ending","9":"some would probably call the writer's style poetic but i found it distracting i read one review that said she never uses one metaphor when she can use three way too many for me","10":"an almost haunting tale about a poor black family in the south mississippi or louisiana before during and after katrina amazing imagery and descriptions","11":"words i would use to describe this book visceral raw fierce many parts of this book are extremely difficult to read for example the graphic description of the dog fight but it is so worth reading the strength of the children and their love and fierce protection of each other before during and after the catastrophe of katrina is stunning my heart ached for the family and the fact that their home situation is much too common","12":"savage and tender katrina is the backdrop not the main event but her relentlessness is echoed throughout the novel","13":" hard hitting brutal in parts this is not a book that i would have picked up on my own it takes place in coastal louisiana right before katrina hit it concerns the members of a poor black family and their interactions with each other friends enemies dogs and nature their lives were so different from mine that it was hard to relate to but the author brought them very vividly to life the dog fighting scenes were brutal but what made the most impression on me was the description of how katrina hit with the rising water and their desperate struggle to survive it made me realize how poorly i understood the situation from watching and reading the coverage on the news","14":"i couldn't finish terrible","15":"interesting difficult a bit overdone","16":" if anything this book validates the sad truth that charles murray so exhaustively describes in coming apart that we have a bifucated society of the elite minority in the super zips focused on promulgating positive social behavior and the rest of the impoverished majority engaged in a largely immoral unchanging existence in fishtowns i was hoping to see some development in at least one of the characters to breakout but sadly this story portrays the all too stereotypical cycle of an underclass engaged in theft pre marital sex dog fighting drunkeness i too am sorry i spent time with this one","17":"i didn't completely finish the book but read most of it","18":" this book surprised me over and over i was expecting katrina to play a much more central role instead we see the author carefully crafting these characters and the enormity of their small slow lives for most of the book only to face a hurricane together and i was surprised by how much i loved these characters how much i rooted for the protagonist and how much i wished i had brothers like hers even as i understood that in real life we would probably not get along but i wasn't surprised by how much it moved me because i was expecting to love this book and i did i have already recommended my copy out of my hands and into a friend's","19":" i don't read a book just because it won an award i'm not that smart nor that snooty i doubt that i would've picked up this national book award winner except that it was recommended by my smartest friend who also invited me to hear the author last month others have said they couldn't put the book down not me it is brutal and i found that if i read too much i carried it with me into my sleep i don't need that but i also was aware of what remarkable writing this is jesmyn ward is a little bitty thing and shy hard to realize all this came out of her but it is truth for sure i am looking forward to her upcoming memoir about her brother's death and other young men in her community who died within a short time span even if i expect it will be hard to read you have to confront life and i too often shy away","20":"this woman can write i enjoyed this book both for the story being told as well as the storytelling the lead up the suspense the storm literally brewing you can feel the tension all along but it all comes down to a sweet story of family and love devotion i'm sad the book ended where it did because i want more but that feels almost selfish","21":"ward makes you feel every page of this book from the sticky heat of the bayou to the wrenching hurricane winds and the howl of every dog whining to be known what i mean to say is a damn fine novel","22":" i spent the first 1 4 or so of this book waiting for something to happen i wasn't sure if i liked it and was dying for more of a plot once the hurricane gets closer the pace quickens and the novel becomes much more engrossing despite being a little put off with the pace of the story at times i couldn't help but fall in love with the beautiful writing i found myself highlighting passages and rereading some several times because the beauty of the words was so elegant for me this was especially apparent at the end of the novel when the author is describing the aftermath of the storm definitely worth the read","23":"had a hard time staying interested and some of the lingo i do not understand a bit of black jargon if this had been written by a white author not too sure it would be getting this sort of recognition a katrina story","24":" it took a while before i could get into this book i only kept reading it because of all the hype that surrounded it i was doubtful but the last 100 pages kept me hooked and i could not put it down ward crafts words together beautifully and does what a good author is supposed to do sweep the reader away with her story telling i could feel the characters' hopelessness but will to survive during hurricane katrina i related to the main character's burning unrequited love during the dog fighting i felt myself tensing up the story made me miss my mother too and several times i wanted to put the book down and cry but i didn't because i wanted to keep reading although she is talented at telling a story sometimes the reading got a little wordy and it made me confused b c i wasn't sure what was happening also a lot of things that were supposed to be poetic i just wanted her to spell it out for me this is a difficult book to get through but if you stick with it i feel like it is worth it in the end","25":"gritty and disturbing salvage the bones sings a hauntingly beautiful hymn about the strength of the human spirit in the voice of the struggling adolescent esche esche and her brothers live in a hardscrabble world of poverty dog fighting ignorance and hope in backwoods southern america their resilience and loyalty are the grace notes in this song although frequently excruciatingly painful to the soul i will hear esche's song for a long time to come","26":"the language in the book was very well written but the subject matter was very difficult extreme poverty animal abuse and just a depresing subject matter it did get a wonderful discussion going in my book club about what is civilized vs uncivilized rising above poverty vs staying complacent role model and the way different people view money","27":" i loved this story and i am so impressed by the writing skill of the author many times i found myself with a new perspective just from a line or two a minor example is this p103 i said gotdamnit daddy tries to punctuate this by slamming the door of his truck but he fails i had never thought about physical actions a person takes in communication can be a sort of visual or auditory punctuation of speech i grew to love and appreciate the characters feeling as if i knew them all by the end of the story highly recommend is difficult to read at times because of the starkness of the lives being chronicled but does that mean we middle class comfortable life readers should only read and learn about the little part of the world in which we live","28":"i think my expectations were too high here yes the writing is very beautiful much of the time but i wanted more plot with less puppy and more hurricane survival detail","29":"this book takes your breath away so worth reading","30":"definitely worthy of the national book award felt like a modern combination of faulkner's and hurston's story telling the metaphors are laid on thick but i didn't really mind also the interviews with ward about her own experiences in katrina and the south are definitely worth reading","31":" i started reading salvage the bones with high expectations having met the author at the sydney writers festival and was at first terribly disappointed i felt the writing was too contrived for a 14 year old poorly educated girl and to be honest i had to go back and re read several passages to absorb the content which was overly descriptive perhaps it would have been more successful had it not been in first person however that being said the book hooked me in the relationship between the members of this family was all at once dysfunctional devoted and heartwarming i felt sickened by the dog fights but compelled by the love of dog and master i was morally disturbed by esch's sexual appetite but longed for her to find the love that she was seeking hurricane katrina is a wonderful foil for the climatic events surrounding this family it at once breaks them and yet washes them clean to make a fresh start definitely a glimpse into a world that i am grateful not to be a part of","32":"this was a devastatingly beautiful story","33":" the short of it the best book of 2011 a stirring evocation of race poverty and hurricane katrina jesmyn ward's salvage the bones should have won the pulitzer the long of it this is a lean lyrical and visceral work but what i truly admired was how skillfully ward weaves the vicious greek myth of medea into esch's thoughts her unrequited love for manny father of the child she carries mythos the world of spirit and legend is one of the four pillars that aristotle said supports great drama and it's one often neglected in contemporary literature the other three are ethos pathos and logos i won't say much more here but just want to log in two of my favorite quotes from the novel the sun will not show it must be out there over the furious hurricane beating itself against the coastline like china at the tin door of her shed when she wants to go out and skeet will not let her but here on the pit we are caught in the hour where the sun is hidden beyond the trees but hasn't escaped over the horizon when it is coming and going when light comes from everywhere and nowhere when everything is gray i lie awake and cannot see anything but that baby the baby i have formed whole in my head a black athena who reaches for me who gives me that name as if it is mine mama i swallow salt that voice ringing in my head is drowned out by a train letting out one long high blast and then it disappears and there is only the sound of the wind like a snake big enough to swallow the world sliding against the mountains and then the wind like a train again and the house creaks i curl into a ball did you hear that it is skeetah i can barely see him he is only a wash of greater darkness that moves in the dark opening of the hallway ward 219 2nd quote i will tie the glass and stone with string hang the shards above my bed so that they will flash in the dark and tell the story of katrina the mother that swept into the gulf and slaughtered her chariot was a storm so great and black the greeks would say it was harnessed to dragons she was the murderous mother who cut us to the bone but left us alive left us naked bewildered as wrinkled newborn babies as blind puppies as sun starved newly hatched baby snakes she left us a dark gulf and salt burned land she left us to learn to crawl she left us to salvage katrina is the mother we will remember until the next mother with large merciless hands committed to blood comes ward 255 in those two quotes you see the weaving of myth the motifs of snakes and mothers puppies and babies and all of it wrapped in this fierce and violent world every bit alive","34":"this book left me flat i kept reading it waiting for something not sure what either to happen or to grab me or to draw me in well the hurricane came so there was that and the descriptions of the family trying to survive that are harrowing and compelling but that doesn't happen until the very end of a very short book and up until then there wasn't anything that drew me to these people or their story it isn't like the author isn't trying you can tell she's trying hard something was just missing for me this book won a book award tons of rave reviews i didn't hate it kind of just 'meh' started wanting to skim which is never a good thing lots of other people love the book though so what do i know","35":"4 2 a gripping look at the batiste family of bois sauvage told by the 15 yr old daughter in the days leading up to katrina","36":"this is a very hard book to read very well written amazing characters but very sad it it wasn't so good i would have dropped it it makes glass castle look happy","37":"gritty and raw novel about a poor black family in the 12 days leading up to hurricane katrina not for the squeamish the dog fighting scene will disturb animal lovers the first half of the book was slow and filled with more imagery than dialog but things pick up as the book progresses i really loved the characters and felt their strength shine through bone crushing poverty","38":"i loved this book i hated this book i wanted to jump ahead and read the last page to be assured of the hollywood ending i hoped to find","39":"this is a very well written book i found it hard to swallow due to the amount of dogfighting that was present i read about almost anything but when it comes to dog fighting i had a hard time worth reading","40":" you really just need to pick up salvage the bones by jesmyn ward i could just end my review right there but i guess i won't i'll tell you a little more over the course of twelve days you learn about a poor family in mississippi before during and after a large hurricane sweeps through town you may have heard of this hurricane it's katrina esch's father is very concerned about the hurricane but he doesn't stay sober enough to make sure all of the plans go through properly for the full review visit love at first book","41":"depressing story centered on the struggles of the southern poor yet beautifully written","42":"this book was beautifully written it was brutal honest heartbreaking and often difficult to read there were parts when i wanted to put it down especially with regard to the dog fighting but i was compelled to read on the characters felt incredibly real and the fury of hurricane katrina was palpable this book will remain with me for quite some time","43":"wow tough to read and even tougher to put down this book was so raw but wonderfully written","44":"i found myself skipping paragraphs not because the book was boring but the tragedy that is brewing through out the book i love the way jesmyn creates her characters to show their story leading up to katrina","45":"liked it both sad and hopeful at times the book felt timeless like it could just as easily have been the 1970s as 2005 didn't realize it was 2005 katrina until well into the novel as i didn't look at the table of contents i also loved the development of the relationship between skeetah and his dog china","46":"salvage the bones is a fabulous family drama that takes place during the days immediately before and after hurricane katrina fourteen year old esch has just discovered she is pregnant and struggles to help her alcoholic father and three brothers keep their motherless family together in the face of extreme poverty the characters are intensely real and fully formed powerful raw heartbreaking yet wonderfully hopeful this is one of the most beautifully written books i've read in a long time i loved this book","47":"interesting characters and excellent descriptions of the geography fill this story sadly the plot moves slowly toward a fairly predictable end","48":" such mixed feelings about this book first it was extraordinarily well written with an incredibly strong unique narrative voice but it was also a truly realistic and therefor brutal read and it was a struggle to make myself go on through puppies dying of parvo and fighting pitbulls and what might only be called statutory rape a willing high school girl besotted by an older acquaintance letting him use and ultimately impregnate her all against the backdrop of hurricane katrina and yet in spite of that the raw humanity is what makes the book so compelling and beautiful and in spite of the brutality there's a love and a hope i wouldn't read it again but i am glad to have read it this time","49":" got this in the goodreads first reads program hooray thanks so much for the opportunity i appreciate it i wouldn't normally give a book 5 stars unless i intended to read it again and i don't plan on rereading this too difficult however this is an amazing book though i'm white and more than twice her age though i've never been pregnant and don't live in the south though i never have to worry about food and was raised by a mother with a sister aunts and female cousins all around despite these things i feel such a strong connection to esch the narrator of this story the empathy i feel toward her is a testament to ward's writing abilities i absolutely adore esch beyond words this book is about many things family mythology mothers and of course hurricane katrina mostly it's about china a dog who is more than a dog but also medea and the force of nature and maternity and hope rolled into one white battered body not an easy read but highly recommended","50":"this book is so beautifully written","51":"wish i could give 3 1 2 stars","52":" more like 3 5 stars an interesting twist on a disaster story this novel concentrates on the build up to hurricane katrina and is really less about the hurricane than the hardscrabble lives and coming of age stories of a poor family while i thought the story was somewhat unique i can't say i was a fan of the super descriptive passages of dog fights which play a very large role in the novel to the point of almost glamorizing it also i got very very tired of the author's long drawn out metaphors","53":"the winner of the 2012 national book award salvage the bones by jesmyn ward is an outstanding evocation of a place and time the place the mississippi gulf coast the time the days leading up to hurricane katrina to be sure a plot summary sounds very melodramatic the narrator is esch a teenager girl she has three brothers and a single father her mother died in childbirth they are african americans living in a small town in mississippi in a neighborhood indecorously known as the pit not only is the hurricane on its way but esch discovers she is pregnant one of her brothers skeetah has a beloved pit bull named china who has just had puppies he hopes to sell the puppies so another brother randall can go to basketball camp and maybe get a scholarship though this may sound like a soap opera and often it plays like one the writing is so good that one forgives the intersection of plot points another is her father losing some fingers in a tractor accident how much more can happen to this family there's also a somewhat pained comparison of esch to medea whom she is studying in school i will go to skeetah like medea went to her brother when they fled on their great adventure with the argonauts i will offer my help but make no mistake this is a brilliantly written book there are several sections that were real page turners one is when skeetah steals some worm medicine for his dog from a nearby white people's house the white people in this book are like somewhat legendary figures another is when skeetah has china fight the sire of her pups in a winner take all match though dog fighting is certainly reprehensible there's something about it in this book that makes it noble perhaps because so much is riding on the family's livelihood and of course the third is the arrival and aftermath of the hurricane ward who is from the area and had her own harrowing adventure during katrina knows how to create atmosphere there is a sound above the water someone is shouting when i surface and breathe my lungs pulling for air skeetah is the only one left and he is silent bats whirl through the air above us plucking insects from the sky while they endlessly flutter like black fall leaves she also has some fantastic similes such as describing the attention skeetah plays to china he wipes at her cuts with a towel he's washed bleached and dipped in hydrogen peroxide she smiles lazily like a woman in a new fourth of july outfit being complimented or ward can quickly summarize a moment the waiting room was scrubbed clean and pale it smelled of pine sol coffee and weariness but the storm is the big climax of the book it's difficult to comprehend for us who didn't go through it what it was like such as when they realize water is coming into the house and before they know it they are in the attic and water is starting to come in there too the family breaks through the roof it is terrible it is the flailing wind that lashes like an extension cord used as a beating belt is the the rain which stings like stones which drives into our eyes and bids them shut it is the water swirling and gathering and spreading on all sides brown with an undercurrent of red to it the clay of the pit like a cut that won't stop leaking it is the remains of the yard the refrigerators and lawn mowers and the rv and mattresses floating like a fleet it is trees and branches breaking popping like black cat firecrackers in an endless crackle of explosions over and over and over again it is us huddling together on the roof me with the wire of the bucket handle looped over by shoulder shaking against the plastic it is everywhere daddy kneels behind us tries to gather all of us to him skeetah hugs china and she howls daddy's truck careens slowly in the yard salvage the bones is a book that i won't forget easily","54":"overloaded with astounding really memorable similes my favorites were the comparison to a pitbull's ribs moving under its skin to a school of fish and the gray spanish moss clinging to oak branches like old kings' beards","55":" i wanted to like this book more than i did simply because i've heard so many good things about it all in all i feel the writing is impressive and gives a good slice of rural mississippi the family randall junior skeetah and esch are a family living on the edge of poverty the book takes place over eleven days during which the family welcomes china's new litter she's a pit bull that fights randall loses the opportunity to pay for his basketball camp because skeetah when his friends start a fight at the game esch finds out she is pregant the father of the children loses his fingers and the family hunkers down for hurricane katrina the most exciting chapters take place at the end maybe that's why i can't highly recommend the book there is a languidness to the book and it made me feel the same way","56":"i'm sure this is a good book because other people seem to like it i really tried to read it but had to stop because it made me feel completely demoralized i've read books about oppressed people many of them but i felt despondent when reading this book and decided i needed to give myself a break","57":"i have always thought of hurricane katrina in terms of its urban impact in new orleans this book gives a gritty view of the hurricane as experienced by a poor family living in the bayou interesting characters lots of suspense","58":"i hated this book i know hate is a strong word and this one deserves it what the author did well capturing the anxiety and frustration of poverty i won this book during a raffle at a conference and thought i haven't read a book that has its setting during a hurricane the hurricane referenced was katrina and this poverty stricken family didn't couldn't evacuate however katrina was less than 1 4 of the story the other 3 4 of the book talked about birthing puppies puppies dying pit bull fighting i had to skip those pages dogs fights make me sad and really angry and the narrator's objectivity as a female she is in love with a guy who only uses her she becomes pregnant and then he calls her out it's not mine because she is the village bicycle i finished it quickly just to find the silver lining or resolution or perhaps a glimpse of depth on the part of the narrator it didn't happen her life continues to be horrible and i don't feel sorry for her she was this faceless vapid entity floating through the book my lack of empathy for the character and this story makes me hate this book","59":" this was a difficult book for me to read it is bleak so very bleak and one of the story threads is dog fighting which meant i had to skip more than a few pages although i did read enough to get the gist of what was going on that being said i think the book probably presents a very accurate portrayal of life for this family in that part of louisiana and given the culture the dog fighting aspect was probably accurate and necessary as well the writing is beautiful in an unusual and unexpected way it literally sweeps you along like the storm that also is a main part of the story i really felt as though i knew the characters both the ones i liked and the ones i didn't the last part of the book when hurricane katrina hits is spellbinding and kept me on the edge of my seat with the vastness of its descriptions and in the end the strength of relationships family and community is what shines through i waver between four and five stars i really would like to give it 4 75","60":"this is a book that almost didn't get finished my new rule in the past couple of years has been if i don't like the book then i am going to put it down which just seems scandalous to me something the former me would have thought dishonorable i did not like this book til about 2 3 of the way through i felt reminded about michael vick and the habits of people i don't want to accept or even think about especially when reading for pleasure but as the sibling bond in this book one sibling's dog and katrina the hurricane all connect powerfully i realized this is a powerful story sometimes a little too precious with the jason and medea story ribboning through and a convenient chainsaw in the attic but powerful nonetheless i am not sure what kept me reading except old habits die hard satisfying read","61":"good story it felt like you were there with the family more importantly it was excellent lyrical writting","62":"this book very unlike anything i've read before it's about a teenager so in a way it's young adult lit but the writing was amazing beautiful similes and metaphors sparse powerful and gritty language some parts were emotionally difficult to read but it was worth it i'd love to teach this book someday or at least discuss it with someone literary lots of depth for analysis","63":"salvage the bones for whatever reason reminded me of the book push by sapphire besides the main character being a very vulnerable teenage girl that is pregnant there aren't too many similarities maybe it's feeling of hopelessness although in push there a glimmer of hope at the end told in a 12 day period salvage the bones takes place in mississippi a few days before and right as katrina hits esch the main character is a girl whose mother died when she was very young leaving her and her brothers under the care of their alcoholic father she is promiscuous her and her brothers are close and their father just seems as though he is at a loss as to how to raise his children so they raise themselves and each other as he numbs himself with liquor more than one person seeing me reading this book said they thought it was depressing i agree but only if you focus on the bad things it's also a book about family and the love they have for one another","64":" this story of a dysfunctional family in fictional bois sauvage mississipp set during the ten day run up to hurricane katrina is absolutely brutal the narrator 15 year old esche is pregnant by one of her older brother's dog fighting friends the three boys in the family dad is an alcoholic mom died when the youngest was born are scrabbling to survive the story features a dog fight a sexual encounter in a school bathroom and a horrendous tractor accident as well as the landfall of the worst hurricane in memory yet the bonds of family and friendship still work the book is both hard to read and hard to put down it's a national book award winner and while i'm not sure i'd go that far it is worth the time you spend on it","65":"i have finished salvage the bones and there is only a burnt out space where my heart used to be","66":"3 or 5 stars i can't really decide gosh this story is just plain awful not the writing though the writing is just beautiful but bloody hell some of the themes are gruesome i do not shy away from sad reads traumatic events earth shattering and life changing loss is what i love to read the most this story has all of that but it is so hard to read it is bleak but not beautifully bleak like caribou island for instance this story is just horrid we are in new orleans and katrina is coming the family we read about are incredibly poor dirt poor hungry and motherless after she has died in childbirth and the only parent left is an alcoholic explosive father the story is told through the voice of esch who is around 14 years old i think she is resilient and sexually active since she was 12 the way the author talks about sex and what it means and doesn't mean to esch is brilliant but one of the things that stops it being a 5 star read which it inconsistently is is esch's voice is just all over the place she has these purely lyrical jaw droppingly wonderful insights and thoughts but yet at other times she just sounds incredibly uneducated and dumb skeetah is one of her brothers and he features heavily in the story as does his pit bull china now this is where the story just becomes too much for me i understand the theme of using dog fighting this family is contstantly fighting to survive too but gosh it is just awful to read about i suspect i am not alone in being one of those humans who can tolerate reading about humans hurting each other within reason and of course still being emotionally affected by it but with helpless animals it is a whole different game and the author goes all in with the fighting i just could not read it i skipped a whole chapter on it and skimmed it just enough to get a grip on what was going on a difficult read written inconsistently beautiful i can definitely say i have never read anything like it and it is burned in my brain for both its prose and its harrowing themes","67":"extremely painful and not the book i expected -- but extremely glad i read it","68":"raw and brutal the animal lover in me can hardly stand the description of the dog fights the mother in me can hardly stand the pathos of the children struggling to grow and be on their own without a parent that can support them the writer very effectively built tension to the breaking point i'm left wondering how many families find themselves in such desperate straits i'm left admiring the strength of the survivors","69":"this was a very powerful book i couldn't put it down the description was phenomenal i could visualize every scene the characters were fully developed it was a sad but uplifting story highly recommended","70":"a 14 year old girl living with her brothers and father in louisiana becomes pregnant by one of her brother's friends much of the book is very dark about relationships within this dysfunctional family scarred by the death of the mother giving birth and caring about animals more than people the pretext is getting ready for hurricane katrina but i did not enjoy it","71":"salvage the bones made me want to die but in a good way it's so small and beautiful it made me cry i'm almost crying just thinking about it","72":"i am haunted by this book and keep wanting to go back to it although i know i read it to the last page","73":" the best book i've read in a long time the author was able to capture the very essence of life along the gulf in mississippi i loved the use of language in fact i made a few notes of some of the passages i liked the most there is a movement behind my breast that feels like someone has turned a hose full blast and the water that has been baking in the pump in the summer heat floods out scalding this is love and it hurts my heart is a wounded bird beating its wings against the cage of my ribs i don't think i can breathe katrinia somewhere out there in the gulf coming like the quiet voice of someone talking before they walk through the doorway of a room and my favorite seeing him broke the cocoon of my rib cage and my heart unfurled to fly","74":"one of the best books i've read in a while beautiful tragic classic heart rending honest storytelling that's taut yet lyrical i could not put it down bravo jesmyn ward consider me a fan","75":"run--do not walk--to procure and then delight in this beautiful beautiful book","76":"you have to read this book with an open mind we all come from different cultures and different life experiences this is about a very poor family living in bois sauvage mississippi the poorest of the poor and yet they are not aware of their poverty as the reader is the family bond is very strong this family loved each other and without judgement i especially loved the descriptions of skeetah and his pit bull china who mutually loved and respected each other there were a few members in our book club who could not read the book because of the dog fighting scenes the scenes are graphic and disturbing but it does give you insight into a world that may be different from our own in the end i was touched mostly by the love this family had for each other","77":"the language is rich the characters and story of love in this family emblematic of the best of human endurance thoroughly deserves the national book award","78":"this review has been hidden because it contains spoilers to view it click here wow this was a rough book to read from page one i understand that the author wanted to paint a vivid picture of poverty in the present day south but i feel like she painted this picture in a bubble at times it felt artificial like she was trying too hard and as if the story was taking place in 1890 maybe that was her point but what i really didn't get was the whole point of the book at the end this wasn't a story of struggle determination inspiration and hope it was just a story that wow this was a rough book to read from page one i understand that the author wanted to paint a vivid picture of poverty in the present day south but i feel like she painted this picture in a bubble at times it felt artificial like she was trying too hard and as if the story was taking place in 1890 maybe that was her point but what i really didn't get was the whole point of the book at the end this wasn't a story of struggle determination inspiration and hope it was just a story that read like a colorful newspaper account of an event - with lots of added cuss words and sex there was absolutely no purpose to it at the end i didn't feel more connected to the characters after reading it i honestly felt nothing for them because i felt like they felt nothing for themselves this book was simply graphic vulgar and awful in most parts it was about people feeling and living like animals and treating animals better than humans big henry was the only character with any tiny glimpse of humanity and it just wasn't enough in a story where characters value pit bulls eating each others faces off as their main purpose in life this could have been a story of change and hope set during a disaster but it's not and it just left me hopeless disgusted sick to my stomach and wishing i never read it more","79":"hmmm had to make myself power through this one until the very end where i still didn't fall in love with it as the reviews predicted i would wonder how much of the hype has to do with the author exposing an unspoken reality or some such that allows the readers to cluck shake their heads while feeling grateful for being lucky that said some beautiful turns of phrase throughout and esch's voice generally came across as honest and believable","80":"i think this would be a great book for a high school reading list though i worry there'd be a lot of objections in the south to it in terms of some of its content","81":"wow if you want insight into the deep south and how some americans live read this book it was on par with praying for sheetrock as far as opening a window on how insular and impoverished yet rich and sustained pockets of people living in the backwoods of contemporary america are pair salvage the bones with the new film beasts of the wild south and you'll never think of katrina in quite the same way","82":"it took me well in to the first week the novel takes place over the span of 12 days before i no longer felt as though i was stumbling through dialogue and struggling to envision scenes however once there i was unequivocally immersed i oscillated between chilling fear aching grief and unconditional affection alongside the characters right through until the end","83":"both lyrical and brutal so much pain and yearning to wade through in the slow ominous build up to katrina cutting a destructive path through this achingly poor mississippi family's homelife","84":"truly moving the relationships were very real a real sense of community is present","85":"this book is a beautifully sad story of one family's tenuous hold on life and each member's experience 12 days before hurricane katrina hits a mississippi bayou it is beautifully written in conjunction with this book see the movie beasts of the southern wild which has a similar theme","86":"this book was so good true some of the descriptions made me feel sick to my stomach but that's okay because this book is phenomenal read it right now","87":"in poetic language tells the story of a 15 year old girl esch who lives in poverty in the small rural town of bois sauvage outside new orleans during the twelve days before hurricane katrina hits the area only one chapter deals with the hurricane and then some of the aftermath so i was a little surprised i had expected more of that type of story when it was really more of a character study but it very realistically depicts poverty and how a teen girl who's never really felt love tries to find it by sleeping with any boy who pays her attention it's easier than saying no but eventually figures out that she can love herself and her unborn baby at the start of the book she has discovered she's pregnant and at the same time her brother's fighting dog has puppies there's an interesting parallel between the not very maternal dog and the budding maternity of the girl she has two brothers and a father who's more interested in getting drunk or working on cars than on parenting much so the kids are left to their own devices and have no clue even that such a horrible storm is coming until it's nearly upon them may have teen interest but has graphic descriptions and language","88":"very difficult material lots of pain and heartache this book was not easy for me to read i kept reading because several friends had highly recommended poverty teen pregnancy dead mom drunk dad and katrina ow ow ow the writing was lovely","89":" i am drawn to fiction about hurricane katrina fiction that either serves as witness or attempts to understand the effect of such a traumatic devastating event for this reason and because it has one hell of a title i picked up salvage the bones salvage is very tightly focused narrated by esch a 15 year old girl the story takes us into the heart of conflict esch's loss of her mother her teenage pregnancy and the poverty and dog fights that surround her in rural louisiana she is a strong character fierce and fighting and proud like china the dog her brother skeet enters into dog fighting matches when she discovers she is pregnant esch must navigate the grief over losing her mother the terrifying parallels between her and china's litter of puppies as well as the uncertain future of being a mother herself katrina in this way becomes the apex of chaos forcing esch and all she loves to open and heal old wounds the greatest strength of the novel however lies in its exacting and sharp language writing that cuts with a knife still at times esch's diction seems a bit out of context the word turgid for example is something i find out of character for a girl of esch's background finally the novel at times feel stretched too thin almost as though it would have fared better as a short story this created an odd effect of a long read and off putting pacing when the novel was relatively short at 250 pages still a recommended read for anyone interested in hurricane katrina poverty stricken louisiana and the heart of a survivor","90":"not a fan of the writing style gave up early on","91":"i did not connect with this book at all the writing was smart and articulate but it struck me as inauthentic more to follow","92":" by far the most difficult book to trudge through that i've read this year or in recent history for that matter over stylized over aestheticized to the point of being nearly unreadable a deft reader can sense from the first page just how much ward wants to dazzle with her language--and there are certainly moments where she does--but it feels as if the only motivation and purpose of salvage the bones is to demonstrate that jesmyn ward can write sentences she never uses one simile when she can use three she mixes three four five metaphors in one paragraph i'm really amazed that nobody at bloomsbury's editorial department objected to a manuscript that is on a sentence level replete with overwrought language and trying so desperately to impress as far as the plot itself goes not very much happens it's anticipating hurricane katrina for ten chapters--chapters that make such meaningless activities as stealing from the neighbors a twenty page exercise--and then the storm and its aftermath in the final 30 pages and i wish i could say what ward lacked in control and restraint in her language she made up for elsewhere but it isn't so for example the heavy handedness of the juxtaposition between china's recent birth and esch's recent pregnancy is a drum that ward never tires of banging indeed she's banging it in the last sentence what frustrates me most--the issue of the problematic self satisfied showboating language notwithstanding--is the many missed narrative opportunities in salvage the novel has within it the possibility to occasion a sincere and thoughtful look at the root and reason of the mississippi gulf coast's systemic poverty especially in the face of a natural disaster like katrina that only served to magnify the area's indigence i'm not sure a better premise exists in which to interrogate and analyze the economic condition of a place whose culture is so imbued with financial strife and though ward illustrates the poverty faced by esch and her family anecdotally throughout the novel over and over again i never felt she fully communicated that what hurricane katrina as it neared closer with every chapter threatened to destroy was a community already destroyed dismantled disenfranchised and disenchanted by pre existing conditions having nothing to do with natural disaster in order for ward to fully achieve her intention of educating those who marginalized the communities she's interested in--communities that are unequivocally shaped and determined by that marginalization so much so that it's impossible and incomplete to leave out this disenfranchisement in any discussion of the region--she needed to have included some context for it rather than hoping the illustrations of poverty--the pauper fantasia--would somehow impart this lesson on its own","93":"very well written and very fast paced and high interest this novel deserves four stars i unfortunately did not enjoy the book because it was very depressing from start to finish the book did not operate on an ups and downs system but rather kept you and the characters down the entire duration of the text i will be reading this with a class of 10th graders soon so it will be interesting to hear their take on it","94":"this book was very slow at the beginning but got betters towards the end","95":"i thought the book was ok i thought the motherhood theme or lack of it was interesting i also thought the slow buildup of descriptive writing that kept us waiting for the storm was clever like bring in the eye of the storm reading about the dogs was hard because the book didn't grab me with multiple deeper issues or problems and i was able to zip through it in one day i didn't give it as high of a score","96":" 3 5 i enjoyed the characters in ward's book particularly the young female narrator i found the pacing to be slow but i guess that's the point of a book set in a rural southern summer it's a quick read otherwise it would have lost me in the beginning due to boredom but i stuck with it and in the end enjoyed it i am surprised it was the national book award winner though be aware part of the story involves a group of teenagers who fight dogs and there is a graphic prolonged dog fighting scene in chapter 8 it is confined to one portion of this one chapter so it is pretty easy to skip although there are a couple of other quick scenes when some pit bull puppies die that aren't particularly fun reading","97":"very good request oba","98":"absolutely wonderful proper review to follow","99":"about a very poor black family 4 kids dad and pit bull in days before katrina in bois sauvage ms read half and last chapter well done but too sad with death of puppies and pregnancy of 15 year old esch the narrator","100":" i chose this because it was the 2011 national book award winner the writing is excellent immediately you get a sense of the characters and their setting the whole book takes place over 12 days with day 1 being the day that pit bull china gives birth to puppies the family knows hurricane katrina is coming amazing how esch skeetah randall junior and the alcoholic dad develop over the course of those 12 days this is not easy reading i almost passed out reading about the dog fights on day 8 but the author writes with truth and authority and compels the reader to know what happens to the characters this is about poverty dogs motherhood family grief","101":"i really enjoyed this book it is a tale of hardship and heartbreak under the cloud of hurricane katrina this was especially interesting as i also attended the talk by jesmyn at the sydney writers festival and her reading from the book was just as i imagined read the full review at ourbookclub","102":"a devastating stunning beautiful account of a rural mississippi family's journey through katrina some of the most rewarding fiction i have read in a long time","103":"this book won the national book award last year and i understand why the language is beautiful even though it is sometimes a bit overdone while esch is a poor girl living in the bayou of mississippi she never speaks the language that she thinks this is a novel of the slim line between life and death it is a novel which asks what love really means it is a novel of the power of nature while the book could be seen as depressing as the family is racked by hurricane katrina it does end on a positive note that the people in bois sauvage will go on and do their best to continue living in the best way they know how warning the pit bull fights are not easy to read","104":" this quick and devastating tale of an impoverished family facing hurricane katrina as it pummels mississippi raises itself to a level of myth with the delicate narration of its protagonist esch and its well rendered themes of family devotion in times of tragedy never veering into melodrama jesmyn ward handles timely topics like dog fighting teen pregnancy and the vicious cycle of poverty in the rural south with language that sings and stings like poetry each chapter covers a single day leading up to and just after the hurricane hits and works well on its own as a slice of life short story but the cumulative effect has a lot to say about motherhood loyalty and the resilience of community on a bigger level the book works as an antidote to the media coverage of this event which often depicted poor communities with pity and disdain instead of highlighting the resourcefulness and bonding that happens at times like this","105":" a book about a poor black family on the coast of mississippi in the week leading up to hurricane katrina told from the view of the only daughter in a mother less family of boys this book is haunting i was up all night thinking about the characters their family relationships their friend relationships the dog the imagery this book still stays with me months after reading it i want to pick it up and re read sections the writing is amazing this book left a huge impression on me i haven't read a book this powerful in a long time","106":"extraordinary won the national book award in 2012 or 2011 and rightly so riveting visceral just read it","107":" i was warned that this book would be dark i'm okay with dark and this kind of dark rural poor and black is a dark that i think i don't get enough of at one point a character references faulkner's as i lay dying and i thought yeah that's about right the world of dog fighting especially was fascinating for an outsider who never considered the care and love that goes into raising a fighting dog and the whole atmosphere buzzes with that metaphor hard drinking but absently supportive daddies lovers who won't look you in the eye a band of boys that feel like brothers yet also perpetuate crime and directionlessness that being said this book is lush to the point of being over written metaphors bloom out of our admittedly brainy protagonist at a rate and vigor that doesn't match up with anything her dialogue suggests and sometimes ward seems only too aware that this book will be billed as the great american katrina novel","108":"this was so hard to get into as it's pretty slow starting and even by page 100 i was wondering whether to finish it but by the end it's all totally worth it i loved how the writing style mirrored the progression of katrina with the pace increasing with the storm's proximity what an amazing read","109":"i read this book over a year ago and i still count it as one of the best i have read is it hard to read yes is it disturbing yes does it make you want to turn away yes will you be glad you made it to the end yesplease stick with this it is definitely worth the investment","110":"ward is in her own words a failed poet at times the analogies and the symbols are overdone simply because they occur so frequently for example the line seeing him broke the cocoon of my rib cage and my heart unfurled to fly 5 is beautiful and for a moment we drift away from a novel into what could be an epic poem we know however that we are not in a poem we are reading fiction though beautiful he poetry in her prose seems out of place at times like an extra spoon at a table setting don't be dissuaded though the dramatic imagery while reading odd for a piece of fiction could make a home for itself in the subjects of the story you don't get a story about katrina and not weave some kind of dramatic blood line into it ward writes as raw as a hurricane perhaps the most vivid passage is when our hero esch describes the birth of her younger brother and subsequent death of her mother i can see her chin to chest straining to push junior out and junior snagging on her insides grabbing hold of what he caught on to try and stay inside her but instead he pulled it out with him when he was born 4 from the beginning ward treats us to a savage image of survival setting the tone for a bloody messy and miraculously hopeful narrative of a young girl trying to stay alive","111":"an intense look at the passions a family has during the twelve days leading into hurricane katrina a dead momma a dream for a basketball scholarship the need to love and be loved and what dreams are built upon are a few things that collide when the pressure builds and the water rises it made me cry","112":" for some reason this book was magnetic for me i learned more about real poverty from this book than i have from a multitude of teacher books and 11 years in the classroom it was fascinating to be a fly on the wall as these characters made poor choices or didn't make choices at all or put themselves into situations where poor choices were made for them the book is not really about katrina but it does devastate the only possessions they do have the deep loyalty between the siblings who practically raise themselves is the real heart of this book it's so sad but it's page turning i'd love to read more from this author","113":"i had other things to do but i did not want to put this book down the voice of this book is so strong so compelling as the book opens i am black poor fifteen and pregnant my mother died giving birth to my youngest brother i have all brothers my dad drinks and mostly salvages for a living my oldest brother is raising a pit bull to fight doesn't sound promising does it amazon kept telling me i needed to read this book and finally i ordered it wow once i started i could not put it down this book is like the old verse about there is no frigate like a book it totally took me out of my own world and showed me a new world shattered my superficial assumptions and gave me new eyes with which to see esch's family is facing a number of crises the biggest of which is hurricane season and ultimately hurricane katrina the family has already weathered hurricane force storms with the death of mama with the crushing effects of poverty and with esch's newly confirmed pregnancy at age fifteen how the family weathers these storms makes the book an unforgettable classic","114":"i can't remember the last time a book made me cry but salvage the bones did the family's poverty and isolation is so foreign that it feels like a different period in time the dog fight scene is difficult to read as much because of the cruelty towards animals as for the love of china skeetah's white pit bull but overall i found esch's grief over the death of her mother so palpable it was impossible not to mourn with her","115":"a pointless waste there might be nuances here too subtle for my particular brand of obtuseness but for me reading 'salvage the bones ' by jesmyn ward was a boring and pointless waste of time recommendation find something better written and more interesting to read--that shouldn't be hard at all adobe digital edition epub on loan from the country of los angeles public library at http overdrive colapublib org far too many pages","116":"this book put me in a place and environment so vivid and different from my experience that it was a little hard to read but completely worth hanging in for heartbreaking too a young girl surrounded by boys and men in a challenging place at the worst possible time katrina","117":"really enjoying this book so far it was recommended to me by the sales person at fearington ridge bookstore","118":"this book was so hard for me to get through the main character was difficult to like i placed it on my abandon shelve a few times glad i finished it","119":"i hated how depressing this book was in the beginning but came to admire the heart of this damaged family and thought the author did a masterful job of bringing to life the oppressive heat and poverty of the pre katrina summer in this rural southern swamp","120":" this book was a lot better than i thought it was going to be when i first read the synopsis it made me not want to read it it seemed over generalized and stereotypical i had no interest in reading about a black 14 year old who got pregnant i only read it because it was chosen as a world book night book however this book was a pleasant surprise i did enjoy it i enjoyed how her being pregnant wasn't the main theme it played a role but it wasn't overwhelming i really like how the family came together in the end","121":"_salvage the bones_ is a novel that handles katrina as a mirror rather than as a character esch's life is already destroyed and it is katrina that personifies this destruction for readers i found the parallel between esch as a mother and katrina as a mother thought provoking if surprising","122":"i enjoyed this yes it's got some issues and i'd give it 4 5 stars if i could enough with the medea references and at times ward gets a little thick with the descriptions all in all though this held my interest fiercely i was hooked","123":"surprisingly provides a sense of hurricane kathrina's wrath and purpose","124":"jesmyn ward is most definitely a great writer i would have rated this higher but it needed more plot","125":"extraordinary unique there were a few moments especially at the end that just gave me chills the nba win was deserved","126":"what an ugly graphic horrible novel not lyrical or poetic descriptions were poorly rendered and characters were awful how on earth did this win the national book award","127":" i read this book in a rush felt like i couldn't get enough of it i was so caught up that when i looked up after reading uninterrupted for an hour or more the weather had completely changed outside and it was starting to rain hard perfect terrifying even after i finished the book i picked it up again to re read the parts that made my heart jump to my throat my hand cover my mouth in horror when manny learns that esch is pregnant when esch likens her confrontation of manny to skeetah always kneeling over china saying make them know and when hurricane katrina goes from being a shadow in the background to screaming overhead so that all the things we thought defined this family are forced out into the open and reevaluated for the sake of survival this book was so raw and beautiful the story and the writing style will stay with me for awhile yet","128":"this book is so descriptive you felt like you were right there with the family i really liked it alot had a great perspective of a family going through hurrican katrina","129":"when i started this book i wasn't sure i was going to be able to finish it as i kept reading i was drawn into it more and more the last part of the book when the hurricane hits i could barely put it down a brutally honest book","130":"very descriptive novel that takes place in the week before katrina hit the gulf coast to d through the eyes of a newly pregnant 15 year old girl she is the only girl with 3 brothers and an alcoholic absent father she was a visual author and this story looked like a cross between 2 movies winter's bone and beasts of the southern wild i did grow tired of her endless metaphors as her way of describing things","131":" raw emotional beautifully written but unremittingly dark i had to put this book aside it was so depressing twelve consecutive days leading up to hurricane katrina each progressively more difficult and tragic paint a stark picture of this motherless family pregnant 14 year old esch skeetah u0026amp his fighting pitbull whose newborn puppies die one by one alcoholic dad who does not provide for his family and the rest of the cast of family u0026amp friends each dogged by misery i will finish when the dark days of winter fade away but for now this was just too much endless sorrow","132":"engaging story of a poor black family living in rural mississippi in the days before hurricane katrina","133":"national book award winner books like this are rare even more rare are novels of this depth that are also riveting to the point that you don't want to stop reading because the story is that compelling ward has written a bleak and violent masterpiece of great beauty as bleak and tragic as this novel is it is also filled with hope love and tenderness while she is so original that i won't compare her writing to anyone i would say that if you are a fan of mccarthy and faulkner you will find this novel to be satisfying and worthy of sitting on a shelf with the best of them the story starts with the tale of a family a very intelligent girl obsessed with classical literature particularly the story of medea and her brothers and father it is a story of dog fighting familial love and loyalty and children growing up amid the destruction caused by extreme poverty as they struggle to live and better themselves in the hot swirling dirt of a blasted out delta town then katrina hits i can see a class devoting weeks to this fine novel delving into character studies exploring the overreaching themes of loyalty love motherhood loss and revenge tracing the parallels to classical literature it would be time well spent this novel is that good i will be thinking about it for weeks while at the same time recommending it to everyone that i know","134":" ward's lyrical storytelling style is poignant and intoxicating but the starkness of the children's neglect and adolescent attempts to survive by fulfilling their own basic needs and desires is heart breaking i started reading this during the joyous christmas season and actually couldn't finish it because of this heavy foreboding and despair that was outwardly expressed in the fate of the dogs which seemed to be a foreshadowing of the fates of the children sorry ward is a beautiful writer though","135":" this year's national book award winner for fiction is an incredible tale of the complexities of life lived both young and southern it is a mythic ode to hurricane katrina an event of modern devastation in the vein of september 11 2001 that has transfixed many an artist and commentator unlike zeitoun dave egger's chronicle of the political injustice and social disgrace that plagued new orleans after the storm the poetic honesty of ward's writing illuminates the humanity in those lengths we find ourselves trekking when birthed from loyalty and devotion if it weren't for the very real connection to historic events we still find ourselves grappling with this book would still no doubt go down as a modern classic it is a literary meditation in the tested virtues that survive even the most cutting winds","136":"a little too florid for me but the story was a good one","137":"i'm against dog fighting and was scared to read this book however her writing is so good and the parallels to the savage world of medea and harsh realities of the katrina flood waters rising into the attic really get under your skin and make you respect the author and her talents tragic is the only word for this story","138":"very well done i became emotionally invested in the main character esch and her family i felt like i was in bois sauvage and st catherine louisiana by first 1 3 of this novel you can't ask for much more from a first novel i look forward to her next book","139":"amazing writing beautifully sad i felt like i was there we all feel like we know the story of katrina of the south of poverty of blacks in america jesmyn ward tells her version the mississippi gulf version of those stories and it is good no wonder ward keeps winning literary award after literary award there were times when i was reading this book that i felt sadness and anxiety almost like i was experiencing katrina all over again but this time as a fly on the wall of this family that i knew and did not know at the same time randall's dreams skeetah's love and obsession junior's curiosity and esch what a great lens through which to view bois sauvage i highly recommend","140":"this review has been hidden because it contains spoilers to view it click here this is a different katrina book than dave eggers's zeitoun this isn't a book where the main character is a hero who later turns out to be a wife beater but that's another story altogether this is just a book about a family who lives through one of the worst disasters in modern history i say just but i don't intend to demean the story at all it's a simple story about a family in the middle of a tragedy salvage the bones doesn't tackle the politics of katrina the failing of the governme this is a different katrina book than dave eggers's zeitoun this isn't a book where the main character is a hero who later turns out to be a wife beater but that's another story altogether this is just a book about a family who lives through one of the worst disasters in modern history i say just but i don't intend to demean the story at all it's a simple story about a family in the middle of a tragedy salvage the bones doesn't tackle the politics of katrina the failing of the government to care for its own people in fact the novel ends on an optimistic note but when a storm takes away your home and your entire city what else can you have but hope although the novel is narrated by 15 year old esch it's more the story of her older brother skeetah and his fighting pit bull china their relationship was the heart of the story to me and i would have appreciated spending more time with him and getting a better understanding of the other family members as opposed to the long descriptions of the environment and the weather that didn't feel like they were coming from a 15 year old the book reaches its peak when the storm finally hits emotions run high as the water rises and then that's it the storm clears and the book is over i would like to have known more about what happened next as the family tried to rebuild their lives more","141":"beautiful writing but just so sad i had to put it down for awhile until i felt up to finishing it","142":"i'll be honest the writing an themes can be brutal but it was a fascinating book and i cared deeply about the characters i had difficulty putting it down part of it could be the stark contrast between my life and experiences with those of the characters despite the differences in my life and the lives of the characters i was able to draw some similarities that seem to be innate aspects of human relationships i highly recommend it","143":"an unflinching portrayal of life of the poor down by the bayou as the author casts the horrifying contests of dog fighting in a more human light","144":"i found it difficult to read this book because of the neglect these children experienced and because of the dog fights despite this i came to care about the characters their hope and their pains","145":"this is not a pretty or light read there were times i could barely get through it due to the brutality there are neglected children a pending natural catastrophe looming over the story the personal catastrophe of a young girl depending on how one looks at it and dog fighting described in full horrific detail but oh boy is the author an amazing writer who developed characters with depth and story i will not soon forget one of my favorite books of all time wish i could give it 6 stars","146":"this was the most beautiful and terrifying book i have read in a long time i thought a long time about how a story about poverty and destruction can be so lovely i think the answer lies in the hands of a writer who can see that family loyalty and love matter in even the most dire circumstances","147":"this is an amazing book one of the best novels i have read this year i highly recommend it with the caveat that it is not a feel good novel but a very realistic powerful tale of poverty and a mississippi family dealing with the stress of hurricane katrina very well written national book award winner","148":"wow this was great really really great it instantly jumped onto my list of all time favorites well deserving of all the praise it's received like a beautiful devastating dream gorgeous","149":"beautifully written absorbing read","150":"not a feel good book just warning you that said it was very well written and i would highly recommend it it really challenged me","151":"i had a hard time with this book i wanted it to be less about the dog and more about the family didn't love as many others seemed to","152":"it's unusual for me to give up on a book but i'm done with salvage the bones at page 54 the intricate description of gutting the squirrel was the final straw for me it's so depressing and uninteresting if there is a plot i didn't find it i think our next book club selection should be a comedy or something quirky like the family fang","153":"not quite sure what to make of this the story is fluid haunting and poetic ms ward definitely has a way with words i don't think the author of the book's inset read the book however i was expecting to read about the demise of a ramshackle motherless family which includes the family's only girl who finds herself pregnant as they prepare for the coming of hurricane katrina taking place over 12 days i thought this would be a really cool story it kind of is and it kind of isn't the bulk of the book focuses on the pregnant girl's brother's pit bull i might add there also is a lengthy detailed scene depicting a pit fight so beware while this book is okay i don't feel it lives up to its full potential it could have been so much more had the author not focused primarily on china the pit bull but maybe that was her point the dog was really all they had it's a stretch but that' my best guess i'd rather the author focused on the pregnant teen than a dog oh well not sure i'd recommend or dissuade anyone from reading this i'd be curious to see what others take away from salvage the bones ever run into people who try to sound deep and intelligent but five minutes into the conversation you realize they're not that's this book tries way too hard and misses were it not for the author's gift of word play and imagery i'm not sure i would've bothered to finish","154":"touching and beautifully written family trumps all things","155":" i had mixed feelings about this book before i even began i'd heard it was amazing a brilliant novel by a young american writer that captured the heartbreaking events surrounding hurricane katrina but did i really want to read a book about katrina a storm so inexorably tied to politics race and class a catastrophe that was at once so fresh and so foreign to my existence ultimately i decided that i was ready to open myself up to what was certainly going to be a book that explored the darker parts of man and nature salvage the bones is undoubtedly a dark book even before the storm hits esch's life holds little to envy yet she seems neither happy nor sad indifferent to anyone and anything outside of her family--except for manny her brother's friend who uses her as an alternative to lotion and paper towels esch the book's narrator tells us that she cares about manny but it's clearly a teenage fascination not anything close to love and esch knows it too yet she doesn't seem upset by this fact nor by the state of her family dead mother alcoholic father older brothers that smoke dope with their friends at all hours of the day and night and a nine year old brother who seems remarkably well adjusted considering he has no adult figure in his life as grim as that all sounds esch isn't complaining she doesn't seem to have any goals for herself other than finishing edith hamilton's mythology her summer reading assignment this detail along with her simple yet poignant comparisons between her life and greek mythology shows that esch is somewhat bookish or at least not as uneducated as her backwoods existence suggests but if esch really had a solid head on her shoulders she should reveal at least an inkling of awareness that she's being denied the opportunity for a better future salvage's first person narration admirably allows the reader to make his or her own judgments but it bothers me that esch has barely a harsh word for her father your average teenager will have plenty of criticisms for the parental units how can esch give \"daddy\" a free pass to his credit he is the only character in the book who pays even a modicum of attention to the storm warnings on the radio i haven't mentioned katrina until now because the storm isn't actually central to the novel it's a setting feature not a plot point maybe ward should have made it more prominent the chapter \"katrina\" is by far the most emotional and gripping still it's disappointing that it takes a near death experience to bring out the drama in a book about a pregnant fifteen year old","156":"there's good storytelling here but i read a lot of the same storm details in news articles after katrina and i couldn't stomach the dog fighting thread here not for the squeamish","157":"this book is really worth 3 5 stars maybe even closer to 4 but so help me i expect just a little bit more from the national book award winner the voice is lovely and the author's writing style is phenomenal also esch is quite a sympathetic character i suppose it just took me far too long to get really into the book and maybe the payoff wasn't so great in the end as i had heard it would be still definitely worth a read","158":"here is a great book club read and of course anyone else it will dig at your heart and perhaps open it up a little bit in ways you won't imagine","159":"there are passages in this novel that are simply beautiful but that does not make a great book i kept having the feeling especially in the first half that i'd somehow missed a really significant chapter when what we're waiting for other than the hurricane is explained i kept flipping back and forth","160":" oh this book this is a book that was both very good and very bad the writing is indulgently lush evocative beautiful it really transported me right there to the broken painful moments before the imminence of the storm some of the most impressive prose i've encountered recently there were things i couldn't get past though the violence of the view spoiler dog fighting hide spoiler made me physically uncomfortable to read the urgency of the story made me lose my way sometimes having to reread passages two or three times to make sure i understood what just happened and while esch is a gritty real powerful narrator sometimes i just didn't feel like she was a 15 year old girl couple this all together with the fact that as i've stated previously modern fiction just isn't my favorite genre and i end up rating this a solid 3 stars i can see how many people have embraced it and how it's been one of the top rated books i give it high reviews but i can't say that it's one of my personal favorites of my recent reads oh and seriously what happened view spoiler to china hide spoiler","161":"powerful and deeply moving","162":" only jesmyn ward a native mississippian could have written a book like this the batiste family experiences the mighty wrath of a storm

first novelist award and the hurston wright legacy award she received an mfa degree from the university of michigan and won many awards and honors while a student from 2008 to 2010 ward was a stegner fellow at stanford university she was also the 2010 2011 john and reniee grisham visiting writer in residence at the university of mississippi in oxford currently ward is an assistant professor of creative writing at the university of south alabama in mobile she grew up in delisle mississippi tsalvage the bones has recently been nominated for a national book award in fiction the award is given only to books written by american citizens and published in the united states categories are fiction non fiction poetry and young people's literature only five books are considered per category the winner is announced on november 16 and receives a bronze sculpture $10 000 and enormous prestige besides ward's salvage the bones other nominees for 2011 nba are andrew krivak the sojourn tea obreht the tiger's wife julie otsuka the buddha in the attic and edith pearlman binocular vision previous winners include jaimy gordon for lord of misrule and colum mccann for let the great world spin tward chooses to tell the story in the first person through esch batiste a teenage girl growing up in tiny coastal bois sauvage esch is the only female in a household of boys and men her mother died in childbirth the reader also meets mr claude the patriarch lonely for his wife and always on the lookout for storms mr claude is prescient during the active hurricane season of 2005 when he predicts a storm will hit them what you think i been talking about i knew it was coming mr claude says he urges his family to prepare esch's brothers also feature prominently in the story randall plays basketball and he excels at the sport desperate to attend basketball camp randall knows the only way he will go to college is if he wins a scholarship skeetah in my view is the most interesting of esch's brothers he is so attached to his dog china that at times he seems like the animal's mother or lover skeetah bends down to china feels her from neck to jaw caresses her face like he would kiss her... yet skeetah uses china in dog fights the smallest batiste brother is junior the baby who never knew his mother junior loves to get into trouble and trail after his older siblings he worships his brothers and wants to take every step they take on the surface it might seem like a perfect family but nothing could be further from the truth esch is pregnant a fact she is keeping secret from everyone if i could i would reach inside of me and pull out my heart and that tiny wet seed that will become the baby twith dog fighting ward takes on a controversial subject and does not shy away from it without a doubt dog fighting is cruel and should be abhorred yet ward puts a different spin on this sport dog fighting is prevalent not only in the south but also within the african american community both come together here in the batiste clan it is also a cheap form of entertainment in rural areas where nothing else might be going on as a dog lover i was surprised by how ward handled dog fighting with the michael vick scandal a few years ago i had a preconceived notion of who owners were who would participate in such cruel behavior however skeetah did not fit into my stereotype he loved china he took great care with her and he took great care with her puppies the subject added so much to the book and also provided a wonderful sub plot i applaud ward for writing about such a potentially dangerous topic tmeanwhile as esch reads edith hamilton's mythology for school she compares herself to medea medea in greek mythology was an enchantress who used her powers to help jason and the argonauts find the golden fleece medea's journey took her to the water which was the highway of the ancient world where death was as close as the waves the sun and the wind in ancient greece ward writes water meant death ward uses medea so readers can compare this to katrina ultimately katrina cleanses and destroys at the same time the storm mends a family at the breaking point while also destroying a way of life and a landscape in this same vein ward uses hurricane metaphors throughout a superb foreshadowing technique such as frothing waves thurricane katrina even before it has formed looms over the entire book with katrina churning making a bull's eye for the mississippi coast the reader knows it will not end well although we already know what will happen ward manages to give us a suspense filled novel we are attached to the characters and want the best for them we want them to survive but nothing came out unscathed from katrina and the batiste family is no exception tsalvage the bones is always emotional readable and real no one who ever lived through hurricane katrina could read this novel and not cry it is just impossible ward's name will one day be added to the list of mississippi's literary giants faulkner welty foote grisham ward","163":"haunting and poetic ward's novel takes a while to draw you in but then you are hooked the portrait of the impoverished african american family struggling to survive in the bayou to salvage their present from their past is honest and moving the characters are distinguished as individuals and the relationships are tragically realistic including those between the humans and the animals","164":" there were a lot of lovely moments in this book i loved the allusions to greek mythology and the imagery when hurricane katrina hits is amazing however the storyline felt a little slow in parts especially since the reader knows there is a buildup happening to when the hurricane actually comes i almost felt like the climax of the book happened too late i would have loved for the action to have happened sooner thus allowing for more resolution time some of the subject matter is also a little hard to get past i definitely struggled to get through the dog fight sections but overall ward has a beautiful way with words and her characters are three dimensional and believable","165":" i really wanted to love this book but i put it down several times and it was hard to pick back up i was able to finish reading it because it was so well written and i did want to know what happened with esch and her relationship with manny it is a story of a family in mississippi that starts two weeks before hurrican katrina hits the story is narrated by esch a teenagers and only girl in a family with her father and three brothers i had some issues with the storyline because it's told in such a short period of this family's life there were some assumptions i had to make to give the character's a backstory overall it was a good and interesting read","166":"beautiful prose but never completely drew me in i should have read up on the jason and medea myth in order to follow that thread in the book better","167":" after devouring jesmyn ward's stunning new novel salvage the bones it is no surprise to me that in december this her second novel won the 2011 us national book award for fiction she is the best contemporary writer i have read in quite a while like many superb new fiction writers it took a long time for her writing to get noticed no doubt another a sign of the deep shit the publishing business is in salvage the bones is written in the voice of fifteen year old pregnant esch as she and her brothers their alcoholic father and a pit bull mother called china get ready for hurricane katrina of course who could ever get ready for such a catastrophe certainly not this poor black family living in squalor in the mississippi coastal backwoods ward's writing is as savage as the circumstances esch and her family and their friends live in every day and yet it is beautiful too for me the most powerful message was about sibling love a love that left me in no doubt that this is a bond that will last for esch and her brothers' lifetimes","168":"beautiful savage intense southern to the core","169":"esch has enough to deal with as the only girl in her motherless family and the realization that she is pregnant but a force named katrina is coming to her mississippi gulf community as well terrifying and very raw","170":" i found this to offer some interest it is about a young girl growing up in the south in poverty with only four brothers father and neighboring boys it is a situation girls have found themselves in where they are not taught about growing into a woman and about our bodies the children basically are raising themselves it is also about desperation of some for money young love is also included the author gets hung up on about three topics and is repetitive and slow profanity and sexual situations are bold and therefore unacceptable for young adult reading although i emphasize with the situations i find them so drawn out that it loses the reader's interest i won this in a giveaway and appreciate the authors and publishers that give this opportunity i however will donate this to a library i would not recommend it nor would i keep it in mine","171":"beautiful writing the graphic description of dog fights are painful but the emotional journey of this broken family facing the onslaught of katrina is riveting","172":"its taking me longer to read this book then it really should because i usually wait 'til i've climbed in the bed at the end of a long day to read okay maybe more information than you really need for a book review but it does serve a point this isn't the book to read as you are fighting your eyelids that said i do like this book jesmyn ward has pretty lyrical writing even when describing a dog fight or tangle with a tractor some of her writing is so pretty when something bad happens it catches you by surprise the book opens with a pitbull in labor i know makes you wonder where's this story going right we then meet skeetah the owner of the dog randall his older brother junior their baby brother and their sister esch our main character a tomboy ish yet sexually promiscuous girl hanging out with her brothers and their friends figuring out that she's pregnant they're being raised by their usually drunk father having lost their mother when she died after giving birth to the youngest brother as i moved through the story i saw china the pitbull as a metaphor for the kids' lives she the dog is the primary mother figure the one esch looks to for a model of what motherhood looks like the suspense in the story is not only built into the pace of ward's writing but the timing of the story its set in a rural area in mississippi days before hurricane katrina you want to yell through the pages get the dog get your dad and get out of town while at the same time wondering how or if this family is going to survive you revisit those questions that ran through the nation's head as we watched the waters flood new orleans why didn't they get out what were they thinking what are they going to do now ward provides some answers at least for this family they were pulling the framing out of their attic for plywood to board up the house and were eating ramen noodles for every meal every day they clearly did not have the means to evacuate and if so they weren't getting far in the not really running pickup truck sitting in the dirt yard salvage the bones is a story of love and desperation and the things that happen when those two strong feelings are confused one for another i think if i can sneak some time in daylight now that we have this extra hour i could finish this book in one sitting and see how esch her brothers their dad and the dog make out in the storm","173":" everything about salvage the bones is stark the story the characters and the setting all have the makings of a greek tragedy unfortunately i can't take credit for that comparison the parallels between esch and medea are very clearly drawn i'm glad that i took my sweet time reading this book because it gave me the opportunity to fall in love with the family and understand their circumstances more fully poverty and hurricane katrina serve as the duel antagonists there's beauty to be found in the pages if only you can look through all the brutality","174":"this books isn't particularly long yet i felt like i was forcing myself to push through it there are sections i enjoyed for their vivid portrayals but each of the characters ultimately felt played with only a single note the subject matter is of course bleak without much of a plot to drive the book i'll round up to 3 stars for jesmyn ward's writing style and what is no doubt an accurate rendering of a people and place","175":"beautifully written book i felt like i was with this family as they experienced hurricane katrina highly recommend","176":"i initially picked this book up because it was nominated for the national book award but for the life of me i can't figure it out i'm not poorly read i read a lot and i read books that are difficult and considered literature so i am no stranger to the lit that has been produced in the last 400 years not to mentioned i've been teaching english lang arts for 12 years but for the life of me i could not understand why this book was nominated for such a prestigious award the story is dull a little boring and very very very redundant the main character esch is pretty cool but man is she a whiner again i get where ward is coming from here we have a novel about a family who lives on some land in miss hurricane katrina is right around the bend esch finds out she is pregnant skeetah esch's brother is breeding pit bull pups his dog china being the mother and randall esch's other brother is trying to get a scholarship to play b ball in college meanwhile esch's father is convinced that a hurricane is coming so he is hunkering down preparing for it esch narrates and we find out that she has slept with all her brother's friends because it was easier than fighting them off there is a continual comparison to china giving birth and her state of mind and esch's state of mind and being pregnant predictably so esch's baby's father is a prick there is more but i don't really want to talk about this book anymore i can't in good conscious recommend this book but if you're interested in what happens go for it just expect a dry redundant read without a lot of substance at least in my opinion and hey it's just an opinion but read on folks read on","177":"could totally write a thesis on all the stuff going on in this book","178":"powerful and well written novel an emotional ride that puts you in katrina's path","179":"ron charles of the washington post got it right when he said salvage the bones has the aura of a classic about it it certainly does read like a good classic bit of lit ward does a wonderful job of weaving together the multiple stories of the different characters and their own struggles her story telling abilities are seamless and the narratives have a good flow to them i'd recommend it to anyone who's looking for a good more contemporary read","180":"sad and gritty but powerful the author has amazing prose looking forward to some more work by her","181":"amazing writing great relationships but difficult subject matter with katrina looming over it all","182":" i am not sure how to review this book it made me so incredibly sad esch is the only female in a family of dad and three other siblings all male she is 14 and pregnant she finds love or affection from her brothers' friends her baby's daddy doesn't buy that he is the daddy their lives are played out in the 11 days before and the one day after hurricane katrina on the mississippi coast they are all trying to make sense out of the desolation of their lives even before a hurricane this book broke my heart but i gave it 5 stars because of jesmyn ward's writing i wanted to eat her words i felt every grain of sand and dust i had to fan myself because i knew how hot they were i was hungry because of their hunger pains she knows how to craft a story a description a family in crisis i do recommend this book but you won't close it at the end feeling better","183":" really wanted to like this more but was completely removed from most of the reading experience i found the mere number of the destructive mother metaphors to be excessive and removed me from the narrative as a whole i saw to much of the author at work and not enough natural character work the structure of the whole story taking place over a limited number of days required a slew of terrible actions to take place over a small amount of time i saw to much of the form of the book and had trouble appreciating it as much as others however when the storm takes over during the last fifth of the book i was swept up she has a knack for driving action that puts her in a higher class i hope in her many future books that she lays of the heavy hand of symbolism","184":"easily the hardest thing i've read in a long time and the dog fight at the novel's apex almost killed me but seriously also the most beautiful","185":"best book i've read in a long time beautiful haunting well developed characters","186":"the storm scene is a nail biter this article made me love it http colorlines com archives 2011 1","187":"4 5 really goodreads needs half stars it's clear why this book won the nba haunting searing and beautiful hangs on to a plot while carrying a mantle of poetic beautiful language recommended for folks who like stories of people and ow people survive despite difficulty","188":"the gritty and harsh story line of this book joxstaposed the underlying them love of family perfectly the evolving model of female empowerment and motherhood combines with the brutality of loss dog fights and hurricane katrina in a world so far removed from what we think of as average","189":"this is not a book i would ever have picked up on my own it's about a poor southern african american family in the days leading up to hurricane katrina esch the narrator is the only female in the household as her mother had died due to childbirth complications her father is guzzling beers and making predictions about the hurricane and one of her brothers is preoccupied with his pit fighting dog that just had puppies i have to admit that it is well written even if it's not a story i liked","190":" i liked this but i wouldn't say i loved it powerful moving imagery of poverty throughout this novel there was less of a plot than i thought there might be put simply this was just little slice of a young girl's life in the days leading up to the hurricane during and right after certainly it was interesting to gain some insight to their way of life in the south but i wouldn't say i was left inspired or profoundly struck by some underlying message you tend to expect that sort of thing after reading a book centered around a natural disaster i will say however that i loved the main character esch and that jesmyn ward has an incredible way with words definitely an accomplishment","191":" it has been so long since i have taken a literature course that i doubt that i can identify let alone articulate all the symbols and themes in this powerful story birth blood bones motherhood forces of nature family colors seven years after they have lost their wife and mother and anchor a poor rural family struggles as katrina bears down on them the father is alcoholic and disabled the children have mainly raised themselves with a little help from their father and memories of their mother to guide them the father recognizes the danger of the impending storm and tries to prepare them and their house","192":"chronicles the life of a poor african american family in the bayou over the 14 days leading up to katrina a shockingly vivid tale told by an author who ostensibly lived it it shows family love can take disparate paths and be nonetheless real and vital","193":"i really loved this and was surprised because i'd never heard of it before imagine if the girl from beasts of the southern wild grew up a little and had four brothers who bred dogs and that's pretty much the gist really interesting characters and imagery a rusted fridge like an egg with paprika and good dialogue","194":"eloquent and gritty at the same time at one point i was flipping back to the cover to ask is it savage or salvage but there is hope so perhaps it's salvage after all reading it in brand new hardback was a pleasurable experience and somehow honored the story","195":"i just picked up this book and i could not put it down it covers 12 days in the lives of a poor african american family who faces many issues the most dangerous being the pending arrival of hurricane katrina esch the young girl telling the story is powerful this is a wonderful story about a family and how it faces its flaws a beautifully written book ms ward is quite gifted","196":"very well written intense story about a very poor family in louisiana in the days leading up to hurricane katrina it was a tough book to read at times especially with the dog fighting scenes but it was very good highly recommended","197":"fantastic writer but hated the dog fighting component","198":"this was the winner of the national book awards last year and while i definitely don't think it was the best piece of fiction written in 2011 it was a pretty fine book and has enough meat to it that it would be good fodder for book groups i loved the family relationships in this skeetah obsessed with his dogs because it is the one thing in the world that is his and because the love he feels for his dog u0026amp her puppies is used to fill the hole caused by his broken family plus he sees a future in her since she and her offspring are profitable feral little junior and randall trying to make a future for himself in sports and hold his family together plus esch who doesn't have enough self worth to say no when boys come sniffing around or to demand respect from her babydaddy the father is barely present even though he lives in the house and does his best to prepare his house and family for hurricanes i liked randall best - he was the family member with the most character and definitely the most decent of them all skeetah was the most interesting because he seemed to care more about his dogs than himself and even possibly his family that dog was his whole world though even with that he was still more observant than the rest of his family he was the only one who seemed to know that esch slept around and he was definitely the first to notice that she was pregnant and the scene where katrina finally struck extremely nerve wracking and nail biting the big downside of this book was that ward likes dumping huge paragraphs of description that i could just not follow plus she has the tendency to speak in circles around events instead of coming straight out with what she means more poetic but more confusing","199":"within these pages lies a new classic every line is filled with faulkner esque beauty wandering metaphors and raw sensual description fitting attributes for a book by a mississippian while the book is framed by the events of katrina it can't be defined simply as one family's response to the storm it's so much bigger than that jesmyn ward's unstinting honesty of narration reveals and reminds as great literature does that abject poverty and familial love are not mutually exclusive update read either niv or the king james version of psalm 88 after you've finished","200":"p 251 there is nothing but mangled wood and steel in a great pile and suddenly there is a great split between now and then and i wonder where the world where that day happened has gone because we are not in it teenage esch narrates this katrina story in a unique voice she has very little but her three brothers but tells her family's story without self pity the short time frame worked well and the chapters during the storm had my heart racing","201":"i found this book at times difficult to read but ultimately highly rewarding the story features fifteen year old esch living with her family in new orleans who discovers that she is pregnant her father who drinks too much doesn't have a lot to offer the family other than the land held by his family over generations her older brother randall is hoping for a career in basketball hoping that he will be chosen to go to basketball camp this summer he is a solid family member helping with the younger members as needed junior is the youngest and mostly hangs around hitching rides on others' backs or riding a bicycle without a seat the other primary character is skeeter a year younger than esch who has a dog china skeet enters china in dog fights this is where the novel became difficult for me i worried about the dog who is pregnant at the beginning of the book and i worried about the place dog fighting has in the story i found a different kind of view of these dogs than the one we often hear about the michael vick type story we find that skeet loves china perhaps more than any other creature this love is not inconsistent with the fighting that she does pitbulls are known for their desire to please which may be even stronger than that of other dogs this is the real reason they make good fighters of course i found it difficult still to think of these dogs facing horrible injuries and of the owners having few resources for helping them with their wounds skeet does an admirable job in this regard but i could imagine there would be many instances when his skills would not be up to the task we follow this family through the days leading up to the day hurricane katrina hits by the time it does its worst we know them we understand why they did not leave their home we understand why it would be so difficult to understand what a category 5 hurricane particularly this one would be so different from the hurricanes they have experienced in the past i found the book enlightening both in the way that it describes how a very poor southern family sees the world and in the details of living through katrina in all the coverage i read and saw of that hurricane i never before heard it described as it is here","202":"it's not that i didn't like the book it's just that it was so sad that it was hard to read it was beautifully written though i'd definitely read something else by the author","203":"this review has been hidden because it contains spoilers to view it click here overall thoughts of the book salvage the bones by jesmyn ward allows readers to embark on a journey of love and self discovery and acceptance i found myself staggered as main character esch unveiled her true self page by page esch started as a character that seemed hopeless and in some ways pathetic however she has transformed into a fighter as viscous and tender and beautiful as chyna she first admitted her inability to reject the boys who made advances to her the she not only stood up overall thoughts of the book salvage the bones by jesmyn ward allows readers to embark on a journey of love and self discovery and acceptance i found myself staggered as main character esch unveiled her true self page by page esch started as a character that seemed hopeless and in some ways pathetic however she has transformed into a fighter as viscous and tender and beautiful as chyna she first admitted her inability to reject the boys who made advances to her the she not only stood up to manny but she was also vocal about how her \"love\" for him cons at times i felt that the plethora of detail made it more difficult to understand this made reading the book take much longer than i intended ex \"we stand in our small group staring at the mess and then i step away and we leave but randall is the last to start walking and he glances back again and again at the gym that was there but isn't \" though this sentence may require one to read it at a slower pace its uniqueness is much appreciated jesmyn's use of diction has proven to be quite sophisticated and creative i'm realllyyyyyyyy sad that chyna hasn't come back yet i thought that she would quickly and now i am highly perturbed with jesmyn's ending pros esch's character made a huge change which i am extremely proud of esch was living in her own world of greek mythology as a result she was unable to be vocal in her real life and was taken advantage of though esch has only demonstrated a few maybe fewer acts of being vocal about how she feels it gives readers hope more","204":"gripping novel with gorgeous prose the pacing is fantastic and the way katrina looms in the background while the characters worry about the other things in their lives gives the novel a tense feel reminiscent of a holocaust narrative where the characters are aware of what's happening but don't have the full knowledge of the danger that the reader does totally deserving of the nba win","205":"wow this book had probably the most intense scene in it that i've ever encountered certainly in an audiobook but possibly in any book writing was chock full of knife edge metaphors beautiful sparse emotional wow listened through st paul public library's access to oneclickdigital despite the terrible app and website","206":" when i started reading jesmyn ward's salvage the bones i knew what i was in for from the start within a few pages i had an idea of what she was going to do and that it was going to piss me off well it did and yet...i have a literary pet peeve and it involves using animals pets in stories just for the purpose of killing them off it's probably because i'm supremely overprotective of my own pets and there's a significant level of discomfort reading stories where any kind of animal especially a pet is in peril also if michael vick's past activities with relation to pit bulls bothered you a lot this is a book to avoid i think and yet...salvage the bones is just a gorgeously written book i found myself stopping any number of times to admire the way ward crafted a sentence i'd look at her word selection and wonder how she ever got there because with an economy of phrasing she was able to paint vivid images that endure in my mind a book set around the events of hurricane katrina the story evokes significant emotion told from the point of view of esch a teenage girl in south mississippi this is the tale of a family and how they exist together from the days before the hurricane hit all the way through the actual arrival of katrina i would be lying if i said i wasn't sobbing at one point so even though i had a pretty big objection to a plot device employed by the author i find myself pondering salvage the bones at unexpected moments when i was about halfway through the book i was certain i would take it to the used bookstore once i was finished with it now i'm not so sure i think i may want to go back and explore ward's exquisite use of language and metaphor i'm still a little mad at the book though","207":"really well written deep characters a glimpse of lives that i will never experience and i can't say i'm sad about that however it gave a more human face to the people who live that sort of life and for that i'm thankful the dog fighting scenes were extremely hard to read for those who may be squeamish about such things but again it's one of those things that i can't always ignore as if it doesn't exist","208":"this is a gut wrenching beautifully and often grittily written book about life before during and after hurricane katrina for a dirt poor black father and his children there are many subplots and twists and turns that i shall not reveal as they need to be experienced by the reader the language is evocative and the mind pictures it inspires can never be forgotten i recommend this highly it is not a light read it is meant to be savored","209":"a hard read with truth all over it","210":"wow i'm so glad this won the national book award i was absolutely mesmerized by the beauty and menace of this book i could not put it down and now i cannot stop thinking about it highly recommended","211":"i was afraid to read this book as i knew it would be very sad and it was however i really enjoyed the book and did not want to put it down haven't read a book that impacted me this much in awhile all in all a good read","212":"i found this book to be profoundly moving providing a look at rural poverty that is often not a part of contemporary fiction the scenes are evocative you can feel the heat the wet the textures that surround this hard scrabble family set in the days leading up to and then one day immediately after hurricane katrina salvage the bones has wonderfully developed characters particularly in esch the young female protagonist and only female member left of her family after her mother's death among the aspects i found most interesting is the way in which ward captures the day to day concerns that govern our lives despite the epic catastrophe that is looming despite my knowledge of the storm its proportions and the devestation i too was taken by surprise being more immersed in the immediate concerns of this sad troubled family note not for the faint of heart there are graphic descriptions of dog fighting i believe you either love or hate salvage the bones and i was alone in my book club on the love end","213":"read the last few chapters through tears and between fingers to shield myself from what was happening well worth the read","214":"i'd really give this book like a 3 7 stars rating but whatever this was a solidly entertaining read i liked the fact that it discussed hurricane katrina's damage to areas in mississippi since the media often failed to mentioned many of those communities i loved the characters they were well developed and very relatable i love when an author can create believable teenagers the one thing that i did not enjoy the story is way too wordy i found myself skimming over a bunch of the narration then having to go back because i'd missed something important overall a good read for young girls and grown women alike i'd recommend it i actually need to find a copy of this book","215":"very good and very well written interesting story about how katrina may have affected families in rural louisiana","216":"this was not a necessarily easy read her descriptions of the indigent african american family living in abject poverty in the mississippi were realistic but frightening esch the pregnant fifteen year old who has studied and loved greek mythology is the chief narrator as this family prepares for the onslaught of katrina her father is an alcoholic who has allowed his four children to raise themselves as they prepare for the hurricane china randall's pit bull has six puppies and his love of her and dog fighting are essential elements in this book ward's knowledge of the area and the vernacular of the characters is evident throughout the book her description at times seem almost poetic","217":"this book pulls off the difficult trick of writing about underprivileged and undereducated characters without condescending to them esch and her family are poor and ignorant and the scope of their world is very very limited yet ward makes the reader care about them and root for them i did get a bit tired of having the medea comparisons continually pointed out esch is reading a book on greek mythology but overall this is a powerful well crafted book i may use it the next time i teach a southern literature course","218":"pros the author is able make a harsh environment harsh before u0026amp after katrina into a beautiful story the characters of the book were all flawed yet it was easy to feel something towards them they felt real the climax built up really well it's a quick read i didn't want to stop i knew katrina was coming but how was the family going to survive once the hurricane finally hit cons there are a lot of metaphors u0026amp similes i think the author is a great writer but it took a little adjusting to get used to the book being heavy on the descriptive side dog fighting this is a difficult subject to read write about yet the author was able to handle it very well i think i am definitely not pro dog fighting but i'm not ignorant to the fact that it goes on it's a very important and relevant part of the book some people may be turned off though i really enjoyed this book","219":"the violence and overuse of metaphor keep me from adding a third star also the disconnect between esch's love for and understanding of western mythology and her raw ignorance in other matters made her seem unconvincing","220":"watch this author very talented this book won the prestigious national book award written beautifully i was intrigued with her use of symbolism and the deeper meanings the plot that on the surface seems superficial or stunted but isn't and the psychology of the relationships presented and i like dogs surely china returned","221":"saw her speak with bonnie jo campbell author of once upon a river at the 2012 printer's row literary fest","222":" salvage the bones was quite an interesting read i admit towards the end the author jesmyn ward became a little too poetic for me in the beginning and middle of the book she wasn't too poetic at all but at the end she brought out some poetic things that kind of stuck out of place i know the book was about hurricane katrina and the before and after affects but it seemed a bit drawn out and forced to create a story around this historical time frame esch pregnant at 14 is one of the main characters in the book she seemed much older than her age mentally and intellectually and i was surprised that she allowed herself to get pregnant as smart and advanced as she was skeetah her brother was so preoccupied with his dog china that he was somewhat distant in the whole story plot randall her older brother wasn't available as much either because of his love for basketball junior was the baby boy and wanted to be in the shadows of his older siblings the father was an alcoholic who widowed tried to focus all his attention on always preparing for something to happen maybe this is why esch fell for the love and affection for other boys the men in her life were not really available to her in the way she needed them to be hurricane katrine devastated the city of new orleans and surrounding areas the way jesmyn ward described how the water came and ravaged the land was amazing to read she definitely created a picture to see and i was enraptured by how the waters and rain came in and drowned the land the baptiste's ran for safety cover and hung on to each other like their lives depended on it they protected each one of their family members with pride family was all that mattered and you can truly see how important each one was to the familial unit in the book the readers can understand and feel the void that the mother left in the family it was such a ragged and gaping hole that the mother left that you actually felt sorry for how they went through life trying not to miss her there were several social issues that were brought out into this book that i commend jesmyn ward in talking about and sharing teen pregnancy poor families who have talented individuals that cannot make it to better situations because of the need to provide alcoholic parents missing dead parents single father households rural living poverty and a host of other issues ward tackled and took on all of those issues in a story that kept you engaged and entertained i would rate this book a 4 i would recommend to others who may be looking for a book club read or someone who likes random fiction","223":"much like the hurricane approaching from the distance at the beginning of the book the story starts at a low roar but quickly hurtles toward and engulfs the reader in the story of the batiste family the savage bones is a tender and gripping portrait of a tough as nails family in a tough spot that never veers into sentimentality it's lyrical and beautifully written but no one would ever call it fussy i devoured it","224":"devastating beautiful book highly recommend","225":"i'm still digesting this one i'm not sure what to make of it","226":"more like 3 75 stars tells the story of a poor black teen girl in rural lousians during katrina liked the writing style and description definitely a worthwhile read","227":"this is one of the most poignant books i've read in a long time brutal and beautiful horrific yet hopeful","228":" this is one of the first books i've read in a while that felt like to me it was working on many levels the layers of mythology motherhood nature and loss were so intricate and subtle making for a rich and substantive read i do wish that esch had been a little more of fleshed out character i didn't really feel like she was much more of a passive observer through most of the book in fact in the end when one of the characters promises to always care for her and her child it took me by surprise because throughout there was no indication he even really knew her but even as a passive observer she has a keen perspective on the world that is falling apart around her what did stand out for me in the book was the well developed and touching relationship between skeetah and his dog china i love how ward juxtaposes the violence of dog fighting with the tender care that skeetah lavishes on his dog the relationship between dogs and people is not always a simple one and ward did a beautiful job of portraying it with deep intricacies and emotions overall this was a rich and complicated story and i think deserving of the national book award","229":"esch's family right before katrina brutal hard to push myself to keep reading but awesomely written","230":" finished \"salvage the bones\" by jesmyn ward last night what a powerful and incredibly sad book even though this won the national book award i don't think i would have ever read this on my own if it wasn't the book club read i typically tend to shy away from sad books but i'm really glad that i read this the main character esch was such an interesting character and her story was truly heartbreaking while there wasn't lengthy dialogue ward gives such rich detailed descriptions of the louisiana town and the characters that i felt like i could perfectly visualize everything that was happening...for better or worse this book definitely gets an a but if you're already having a rough day i don't know if i'd recommend reading it this novel weighed heavy on me and it really made me reflect on how quick our society has been to forget about the damage done by katrina","231":" i had a unique experience with this because i knew absolutely nothing about the book when i began to read it in a big hurry to get it read before book club monday i downloaded it on my ipad and jumped right in without seeing the cover reading a blurb knowing it was an award winner and not knowing a thing about the author after reading some of the other reviews on goodreads i think my ignorance made for a much better read having no expectations it was very easy to accept the first person narrator esch esch is a young teen girl living in abject poverty with her 3 brothers and drunken dad near the gulf hurricane katrina is only days away but i didn't know that because i knew nothing therefore i was able to lose myself in the story of a family living in the utter devastation brought by the death of their wife and mother when the youngest child junior was born they are living with no rudder in a storm of loss and each family member finds ways to cope the dad drinks randall is trying to be a sports star esch makes her way as the only female by giving herself physically to the boys' friends junior sticks to each of them looking for motherly love and skeetah creates a tumultuous bond with a female pit bull dog the core story is skeetah breeding his dog china to have puppies to sell so they can get some sort of toehold out of barely surviving the reality of living with a dog trained to dogfight and encouraging that dog to raise puppies was nauseating every page was heavy with the threat of something terrible katrina ended up being a sort of catharsis as the build up to the storm was stifling i only experienced katrina on tv so i have no first hand knowledge to impart though i did have to drop a star because i found it hard to accept that the storm's aftermath seemed so uneventful overall it was powerfully good writing and the poetry of esch's interior language created a setting i haven't so vividly seen in a long time it will be quite awhile before i can look at ramen noodles and not cringe","232":"writing story content definitely deserving of the national book award wow but just so painful other reviews have used the word 'brutal' and that's right too and heartbreaking","233":"audiobook narrator somewhat monotonous story not strong","234":"read on kindle the voices of these people are captured by the author and though you wish more for them their lives go on and they survive","235":" 4 5 stars i picked up this novel on the recommendation of a friend knowing absolutely nothing about it the tale follows a fourteen year old girl esch in the twelve days leading up to katrina striking her town in bois sauvage mississippi the book was unrelentingly powerful in its depiction of the myriad of brutalities that accompany rural poverty including dog fighting molestation and racism other reviewers have stated and lamented that it is ultimately a happy tale showing the powers of love and sacrifice that can hold people together even in the most dire of circumstances while that love and sense of community is certainly what keeps the family afloat it is also the root of the brutality it is why the brutality stings so much because sometimes people that love one another hurt one another and because we love the characters and cannot bear to see them hurt i very much enjoyed this book but it is indeed a hard novel","236":"just finished reading this novel and experiencing the blinking re entry that comes from spending time with something exceptional i almost found this book suspect in how easily jesmyn ward caused me to slip into it's brutal emotionally rich world salvage the bones is an honest keenly observed tremendous piece of writing","237":"devastating i was scared for the last third of the book afraid of what would happen to the family once katrina hit and while the resolution was not as deadly as i feared it was still not easy to swallow and difficult to face this is a book that will make a reader's thinking change that will remain as a new perspective powerful and energy draining all at once a heckuva read","238":"well written and moving tale of an african american family's everyday struggles which collide with hurricane katrina","239":"beautiful and scary not boo scary more like tragic scary a favorite of 2012","240":"\"she left us as dark gulf and salt burned land she left us to learn to crawl she left us to salvage katrina is the mother we will remember until the next mother with large merciless hands committed to blood comes \"a storm is coming esch is fifteen and she lives with her three brothers in the coastal town of bois sauvage mississippi they struggle along the poverty line but live a simple content life the father a single parent is an alcoholic but is a decent provider this story covers the twelve days leading to katrina as the family tries to prepare made difficult by the sudden news of esch's pregnancy dog fighting is also a major part of this tale beautifully rendered but also brutal and graphic so be forewarned ward's prose is strong deft and vivid she captures the hard beauty of a family dealing with everyday life and an oncoming catastrophe","241":"a little depressing but beautifully hewn book","242":"salvage the bones has been executed perfectly it is a profoundly beautiful story of a young woman coming of age that will touch any heart there are different types of love we discover in our lives and jesmyn ward has taken them to a mythical and almost mystical level with salvage the bones it will stay with you a very long time absolutely excellent","243":" harrowing if there is one word to sum up jesmyn ward's salvage the bones that would be a good one it is a coming of age story of 14 year old girl named esch living in poverty in the bayous of mississippi with her widower father and three brothers young junior who has never known a mother future basketball hopeful randall and brash skeetah with a tender spot for his white pit bull named china from the start there is a sense of foreboding that things are not going to end well so one hardly needs the added plot of hurricane katrina to be way this is sad tough rough stuff but balanced by ward's beautiful prose there is a poetic lyrical quality to it but i found that it more had the painful pained riff of the blues quite appropriate for the setting and these lives it has the feel of a classic novel one may read in high school though it would never get there due to strong language and mature themes a caveat to animal and particularly dog lovers while esch is the emotional core of the novel the spotlight is strongly shared with skeetah and china a legend in neighborhood dog fights there are some quite difficult and graphic passages that i imagine would be gut wrenching for anyone but particularly sickening to those of us with special relationships with wo man's best friend not many downsides to report other than feeling my attention flagged the story dragged at a few points in the middle a solid 4 star book that may have briefly dipped to my unofficial 3 5 stars at those low points but then there was the ending the ending wow based on one chapter alone it was easy to see why ward won the national book award it had me wavering to the higher rating but alas i will stick to the 4 stars a heartbreaking read but amazing book","244":"lyrical and wonderful and real small novel written by an author with great promise took me into her arms and felt i was there for it all","245":"so refreshing to read a book written by an author that truly knows how to write i understand others not liking certain aspects of this book with respect to the dogs however great fiction will help you step outside of your world and explore other places that you would never see do i like what they do with the dogs no but i wouldn't stop reading a book because something made me uncomfortable life is uncomfortable sometimes so what it passes i learn things by reading books like this about others and about myself and my perceptions of the world this book was so good and so well written visual and lyrical a gift to the reader get over your own issues and just read the words and listen","246":" 3 75 stars actually this was a difficult book to read very depressing subject matter and very misleading synopsis it was far more about pitbulls fighting than hurricane katrina and i hate any kind of dog fighting and this book was way too soft on raising a dog for such a reason if you raise your dog to fight you do not love that dog period that said there were aspects of the book that made it compelling though difficult to read i hated the poverty adolescent sex drug use etc but i guess that is life in parts of our country which is a very sad statement on america it was an interesting read though and my own only complaint is i would have liked to read more about the aftermath of katrina the hurricane part was only the last 2 chapters and i wanted more not what i expected but worth my time","247":"writing is excellent loved the mythology references especially to my favorite medea i have a new understanding of katrina unimaginable and so why only 3 s it doesn't seem fair but it just was not an enjoyable read was it meant to be probably not i just wanted it to be over and to escape the dire circumstances both human and canine","248":" salvage the bones is a hurricane katrina story that won the 2011 national book award for fiction that's all i knew when i requested a copy from my local library and i figured i couldn't go wrong with reading this book sigh i did i wanted to like it it had all of the right ingredients for a powerful novel characters were conflicted with themselves each other and nature there was room for characters to develop and change throughout the story the backdrop was one of the worst disasters america has ever seen author jesmyn ward has a distinct narrative voice that can be powerful and beautiful at the same time but the story just didn't work for me one reason salvage the bones didn't work for me as a reader is that i didn't know what i was getting myself into i tend to take the 'know as little as possible' approach to books because i want to be surprised by the story as i mentioned all i knew before opening up the book was that it was a hurricane katrina story that won this year's national book award for fiction i wasn't expecting to start the book with a dog birthing her first litter of puppies nor was i expecting the emotional and physical violence inflicted by something other than hurricane katrina usually my approach to books works for me but this is one instance that knowing more would have been better if i was aware of what i was getting into i may have enjoyed it more the other reasons why this book didn't appeal to me stem from the narrative as powerful and beautiful as ward's voice is it barely evoked any emotion in me this was disturbing shouldn't i care that a fourteen year old girl is pregnant and that she views sex as something to give in and have because it's easier than fighting the guys off shouldn't i care that four children lost their mother after giving birth to the youngest sibling and that their father is an absentee dad with a drinking problem shouldn't i care that there isn't enough food in the house or that they don't have any money to buy food in preparation for the hurricane i should have cared but i couldn't bring myself to because it didn't seem like any of these characters cared the only person trying to make his situation better was randall a high school basketball player working toward a scholarship to a basketball camp where college scouts could see him play when his family lost that opportunity for him no one really seemed to care this family lives at a level of poverty that i can't even begin to fathom maybe they had given up resigned themselves to their fate that was the impression i got and it doesn't make for good reading hurricane katrina's role in the narrative isn't what i expected most of the book is spent getting ready for the hurricane to make landfall very little focuses on the wrath she brings and just what this family does to survive the family finally rallied together and fights back fights for their lives and only a handful of pages were dedicated to this harrowing and life changing chain of events then the aftermath of the hurricane is described in a very cold way it seemed like a lot of 'telling' rather than showing the reader how the landscape and inhabitants of this mississippi town were forever scarred by the hurricane again very few pages were dedicated to detailing the devastation these were the aspects of the story that drew me to the book finally the parallels fourteen year old esch draws between herself and 1 her brother's dog china and 2 medea seemed a bit too far fetched maybe these parallels were meant to be that way so readers could see esch was still a child and immature even though she carried her own child or maybe esch making these connections between herself and others is the author's way of showing readers that there is more to esch than what we see and that she has actually has hope for the future i just don't know i think this is one of those books that readers will love or hate there won't be much middle ground these books generate heated debates and intense book discussions reminding me why i love reading and reviewing books even though i give salvage the bones one star out of five i'm sure there are others out there who would give it a five star rating and then some that's the beauty of books each reader reads a book just a bit differently because of who they are what they've experienced and where they are in their lives this book may not work for me now but i could reread this book five years from now and love it this review originally appeared on feeding my book addiction http feedingmybookaddiction blogspo","249":" this is a gorgeous haunting book it's a book that finds you reading at stoplights when walking or driving because you can't set it down it's a book where you don't realize you've been holding your breath for pages until you let it go it's a book that will stay with you long after you've closed the back cover and wiped the tears from your eyes this book is filled with savagery pain sorrow neglect cruelty loneliness and the infectious red mississippi dirt that clings to the character's skin for most of the ten days leading up to hurricane katrina but it is also a book that is filled with heart promise and a sense of pride so incredibly sad perhaps second only to the book thief as one of the saddest books i've read in a long time but absolutely perfect in every sense of the word don't miss this one","250":"i would have given this a 4 star but had a hard time with the dog fighting aspect","251":" this beautifully written book recently won the 2011 national book award for fiction i'm glad i read it but it was sometimes a true challenge not an easy read by any means the subject matter and imagery can be brutal the story concerns an african american family living on the mississippi gulf coast in the days before hurricane katrina the four motherless batiste children live in rural poverty with a neglectful often drunk father each child has his or her own way of escaping the harsh realities of their world fourteen year old esch the narrator is just coming to grips with the fact that she is pregnant a storm is on the horizon for this family both literally and figuratively ward's writing is forceful and poetic the storm scenes in particular are magnificently rendered i think ward is a tremendous young talent and i look forward to reading more from her there were some dog fighting scenes in this novel i could've really lived without although i understand they are a part of the world that ward wanted to present in a realistic fashion","252":" this is a first novel for jesmyn ward and the national book award winner for 2011 esch is a teenager living with her impoverished family in the 'pit' in bois savage mississippi esch lives with her father and three brothers and the novel is the story of her life as hurricane katrina approaches it is an emotionally charged look at how poverty can be utterly devitalize a man and how a family of children cope as they realize they are unable to achieve society's high expectations due to their familial poverty and circumstances this novel is simple to read yet stunning it is a beautiful first novel","253":"gritty hard scrabble life of poverty is the main focus of this novel the characters are really well drawn and the plot is decent the book really picked up steam towards the end with the arrival of hurrican katrina somewhat of a downer but not at the same time strong writing and sense of place made this a standout for me","254":"beautiful descriptive writing such an interesting look at hurricane katrina and its victims","255":"it's a family story and a good one the family is poor black no mother and gets hit by katrina all kinds of things that i find horrible pit bull fighting but the way it's written is a look at a different culture no excuses are attempted loved the characters and the strong bonds between the kids","256":" esch batiste is a fourteen year old girl quickly coming of age in an impoverished coastal mississippi town her mother died several years earlier and she is left to live with her alcoholic father and three brothers the story begins twelve days prior to hurricane katrina the family is busy preparing for the storm as esch experiences her own inner storm she is pregnant the full realization of her pregnancy occurs to esch while watching her brother's beloved pit pull give birth to puppies the theme of motherhood continues to weave itself throughout the story as the batiste children scramble to collect food and protect their home from the impending storm the winner of multiple awards including the national book award for fiction 2011 salvage the bones is an excellent choice for fans of literary fiction the poetic nature of ward's writing along with the emotional telling of one family's endurance will appeal to those who enjoy thought provoking gripping story lines","257":"this book takes place in mississippi as katrina approaches the gulf it is not a book about that event however it is a book about family love struggle and survival the hurricane punctuates much that is happening to esch skeeter junior randall and daddy along with manny rico marquis and big henry china the pit bull is also a central character whose life runs parallel at times to esch's a great read","258":"i liked this gritty distressing story it moved me but did not leave me hopeful and overall i found the writing style effective for the story","259":"loved thanks to rita for the rec","260":"won the national book award but suffers from m f a disease very well written but the plotting is crude and the use of thematic allusions too much medea even for me is overwrought","261":"had a real hard time getting into this book because of its violence by poor i'm glad i finished it because at first i didn't think i would","262":"lyrical prose beautiful writing not comfortable subject matter grinding poverty i loved the characters and found myself crying no don't do that please be careful","263":" this story of a poor louisiana family in the days up to and during hurricane katrina is told by the teenage daughter 'esh' has three brothers and a drunk widowed father a lot of focus is placed on the relationships between esh and her brothers especially skeeter parallels are drawn between the love skeeter has for his fighting white pit bull bitch china and the love esh wishes she had from the neighborhood boy who slept with her even though he has a girlfriend the tone throughout is matter of fact and straightforward by the time the hurricane arrives i found myself surprised to be crying the girl and boys had gotten into my heart without my noticing a quick read touching and somehow in the face of personal and community difficulties esh finds and helps the reader feel hope wow sorry so disjointed but in a hurry as i sometimes am but like to jot down impressions before i get distracted by other books o","264":" think tobacco road but with an african american family in louisiana on the verge of hurricane katrina throw in some faulkner and nathanael west's day of the locust just the cock fighting scenes and you've got this novel it's not bad exactly just super depressing i wouldn't recommend it to anyone even though it was written quite well the bright spot in the lives of this family boils down to skeetah's supreme adoration of his pristine white pit bull china he treats her like an angel descended from heaven well except when he's sending her into a ring to fight to the death if you're not inherently interested in reading about dog fights this is tough one to get behind","265":"i've yet to find words appropriate to describe this book it is exceptional and moving it is a wonderful read and the characters are so intimately written i loved it from beginning to end","266":"outstanding 2nd novel from jesmyn ward one part john steinbeck some part toni morrison salvage the bones is a poetic novel full of heartbreaking plot twists and breathtaking prose \"salvage the bones\" explores family dysfunction and the nature of love a truly beautiful novel by a great great writer","267":"i'm not going to lie i wasn't sure if i'd be able to finish this book not because of the writing but rather the subject matter is pretty hard to delve into teenage pregnancy dogfighting i'm glad i stuck it out though because in the end it was absolutely stunning","268":"beautifully written and lyrical and heartbreaking and so hard to read not exactly what i expected i felt like the book was really language driven rather than plot or character driven and given that the whole thing is building to hurricane katrina there's a lot of plot and that's not usually my thing definitely worth reading though","269":"one of the most moving novels about love i have ever read made me cry at the end thanks jesmyn","270":"this book deals with a number of difficult subjects teen pregnancy abject poverty alcoholism child neglect animal abuse and is set in mississippi as hurricane katrina gathers strength and approaches land i found the story unsettling and difficult even though it is beautifully written the end of the story as the hurricane hits and our rag tag family fights to survive is riveting and kept me reading into the wee hours of the night","271":"i actually liked this book a lot unlike many in the bookclub with whom i read it i thought the setting within the new orleans katrina period was interesting and it helped me to understand how poverty and the daily grind found so many unprepared and flat footed during that crisis","272":"so bleak but with a thread of love running through it that is moving and real gorgeous language and i cried my way through a majority of the last chapter without a doubt one of the best books i've read this year","273":"wonderful and heart wrenching","274":"very very emotionally intense and violent i'm a bit too mentally fragile right now for it but i can definitely appreciate the narrative grace","275":"dark and foreboding but a quick and worthwhile read read the

check it out","277":"disturbing book about a very poor black family living in mississippi in the 10 days leading up to hurricane katrina lots of dysfunction and love within the family since the mother died 7 years before with the children parenting themselves and each other hard to read but worth the effort","278":"ugg this book was so incredibly slow and painful to read i only got about halfway through the book u0026amp decided to throw in the towel had the characters been captivating i would have tried to trudge through the rest of the book","279":"wow this was a beautifully written book with a very visceral quality to it this may be the best novel set around the time of hurricane katrina that i've read","280":"finished stronger than i thought it would good story but slow in spots","281":"award winning fiction writer this book will stay with you for a long time it offers a vivid view of black poverty in southern mississippi the story ends with the coming of a hurricane katrina like storm although the storm's name is never mentioned complex yet simple characters make this a poignant reading experience","282":"i was not interested in this book or the story but read it for my brick and mortar book club i picked it up read one page said i do not want to read this then basically could not put it down again the writing was so compelling and the characters so vivid i was addicted from the first and against my will at that i never felt sorry for any of the character because they did not feel sorry for themselves i feel much more informed of hurricane katrina than i ever did from the seemingly unlimited articles i read newscasts i saw and celebrity testimonials that endlessly assaulted us from the time it hit land wow","283":"just not developed enough storyline and characters were lacking","284":" tell the wolves i'm home is an outstanding coming of age debut novel by author carol rifka brunt set in 1987 it tells the story of eccentric fourteen year old june

secret rivalries this book is a deeply touching and incredibly moving portrait of a family finding their way in the wake of tragedy and a young girl's compassionate courage in the wake of the aids hysteria of the late 1980's","285":"amazing book beautiful prose","286":"the 2011 national book award winner is a story told by a 14 year old woman child living through the hurricane of family at the precise moment katrina moves through ward does a beautiful job exploring her characters painting the bayous of mississippi with a detailed brush characteristic of a good book it leaves the reader wondering what happens next not wanting to be separated from the family you've learned to know","287":"3 leading ladies esch china and katrina compete for their individual stories and ms ward succeeds subtle and gentle ferocious and dangerous they are all these things and characterized beautifully","288":"well written and deep poverty described as best i have seen tragedy dwarfed by more tragedy and then comes katrina the great equalizer one's greatest stroke of luck is their birth circumstance this book is a confirmation of this fact thank your lucky stars if you had a bed to sleep in when you were done reading this novel not a fun read","289":"loved it at first then got bored reminds me of other southern literature","290":"my review here","291":"just read this for book club it's a lovely lyrical book a beautiful story about family and relationships her writing is poetic i feel like i have a much better understanding of what it must have been like to experience katrina as if a friend told me about it","292":"yet another overrated award winner i read the whole thing and while i thought it was clear the author could write could at least describe well i found every single character so despicable that i wanted the hurricane to kill them they steal they abuse animals they get drunk they abuse each other they have irresponsible sex i'm supposed to care about these horrible people when a threat arrives i do not a novel has to give me someone i can like at least a little to root for and in this case there was not a single character i found at all likeable poverty doesn't make people evil lots of people are poor and yet kind responsible and don't abuse animals","293":"won the national book award for 2011 written with raw honesty of a poor family shortly before hurricane katrina the book was full of sadness particularly the children but you could say that about the father as well just a very depressing book a lot of time i think was spent on dog fighting which to me was too descriptive as well as destructive jesmyn ward has a new book a memoir coming out next week which i will read i enjoy her writing just not so much this book","294":"i am already annoyed at the overuse of similes and metaphors i feel like i am reading an episode of family guy ugh i hated this book i am over bad fiction about real life events","295":"an uncompromisingly bleak look at life in bayou like coastal mississippi in the days just prior to the arrival of hurricane katrina jesmyn ward's salvage the bones occasionally soars above the sordid panorama it paints and shimmers with haunting beauty there are a couple of glaring problems though like persistent sour notes at an opera or a nagging toothache that make it tough to wade through to get to the good parts most of the problems stem from ms ward's choice to relate this story through the eyes of esch a wide eyed 14 year old girl she presents this cavalcade of bleakness drunk father deceased mother abject poverty squalor and hunger teen pregnancy dogfighting etc etc capably enough but when she breaks into reveries of greek mythology and jason and medea it rings false and discordant incongruent to her character's behavior the head scratchingly omniscient inexplicably omnipresent esch character could just as easy been relegated to a lesser role and capably replaced by an unknown narrator instead esch's musings get in the way of what is otherwise powerful storytelling","296":"in this her second novel jesmyn ward tells a story that takes on hurricane katrina from the point of view of a poor rural family that lives in a clearing in the woods outside of a poor community a few miles from the gulf a place where flooding isn't likely we see life through the eyes of the one daughter esch who's 15 and in love with one of her brother's friends who takes her body without tenderness mom's dead dad's a drunk who tries to be responsible but isn't up to watching four kids and katrina is on her way together the siblings and the eldest brother's friends form a community trying to figure out how to respond to life as it unfolds meanwhile dad focuses every sober moment trying to prepare for katrina by salvaging what he can a brother's obsessive love for his fighting pit bull and her newborn pups as well as esch's secret pregnancy ground the novel and raise the characters to mythic proportions in fact esch is reading edith hamilton's greek mythology for her assigned summer reading and identifies with medea in this tightly focused beautifully written novel ward shows us that all human beings are the same we struggle with love loyalty fear and loneliness and just like the rain sometimes we nurture and sometimes we destroy","297":"i can definitely understand why this was a national book award winner excellent read","298":"book club october 2012","299":"this book was very difficult to read because the people lived such a hard life and then they had everything taken away i didn't like the parts about dog fighting but it is a real part of life in certain areas of the country and part of the story written by a katrina survivor haunting","300":"what a beautifully written book on more than one tough subject i was immediately drawn in and attached to the characters and was sad when i finished it's a book i will definitely read again","301":" i had such high expectations for this national book award winner the concept sounded exciting a young african americna girl named esch barely a teenager living with her widowed father and three brothers in the poverty stricken coastal area of mississippi discovers she's pregnant a few days before hurricane katrina strikes the looming hurricane provides for some nice dramatic irony as the characters are sure this is just another storm like all the others they've lived through but there's not a whole lot to propel the story forward otherwise the story symbolically revolves around the gleaming white pit bull on the novel's cover she's a new mother named china who is thrown back into the dogfighting ring while still nursing her struggling pups a stand in for esch's mother the dog begins as a quiet metaphor for everything this family wishes it had and ends as a heavy handed clunker especially due to ward's constant references to her gleaming white coat my kindle found a hundred matches for the word nearly one on every other page there are some great passages here in spite of the tedium that pervades most of the narrative and since what i've read about ward and her craft intrigues me i'll probably pick up another of her books at some point i'll probably just need to wait a while to get the taste of china's white so white fur out of my mouth 171","302":"this is one of those books that's hard to talk about because there is so much great happening in it the story is sad and uplifting the conclusion inevitable and unresolved it's a tremendous work and definitely worth the acclaim it's received","303":" the description of this book drew me in and it didn't let me down after reading it i found an interview with jesmyn ward www theparisreview org i had to be more honest about the realities of the community i was writing about after my brother died in the fall of 2000 four young black men from my community died in the next four years from suicide drug overdose murder and auto accidents my family and i survived hurricane katrina in 2005 we left my grandmother's flooding house were refused shelter by a white family and took refuge in trucks in an open field during a category five hurricane i saw an entire town demolished people fighting over water breaking open caskets searching for something that could help them survive i realized that if i was going to assume the responsibility of writing about my home i needed narrative ruthlessness i couldn't dull the edges and fall in love with my characters and spare them life does not spare us","304":"my review at www catsandabook blogspot com","305":"intense book understated in a way that makes the rough parts believable while the book does not directly address race issues it provides an interesting look into race relations and the lives of ordinary black folks in mississippi worth a read","306":"great characters and beautiful writing in this book","307":"this book is a love hate it won the 2011 national book award and well won it was excellent excellent writing wow my paltry words will not do it justice love family warts and all this family has lost their loving mother wife and continue to grieve in their heart breaking dysfunctional ways their love and mourning over their mother wife is part of their daily steps the story is set in the pit the family property and the rag tag community built around basketball pit bull fighting and family the reader wants this family to not only survive hurricane katrina but thrive i'm rooting for you esch hate drugs alcohol not educated how do these people survive and dog fighting really i was absolutely repulsed by their life style it was one of the more difficult reads because of the content teenage pregnancy casual sex dog fighting it was a vivid view of how the others live even though i hated parts of this book i got it this is one of those books which should be read by every american katrina victims should not be forgotten","308":"ward takes you on a twelve

characters also immerse you within their world twhile not a story of non stop action that will keep you on the edge of your seat the plot does draw you onwards salvage the bones is powerful prose within a setting that will resonate throughout the country in compliance with ftc guidelines i'm disclosing that i received this book for free through goodreads giveaways","309":"this book was so good one of the best i've read in a long time highly recommended","310":"okay i've been trying to struggle through this for several days i'm at about 32% on my kindle and i'm done it's well written but just so bleak and depressing i'm too old to spend my precious reading time on something i don't enjoy even if it is a national book award winner","311":"couldn't read the dog fighting scene enjoyed the rest of it","312":"this book made me weep and not for the dogs which seems to have bothered most people in the reviews i've read what these kids endure should never happen but they seem to take it in stride beautifully written","313":"my husband grew up on a small island called st croix located in the us virgin islands so going in to this book i had previously heard many stories about what it's like to prepare for live through and deal with the aftermath of a category 5 hurricane he was on st croix in 1989 when hurricane hugo stalled over the island for 12 long hours taking his family home and stripping the island of almost everything including people's abilities to be good to each other salvage the bones is the story of one family living in the mississippi bayou as hurricane katrina is heading their way the family member seemingly concerned about this hurricane is the alcoholic father everybody else has lived through or known others who have lived through a category 5 hurricane in the past so they remain relatively unconcerned in the days leading up to the hurricane we are able to get a good feel for what this impoverished bayou lifestyle is like the teen daughter of the family esch finds out she pregnant and she has to confront the reality of it one of esch's older brothers takes his dog china to a dog fight and i found myself rather shocked by how much he cared about his animal i would've though people who fought dogs did give a care about the health and welfare of their pets so it's definitely made me look at that piece from a different perspective based on the stories i have heard from my husband and his friends as to the aftermath this story really does end on a good note this is a story of family sticking together during tough times and i found it to be a shining example of how tragedy can bring people together","314":"i almost didn't get off the ground with this book it was recommended to me by a friend and author who has great taste in books which of course means that i usually agree with her so i kept going it was worth every minute of the pain and sadness i felt while i read parts of it sometimes fiction is the most honest form of reporting there is","315":"this review has been hidden because it contains spoilers to view it click here somehow reminds me a lot of as i lay dying by faulkner very descriptive with cruel scenes it was satisfying to find out the reaction of the dad to esch's pregnancy and glad that the family supports one another most heart warming line was when big henry says that the child will have a lot of daddies the book overall was good it lost me in the middle for a while but otherwise the flow was good","316":"i was surprised by how much i enjoyed this book i wasn't expecting it to be as good as it was it was well written some of the imagery was amazing and the final few chapters were so emotionally charged that i was almost in tears recommended","317":"perhaps not the best honeymoon read but a compelling story nonetheless","318":" 'before the storm'china the pit bull is preparing to give birth when jesmyn ward's intensely powerful novel opens in the eyes of esch the young narrator what china is doing is fighting like she was born to do china belongs to esch's brother skeetah who will do all that it takes to keep the pups alive hopefully sell them soon enough china's story will be intertwined with esch's when she discovers that she's pregnant something she copes with quietly if that weren't enough to underscore the theme of motherhood esch reading mythology is caught up in the medea jason legend and looming over the narrative cutting right through it is the mother of all storms katrina on her way in prose as poetic as it gets jesmyn ward weaves a story of love and survival in all their passionate savage and mythological dimensions","319":"splendid writing lukewarm content fluffy summer read","320":"magnificent the best novel i read this year","321":"i was blown away by this novel in trying to describe the writing to myself at the end i thought it's exquisite resolute epic if i had only read the description of the book i wouldn't have chosen to read it but good friends loved it so i wanted to read it there are no phony morals in this novel dogs and mothers die lovers are spurned no insignificant things are described the narrator teenage girl is fascinated by greek myth especially medea and this allows the novel to be stripped to its essence i thought often of the intense and beautiful pasolini film with maria callas as medea the mississippi weather and topography is palpable and terrifying not just the hurricane but the heat bugs sun woods dust bayou i have to stop writing this because i can't do it justice i loved it","322":"outstanding the characters are amazingly deep and shallow","323":"great book very sad though","324":"this is a fine novel well written nicely paced with compelling characters however these ratings are subjective and i demoted it to two stars because of multiple vivid descriptions of cruelty and violence to animals it made it very unpleasant to read although i should have known about the difficult subject matter before i started","325":" what the other is trying to do in this book is remarkable the greek mythology the metaphors and parallelism mostly works the story is about a 15 year old girl in 2005 mississippi the book takes place in 10 days before the storm during and one day after hurricane katrina the girl and her family 3 brothers and a father are very poor out on the bayou and the author doesn't pull any punches these kids are dealing with alcoholism teen pregnancy poverty so poor that you don't even think about vaccinating your dogs etc but the descriptive writing is pretty remarkable and the books pace is mostly right on this is one author to watch","326":"at the beginning of this book the narrator esch mentions she has read faulkner's as i lay dying it's a nod to what the reader is getting into the grief of a family the heavy spanish moss draped dirt covered setting the rich language except this family is african american i loved esch's changing perspective on her brothers and herself and even her father as the storm and other circumstances strip them of those things that are meaningful to them skeetah's puppies born to his prize pit bull china randall's chance for a basketball scholarship junior's innocence her own hopes for love from manny the boy who made her pregnant and her father's control over his family they are stripped of what little they have own too as katrina devestates their community still in the end they have each other they have a sense of hope they have skeetah's friend big henry's care my only problem with the book is the way i had to suspend belief about the voice being esch's she's not a dumb girl she loves reading edith hamilton's rendition of greek myths but this isn't a 14 year old's voice by any means so why put this in first person yes yes immediacy and all that but i think this could have been done in an authorial third person voice sticking close to esch and come across as more believable still this was a rich read and it had me even when i didn't think i'd like to read about certain things a dog fight for instance just couldn't put it down","327":"another book club book if this had not been a bookclub book i never would have touched it i hated the subject matter and the end was depressing","328":"i couldn't finish it because i couldn't find the plot i was over 50% in and couldn't decide why to keep reading","329":"i appreciated that this was a book set in the deep south about hurricane katrina but i never really could get into it until near the end and even then it wasn't enough to save the book in my eyes i just didn't warm up to any of the characters i would have probably enjoyed the book more of it was devoted more to the hurricane and it's aftermath","330":" this book isn't perfect but there is something really special about it it's just so vital it breathes with life the characters are great especially the protagonist a poor black 15 year old girl in coastal mississippi who finds out at the beginning of the book that she's pregnant oh yeah and katrina is coming there's a serious beasts of the southern wild vibe going on minus the whole post apocalyptic element sure there are reasons not to love this stylistic sometimes the author doesn't know when to stop with the similes and metaphors and substantive upsetting subject matter not for the faint of heart but look if a book that prominently features pit bull fights can win me and my animal loving heart over it's doing something right","331":"if i could give it more stars i would","332":"scenes from from this book still haunt me","333":"this book was just ok i found the dog fighting disturbing on the other hand i found the details of hurricane katrina gripping and this part of the book hard to put down","334":"its very intense i have to read it in small doses its very good but alarming because i know what is going to happen but i don't know how the author will get me there wow really amazing","335":"the best part of this book was the last two chapters when something besides watching a dog actually happens unfortunately by that time i was so sick of the voice of the novel i didn't have it in me to do more than skim read this book really made me ponder what the purpose is of metaphors when i read anything else i would find myself noticing the metaphors and thinking is this a good metaphor does this metaphor make any sense is it a needed metaphor does this metaphor end when it should or does it go on and on and on and most importantly is this metaphor really necessary","336":"gritty account of one family's experience in the days leading up to and following hurricane katrina the plot involves dog fighting which i could have gone without reading","337":"brilliant fiction writing about some of the most poverty ridden people of our country people who have each other but not much else it's the each other that survives all the storms real and otherwise in this work i liked hurricane katrina's presence as the anti hero in this greek myth of a story from deepest backwater mississippi i'd have missed reading this book had a friend not loaned it to me i'm glad i read it and look forward to future work from jesmyn ward","338":"an extremely poor family prepares for hurricane katrina in mississippi totally harrowing","339":"salvage the bones is a complex story of love loss and hope shattered restored and expectant anticipation is a key theme set within the context of preparation for hurricane katrina there is an underlying sense of impending doom that threatens but never completely overcomes tenacity and hope the central character esch struggles with hoped for love even as she is ultimately held safe within the fierce love of her father and brothers","340":"did this just win a book award i think it did and why i added it to my to read pile i really like the feeling of this woman's writing it's so deep and hits you so hard i can't say the subject matter was super enticing at first a poor black family living in rural mississippi a few days before katrina hits but by book's end i felt so close to them in the last few chapters when the storm hit i couldn't put the book down i was in the attic with them as the water was rising up and i felt so emotionally connected i nearly started to cry and i am not a book crier this book is totally different and totally great read it","341":"the reference to as i lay dying sets the stage for a lot of dysfunction and unhappiness it actually ended a bit better than i thought it would i think this one will stick with me in a week i might add a star to my review","342":"although it won the national book award it was a book more for young adults than adults told by a teenage girl before and during hurricane katrina the book presents an authentic voice narration and tells the sad story of her life","343":"i thought this book took a while to get going but once it sunk it's teeth into me it wouldn't let go the last 100 pages were some of the most enjoyable fiction i've read in a long time i'm interested to see where this author goes next","344":"set just prior to hurricane katrina this is a gripping novel that follows a young teenage girl and her three brothers who live with their father in a poverty stricken area of rural mississippi though some parts of the book were difficult to read especially those dealing with dog fighting i really got sucked into the story and know that these characters will stick with me for a very long time as soon as i finished reading it i was sad it was over and wished that it had a sequel","345":" for the full review go to wellreadwife comsalvage the bones is told through the eyes of fourteen year old esch the story begins with china a pitbull giving birth to a litter of puppies in what is one of the most vivid birthing scenes i have read since the red pony by john steinbeck esch reminisces about the birth of her brother junior that resulted in her mother's death while watching china struggle to deliver her puppies the scene is both beautiful and tragic and sets the tone perfectly for the rest of the novel from there ward writes of twelve days in the life of the batiste family and within those twelve days a startling portrait of a life of poverty in the modern south is portrayed first there is esch at fourteen she has just found out that she is pregnant and she is scared there is randall who dreams of being scouted for college ball and then there is skeetah skeetah loves his pitbull china and cares for her the way a father cares for a child yet he risks china's life in dog fights all of the action leads up to hurricane katrina's arrival on the coast","346":" in many respects this is a really good novel and i'm thankful my friend pushed me to read it i had been put off by comments about how emotionally upsetting the story can be true i view most pulitzer prize winning fiction with suspicion still will i was inhibited by this book's much trumpeted status as the best katrina novel not true in the balance though my time has been well spent these characters were very believable to me they are not like anyone i know well but i have met people in these circumstances over the years ward makes many brave choices regarding their motivations desires and behaviors many of the things they say or do are rather ugly but she was unflinching and i understood them i cannot honestly say that i wouldn't make the same choices if placed in the same situations with the same very limited coping strategies the one thing i consistently found distracting was the use of a rural fairly uneducated teen girl as a narrator with a voice that does not ring true anyone who would say i'ma tell randall 'bout you would not use words like admonition garotte florid or fulcrum she would not describe her yard as refuse laden or the sweat on her lover's face as running off unimpeded esch may be reading the jason medea myth but that doesn't give her a sorceress' way with language","347":" i think this is an important book for anyone to read since it portrays a slice of american life that can be easily ignored a poor black family living in rural mississippi the characters are raw and real the imagery and symbolism are stunning what is more the insight into their plight during hurricane katrina is heartbreaking and the truest indictment of the federal and state governments i've heard as someone who studies vulnerable populations for a living this book should punch all my literary buttons however i found myself dreading sitting down to read it which possibly speaks to its visceral authenticity while emotionally challenging at a merciful 250 pages it's worth casting aside my desire for literary escapism kate morton et al to read something truly meaningful for a change","348":"i almost put this book away after reading the first couple of chapters but since the writing was better than just ok i kept on going i'm glad i did i wound up liking the book so much on so many levels that i'm thinking of presenting it to my book club for one of our readings there are many aspects to this poor black rural family and their story that beg to be discussed and analyzed the story is a fictional slice of life based upon actual events and the writing turned out to be excellent this is not a pretty book and it does not have a happy ending but then the main character is hurricane katrina who doesn't even appear until the last chapter this is a serious book that deserves to be read discussed and remembered","349":"an odd book but there was something about it that i liked and made me keep reading not much happens until the end","350":"this book was not one of my faves but it did have a lot going for it the slang speaking parts were well written and the content was very visual the story was sad but not heart wrenching i felt for the characters but never became totally immersed i had a hard time relating","351":" this novel is incredibly beautiful and utterly heart breaking it takes place over a series of 12 days leading up to hurricane katrina in a very poor coastal town in mississippi the main characters are four siblings who lead a mostly unsupervised and impoverished life in a wild wooded area they call the pit their lives revolve around finding food dog fights and basketball the 15 yr old daughter esch is also pregnant honestly this book is hard to read and hard to put down haunting eloquent moving and disturbing if you have a low tolerance for pain suffering violence and heartbreak then don't pick this one up this one will remain in my memory for a long time to come","352":"haunting brutal and glaringly real","353":" for me the novel got off to a slow start and i considered bailing on it i am so glad i didn't never in my life have i read a book that maintained such a strong sense of foreboding from start to finish as this one did someone i know who read it called it harrowing i'll see your harrowing and raise you to menacing the prose was incredible crafted so beautifully so vivid so full of poetry and yet i raced through it my shoulders tense my fingers forever in my nibbling mouth so on edge was i at what might happen on any page hurricane katrina looms throughout making its destructive landfall in the last 30 pages or so of the book but it wasn't the storm that i was afraid of i came to really care for the brothers and sister in the book looking out for one another amidst the poverty of the bayou a mother long dead a father who has abandoned them in almost every way all i can say is wow","354":"best book i read this year can't wait to teach it","355":"this book is a little hard to read not because it isn't beautifully written but because of the subject poverty abuse of children and animals fear loss destruction but there is also family and love it is hard to believe that in a country as rich and powerful as the us that people still live like this it is shameful","356":"captivating a tragic but beautiful story of children living in rural poverty facing a life or death situation and coming of age a complex portrayal of family siblings friends enemies loyalty birth death and hope i am eager to read more by ward","357":"i really did not like this book it only got 2 stars instead of 1 because i ultimately appreciated the end part when hurricane katrina finally hit finally i thought this whole book was about the hurricane but only the end part was which would have been fine if the rest of the plot had been remotely interesting but i just found it all very tedious i only finished it because it was such a quick read and i kept waiting for the storm to hit it's not that the author is not a good writer but i just personally really disliked the writing style holy metaphor batman she could not refrain from using overwrought overly flowery metaphors and similes constantly if they had edited out all her metaphors and similes it would have been a 50 page and much better book it felt like an overexcited high school creative writing student just learned about metaphors and similes and went way overboard with it also there was a 30ish page scene of a dogfight that i just pretty much completely skipped disappointing","358":"originally a two star book for me but my book club conversation convinced me to bump it up to a three star the relationship between the brothers and sister is quite nicely drawn and you don't often get books about people living in poverty where the characters aren't only their financial status so that was all good i just wished more happened it was a book i appreciated more than enjoyed","359":"this is the kind of book i wish i had a book club to discuss the most interesting thing to me was how the author was able to build tension with hurricane katrina coming without having to say a thing the reader knows i'll think about this one for a while","360":" i didn't like this book at first it is set across the span of 8 days i think and it started with this slow sad creep almost how i feel in the extreme heat set in the days before katrina and a family that scavenges its existence i was drawn in by day 3 poverty and childhood and love and family these are the kinds of books i wish were read in schools to help me understand other realities and the power of the written word ms ward is a gift the kind of prose that feels like poetry beautiful","361":"i went into salvage the bones expecting a lot and sadly came away disappointed the story is told by esch a poor very poor 15 year old girl in rural very rural louisiana it is a story of dog fighting hurricane katrina and ultimately love i just did not buy some of it and found esch's voice at times phony perhaps if i had not read this right after the glass castle a true story of a similar childhood that was 100% believable","362":" there is much to admire in this novel it's intensely physical and i like that in fiction i like an awareness of bodies and places ward also writes vividly and often with both guts and grace the story is focused and dramatic i did sometimes feel as though ward was trying a little too hard to lift the story with its connections to jason and medea and other elements of greek myth and the impassioned prose felt a bit strained to me now and again but it's a good book and its central affections particularly between skeetah and his dog china are unforgettable","363":"an american tragedy based on a greek tragedy interesting idea and execution but very depressing writing is excellent","364":"an emotionally raw and gripping novel about the hardships in rural mississippi and how far a family will go to survive set against the landfall of hurricane katrina the book alternates with the emotion of the author's future and the brutality of animal fighting and mother nature it can be hard to read certain parts but the story in itself is ultimately believable and sad great first novel by the author","365":" i'll admit that this book did not grab me from the beginning i had a hard time dealing with esch's passivity and the lack of a strong female character in this male dominated world even china the pit bull is masculine in her motherhood but as the story progresses and you get to know this family you realize that the loss of their mother seven years ago is both what hardened them and brought them together esch is a much deeper character than i first gave her credit for she is lonely and empty but full of misdirected love and passion she is real i read the last hundred pages of this book furiously as katrina began to show her strength and ugliness and threatened to destroy the roots that held this family together although the hurricane only takes place over one chapter of this book you realize at the end that it's been there all along threatening the heavy humidity that hangs over the first ten chapters is the pressure on this family getting ready to break ward's writing is poetic and beautiful and the setting of the story is a character in itself it is not just poor rural mississippi but another world which is foreign and old fashioned but never stereotypical she does an excellent job of creating characters who are highly flawed yet impossible not to empathize with even the father who appears at the beginning to be little more than a useless drunk becomes a man whose life has been crushed by the death of his wife and the responsibility of raising four children this is a book that will leave a lump in your throat during its final chapters and stay with you after it's done there will be parts you want to read over and over again and parts you want to skim over so quickly for their ugliness this is a book about the hurricane we all know but it gives experiences and faces to the victims that we may have only seen glimpses of on tv or in photographs","366":"i was really interested in reading about this book because i thought it was going to talk about life before and after the hurricane for the people that lived through it book was almost over before hurricane hits and ends shortly after more than you ever want to know about pit bulls and dog fighting","367":"very very painful book to get through the family had so many struggles even before katrina hit but their powerful love for each other was always there beautifully written","368":"for about the first half of the book i didn't care about the characters but by the end the book had built up character development and suspense the ending was very moving i had to take about a half hour to get my emotions under control very powerful novel","369":"took me a while to get into it but once i did i was hooked","370":"yes this book is very raw however it is written so poetically that it takes away from the rawness emotional read but a great book","371":" this is a book that will stay with you long after you finish reading it reminds me of faulkner or steinbeck even dickens with its well drawn characters in a period of 12 days we meet junior esch randall big henry skeeter and many others who live in mississippi prior to hurricane katrina as the motherless children who live with their father try to go about their daily lives their father who is seemingly emotionally absent tries to ready their house for the hurricane he hears about on the television the mood is stark and the writing taut it is just like a train wreck you know something bad is going to happen but you just can't look away","372":"this book brought the reality of hurricane katrina to life through the eyes of a 14 year old girl i actually looked up while reading last night and felt like i was in the hurricane i was actually surprised it wasn't raining torrentially outside great descriptive writing","373":" i hemmed and hawed on my review for this first i intended to give it 4 stars i tend to reserve 5 for really enjoyable guilty pleasures and books so beautifully done they are without flaw peer complaint but it's a national book award winner and because i'm a black woman writer myself who has yet to publish a full length book i have to be careful of being too harsh a critic out of sheer envy so i bumped it to 5 but then i gave myself a full 24 hours to sit with my reaction and let it settle we're back to 4 it gets high marks for its poeticism so many turns of phrase seemed fresh memorable sparkling there's a scene where skeetah whispers to his prized pitbull and i just loved it i loved that character ward does a fantastic job of making him seem feral but not insomuch that he can't gauge the value of his family's lives over his beloved dog's it's a close call but still katrina as an ominous promise also works in the first 2 3 of the book but it's in the execution and aftermath that the conceit doesn't live up to its promise i also didn't care for the extended medea jason metaphor but i mean i get it so it wasn't too distracting for those saying that the esch's purple prose flowery poetic language didn't match her spoken dialogue and thus made her an unrealistic unreliable narrator i let that slide because growing up my thought life interior language was a lot more eloquent than it translated in conversation still does now that i think about it","374":"i read two books about hurricanes during hurricane tropical storm sandy this one and their eyes were watching god both showed me what awful power a big hurricane can have and what heroic strength it can take to survive it but both were as much about family as the storm this one covers 9 days of hurricane katrina mostly the time preceding the storm it takes place in a very small rural african american community in mississippi the central characters are the three children of a motherless family their pit bull terrier and their mostly non participating dad if i said any more i'd spoil it for you","375":"meh last 20% or so was good","376":"interesting read it did give a great depiction of life of people effected before hurricane katrina a lot of good thought about family with great imagery about protecting loved ones whether people or animals had some very subtle messages about caretaking and motherhood overall a good but not great read for me","377":"if this book wasn't so well written i couldn't have stayed with it the main characters are three teenagers living in the louisiana bayous doing their best to raise themselves and their younger brother their mother died giving birth to the youngest and their father is an alcoholic who can barely take care of himself they subsist on ramen potted meat and eggs from their chickens their teeth are rotting from lack of dental care the 14 year old narrator has just discovered she's pregnant by a friend of her brother's who's using her for sex and that's not even getting into the dog fighting subplot all this happens in the week leading up to hurricane katrina besides the writing i was impressed by the devotion these siblings showed for each other and the fun they made in the woods surrounding their decaying home a tough read but a rewarding one","378":"interesting read especially if you've been to louisiana","379":" \"you have to read this book \" that message seemed to be everywhere - book bloggers critical reviews national book award my own mother the novel's description contains all elements i love - young female narrator brutal circumstances rural setting i was not at all put off by the constant warnings of savage and emotional in fact those are the very words i used to describe some of my favorite books once upon a river girlchild or ten thousand saints but i continued to put off reading this book until my mother finally put the paperback edition into my hands and said \"read this you'll love it \"my mom is rarely wrong but for the first half of this book i could not engage with the story or the characters set in bois sauvage mississippi in the days leading up to hurricane katrina we meet esch 14 years old pregnant and the only female in a world of a drunken father 3 brothers and a group of male \"friends\" with whom she has sex indiscriminately as we follow her story we also meet her brother skeetah determined to raise his prized pit bull's new litter to bring their family money through dog fighting i know i'm supposed to love the savage beauty of all of this but i could not find the emotional pulse i was sad for ech and her circumstances but not heartbroken because i didn't connect with her despite the lyrical prose i did not feel the impending peril of the hurricane i really think i missed something because it wasn't until 100 pages in to the book that i realized jesmyn ward was brilliantly crafting a metaphor between esch's search for love and skeetah's love for his pit bull china to give life is to know what's worth fighting for and that's love once i understood what the author was going for i fell into this novel hard and finished the rest in a day it could also be that as the storm grew closer the pace of the action also picked up all of the strands that ward has carefully set down before the reader began to unfurl and collide picking up steam and intensity just like the storm and ultimately i was broken hearted and in awe of esch and skeetah as they fought their way through poverty abandonment and natural calamity we never stopped crying we just did it quieter we hid it i learned how to cry so that almost no tears leaked out of my eyes so that i swallowed the hot salty water of them and felt them running down my throat this was the only thing we could do i swallow and squint through the tears and i run i still think that \"savage bones\" would be a more appropriate title than \"salvage the bones \" jesmyn ward never lets up or backs off which i admire she also writes a perfectly fitting ending so rare and brave ultimately this novel does not make my \"you must read this book\" list but i get the attention and critical acclaim they are well deserved note i'm not sure i could recommend this book to any animal lovers given its brutal depictions of dog fighting","380":"heartbreaking and beautiful all at once","381":"excellent excellent excellent i'm not a fan of dog books but i so loved skeetah esch randall junior and all the pit residents a short novel read it one night","382":"i chose this book after hearing an interview with the author the novel takes place in rural mississippi just before and during hurricane katrina the details of abject poverty can make the story difficult to read at times but the characters keep you coming back for more not a light book at all but overall truly memorable","383":"a compelling story with richly developed characters so real i'm going to miss them jesmy ward has a soft nonjudgmental way of describing inequality that shows a true understanding of human nature this is the kind of book you need to wait a day to fully digest before you move onto a new one","384":"this book was different than some others i've read and i enjoyed it very much it's based on 12 days building up to katrina the mother dies early and the father has to raise the kids on his own the one son loves his dog and the dog plays an important role in the book the sister discovers she is pregnant and she has to find a way to deal with and tell her father","385":"this book won the national book award although i enjoyed it i'm not sure it would have been my pick the hard life of the family poor and hit by hurricane katrina are heart wrenching the dogs in the book are major characters and move the story and emotions forward","386":" in the bayou in the days leading up to hurricane katrina esch and her family have many preparations to make but she and her brothers aren't as concerned about the storm that is supposedly coming as their daddy is they have basketball games pit bull fights and sex to keep them busy i enjoyed the many complex relationships described between esch and her brothers and their friends between skeetah and china as they go about their lives in the shadow of the approaching storm and in the cloud of their mother's memory","387":"an interesting yet sad story to read","388":"this national book award fiction winner last year comes through shining it concerns 12 daysin the lives of the batiste family in bois sauvage mississippi it is only a few miles backfrom the gulf coast and they prepare for and miraculously endure hurricane katrina the motherdied in childbirth about seven years

powerful story about familial love andendurance you can almost smell the red dirt and pine trees ward is so exact in her portraiture highly recommend","389":" a good book i read it fast on the fading days of march break and enjoyed it i felt a vivid description of the heat the forest the dog fights the approaching menace of hurricane katrina sweet esch with her budding belly feeling like water pulling her to earth and her family anchoring her on a tree awash in a flood i want her to love big henry because you know he loves her but like so many of us we fall for the golden boy with no soul lots of water imagery lots of blood of the familial kind and the fatal kind good i liked it","390":"about a family living in the southern bayou right before during and immediately after hurricane katrina the author has a wonderful style of writing the dog fighting aspect was difficult for me","391":"this woman can write and she knows it this sometimes causes her beautiful prose to go on for longer than is necessary to create an interesting narrative fascinating tale of a girl coming of age in a world falling apart worth reading but skip a couple of the middle bits","392":"staggeringly beautiful prose i am in awe of jesmyn ward's talent","393":"this is a story a out a 15 year old who is pregnant it takes place before during and just after hurricane katriana the only book of this type i've seen i am reading it now to see if i can read it aloud to my high school students they are mature street smart in many ways they have learning disabilities and reading is so difficult for them i want to find a book that will get them excited about the story line i am not sure yet","394":"easy read about a life very different than my own","395":"recommended really would have rated a 3 5 because there were some slow parts good insight into rural poor mississippi living should answer the question why didn't they just leave for folks who kept asking that after katrina","396":"amazing and gut wrenching","397":"loved this story of a family dealing with lots of things hurricane katrina among them great writing that stays with you","398":" i added salvage the bones to my \"to read\" list based 95% on the cover art i have found that with wine and books if i like the label i usually enjoy what's inside this book was no exception this family tragedy is beautifully written maintaining a steady pace even in chapters with more idleness than action ward certainly has a way with words expertly using an epic storm to tell the story of a broken family and the tempest building within their own walls full review http books4shiggles blogspot com","399":"not for the squeamish but what an amazing book wonderful writing vivid characters and unforgetable situations i finished listening to it today and had to sit in a parking lot and cry for awhile just to process all the feelings it brought up so happy it won the national book award would have been perfect for the pulitzer too","400":"good story i had hoped it would take us past katrina","401":"this was a difficult book to read but the language and the imagery were amazing winner of the 2011 national book award","402":" this book really took me out of my comfort zone and i think that's good for all of us occasionally one of the main story lines is about a young man and his relationship with his dog how close they are and she is his whole world but he also fights her in an illegal dogfighting ring it's set in mississippi which i didn't know when i bought it it was very tough to read at times because of the dog fighting yet the story was beautifully written and the way the writer describes a scene is fabulous i recommend this to those with a strong stomach but are looking for a different perspective on a topic no one likes","403":"i loved the characters and the descriptions but i wanted more i wanted it to last much more than 12 days","404":"loved this story and the way it was written and told but the ending left me wanting something more","405":"this book has too many similes like high school poetry see what i did there","406":"this novel is beautiful and tragic but strangely hopeful as well ward's depiction of an impoverished family living on the gulf coast on the eve of hurricane katrina manages to capture both the desperate nature of those without resources or the hopes of attaining any as well as the unrelenting loyalty of people who owe nothing to anyone outside their immediate circle of family and friends","407":"the dog fighting scenes were pretty tedious but i must admit that i found the last 2 chapters pretty impressive","408":"i didn't finish this book in fact i only read about 30 pages and just couldn't take it i rarely quit a book and i've never quit after so few pages i probably didn't give it a fair chance but i really really found it repulsive","409":"a book that makes me care about the fate of a pit bull trained to fight has to be something special i experienced katrina from a safe distance incredibly moving to follow the experience of a family with next to nothing as it braves the storm","410":"wonderful extraordinary engages to the last page","411":"a sad story with a twinge of hope so beautifully told","412":"i've read a lot about hurricane katrina and new orleans this was a fresh perspective of a family living in the mississippi gulf coast leading up to and living through the storm","413":"$25 for a lost book and wasn't prepared to pay yet in the first half i felt like the author was trying too hard to be poetic also i couldn't figure out who the characters were the protagonist esch lives in a neighborhood full of boys about half of them are her brothers and the other half are just family friends it took me about half the book to figure out who was who it got bette took me forever to get into this book only reason i kept plodding through was because i owe the library $25 for a lost book and wasn't prepared to pay yet in the first half i felt like the author was trying too hard to be poetic also i couldn't figure out who the characters were the protagonist esch lives in a neighborhood full of boys about half of them are her brothers and the other half are just family friends it took me about half the book to figure out who was who it got better at the end when the hurricane came the author put away most of her florid language and just told the story which was much better she did a good job of portraying the uneasiness of the beginning of the storm and then the ensuing panic that must have set in when the people realized just how wrathful and relentless katrina was nevertheless i can only muster 2 stars","414":" this is a really wonderful book about the pain of growing up the setting in mississippi in the days leading up to hurricane katrina make a really atmospheric tense setting the story is about a 16 year old girl called esch who along with her three brothers is trying to survive day to day in a poor area of their little town their dad is a drunk who when he's not fretting about and preparing for the hurricane is largely absent and their mother is dead esch and her three brothers all try in their own ways to find the love and acceptance lacking from their parents and to find a means of escape esch is pregnant by a boy who doesn't love her it's a wonderful powerful book about growing up family different kinds of love and what really holds us together it's really quite a grim gritty read in places but the warmth and humanity and vulnerability of the characters shines through","415":"set in mississippi at the time of katrina","416":"mississippi native ward tells the story of a poor family in a coastal area mississippi town in the days leading up to hurricane katrina a difficult story but well written","417":" do you remember those books you had to read in high school the ones that were painfully drawn out and wordy and the plot wasn't very exciting but you knew that it was supposed to be a good book and that maybe you just weren't intellectual enough to appreciate it that's how i felt about salvage the bones the reason i wanted to read this was because of all the accolades ward received for this novel in particular the 2011 national book award but as i was getting into reading the story it just didn't hold my attention you can tell instantly that ward has a great deal of talent and that the book is extremely well written but there were so many things that turned me off the characters the far fetched drama in so few days the contrast between how beautifully the narrator narrates the events and how incorrectly she actually speaks in the end i felt that it was a well written book with a not so good plot i would recommend that someone who is interested give the book a shot but not to have high expectations","418":"at first i thought it was a good story about a family from a culture which i was not familiar with but that not a lot was happening after i finished the book i thought about it a lot and realized that a lot happened","419":"amazing artistic work especailly loved the mythological references the characters are well developed and you buy into their difficult lives never thought i'd like a pit bull and root for it but i did astute use of figurative language it caused the setting to come alive the climatic chapter was so engaging i worried and fretted for the protagonists as katrina swirled around them just a great book","420":"fifteen year old poor pregnant girl waits for hurricane katrina to hit along with her three brothers and drunk father there was no way this was going to be an uplifting read","421":"i am determined to find my edith hamilton","422":" this a beautiful but disturbing book disturbing because i won 20 free copies that i wanted to give away to my students however although the protagonist is a teenage girl it is not young adult fiction if i gave it away to these eighth graders i am afraid i would have to face some angry parents administrators and teachers i don't believe in censorship of any kind and i read much worse stuff at that age but i do remember getting banned from the adult section of the library because some librarian ratted me out to my parents any ideas on to whom i could give these books","423":"this is the story of a family in mississippi a family who struggles daily and their preparations for hurricane katrina esch the fifteen year old female narrator has three brothers and so desperately seeks male approval and the avoidance of disapproval she discovers she's pregnant after a few encounters with her brothers friend their mother is deceased and their father is an alcoholic the four kids are largely on their own but their father does start preparations for the hurricane his preparations of course are meager in the face of category 5 katrina family loyalty dog fighting struggle and survival and strength and poetry the story is written with wonderful metaphors so the reader sees and experiences everything along with esch definitely worth reading and underlining passages","424":"oh this is a tough one i was recommended this book and probably had quite high expectations for it but it was slightly disappointing the writing is beautiful and i can see why it won the national book award but it just wasn't as great as i hoped it would be please see my full review at http bibliobeth wordpress com","425":"a beautiful book at times this book was so raw and powerful that it was hard to read but the story and the characters were so masterfully created that i wouldn't hesitate to recommend this book to everyone i know","426":"powerful beautifully written like a fierce poem","427":"beautiful and heartbreaking it's set around hurricane katrina but the themes are timeless and this book feels like a classic","428":" the description of this book didn't much interest me but i was waiting for several other tournament of books contenders to get here so i decided to give this one a try and it hooked me from the outset the narrator esch is a wonderful person with whom to spend the 12 days in the story her strength and the rich relationships with all the men and boys in her life are fascinating my favorite thing about the way the story is told is how the dialogue is slowly spoiled out with reflections and background information revealed between two statements spoken aloud it's a device that creates a wonderful pace to the book that both slows time down and propels the reader forward to find out what is said next and i loved how rich the depiction of place is i'm rarely someone who has a clear mental picture of the characters or setting of a book but i had a very strong image of the exterior and interior places in this world which made the transformation of it all in the last chapter after hurricane katrina has destroyed everything feel all the more significant","429":"very well written","430":"i had such an emotional reaction to this book it was brutal and hard to read at times the dog fight but so intense even if you haven't been in a natural disaster before it will feel like you have after reading this she is so accurate in her description of how it sounds and feels amazing","431":"i'm not really sure how i feel about this book it's compelling enough that i wanted to finish the book but i also found myself skimming and getting bored the language and descriptions are lovely at times especially in describing terrible things and i like that juxtaposition however i often wondered if this language and insight was true to the 15 year old narrator on the other hand i think much of it is done well particularly some of the obsession that esch the narrator deals with in being pregnant in pondering what it is to be a mother in loving hating the father of her baby i also felt like the book had a very slow pace it seemed to work well in the beginning the summer days are drawn out and no one really seems to be doing much but it did lead me to skimming and i may have missed out on some of the nice description that i usually adore in books","432":"i wish i could have given this book 3 1 2 stars it is undeniably well written but it just wasn't enjoyable in any way for me there is a lot of focus on one of the brothers and his pit bull which i found kind of repulsive the sister is a well drawn character the description of the hurricane and its aftermath is vivid and intense still it leaves me with a bad feeling","433":" these characters are hard won and their emotional responses and interactions portrayed so accurately i fell in love with all of them this novel unfolded seamlessly and there is some amazing imagery the only thing i couldn't get on board with was the ongoing allusion to the the greek myth about medea it would have been fine as a throwaway line one or two mentions at most as esche sees parallels between it and her life but it gets too much room on the page for a story that stands well enough alone without it","434":"soooooo sad didn't like the dog fighting katrina was an interesting character in her own right i didn't live nor hate the book just super depressing in every way possible but then again nothing humorous came from hurricane katrina","435":"this is a beautifully written book but the content is hard to digest it does provide our teachers with the opportunity to discuss the history of hurricane katrina which many of our students remember","436":"i did enjoy the book and the author clearly has talent the descriptions of the hurricane and the dog fighting were very vivid and made you feel present the general story was fairly predictable and seemed a little to indebted to toni morrison for my complete satisfaction not sure that the book deserves the awards it received this year","437":"this is beautifully written but is a grim story of grinding poverty in the south which is made worse yet by hurricane katrina's destruction it's a wrenching story of family dysfunction and parental neglect alongside dog fighting rings and teenage pregnancy memorable but not for the faint of heart","438":"i likes this book skimmed a little but would recommend","439":" as i've said for months this may have been the hardest book i have ever read it was so challenging because of all the places your emotions are taken to as you read of the heroine's struggles this book that took me months to complete because of the multiple breaks i felt were necessary for me to take from it only covered the span of a few days in time the characters ring true the setting rings true the situations are ones you've been through one of the most artful aspects of the book were the allusions to greek mythology the medea story ies particularly it is brutal hard tragic and you'll be so glad you read it i recommend it to everyone","440":" jesmyn ward has done well to author an authentic text detailing the backwoods experience of a family preparing for hurricane katrina the novel has generational elements chronicling a sort of lived family history in a small community in mississippi the novel receives much criticism for its focus on dogfighting and early teen sex it must be noted that the inclusion of these elements is supposed to stir the audience ward is writing of rural poverty in the same way dickens or nelson algren would illustrate urban poverty her book says this is a reality for some people this is a narrative i know well ward's writing is beautiful poetic and succinct her prose may be both breathless or slowly moving like the tertiary winds of an oncoming hurricane this is a wonderful novel of place a brief insight into southern poverty and a tightly knit political commentary on hurricane katrina her criticism is not terribly overt but embedded into the day to day events the batiste family endures great read great novel","441":"poignant story i really appreciated the sibling relationships and the way they all stuck together i don't know if my high school students will lilke this book though","442":"esch talks a lot about the mythology book she is reading making comparisons to her family but i really couldn't follow it very well had to skim parts about dog fights book was well written but just too depressing for me i couldn't get to really like any of the characters it was especially sad how esch felt she always had to have sex with any guy at all she felt it was easier to just say yes but she really did like manny started having sex at 12 w marquis who was 13 not sure what title of book means other than the salvaging they had to do after hurricane but i guess throughout the book they were always salvaging things i got mixed up with some of the names of the characters involved in the dog fighting not sure which were people names and which were dog names","443":" overall i am very in like with this book the character development in my opinion was lacking and i found it difficult to become attached to any one character in the book despite having been a destitute mother myself what made this book was the authors particular writing style as expressed through the main character her style while lending to the overall appeal of the text was thick as molasses and so seemed to weight it heavily at times making it difficult to drudge through the same styled lines repeated so often they make they reader feel gluttonous with the sticky sap of them i doubt i would read this book again but on a whim and stranded with nothing else to read it does the job by keeping those pages turning","444":"be warned there is a significant amount of graphic dog fighting","445":"i couldn't finish it wonderfully lyrical but felt sensationalist privilege porn also too many similes","446":"i loved every word it's a beautiful rich story heavy with heartache and language and blood and dirt and family and i will likely re read it many times before i leave this life you should read it too like right now","447":"what a read gripping plaintive horrific and tender a first novel by a talented young writer","448":"with the hype and awards that came with this book when i picked it up though i had been eye ing it at the book store before hearing the accolades the recommendations are what pushed me over the edge to pick it up for a little while i thought i was going to be let down but in the end i was not at all if you are looking for a plot driven novel look elsewhere this is not the story for you but about halfway through the book i found i couldn't put it down the story is about an impoverished family in southern mississippi as hurricane katrina approaches and is told from the perspective of the family's 15 year old daughter the humanity with which ward presents the family is endearing even as the dark side of people sometimes comes out even though it's a first person perspective the entire family is fully formed and even the drunken mostly emotionally absent father deserves compassion there is no doubt the best part of this book is ward's borderline poetic prose countless times i paused to wrap my head around the way something was said because her descriptions and similes are completely unique and never cliche it is from these that the story draws so much of its character my only gripe and it's a small one is that the narrator is a 15 year old girl and yet her narration is seemingly mature beyond her years i understand that this is a girl who has been forced to grow up faster than many kids but the same things that can make the story telling gorgeous also make you often forget that this is a child telling us the story there are some small subtle things that reminded me this was a young girl talking but that fact was often lost while it is great to avoid the cliched teenage portrayal it still distracted occasionally this flaw is forgiven though because often a more realistic tone was sacrificed for lyrical story telling that sucked me in","449":"a good 12 day story just glad i wasn't reading this for a lit course with a required analysis too many metaphors reenforced my dislike of pit bulls big time","450":" to my own surprise this is the first book i have read about hurricane katrina although to call it a book about hurricane katrina would be doing it a disservice as it is about much more than that i would be much more inclined to say that it is a book about the impoverished culture of bois sauvage or a book about dog fighting or a book about family dynamics it's about a girl and her brothers or a boy and his dog it's about the theme of birth and about the theme of destruction the promise of life and the struggle against death the character i both loved and hated the most was skeetah's dog china ward does an excellent job describing both the savagery and the beauty of such a dog as well as the loyalty that can develop between dog and master my main issue with ward's writing is that she loves similes and metaphors just a little too much it's beautiful writing i will not deny her that however while i was captivated by her most poignant and perfectly placed literary devices she often took me out of the moment with an overabundance of his back was like a reed and her stomach protruded like a melon what's most striking of all is that the metaphors and similes were usually not trite there were just too many of them clogging up the progress of the story all in all though i am not sorry at all to have read salvage the bones i can imagine it becoming a historical text used as a literary reference to hurricane katrina for years to come","451":"wonderfully written thought provoking but disturbing and sad at many points it is hard to read","452":"a gritty and honest book about a disenfranchised famiy in the days before and after a major hurricane it was a painful read in many ways and the dog fighting scenes are gut wrenching the characters are deftly drawn and detailed and very memorable this is a story that will make you angry about the way some people are forced to live it will also make you angry about the failure of the political and educational systems it's not a real upper of a book so time your reading accordingly","453":"the writing of this book is impeccable the detailed description of gruesome events made me want to read this book with my eyes closed while i could appreciate this story of the bonds of a family this book did not match up to all the hype","454":"loved this book jesmyn ward does an amazing job developing her characters giving them courage hope and dignity possibly one of the best books i have read","455":"wow the imagery u0026amp prose is just amazing in this book it makes me want to write as well","456":"i really thought this would be more about hurricane katrina the hurricane came in the second to last chapter and didn't last long i was disappointed the whole book just led up to it and then it ended","457":" esch is a teenage girl living in a world of men her father her three brothers and her brothers' friends randall is the oldest brother who sees a hopeful future of college on a basketball scholarship skeetah is a boy in love with his pit bull china who he matches against other dogs in dog fights junior is the youngest brother who never knew their mother their father is a man trying to hold his family together and finding comfort at the bottom of a bottle esch identifies with the mythological medea and is in love with her brothers' friend manny each chapter leads closer to hurricane katrina and after the storm the family is left to do what they've always done salvage what they can i would normally have a problem with dog fighting and i still do but the love between skeetah and china superseded my issue with that it's a different world one that i do not understand but what did come through was that skeetah did not see his dog as just a beast but as an extension of himself and he loved her tenderly even while asking her to live a most brutal life this is a gorgeously written book full of pain love heartbreak and in the end hope stark raw poetic i loved every page","458":"this review has been hidden because it contains spoilers to view it click here near the end of the book in the eleventh day chapter we find the following 'junior ' randall says 'i know you ain't pee yourself ' with this sentence begins some of the most harrowing fiction i've ever read the rest of the chapter is so vivid i felt near to shivering as if i were trapped in a house about to be flooded every moment is breathless and discouraging and desperate and you very nearly reach a hand out to skeetah esch china junior randall daddy while they struggle on the ro near the end of the book in the eleventh day chapter we find the following 'junior ' randall says 'i know you ain't pee yourself ' with this sentence begins some of the most harrowing fiction i've ever read the rest of the chapter is so vivid i felt near to shivering as if i were trapped in a house about to be flooded every moment is breathless and discouraging and desperate and you very nearly reach a hand out to skeetah esch china junior randall daddy while they struggle on the roof you can feel the wind blow can hear them try to be heard over it fight against it and the rain and the rising flood and when esch is in the water more beautiful evocative writing follows i kick extra hard like i am running a race and my head bobs above the water but the hand of the hurricane pushes it down down again who will deliver me and the hurricane says sssssssssshhhhhhhhhh what a beautiful tough little book that had more dog fighting than i anticipated more","459":"a great coming of age story i loved the interactions between all the siblings","460":" if you've never read a fictionalized account of hurricane katrina this book is probably a good place to start while the story builds slowly wrapping itself around the tight confines of an impoverished mississippi family's life before and briefly after hurrican katrina by the time you reach the last 30 pages it's difficult to put the thing down at times ward gives her narrator a more mature voice than a teenage girl should have particularly with the narrator's view of her physical environment the metaphors and internal monologue are undeniably those of a poetic seasoned adult that's ventured outside rural mississippi and while some readers might not care this did rub me a bit additionally there's a lot of sadness in the book and not much in the way of redemption the way the narrator's family takes care of each other in the midst of all their losses is very touching and rings true it's only that you'd like to see a little bit more of the good stuff that surely suffuses their lives even in poverty despite the slow pacing and unrelenting sadness there's still much to love about the book the final third in particular including an incredible dog fight and the reckoning of katrina is unlike anything i've read before","461":"very well written however i found the scene regarding the dog fighting very disturbing the scene is obviously meant to be disturbing but as an animal lover i found it really hard to get through so animal lovers should be forewarned the story and the message of the story makes it worth reading","462":"3 5 stars rounded up grim and sad book","463":" this book is difficult because it immerses the reader very well in fact in a world most of us wish didn't exist poverty dog fighting trashy lifestyles etc the story centers on a black family of 4 children youngest 7 and their father one of the teenage sons raises and fights pit bulls for income the only female in the family has gotten pregnant by her brother's friend who wants nothing to do with her hurricane katrina moves in and the story moves on the writer does an excellent job of portraying the life of this family her wording expressions and descriptions are quite well done","464":"this book one of those rare ones where you can feel what you read feel his hands on the dog feel his pride the water the heat her shame and junior's fear i hope she writes so many more","465":" it takes a certain kind of author to write so eloquently and it takes a certain kind of reader to appreciate it i liked it but i didn't love it some of the beginning didn't engross me like i wanted it to but by the middle and certainly the end i didn't want to put it down","466":"this is a great window into a world i could never know a poor black community in rural louisiana is facing an approaching hurricane the author details the struggles and hardships not in a pitiful way but in the matter of fact way they live their lives there is plenty of pain for all the characters but there is more than enough love among the family and the community to get them through an eye opening and inspiring book and the scenes when the hurricane hit are breath taking","467":"this was an interesting book which took place over 12 days leading up to and during katrina historical fiction it was an easy thought provoking read i found myself thinking about the characters days after and wondering what would have happened to them","468":"depressing family story using hurricane katrina as the backdrop strong heroine","469":"this is a heart wrenching depiction of rural poverty as experienced by a black family in mississippi in the days around hurricane katrina the characters are complex beautiful determined and fierce all at once one of the better books i've read in the past two years","470":"wow will be thinking about esch and skettah for days to come truly great writing the description of such abject poverty and the unrelenting dysfunction with such a great degree of accuracy made this novel one of this year's favorites","471":"this is a beautifully written book the characters and places are well drawn out the cruelty of the dog fighting did not bother me so much because it was a part of their culture it was no more cruel than the circumstances of their lives despite the harshness of their lives the love they have for each other is what makes this book a really good read","472":"what an amazingly original voice","473":"i'll say right up front that the subject matter of this book is not the most pleasant in fact many people would find it disturbing and or depressing focusing on a dysfunctional family living in poverty in rural mississippi the narrator is a pregnant 14 year old if that's not enough to get your attention esch is one of 4 siblings the only girl whose mother died giving birth to the youngest the father is an alcoholic and no one seems to have a regular job with esch's brother regularly stealing medicine and other supplies for his dog oh that's the other thing dog fighting plays a major role with fights graphically described not for the animal lover or faint of heart and did i mention that hurricane katrina is about to hit so what does this book to recommend itself the writing this is one of the most lyrical beautifully written books i've read recently the author gives you a vivid sense of place rural coastal ms and i found her characters to be so well realized that i could understand them even though my life is very different and when the hurricane hits the descriptive narration was breath taking i won't spoil anything by saying that the family emerges from the hurricane a little stronger and you have to hope that they'll make it","474":"interesting a family that weathers hurricane katrina and so much more as portrayed during the twelve days prior to the storm brilliantly written such tough themes","475":"a deceptively simple story about one family's struggle pre and post katrina great novels don't need to be 600 pages long and have a million different characters and this book is proof of that times a million i was incredibly moved by this book and the story telling in it and encourage everyone to read it","476":"although i found this book to be somewhat engaging i think that the short time span just 9 days left the character development and story details lacking i feel that a lot of the book left you hanging and i would have liked to read more","477":"started off really good didn't grasp me enough to read it through because it felt so dated even in the impoverished south it is still 2005 when katrina hits i put it down for a while because of the disconnect i appreciate the solid writing though so when i picked it back up it was easy to continue definitely a good read","478":"good view point on poverty and hurricane katrina","479":"this national book award winner for 2011 is a first novel it's beautifully written it's about a dirt poor black family that lives in what they call the pit in bois savage mississippi their land a virtual junkyard is surrounded by woods the narrator esch is the only girl in a motherless family with three brothers she tells of their life in a matter of fact way without asking for sympathy yet i was emotionally engaged from the start in fact i had to put the book aside a few times so i could calm down the story is mainly about esch's family her alcoholic father her brothers and china a pit bull the approaching hurricane katrina is in the background for much of the story it's interesting how preparing for the hurricane is the one way esch's father can contribute to the family his children believe this hurricane will pass leaving them unharmed as all the others have in their lifetime each is far too involved in personal dreams and problems to focus on the coming storm will the hurricane ultimately force them together","480":"a well written brief story taking place in a little known forgotten part of modern american the rural predominantly african american predominantly poor south","481":"raw and in your face","482":"this is one of those books i chose without knowing anything about the plot first i saw that it won the national book award and thought it was a good bet what can i say i like to be surprised it was excellent no matter what the plot description says this is a book about the bonds of family jesmyn ward conveys the tenderness and complications of blood ties with an unbelievably fresh and authentic voice i honestly feel like i know what it is like now to have brothers read this lovely book it's worth your time","483":"incredible ward presents a narrator with a quiet dignity the narrator is poor and has an awful situation but she's clearly smart and entirely human the brothers and father particularly the brother with the fighting pit bull are wonderfully drawn some readers may find the book too disturbing e g dog fighting scenes extreme rural poverty characters' poor choices i strongly recommend this book for a look inside a world that most of us don't understand","484":"loved this book cried laughed got scared and more ward does an amazing job of illustrating love dedication and survival through such compelling characters and story lines","485":" i wanted this book to be my new favorite but i found it so consistent that i was glad when it was over no doubt ward uses beautiful language and is a gifted writer however her flowing passages seemed almost contrite when compared to the subjects she's talking about rural dirt poor african american family dog fights teenage pregnancy mass destruction at the hands of hurricane katrina instead of there being this fascinating veil over this sequence of tragedies building up to the ultimate tragedy of hurrican katrina the story seemed to get in the way of itself splintering instead adding to those contradictions were a few discrepencies that i have a hard time believing which again is probably why i found the book untrustworthy and inconsistent ward grew up in mississippi as did i so i would think that she would remember that schools in mississippi start in mid to late august august 10th 20th the novel takes place in the summer which is fine but hurricane katrina hit southeast louisiana on august 29th 2005 esch and all the boys would've been in school the entire time the novel takes place 10 days prior to the hurricane and the 2 following fiction is fiction but if you're going to base it around an historical event as earth shattering and destructive as hurricane katrina then the author should ask questions about what makes a valid setting a believable setting also the day after the hit when esch her brothers and big henry get in the car to go drive around and see the damage i had to put the book down and walk away totally unbelievable there were no roads available on the coast of mississippi neighborhoods 3 hours north of the coast in jackson had people blocked in because trees fell in the road blocking the way if the center part of the state couldn't drive then the coast would've been completely out of the question save for john boats and cutting a path with chainsaws i felt like for all of the build up for the previous 10 days chapters the event was a total let down tragic of course but the book only seemed to cheapen the signifance of what was going on by having the protagonists jump in a car and survey the damage i am disappointed by this book i would like to think i'm going to read more jesmyn ward but i may have to remember that she is disguising her poetry with a somewhat weak novel","486":"parts of this book were intensely uncomfortable to read but the sum of all the parts was breathtaking an excellent intense and involving novel","487":"i love how the author has keeps each sentence crisp neat and little this gives the book almost a poetic kind of reading poverty was never this beautiful","488":" i'm a sucker for southern gothic literature and though salvage the bones doesn't quite fit the bill jesmyn ward's masterful novel is imbued some irrefutable qualities of traditional utterly southern writers salvage is a heart wrenching and likely a partially autobiographical account of a smart fifteen year old girl living in rural mississippi her mother is dead her father is a drunk and she's left to corral and feed her three brothers the book proceeds in the days leading up to hurricane katrina and ends shortly after it ravages her family's home","489":"even though i'm not much of a dog person even i was caught up by the end also i could not stop picturing the girl and the dad as the characters from beasts of the southern wild weird","490":"i was reading this book during the approach of hurricane issac which made the backdrop of the novel's hurricane katrina all the more vivid while there are some really raw scenes there are also some very gentle touching and loving ones","491":"amazing amazing amazing such control of voice characters were beautifully developed and the various plot threads managed so well that i kept turning and turning the pages desperate to find out what happened can't say enough good about this book","492":"earthy and provocative the birth of puppies to china the pit bull the pregnancy of esch as a 15 year old the oncoming hurricane katrina power a book full of tension blood and violence beautiful writing and hope from despair the unique and non traditional family comes together to be reborn after the storm","493":" this book was absolutley amazing i will keep this review really brief for fear of spoiling the book ward created characters that i felt like i knew personally reading i felt a maternal and sisterly love for esch i wanted nothing more to protect her during the entire book big henry's kindess is unforgettable my favorite character is esch's older brother skeeter stubborn wise and vulnerable his love for his pitbull china was so beautiful to me and i am not a pet person ward has managed to create characters that i will never forget similar to holden caulfield of catcher in the rye and okonkwo of things fall apart they all are permanently ingrained in my memory","494":" ungainly sentences trite metaphors prosaic descriptions might ward have fallen victim to the pitfalls of first person narration it's likely to honor the narrative mode an author must observe the limits of her storyteller ward manages this but in so doing she confines herself to the rudimentary voice of an adolescent girl in the rural south this was a brave but perilous choice on ward's part in the sound and the fury faulkner creates an unforgettable character by narrating the story through the jumbled thoughts of a mentally disabled man in salvage the bones ward limits her narration to a rustic style consistent with her narrator but this realism is accomplished at too great a cost the writing is insipid and moreover it adds little color to the narrator this ruined the book for me at the end of each chapter i could recount the events i had read but i could never see the world in which they occurred","495":"i did not think the novel lived up to the hype i had read about it it is a story about hurricane katrina 's devastation of a poverty stricken family in lower mississippi the dog fighting scenes were very graphic so be forewarned","496":"although i enjoyed the writing style the storyline dragged for me the bulk of the story lay in the last thirty pages which i wish was the majority of the novel great theme for the book but not as well executed as i had expected","497":"a struggling family in coastal mississippi before katrina mother dead father often drunk but anxious about hurricane season eldest son hoping for a basketball scholarship another raising a fighting dog about to whelp the youngest whose birth was the mother's death and esch pregnant and sick with it gorgeously written realistic and oh so painful","498":" i liked this book a lot the narrator is a teenage girl named esch hmmm what's the significance of that name in rural louisiana in the days leading up to hurricane katrina her family includes her father an alcoholic since the death of her mother younger brother junior and older brothers skeetah and randall skeetah has a pit bull named china on whom he dotes china has just given birth to a litter of pups animal lovers may find this novel hard to take since china is entered in a dog fight which is one of the set pieces of the novel on the other hand this is one of the best novels i've read in which a dog is a central character yet in the complexity of the character dynamics it's obvious that skeetah loves his dog in a way that transcends the use he puts her to skeetah employs his tom sawyer ish wiles in aid of his dogs at every step his love for the dogs is a force that moves the novel and all its characters i'd venture to say that even though esch narrates the book and has her own trials to overcome that skeet is really the main character in the same way that we see atticus finch through scout's eyes in another great novel of the south the writing is top notch apt poetic metaphors describe colors scenery characters and weather with an economic vividness speaking of weather the final chapters of the book reminded me of in their description of the storm and resulting flood","499":"oy as writing goes this book is top notch but the story is very hard to read i found myself skimming most of it due the fact that i couldn't face what the characters had to go through great writing great character development excellent story progression but a doozy of a heartbreaker don't read it if you don't like sad books","500":"great read looking to more reads from this author","501":" this is a book written by an young african american woman about a poor family living in mississippi it covers a small portion of their life maybe less than a month the character develop is superb in that you come to know intimately each of the characters their personalities their hopes and dreams their flaws it is told through the eyes of a young teenage girl she has three brothers and a alcoholic father the mother passed away with the birthing of the youngest son the last days in the book hurricane katrina hits and they scramble for their lives i was impressed with the family's closeness their acceptance of each family member with all their flaws they were not judgmental towards each other they each were loving and supportive of each other i wish that my family had been like that each of us judges criticizes and advices each of us to be different we learned this from our parents this breaks down the intimacy the closeness and the caring for each other she is a good writer and i will read more of her books","502":" jesmyn ward's salvage the bones works on many levels as a contemporary answer to zora neale hurston's their eyes were watching god but ward shouldn't be seen as just an imitator and she doesn't have her sights set on creating a dialogue with african american literature alone medea and mythology the bible and hip hop all of them run through the book like currents of water she writes with a poetry that startles slapping you across the face with metaphors and imagery that embeds itself in your soul the final third of the book is harrowing as hurricane katrina which has been alluded to all through the book and is discussed on the book's jacket so this isn't a spoiler finally arrives and ward doesn't coddle her characters even as she leaves a space for hope it's compelling stuff and it's a reminder of how much good writing is still going in literature today it's a rough book sexually explicit at times heart breaking at times violent at times and one i could see causing trouble among more conservative readers but ward gives us such a fragile and rich character in her narrator esch that the sharp edges were totally worth it this is a girl who loves and wants to be loved that is bound to her flawed and hardscrabble family with bonds deep enough to cut i loved the way esch saw the world even when it broke my heart at its heart it's a novel about motherhood in all its forms absent present soft hard tender violent protective independent and so on and so forth ward's characters interact in so many different ways but underneath many of these interactions are peaks and valleys that their mothers left in them i like that concept and a second reading i think would bring out even more fruitful material but i had to tear through the book faster than i wanted due to school starting still this is good stuff i think it could have some life in it beyond the typical span for contemporary fiction i look forward to ward's next book grade a","503":"this is the kind of book i hope to write it is full of raw unbridled emotion there is no glamour here no false beauty only the truth of humanity buckled by poverty and natural disaster with those of fine character standing up under the weight of it all to survive and love despite despair","504":" i really struggled with rating this one it was really more of a 3 and a half for me on the one hand i thought the book was good interesting characters the setting was fascinating u0026amp the story of these characters is really gripping and feels true to the setting however there were some flaws for me primarily the speed u0026amp pacing was horrible in my opinion some of the writing was uneven to me some places it was so beautiful that it was almost poetic yet in others it was dense and repetitive and in need of serious editing in my opinion that took away from the overall impact of the story but its a really good book in terms of portraying a very specific time place and cultural socioeconomic reality so i'm ultimately torn in my assessment of the novel the descriptions of the impact of hurricane katrina was extremely well done i really felt as if i was there experiencing the impact along with the characters although the actual hurricane katrina pieces didn't happen until late in the book those are the chapters that i think stand out they are so well written and descriptive as to give the reader a true sense of how riding out hurricane katrina and the aftermath of the impact must have been for the impoverished families in that community it was just a stunning portrayal of katrina this novel is not easy to read beyond the pacing of the novel there is a dog fighting component as well as a lot of poverty and other kinds of darkness the dog fighting was well done in my opinion it's never fun to read about that kind of brutality but i think it gave me a new perspective on the practice that i'd never thought about i'll still never understand it but i thought that component really gave the story itself another layer that complimented the overall themes and i didn't find it too graphic just graphic enough to show the true brutality of the practice but not graphic enough to make me put the book down the poverty and situations the characters find themselves in were certainly disturbing as well this is not an uplifting novel it's dark haunting and raw i think this one is definitely worth the read despite its flaws i understand why so many people are giving raving reviews but this novel ultimately didn't wow me i am eager to see what jesmyn ward has in store for us in the future","505":" remember hurricane katrina that hit the south east coast of the us in august 2005 this became the most expensive natural disaster in us history virtually all the media coverage we saw of this event was focused on new orleans the apparent lack of preparation the flooded streets floating corpses the inability of the city to cope afterwards the president's apparent lack of interest i am sure you remember but what we never really saw or heard about was the devastation in neighbouring states and communities especially mississippi this state was the hardest hit by the hurricane with all areas suffering widespread damage 235 people died most of them in the coastal areas which is also where the greatest damage and destruction occurred in common with new orleans and those images forever imprinted on our minds is that it was the poorest who suffered the most mississippi along with louisiana and neighbouring alabama are among the poorest states in the country the effects of such a disaster are going to be much greater on the poorest than on others such a family lives in the fictional mississippi coastal town of bois sauvauge four motherless children left largely to bring themselves up 17 year old randall way older than his years 16 year old skeeter who lives only for his fighter dog china in whom he sees the source of financial salvation for the family 14 year old esch pregnant and desperately trying to deny it and 7 year old junior who never knew his mother and is almost feral their father has never gotten over the death of his wife and tries his absolute best to parent and provide for his children but the family's hand to mouth existence makes this an almost impossible task beginning twelve days before hurricane katrina strikes esch narrates the family's attempts to prepare for the storm which they know is going to be bigger than anything else they have had to deal with the children try to stock pile food their father works on getting bottles filled with water and on ways to protect the house and shed skeeter proves to be a better mother to china and her pups than china is herself esch loses herself in morning sickness her mad crazy love for the teenage father of her baby and having no mother looks to the sorceress medea from greek mythology for inspiration and direction each chapter is one of the twelve days at the core of each chapter is the ominous threat of the approaching storm the exhausting heat and humidity the dirt and dust the family lives in the constant hunt for food but also the enormous love andhige reliance these children have on each other for the survival of their precarious family unit their father is really a background figure simply because he is so powerless and ineffectual plus he is often drunk their relationships with each other and with their peers in the local community are what are what drives them the rivalries love affairs the graphically violent but beautifully drawn dog fights and skeeter's utter devotion to the dog this book won the national book award 2011 very inspirational it is a marvellous story it is raw it is violent there is little stability in these kids' lives but above all they have each other and that is a difficult thing to tear apart something not even hurricane katrina has the power to do although she has a damn good time trying","506":"ward takes a vastly different route to explore the events surrounding the impact of hurricane katrina instead of focusing on the complexities of the government failures and thousands of people left homeless and displaced she takes the reader to a much smaller environment a family by doing so ward manages to make the connection between the family unit as dysfunctional as it is and the weather phenomenon simply put ward exposes the struggles of life on the gulf coast before the hurricane to help readers truly comprehend why katrina was so devastating she has captured both the individual and familial struggles of living in a community of concentrated poverty","507":"this is one of the most painfully difficult books i have ever read it's about 15 year old esch batiste and her family who live in coastal mississippi although hurricane katrina happens in the book it's not a focal point of the story except that the reader knows katrina is coming and that it will be much worse than the characters are aware i think that overarching dread is one difficult aspect of this book i knew the whole time what was coming and the characters did not daddy batiste is an alcoholic and pays little attention to his children he does however prepare almost obsessively for a hurricane mostly so he has something to do all day because he's not working most of the time esch has 3 brothers randall skeetah and junior randall aspires to play basketball skeetah dotes over his pitbull china constantly and junior just gets in the way esch is barely pregnant in the book and she's in love with the baby's father who doesn't even see her as a person skeetah treats his dog with more love than the father of her baby treats esch there is a whole lot of social commentary in this book the pitbull fighting is hard to read about it's animal abuse and it's prevalent in some parts of society skeetah loves china almost like he'd love a daughter or a girlfriend yet has no problems fighting her with other pitbulls it's nearly impossible for me to relate to that the batiste's mother rose died after giving birth to junior after giving birth to him in their family house that esch's grandparents built and not because she's some new age mother who wants to have a home birth with a midwife but because they clearly couldn't afford a hospital they hear about the oncoming hurricane on their radio while the tv gets little to no reception there is no computer no internet no books no newspapers reading this book has given me extra perspective on both the devastation of hurricane katrina and the existence of real poverty here in america to believe that families such as the fictional batistes ever had any chance of getting out before the hurricane hits is ridiculous i read a blog post by a prominent white american author recently who explains that being a white male in america is having the easiest mode in the rpg of life this book is one way to help see why this is the case esch who loves the greek story of medea and who exhibits what could almost be seen as a love of literature really has no chance being 15 and pregnant with an alcoholic neglectful father an abusive father of her baby and nothing to eat except ramen noodles has to climb a ladder higher than i know i would be able to in order to achieve what i have this is a great and painful book it has left me depressed but grateful and i'm glad i could get through it i perhaps made it more social commentary than other readers might but those are the messages i heard loudest while reading the book","508":"writing is visceral vivid humid another katrina book i secretly thought when i read about the national book award but i couldn't put it down thought of it all day at work finished it the minute i got home from work when's the last time a book did that for you","509":"i would give this more than 5 stars if i could beautifully written and intensely moving","510":"i had a hard time with this book but did finish it because it was a gift from a friend i would rate it higher but it centers around dog fighting","511":"felt played with didn't get much satisfaction at the end","512":" this feels like an absolutely authentic update of abject poverty in the african american deep south in line with the fictional works of older or deceased authors like zora neale hurston or alice walker i feel like she had to write about the hurricane because of her personal experience but in many ways this book might be even better without the actual presence of katrina because of the baggage and uneven knowledge about that storm that the reader brings to the book not really her fault though","513":" because jesmyn ward's katrina novel won the national book award and is a contender in the tournament of books it has been widely reviewed mostly favorably so i won't go into plot or spend any of our valuable time rehashing what others have already said my reading experience of salvage the bones was mixed i certainly got involved with the story and the characters she put me into their world and made me care what would happen to them as she also personalized the katrina experience but something kept jarring my attention for days after finishing i found myself thinking about the book and knew that i had been emotionally affected it was during these moments of reliving the story that i figured out what had bothered me ms ward chose to have the fifteen year old esch tell us what happened during the twelve days of katrina when esch speaks to her brothers father and friends in the book's dialogue she sounds like an impoverished black teen from a small mississippi town but when she is narrating to the reader she sounds like a well educated writer and professor of creative writing she sounds like jesmyn ward instead of esch to get technical i wonder why our author wrote her novel in the first person narrative mode instead of the third person limited in fact she mixed the two while staying in first person and thus diluted my reading pleasure otherwise i think salvage the bones is a prizeworthy and important novel for giving us one of the stories that should accompany all those images we saw on the news feeds in 2005","514":" set in the 12 days leading up to hurricane katrina readers meet the dysfunctional and dirt poor batiste family living in the small hamlet of bois sauvage mississippi momma died when jr was born and esch and her older brothers skeetah and randall are just trying to get by mostly in the absence of their beer swilling father skeetah thinks his ticket out is his pit bull china who has just had puppies randall thinks a basketball scholarship is in the cards for him and esch her only hope is that manny will look her in the eyes when he once again comes to her for sex a romantic notion brought on my her love of mythology provides her with escape but no rescue when the hurricane finally hits the family manages to hold together revealing more about themselves than they ever suspected graphic sometimes violent this beautifully told story will stick with you for a long time ward masterfully juxtaposes the storm with dog fighting family loyalty and secrets and what life looks like when there is nothing left to lose","515":"eh interesting enough that i stuck through to the end but once there eh","516":" i had trouble getting into this book at first but once it got going man did it get going we get to know esch skeetah randall junior and their dad along with assorted other characters over the course of 12 days or so every chapter seems jam packed full of things to think about how esch is going to handle her pregnancy how the siblings relate how randall's dreams are deferred and all the while you know what they don't know about the storm approaching in that way katrina hanging over their heads makes this almost like a horror movie the story built up almost like a hurricane moving from slow meandering winds to furious speed and power definitely a good read","517":"although hard to read at times this is an impressive and important book","518":" this book is an absolutely stunning debut it is moving in its exploration of difficult themes and courageous in its confrontation of the brutal realities of rural generational poverty i know of no other novel that takes us inside the singular experience of riding out hurricane katrina wonderfully written and sometimes terrifying in its carefully selected almost poetic detail this first novel makes me want to read more by west also an excellent choice for sophisticated ya readers highly recommended","519":"his was the 2011 winner of the national book award it's about a dysfunctional family set in a coastal town in mississippi starting just before hurricane katrina until just after it hits it's a story centered around esch a fifteen year old girl who is pregnant and living with her three brothers and her father mom is dead and dad is a drunkard her brother skeetah is raising pit bulls and is caring for a new litter that is slowly dying in the dir salvage the bones 2011 jesmyn ward tthis was the 2011 winner of the national book award it's about a dysfunctional family set in a coastal town in mississippi starting just before hurricane katrina until just after it hits it's a story centered around esch a fifteen year old girl who is pregnant and living with her three brothers and her father mom is dead and dad is a drunkard her brother skeetah is raising pit bulls and is caring for a new litter that is slowly dying in the dirt outside of the kennel he built to house them esch is pretty free with sex she imagines she is one of the muses while in the midst of the act the boy who got her pregnant however wants no more to do with her daddy is busy collecting food and liquor to ride out the hurricane he knows is coming mostly the food is dried ramen it's a pretty bleak picture what holds it all together is the love the children have for each other this is a first novel by this author and is well written but lacks the spark to hold it all together i got the feeling that this was an exercise of putting a bunch of characters in a box and shaking it up to see what happened the story itself was a kind of collection of daily vignettes of family life under not the best of family conditions - a genre that we have seen plenty of in the recent past i didn't think it was of national book award standards although i haven't seen the short list all in all though not a bad execution for a first novel","520":"i really enjoyed this tale of utterly rural life in the south where a family struggles to keep things together in daily life and then are confronted by hurricane katrina i found the portrayals and motivations of the characters convincing and while it isn't heartwarming it does end with a positive sense of humanity","521":"i thought this book was going to be depressing but it ended up being a very hopeful story while the details of the main characters lives as well as their living conditions are heart wrenching at times their loyalty commitment and love for each other pulls them through their very challenging circumstances i was left with the feeling that these characters may be down on their luck but they are resilient and will find a way to prevail","522":"this book knocked my socks off i couldn't put it down","523":"i give up i keep trying to force myself to read this and just can't make it happen i figure giving it 20% 60 pages is enough to feel like i gave it a real go just not an enjoyable read none of the characters were really coming across as incredibly well developed the prose was kind of dull and there was nothing in the way of plot","524":"i couldn't get into the story although there wasn't much of one i didn't like the characters and i certainly don't ever want to read a description of a dog fight ever again","525":" this won the national book award for 2011 and it is not an uplifting read brace yourself it is a fiercely poetic novel that takes place in the fictional town of bois sauvage miss in the 10 days leading up to hurricane katrina on one level \"salvage the bones\" is a simple story about a poor black family that's about to be devastated by one of the most deadly hurricanes in u s history what makes the novel powerful though is the way the author without a hint of pretension enmeshes us in the simple lives of these poor people living among chickens and abandoned cars and then evokes the tenacious passion and desperation that you would expect to find in a classic tragedy the force that pushes back against katrina's inexorable winds is esch a pregnant 14 year old girl the only daughter among four siblings whose mother died during the birth of the last one precocious and sensitive she speaks almost entirely in phrases that reflect the poverty that defines her community everything here is gritty raw and alive the book does not end altogether well but people do survive on many levels unique and compelling","526":"this book is dark brooding menacing with an underbelly of violence from the approaching hurricane the dog fights daddy's drunkeness it is the story of family of ties that bind and i guess an underlying theme of hope and strength through adversity this is far from an easy story it deals with poverty child pregnancy isolation and social ills endemic in society today it is a wonderful evocative novel very much of a time and place and the event that triggered it highly recommended","527":"one of the best books i have read in a long time i'm calling classic on this one","528":"brutal raw honest poetic the most difficult novel i have ever read but i am so glad i stuck with it","529":"i appreciated the story ward tried to tell but she never finds a compelling voice for her lead character esch spending too much time on lush metaphors and detailed descriptions and not enough time on developing her ensemble cast beyond two dimensional stereotypes as a result the rather abrupt non ending is far more bitter than bittersweet perhaps not a fair comparison but having seen the similar and far superior beasts of the southern wild a couple of months ago didn't help","530":" set in the days immediately leading up to and following hurricane katrina this 2011 national book award winner is absolutely stunning narrated by the lone female of a male dominated family esch is 15 and secretly pregnant on the eve of imminent disaster it is a story of what it feels like to be on the cusp of being a mother when yours is gone about the fierce loyalty of family and largely about the root of most things love of all types you'll find yourself wondering about these characters long after the story ends","531":"veered its way up from a 3 to a 4 by the end for me kind yet cruel immediate yet talismanic all at once","532":" this book was pretty heavy handed but then again so are teenagers often i felt like it was about 80% similes which bothered me until i considered that maybe 15 year olds or however old esch is need to compare new things they see with other things that are more familiar to them the writing was effective in describing scenes i winced at some of the graphic violence and toward the end when i was completely submerged in the book i had a hard time believing there wasn't a storm outside my window what seemed like a linear plot drew in so many other aspects that even though the symbolism was a little overbearing it was easy to respect ward for thinking so much about her characters and her story","533":"powerful and disturbing horrifying yet hopeful universal themes of family suffering pain and strength some of the subjects dog fighting dire poverty and ugly sexual encounters are difficult to read about yet the relentless building of tension as the storm approaches and the continuing glimpses of hope and humanity kept me reading feverishly to the end wow","534":"set in fictional bois savage louisana this is the story of 15 year old esch and her family in the ten days leading up to hurricane katrina and the two after very very slow i just didn't like this i thought at first it was maybe because of the subjects dog fighting hurricanes extreme poverty but really i just didn't think it was well written","535":"very insiteful","536":" i think this book was beautifully written and did an amazing job of transporting me to a place unlike anything i know as a middle class midwesterner i enjoyed getting to know the characters in the 12 days that the story spans and witnessing their pain and fear them stemmed from both the events occuring in their lives and the hurricane however the lives of the characters and even the animals described in the book seemed so bleak and at times it was just sad piled on said piled on sad i also found it hard to reconcile the vast gap between the narration and the character who is supposed to have been doing the narrating the characters and the plot had so much more to offer that was left untapped because the author was obviously more focused on the prose which ended up being quite a letdown when i got to the end of the book","537":"this book belongs right next to absalom absalom and beloved and tom franklin's hell at the breech and flannery o'connor's the violent bear it away on the whoa damn look at that shelf southern literature it's excruciating and voluptuous goes places i've never even imagined imagining and just hangs out right there in those places no matter how terrifying how raw and in language the writer invents out of the language we thought we knew a workout and worth every panting breath","538":"i am having a really hard time getting through this","539":"dog fighting dead puppies a pregnant 15 year old a dead mother and a drunk father desparate poverty oh and hurricane katrina is on the way ughhh i found the storyline and characters in this book so distasteful i almost couldn't read it it was so bleak and hopeless","540":"this is a beautifully written book with disturbing themes the teenage heroine is unhappily pregnant there are dogfights kind of grim no i found myself drawn into this world of the poor south just prior to katrina as in 'behind the beautiful forevers' the point is not the grinding poverty that is just the backdrop for a story of perseverance and family loyalty i admit i had to skip the dogfight scenes the ending of the book redeemed it for me i didn't think it was too perfect it just had some hope which was sorely needed not light hearted enough for the beach not by a long shot","541":"i read this book by candlelight during hurricane sandy house was swaying water was up to top step book and storm made an impression on me i am by the way the son of a weather man and possum charmer","542":"hmm took a while but got it in the end a bit of a slow start hard to warm to the characters","543":"a book about the grinding poverty that made hurricane katrina so tragic hard to read harder to forget","544":"i may be able to come back to this later but this did not captivate me","545":"i loved this book i though her writing was wonderful her descriptions left me feeling the heat the dust the poverty i would recommend it highly","546":"if you love dogs then i guess its poor grimey did i spell that right sad and about katrina was not my cup of tea but well written","547":"i really enjoyed this book i really felt like i knew the characters and was rooting for each of them","548":"great really just great","549":"beautiful descriptive language but for some reason i just couldn't really get into the lives of these characters","550":"this book was so amazing that i can't even describe it the writing was just so beautiful and every other book from now is going to sound like dog poop compared to this one though i do feel like the hurricane part was so short it led all the way up to katrina and then it went straight to the aftermath i don't know it just seemed so short i wanted more of it but besides that it was so good everyone needs to read this book at least once in their life","551":"authors writing was much to graphic to be a young adult genre","552":"this novel was poignant gripping and extremely well written the story follows one family in the days leading up to katrina the hurricane is secondary to the main plot but it packs a wallop in the climax this hard scrabble motherless family wormed their way into my heart the author made me care about unexpected things like dog fights read this book","553":" 5 18 13 i just re read this for a workshop i am teaching still love every raw bit of this book be prepared though it's the kind of book that wrecks you 3 19 12 i feel like i want to write a love letter to this author this book just earned a spot on my list of all time favorites it is the story of fourteen year old esch and her family who live in the bois sauvage in rural mississippi it takes place over the ten days leading up to hurricane katrina esch's mother is dead her father is a drunk and she is pregnant they live on the pit a destitute and wild place as almost feral children i fell in love with esch and her brothers particularly skeetah who is driven nearly mad in his attempt to keep his beloved fighting pit bull china alive after she gives birth to puppies i found myself aching for each of them as they sought the simplest of things attention love survival i have never read something so beautiful about subject matter that is so difficult dog fighting rural poverty and teenage sex it is also about family and loyalty about survival and the cruelty of nature the language is masterful every single line of this novel sings with gorgeous brutality i borrowed this from the library but intend to buy the hardcover to add to my own library and you should too","554":"this book was incredible the presence of true voice in writing is something i have not witnessed in a while and this book had voice no this is not a plug for the show the voice while the plight of the characters goes from bad to worse to horrible there is a small glimmer of hope at the end that made me believe there is some good in the world i would highly recommend this book and i am looking forward to what else this author has to offer","555":"compelling novel about a family's days leading into hurricane katrina sad and a bit depressing at times though very well written and thought provoking the last two chapters were riveting","556":"some bizarre stuff in here i e dog fighting but rich language u0026amp a good story","557":"jesmyn ward has a way with dialogue and does so much of the storytelling through it very well done","558":"this is a wonderfully written book about a family's painful and heartwarming story of survival in the throws of poverty and hurricane katrina","559":" this book is tense like few other books you will read these kids live in poverty and have to deal with teen pregnancy dog fighting a dead mother a drunk father oh yes and a little hurricane named katrina is en route it takes a little time to get invested in perhaps because you know what is coming and want to find out what happens to the family it feels at times as if you are just flipping pages to get to the main event - how will they make it through the hurricane the most striking parts of this book are the creation of place and esch's comparison of her own life to greek mythology the poetry of ward's words and the beauty of nature set in opposition to the despair and squalor of the characters' lives is beautifully written it takes some time to get invested in salvage the bones but ward has written a powerful meditation on love and family and the things that remain constant when everything falls apart","560":"a beautifully written book by a stegner fellow the story follows a very poor motherless black family who have nothing and then lose all of that in katrina powerful and depressing","561":" i highly recommend this book it's about the lives of a poor family in miss over a period of 12 days leading up to hurricane katrina told from the pt of view of a 14 year old female protagonist caution for the animal lovers out there it does include dog fighting but also a fierce love for one's animal the young girl discovers she is pregnant and battles morning sickness and constant hunger while preparing for the upcoming hurricane and hoping the father of the child will reciprocate her love a pitch perfect account of struggle and community in the rural south... though the characters in salvage the bones face down hurricane katrina the story isn't really about the storm it's about people facing challenges and how they band together to overcome adversity bookpage","562":"a very tough read but i'm glad i stuck it out","563":"fiercely poetic and beautiful","564":"painfully good finished by sheer force of will the level of detail was almost oppressive impressive and skillful but not necessarily enjoyable to read","565":"a story about the struggles of a poor black family on the gulf coast as katrina arrives narrated by the teen aged daughter much of the plot has to do with the older brother's attachment to a pit bull that he takes to dog fights in order to earn money the desperate circumstances of the family contrast with the cool resignation of the narrative voice a good read","566":" for much of this book i felt as if i were listening to music country music i like most kinds of music but not country the book tells the story of a family 3 boys their sister the narrator and their widower father mom died shortly after giving birth to the youngest boy who is nine years younger than esch the girl the first three are teenagers born a year apart dad morns the loss of his wife at the bottom of a bottle esch is surrounded by males not only her family but her brothers' friends her brother skeeter is determined to change at least his fortunes through his pit bull and her pups the family lives in louisiana where despite being sick the dad is mindful of the approach of the hurricane katrina the boys and esch think the storm will hit florida which will reduce its ferociousness only daddy with previous adult experience with hurricane camille understands the danger the days before the hurricane hit are entangled with esch's behavior and skeeter's with his dogs my disjunction with the characters parallels with the first time i student taught in my early 20s the students i was teaching experienced a life i had only read about in my white bread world so after 40 years i am dumbstruck by a life i can not relate to the book changed for me with the vicissitudes of katrina no i haven't been through a hurricane but i have experienced several tornadoes i watched with horror the plight of the people on the gulf this section did relate it might be interesting to re read this in the future but i know parts won't be any easier with subsequent readings","567":"totally couldn't get into it at all","568":"i highly recommend this book for anyone ftc i received a free copy of this book and was not reimbursed in any other way","569":"one of the best books i've read in a while i am not surprised it won the national book award i just might read it again","570":"this is a powerful book and a very readable national book award winner the dog fight scenes can be uncomfortable but so necessary for skeeter's character once you meet esch and the poverty she lives in both in parental and romantic love you will never forget her the poverty of rural mississippi is brought to the forefront and katrina must demonstrate how much harder life can be for those already suffering daily i cannot describe the further layers without giving too much away but can say that esch is 14 and sexually active but only because it's too much effort not to be","571":"very tough read due to the subject matter and not a book to read when you have a litter of puppies in the house compelling story and some of the language is wonderful but it does get to be a bit much at times another book that could have used an editor to pare it down preferably hemingway's editor less words plainer language the actual story in the book is very depressing i prefer books about places i'd like to be or people i'd like to meet this book had neither","572":"i know the people and place reflect reality it was hard to read 14 yr old girl pregnant dog fighting such terrible poverty in this country hard to read","573":"i was concerned at first that this book was not going to live up to the praise it's been getting but it absolutely did the start is a little confusing but once you get into the story it is great beautifully written","574":"what really does it for me is that you can taste and smell this book it's like an earthy body order you can smell katrina the despair the love the pain all of it jesmyn chronicles a slice of black life in the deep south for those who don't live in a post racial america amazing read it","575":"hurricane katrina is bearing down on the mississippi gulf coast esch and her family live dirt poor right in the storm's path her often drunk father tries to prepare for the coming deluge but the storm's power finds esch her father and her brothers struggling for their lives against the floodwaters","576":"esch batistie the main character in this book has a beautiful way of thinking the book is set in the rural areas of bois sauvage mississippi in the days leading up to hurricane katrina and esch's inner monologue combined with the narrator's omniscience and use of beautiful language really make this book shine the story follows the batiste family through their trials and tribulations as they prepare for the coming of the hurricane although it seems as if their father is the only one who really knows how bad it's going to be esch's brother skeetah who fights dogs as a hobby has a dog named china that has more personality than some of the other human characters with the narrator describing the brutal vividness of their lives in bois sauvage combined with skeetah and china's unique relationship this book is hard to put down there are times when the descriptions of feelings landscapes thoughts and actions are almost cormac mccarthy like overall a thought provoking story","577":"beautifully written but a bit bleak","578":"if you saw and loved beasts of the southern wild this year than you will find similar affection for salvage the bones this is a beautifully written but brutal book about poverty family and survival you won't be disappointed","579":"sometimes hard to read but well worth it amazing language and story","580":"amazing ward captures your heart w characters u0026amp holds it in a vise the entire time you're reading","581":"too disturbing to read let alone finish","582":" this book had the potential to be so much better i liked the concept a poor family in the south single father and the impact of hurricane katrina part of the problem is that hurricane katrina does not come into play until the last 10% of the book and the writing and dialogue was weak i also did not enjoy reading the part of the book that details dog fighting the dog was the only character in the book that i hoped would not be killed in the hurricane i finished the book but was relieved when i was done","583":"loved it but abhor dog fighting and wanted more of the hurricane scenes lived through a few myself though none at cat 5 could feel the anticipation the torture of waiting through it well done ironic how i finished reading this as a storm debby currently churns in the gulf sea","584":"as difficult as it was to read this is one of the most compelling stories i have read in a long time i wanted to memorize whole passages because they were so wonderful i read this book in two sittings and felt so attached to each character i was incredibly sad when it ended i would recommend this book to everyone read every single word even the hard and gritty parts a terrific find thanks elizabeth","585":" the first few pages had me doubting that i would like this book but i stuck with it and after awhile i was hooked i thought the author did a good job with the character development considering the entire span of the book just covered the 12 days before katrina hit they were real enough to me that i felt so many different emotions as i read about their day to day lives there are parts that are brutal and it was almost painful to read at times but yet i was so sucked into it i couldn't stop it was like the intensity of the story increased as katrina came closer and closer there were many times throughout the book that i wanted to knock some sense into the various characters for their behavior and actions but in the end the family members pulled together and did what was necessary to help each other survive it's difficult for me to imagine what it would be like to live in their shoes the extreme poverty the lack of parental involvement etc some of the things they did just to survive and entertain themselves were shocking there was no sugar coating in this book it was raw gritty brutal and real and it certainly captured my attention","586":"amazing felt like you were right there in the experience of the story","587":"devastating and lovely it deals with some very difficult themes but addresses them honestly and without reserve the weaving together of the nature of dogs storms mythology love and mothering makes this a truly incredible story the final lines are simply haunting i'd read it over if i thought i could stand to cry that much again","588":"tough story but impossible to put down unbelievably beautiful and well written","589":"after taking me on a ride through their loss and struggles the dog fights and the hurricane the book can't end like that i'm just going to have to believe it was a happy ending i am 100% convinced of it if it would have finished with a joyous reunion i'd give it five stars i'm holding stars cuz it was too brutal a journey to not have a happy ending just sayin'","590":"very well written story of a family in the time just prior to katirna and just after the characters grew on me as the story progressed and although many of the situations were difficult and way different than my life i couldn't stop reading and came to care for this family","591":"i am having a bad run with award winners while i admired the sense of place the author created and i was interested to read whether this family would weather the weather or they'd self destruct along with katrina's destruction but in the end it did not win me over i couldn't get over the dog violence and i realize that should not sway me because it's part of the representation of their hard life also while the hurricane scene was gripping it seemed too short after the build up the whole waiting for the water to recede was summed up in a paragraph as i said best thing was the gritty sense of place","592":"it almost feels pointless reviewing this book because my clumsy words will never do it justice the unmatched beauty and poetry of ward's language left me dumbstruck this is a heart rending book one that will stay with you hours and days after reading if you liked their eyes were watching god then this is a new classic for you","593":"it is a beautifully written tragic story very well done","594":"i love this book jesmyn ward did a wonderful job salvage the bones twelve chapters long was a easy read for me twelve day leading up to hurricane katrina was pretty powerful","595":"beautiful language but the greek mythology was giving me too much still readable","596":"the book was at once interesting but has a very difficult subject matter dog fighting in the middle which made it hard to read there are some great juxtapositions and vivid characters but i was left with an overall feeling that the story wasn't quite finished","597":"this book had great potential but i was so disappointed by much of the content there was so much language scattered throughout the book some of the worst kind descriptions of teenage sexual encounters scenes with dogs fighting etc on the good side the book was well written the themes and characters deep it is heartbreaking to see what happens to a poor girl without a mother to teach and guide her it was easier to let the boys have their way than to say no","598":" i thought the prose was fast paced and plot forming at some points and at other points fairly slow although it seemed to be always reaching for something the story however was meant to portray a life scene which is both slow moving at points and fast paced the calm before the storm and the destruction afterwards i did not understand much of the comparison between the main character esche and her brother's pregnant dog china i did appreciate knowing more of what was in the main character's head as she was trying to deal with being pregnant broke an uncommitted partner and without many options i thought that the relationships between the brothers and her character were genuine they were not overly paternalistic but they did indeed care for her greatly i could see how all of the characters worked together to become a family i believed in them the literary comparisons made throughout the book with the greek myths also added a simple but thoughtful layer of complexity to the story esche through her reading could escape her own life drama just for a moment to compare it to a wider selection there was some great foreshadowing within the brief connections made between her life and greek mythology","599":"i found this book impossible to put down it was so well written it's not a pleasant read by any means and definitely not meant for the beach i unfortunately took it with me on vacation the story of a poor black family in the coastal town of bois sauvage mississippi in the days before hurricane katrina hits the narrator of the story is esch 15 and pregnant her mother is dead and her father is mostly gone or drunk and the siblings do the best they can to take care of each other there are probably spoilers below i have a hard time reviewing without revealing something sorry esch's mother dies in childbirth directly after bringing junior into the world randall the basketball prodigy and esch learn to take care of junior in their mother's absence skeetah has eyes for his dog china only although ironically enough he manages to see what goes on around the pit better than anyone else if you had ever said that i would enjoy a book that features dog fighting i would've called you crazy immediately but the crazy thing is that ward makes it palatable it has to be in the way that skeetah who owns and fights the dog china loves her loves her in a way that puts her before anyone even his own needs at times that's the only way i can explain it that and the parallel that ward draws between china who at the beginning of the story gives birth to a litter of puppies and esch who is trying to come to terms with being pregnant esch compares herself to china in a few ways and its one of the many sadnesses of the story that this is the mother figure that esch looks and compares herself to esch has fallen in love with randall's best friend manny the story describes how she slept with all the boys before manny because it was easier than saying no to them but once she started messing around with manny she turned all the other boys down of course manny has a girlfriend and isn't interested in esch and is horrible to her when she reveals the pregnancy to him complicating matters a little is big henry a friend of the family who actually does love esch but she can't bring herself to love back in the background of course is hurricane katrina ward does a brilliant job of pacing in the story and by the time she actually hits you've been waiting anxiously for it the family attempts to prepare for her but of course they do too little way too late i think i expected more of the story to be about the actual hurricane and aftermath but the way she wraps it up is satisfying enough i could have used another 100 pages of storm and recovery description which might be why i only gave this 4 stars not 5 this story covers issues of poverty race and sex all in backdrop of the south it runs the gamut and almost seems impossible for me to adequately discuss all of it here in this review it's riveting the way she describes the childhood that these kids have had and your heart breaks for them in several places you can't help but wonder how it would have turned out if their mother had made it through junior's birth and you know it would have been better that's the heartbreaking part the father is broken the brothers can't relate esch gives her body away to anyone because she doesn't understand the value of it and junior is just a mess i liked the way the esch related her story to the greek mythology that she has been reading at school it makes sense in the way that the greeks used those stories to explain away their natural phenomenon that they didn't understand in the same way esch uses their stories to explain or relate to situations that she doesn't have the emotional intelligence to deal with i didn't think that some of the vocabulary that esch used in her head made sense for her character but it was only a couple minor words reference in places the only thing that's ever been easy for me to do like swimming through water was sex when i started having it and it was easier to let him keep on touching me than ask him to stop easier to let him inside than push him away easier than hearing him asks me why not it was easier to keep quiet and take it than give him an answer pgs 22 23 the blood on daddy's shirt is the same color as the pulpy puppy in china's mouth why did you skeetah wails why daddy breathes to randall and big henry standing over him the blood sluicing down his forearm china is bloody mouthed and bright eyed as medea if she could speak this is what i would ask her is this what motherhood is pgs 129 130 i want to say that i know her voice i want to open my mouth and have her voice slide out of me like an impression to speak mama alive for him as i hear her but i can't pg 221","600":"this book was emotionally difficult to read so i have a hard time giving it four stars which says i really liked it immensely depressing but well written and a great story about family and tragedy","601":"as hurricane katrina moves closer to the mississippi town of bois savage esch and her brothers prepare for the storm and live their lives the story is told over twelve days and there's a lot going on here esch is pregnant skeetah is fighting his pit bull and trying to raise her puppies randall is competing for a basketball scholarship and baby of the family junior is trying to grow up and be a child at the same time the family is motherless and almost fatherless daddy drinks often and is gone for long periods of time school is out for the summer and there is no adult supervision what could have been a book fraught with anxiety and melodrama is instead a simply told story of family love the writing is clear and pointed no words are spared and nothing extra is given making the descriptions of the storm and the poverty of the landscape all the more real","602":"this national book award winner took me away to rural mississippi and the days around hurricane katrina the deep love of the characters along side the brutality of the events is mesmerizing i was so inspired reading it that i'm going to edith hamilton's mythology off my son's bookshelf and read esch's favorite stories","603":" this was a hard book for me to read esch's predicament her father's alcoholism and the whole family's poverty was so bleak that i didn't want to continue reading any further even with the bleakness of the story there were some threads of hope that helped me to keep reading on the close bond of esch and her brother skeetah skeetah's affection for his dog and the growing tenderness between esch and her brother's friend big henry who begins to show esch true romantic affection that is beyond just the physicality of sex like she's experienced with the other boys a very touching story","604":"i could have done without the graphic dog fight skipped most of that chapter","605":"i picked this up as it was on the pulitzer list from last year this book had promise and i really enjoyed the character development at the beginning of it but it just didn't deliver during the really dramatic parts still i think it was a good sophomore effort by jesmyn ward and worth the read if you want a fairly heartbreaking novel about the experience of a african american family in the south and the obstacles faced both socially and economically by these people this is where i found the power in this book was in the way the story was told by the lead protagonist esch a 15 year old girl in rural mississippi who we also spoiler alert find out is pregnant as far as the story line goes if left me wanting a bit more it just seemed unresolved at the end","606":"salvage could've been gritty and turgid but despite the hurricane the story didn't twist to look death in the face and make us nauseous as i expected instead it floated along tossing out mythology to buoy esch and the men in her life i wanted her to be stronger tougher louder faster","607":"crazy little book i just couldn't put down just when i thought the obstacles where piled to the peak poverty hunger alcoholic father recently deceased mother dog fighting teenager longing for love and mistaking sex for love and then getting pregnant along comes hurricane katrina wow everything but the kitchen sink but so well written that you can feel the pain","608":"between 3 5 and 4 stars for me in my eyes after reading this i absolutely see why jesmyn ward won the national book award last year this is heady and deep stuff you see everything esch describes and you feel what her family feels what she feels deep down the dogfight scene had me on edge expecting the worst and you realize how little and how much the family has when katrina hits and even before then","609":"4 1 2 this won the national book award jesmyn ward is a fantastic writer her descriptions of this poor family in mississippi during katrina were heart breaking i thought the beginning of the book tended to ramble while she was establishing characters but the last third was fantastic stick with it and you will love it","610":"this was a tough book to read there were a few times i considered putting it aside but kept with it gritty raw and ultimately powerful the writing was very good perhaps too good considering it was in the voice of a young girl with a hard life and a self esteem problem i didn't think that her erudite thinking could be sufficiently explained by a love of reading mythology","611":" in the harsh atmosphere of backwater impoverished town esch and her family are preparing for hurricane katrina meanwhile she has sought love through sex with a neighbor boy her brother has sought it in the pit bull who has just birthed a litter the death of their mother in childbirth from the youngest junior has changed the dynamics of the family metaphorical savage scenes of dogfighting references to the book of mythology that esch is reading all blended into the tale of the twelve days leading up to katrina wonderful","612":"perhaps because i feel like so many books i pick up any more are dystopian and or apocalyptic this slice of life literary story was refreshing there were so many things to like about this story the characters we so well drawn that by the end i felt i could predict what they would say or how they would react in a good way i believed their relationships to each other and their animals the father wasn't drawn quite as well but i kind of liked that as a 13 year old i don't think i could have given a full picture of my father so i didn't expect esch to be able to do that either the katrina chapter had me on the edge of my seat i couldn't read it fast enough view spoiler and even though there was still another chapter to go i was worried that esch wasn't going to make it hide spoiler i'm looking forward to more books from ward","613":"great descriptive language the author transports you to the place and you really get into some of the characters' head i ended wanting to know more","614":"wow a powerful rough story that will stay for me a long time i don't know that i could easily recommend it no feel good story this but it would make for quite an interesting discussion at book club","615":"i thought it could have gone on for another twenty pages i'm upset they never found the dog and i didn't think the title was apt","616":"this book made my heart hurt i read it in a day i found it somewhat painful but couldn't put it down i would have cried like a baby but i finished it at work and felt like novel induced tears would just be too unprofessional really powerful read it","617":"i can see why this won the national book award the writing is exceptional although their lives were completely foreign to me the author opened my eyes and allowed me to see through the characters' eyes which is a real fete and testament to her writing abilities this feels like an important story that needed to be told","618":"it is hard for me to not start with why with the relentless medea but i'm going to try not to because i really enjoyed this book this book is ostensibly about the narrator but really it is about the dog mother china she is the central focus of everything when the book began i was annoyed at how much time was spent going into detail on the dog's birth but that's because i had no idea china would become the foundation for the novel those details and the many that followed we're critical the descriptions of china are both heart breaking and terrifying the love between her and skeetah is so well depicted without resorting to any sentimentality and really there is no sentimentality when it comes to this dog some of the scenes no spoilers i almost flinched at and had to turn my head away from the page i shuddered at one in particular at the end of a dogfight those who've read will know what i am talking about the characters all felt very multi dimensional and full skeetah was quite a study his devotion if that's what it is as described by the narrator is intense the narrator esche is also a great character her narration of the story is unflinching and detailed i felt really immersed into her world she herself is also fascinating as we watch her try to figure out what to do with her unexpected dilemma spoiler the scene were she finally tells manny was just so painfully gorgeous so real she hates him so much but loves him so much all she can do is fight him even as she is pregnant with his child and theoretically could lose it in a rough fight one of the reviews said this was the best katrina novel ever or something like that it's absurd this is not a katrina novel if it was it would be a failure this is about human suffering in the face of greater suffering the struggles to survive but for what this is not about katrina other than the massive hurricane bearing down is the background throughout so i can't even really talk about it in that context books have catastrophes that characters have to deal with what makes this different but again the entire evacuation sequence was also incredible esche'a narration was typically slow and thoughtful but it raced during their flight from their home and struggle back and it didn't feel like it raced to spare us details or because the author didn't know how to convey them spoiler she clearly knew how to convey them i thought using every body sense the water rising up their bodies was incredible but really what showed me she was not going to back down was when the puppies were lost somehow though there was always this foreboding something would happen to them after china beat so many other problems when it did happen it just happened so quickly they were gone and so was she so medea i love medea as an image and icom and reference i even took a class in college called mothers who kill about medea medea stories and medea characters i could not for anything figure out why the author had to slam it over our heads so many times i get it china is medea esche is maybe medea all women are part medea at first i thought she was trying to make esche appear right less we stereotype her but you can quickly tell that is unnecessary and honestly an insult to the intelligence of people like esche and her family so then i have the author the benefit of doubt and assumed it really was to just keep the medea story everpresent except it was jarring esche would in the middle of narration ask herself questions about did medea feel this way or did jason do this etc etc that being said some of the medea imagery was intensely beautiful horrifying spoiler the description of china as she ate her pup especially her face as observed by esche who then thinks is this what it means to be a mother and china's fight scene the thoughts imputed to her were astounding especially the last few as she stood on top of her mate the father of her puppies ready to kill him i have no milk for you whoa blown away i would really give this book a 4 75 just because esche's medea questions were so irritating but were balanced in part by the skillfully woven medea thread of actual actions all the way to the very last sentence","619":" just finished salvage the bones by jesmyn ward about thirty pages into this book the father of the family living on the outskirts of new orleans comments that a hurricane called katrina has been identified off the coast of florida with that seed planted the book progresses to what we all know is a major catastrophe the tone and tension mirroring the building intensity of the storm the narrator esch is the sole female in the house her mother having passed away after giving birth to her youngest brother esch navigates her feelings towards mothers and motherhood after her brother skeet's pit bull china gives birth to puppies without giving too much away motherhood and loss are the underlying themes of the book and ward captures them thoughtfully without being too heavy handed by the time katrina arrives the family has already experienced life changing events in the days leading up to the storm and i found myself wondering just how much more they could weather as the winds started to pick up i thought the book was beautifully written but didn't love or hate it on the whole also as a warning to animal lovers there is organized dog fighting that was extremely difficult to read","620":"i found this book very interesting it was raw and confronting the family you follow is equally easy to love and despair at i was drawn in very easily to their world and their troubles and threaded through this book is the weather hurricane katrina is a character here very much in her own right i recommend this but not for the faint hearted","621":"dark and deeply compelling","622":" brutal and savage this story of a family's experience before and after katrina is one of my favorite books of the year told by a poor pregnant fifteen year old at first glance one would say her life couldnt be any more hopeless but soon the grace and dignity of a destitute southern families loyalty and devotion to each other makes lack of resources seem not so desperate the ever present background story of medea accents the classic nature of this tale of the meaning of motherhood and family dog human or mother nature i kept thinking faulkner and wasnt surprised that she lists him as an influence at the back of the book beautiful language and a beautiful story","623":"absolutely blown away by this read ward channels the emotions and realness of this family's pre and post traumatic life in a way that makes you want to weep some have compared her to toni morrison and there are definite similarities which i now see after finishing the way she depicts scenes is unabashed and completely without remorse allowing the characters to channel these emotions rather than herself","624":"physical writing everything esch talks about it's all spun out from her body the bodies around her intense u0026amp fucking worth it it took me awhile to realize how much i like this book a lot but only because i'm not used to such... physical writing everything esch talks about it's all spun out from her body the bodies around her intense u0026amp fucking worth it","625":"this book is painful to read it is the story of a teenaged girl in mississippi during hurricane katrina her family is dirt poor and she is pregnant by a boy she loves but who has been using her esch has three brothers and an alcoholic father and the story of the love that holds them all together is powerful i found myself wondering how such poverty can exist in a country where we have millions of millionaires and saddened by the thought of a young girl who wants so badly to be loved that she allows boys to use her without a second thought for sex and the storm well as others have said the storm is the monster in this nightmare of a story beautifully written heartbreakingly real","626":"this was beautifully written i'm not sure i totally bought the mythic connection between jason and medea and the dirt poor yearning struggling pit bull fighting characters struck by hurricane katrina but it did make me think and feel a surprising respect for a set of very different characters it also makes one ashamed of our wonderful advanced society here in the good ol' us of a","627":"this is not a happy book in any sense the longing esch feels for manny is hard to read as are the passages about dog fighting but it pulls you into another world and will likely stick with you after you've finished","628":"one of the best books that i've read over the past 10 years loved it","629":"great companion book to etounne","630":"hard to finish ending goes too fast better in the beginning","631":"tough book to read hated the atmosphere however having said that very well written if you like despair read it","632":"salvage the bones is an unflinching story of southern rural black poverty told through the eyes of a young black girl that most of us would probably write off jesmyn ward has written a beautiful and terrible account of daily survival in the poor rural south and then intoduced hurricane katrina to the mix interwoven is the myth of medea as esch the narrator comes to understand it's relevance to her life lyrical and metaphorical on so many levels as a human you should read it","633":"there are four of them junior age seven esch fifteen skeetah sixteen and randall seventeen their mama died seven years ago when junior was born the daddy is around but has a problem with alcohol and anger they have a dog a pit bull named china a dog trained for fighting she gave birth to five puppies in the very first chapter early on we also learn that fifteen year old esch began having sex at the age of twelve and has had quite a number of local partners in the three years since then condoms were not quite enough protection and esch is pregnant since esch is the narrator the pregnancy is covered closely in the past couple of months esch has limited herself sexually to manny so she figures he is the daddy she'd like him to love her or at least notice her more but he has another woman she doesn't tell anyone she is pregnant not even saying it out loud to herself the story takes place over twelve days including hurricane katrina but esch does recall earlier events in the life of the family the book can be seen as small stories that are put together to make the whole at the end of chapter four there is the escape and chase ending with the dog fight when that scene concludes you are just as out of breathe as the characters on the page then there is the confrontation between skeetah and daddy about getting rotting plywood to board up the house in preparation for the coming hurricane if you know the stories of the greek gods this book has a bonus for you references to myths gods and goddesses occur regularly \"he is the patroclus to randall's achilles tonight \" i don't know the myths or the gods i could look them up and figure out what the references mean but then i would never finish the book but if you know them it undoubtedly adds to the reading imagine the greek myths in a story about ramshackle country people with a ramshackle home place salvage the bones has some terrific descriptive writing about people and places vivid little bits about the deteriorating homestead are sprinkled throughout \"our house is the color of rust nearly invisible under the oaks and behind the rubbish lopsided the cement bricks it sits on are the color of the sand \" if i can just relax focus and let the words come to me it is a moving experience the characters can be brutal physically and emotionally here is manny attacking esch in the women's bathroom at a high school basketball game the bathroom is dark darker even than the gym and it is small...been thinking about you says manny and then he has pushed me back into the stall he will look at me he snorts puts his head down into my shoulder i pull hard and my hands slide along his face i grab again he will look at me he grunts grabbing at my sweaty sides his eyes closed his lashes are longer than those of any girl i know beautiful the thumbs of his long hands press into my stomach so he can pull again but then they stutter he presses hard again my belly pushes back he looks down and back up eye to eye all i have wanted here he is looking he is seeing me and his hands are coming around to feel the honeydew curve the swell that is more than swell the fat that is not fat the budding baby and his eyes are so black they are all black and they are a night without stars all i have ever wanted he knows \"fuck \" manny yells and he is throwing me up and off of him i hit the door behind me the rough cat tongue of his face gone dog fighting is a rural small town sport men have their pit bulls and get together to cheer on the blood sport usually they are too fond of the dogs to let them fight to the death the book includes a dog fighting episode that gives you a taste of the \"sport\" and how the dogs can be the substitute acting out the antagonisms between men the juxtaposition of the fierce dog vs dog and the tender feelings between owner and dog are a part of the complexity of the story the idea of dog fighting is abhorrent to me and i found myself conflicted about the dog china this book does \"intense\" so well the last example is the family going though the raging storm that was katrina along the mississippi coast but for all the intensity i thought that the ending was rather blah and sentimental maybe it was just a little too hopeful and neat it didn't fit the book for me the writing is excellent and the story is enveloping you have to be willing to be battered by the intensity and to live with the experience of being a pregnant teenager this is not an easy book it honestly earns four stars but for the ending i would call it five","634":"did not finish this one because though it is well written it is also too wordy for me with far too much poetic description and far too little dialogue and plot and apparently in order to be a national book award winner your book must contain a typo p 3 see also absolutely true diary of a part time indian review","635":"the story covers a twelve day time period leading up to the landfall of hurricane katrina the main character is esch the only girl in a family of 4 children her mother has passed away and her father is an alcoholic added to the batiste family is an assembly cast of friends of the two older brothers what we learn about the family over this short period of time is both haunting and devastating this leads up to their fight to survive the hurricane as they are forced from their home during the middle of the storm after reading all of the great reviews on this book i was a bit disppointed in what i read it's not that this wasn't a fairly good read rather i guess i expected more from the story line it seemed that the majority of the book focused on skeet esch's brother and his beloved dog china i wanted to see more of esch's story but she seemed to be swallowed up in the storyline of her family","636":"great story about the strength of a poor southern family that has little but a belief in each other a belief that persists in the face of the limitations of circumstance and character in each family member and in the face of hurricane katrina the 15 yr old pregnant narrator is eloquent with her straight forward descriptions of what she sees and is appropriately less skilled at understanding and conveying her emotions she even gives the reader cross references from what unfolds in the 12 days she describes to greek mythology now that's service","637":"pregnancy poverty puppies and hurricane katrina i can see why this won that national book award it tells the love of a battered family that makes them survive one of the most destructive storms ever","638":"under all the hardships a family survives a breathtaking read with such insight and love into another families life you felt that you were watching each characters lives as if you were there in the room with them","639":"read this book it is a classic","640":" it took a while for this book to grow on me but it did just that it slid on up and engulfed me quietly and slowly esch's voice is tender and vulnerable and she does justice into letting us into the folds of the batiste family a family that is like our own in so many ways yet different families and people that we see and know yet we try to distance ourselves from them in some way but they represent the yearning unknowing trusting pain sorrow and fierce closeness that many families share and they share these feelings in words that are never expressed but action while descriptions say the book is about hurricane katrina it's really about family and how family pulls together in moments of pure tragedy when they've just been trudging along before","641":"disturbing and poetic","642":"transports you into a totally different world a very poor rural family living their normal lives as katrina approaches and then hits very well written feels like you're watching a movie through the eyes of a young girl","643":"this story takes place over 12 days in mississipppi with hurricane katrina hitting on day 11 we meet esch a teen who finds out she is pregnant and follow her and her brothers there is crazy poverty dog fights child neglect a mother's death and natural disaster it is a hard story to read but it brought the experience of a hurricaine to life in a way i haven't ever felt throughout the book are references to medea and jason it felt like a novel meant for an english class to have time to parse out the themes related to greek myths parenting and have time to re read and study beatifully crafted passages","644":"this is not a light happy read i was going to only give it two or three stars but the last third or more flew by and was very compelling the author had a great voice and her account of katrina was gutting ended up enjoying what the author did even if it was mostly dark","645":"jesmyn ward is a master of simile and metaphor","646":"hard to finish because of the style of writing","647":"filled with an incredible sense of foreboding i have to admit though that i skipped some of the dog fighting passages","648":"liked it a lot really got the feel of the characters","649":" wow if you ever wanted to know what it was like to be poor and facing katrina read this book if you ever wanted to know what it was like to be a 15 year old girl and pregnant read this book if you ever wanted a full picture of maternal ferocity read this book it is savage brutal loving in some way i haven't put my finger on yet ward is updating their eyes were watching god which also culminates in a hurricane everything about this story is different but still i almost couldn't read all the way through the dog fight in the center of the book but it was worth hanging on till the end","650":"not an easy read but a compelling story with interesting well defined characters an uncomfortable but probably very realistic view of poverty in the south","651":"a very engaging book some parts were hard to read because of their gruesome nature however i enjoyed it and think it'll be a book that will stay with me for a long time excellent book group discussion","652":"this book was written from the perspective of a 15 year old girl it succeeded in transporting me back to those days of teenage angst and family struggles set immediately prior to and after hurricane katrina it also helped convey the scope of devastation and helplessness brought on by this storm to an already impoverished many overriding all in this story is the strength of family in the face of a multitude of tragedies hardships and personal flaws","653":"every now and then a book comes along that touches you either emotionally intellectually or both to me this is the mark of a great novel salvage the bones is one of those novels it's raw and gritty and real and sometimes very ugly in the most beautiful way","654":"focusing on a small african american community in the days before katrina salvage the bones is a decent enough idea that for me didn't quite come off on the conceptual level i get it the emotional punch is supposed to come from our sense of the lives that are about to be disrupted the looming shadow one of the problems is that that's kind of obvious another is that ward's obsessed with making her protagonist's life seem capital i important by sprinkling in a series of references to the medea myth the rest of the characterization makes it unlikely that the character would feel that kind of connection with the story similarly ward piles a lot of symbolic weight on the protagonist's brother's relationship with his fighting dog again it's a decent enough idea but it never quite comes alive there are simply too many big events in sotto voce crammed into the time span not bad but i'm not recommending it","655":"seriously beautiful and emotionally gripping tale of kids growing up in poverty and the love they have for one another set with hurricane katrina approaching a few scenes very hard for me to read about dog fighting etc and then several scenes brought actual tears the kind of book that stays with you","656":"lovely story of this family heart breaking yet gave me such a warm feeling of the love these brothers and sister had for each other and their life in the south highly recommended","657":"there is so much love in this book hurricane katrina's power so urgently portrayed pales in contrast","658":"beautifully written very moving story incredibly depressing but even though it was a bit dark it didn't leave me feeling hopeless or completely worn as many depressing books tend to do it left me in a rather thoughtful mood really great book","659":"parts of this book were very difficult to read including a graphic passage about a dog fight but despite the ugliness surrounding the lives of its characters salvage the bones is a wonderfully written and captivating novel through the thoughtful lyrical voice of esch ward managed to bring me close enough to the family in twelve days to bring tears along with the winces she also managed to write a book with a character as big as katrina that is much more than a story about the storm it is a masterful telling of the pain of poverty and the resilience of family","660":"story of an african american family in bois sauvage mississipp during hurricane katrina","661":"this was a work of art a vivid painting of life in the mississippi bayou just before and as hurricane katrina hits the perspective is original the subject matter is troubling and there's no denying the artistry of the writer","662":" a literary work about the struggles and triumphs facing four siblings who are living a hardscrabble existence in rural louisana with their alcoholic father it takes place over 11 days leading up to what will be the devastation of hurricane katrina in spite of the oppressiveness of the poverty the heat and the approaching storm this is a story about the strengh of love and family bonds and the resiliency of the human spirit like all good literary fiction this book evokes powerful images and emotions the characters especially the narrator teen aged esche will be with me for a long time","663":"jesmyn ward is one of the most talented new writers working in the us today she powerfully weaves the story of esch a pregnant 15 year old with the events of hurricane katrina and the myth of medea and jason brilliant","664":"amazing story about a family and katrina","665":"not sure what attracted me to this one probably reviews enjoyed the storyline but felt that it ended a bit abruptly without resolution","666":"too long and very boringthe author is so overly descriptive my eyes glazed over many timesnothing interesting or insightful happensi was indifferent to every character except big henry but he wasnt enough for me to recommend this book","667":" i loved esch's voice she is a bright and articulate girl stuck in a boy's world and coping the best that she can the story is amazingly tragic and has the potential to be too overtly after school special with the teen pregnancy alcoholic father dead mother extreme poverty and katrina to boot but amazingly ward pulls it off she crafts a novel that is compelling heartbreakingly real and touching there are several important relationships in the book and each one examines a different kind of love skeet's love for china is one of the most overt in the book yet he is the only one paying enough attention to notice that esch is pregnant and he sacrifices china to the current to save esch when they swim for high ground during the hurricane randall is also a very caring a nurturing guy he is essentially the father figure for junior esch clearly describes her intense attraction for and love of manny despite his indifference to her i loved the change in language when esch was thinking about manny he is always beautiful she knows that he has no deeper feelings for her and that the likelihood of them ending up in a relationship is almost nonexistent she knows that the pregnancy is not a good thing the terrible truth of what i am flares like a dry fall fire in my stomach eating all the fallen pine needles but she still hopes and dreams i also liked that her description of china changed after she became certain of her own pregnancy titties became breasts china was a weary goddess and later china will bark and call me sister in the star suffocated sky there is a great waiting silence she will know that i am a mother early on the reader sees a similar unrequited love in big henry's feelings for esch she does not spurn him the way that manny has spurned her but he is the only one of the boys with whom she has not consented to have sex i loved the simultaneity between china eating the puppy and daddy losing his finger there is so much that is shown in the relationships between these people and the animals as who we love disappoints us and we struggle to establish a new reality or convince them to return to the way they used to be or the way they used to treat us before the disappointment there was a timeline issue that bothered me on the first page esch is described as being 8 when her mother died giving birth to junior but later when she tells the story of elaine the worse hurricane she experienced prior to katrina she says she was nine and mama was large pregnant i also did not like that on page 7 she references as i lay dying certainly the topic and location bring faulkner to mind throughout the novel and gives esch the ability to answer the hardest question it seemed like ward was inviting the comparison rather than letting it happen naturally which it very well might given her great writing cheap and fishing for compliments is how it came across and maybe just because it was so early in the book overall this book is about love in all it's forms and the relationships that sustain us through the worse things that life can throw at us very good read","668":" ust as a heads up this is book is a downer set in bois savage mississippi the book follows esch a teenager who lost her mom about nine years ago while giving birth to her brother her father a heavy drinker finds himself preparing esch and her three brothers for the storm of a lifetime katrina the preparations are complicated by esch's pregnancy as well as the birth of a litter of puppies to the family well really her brother's beloved pit bull this book was nominated for the national book award and i felt it was well deserved of the praise it has received it was a little hard for me to fathom the conditions this family lived in but was a much needed reminder that there are many more like esch's family out there the writing kept me engaged and i was interested to see how the family would weather the storm","669":" i should have liked this book i really should have i knew next to nothing going into it but when i started it i honestly believed it would be a book i'd fall in love with and sure it's well written sometimes ward's descriptions teeter on the edge of too much writer workshop exposure but for the most part she knows how to beautifully construct a sentence but i found myself spending more time flipping through the pages to see where a chapter ended so i could take a break rather than submerging myself in the story it just never gained the power to fully grip my attention this might be one of those books that i'll revisit in a few years a realize my low rating was completely asinine but as of right now it's just going to have to do","670":"i thought salvage the bones to be fantastic in terms of the authors writing the way she interwove jason and the argonauts into it and her use of words to describe what was going on in the story it was almost poetic her description of the weather is subtly woven in leading up to the hurricane almost as if you could actually feel what they felt i also like how the family looks out for one another even their close friends none of them have much but what they do have they share","671":" ward has a beautiful control of the language she did not have the same control of the plot the best part was the love between all the siblings i wanted to get inside esch's head more to better understand why she allowed such abuse i get it but i would have enjoyed more depth in that part of the story line the hurricane fit well into the structure of the story and those readers who have katrina fatigue won't feel that way with this one the book has a discombobulated feel about it i personally don't like reading about dog fighting","672":"this is a book worth reading it is beautifully written and offers many exceptional turns of phrase that will make you go back and reread because of the inherent poetry and insight a simple phrase can offer the story is a classic tragedy and leaves the reader with a new perspective but it is a also a brutal story so well told that the impact of the brutality should not be minimized this story is just not for the faint of heart in spite of the author's gift of expression the book offers an underlying theme that is quite unlikely given the overall setting the protagonist is a teenage girl mired in poverty so unrelenting that it made me wince more than once she has a summer reading assignment from school and she perceives her own life in the context of that classic greek tale this is an effective storytelling method that offers insight into the heart of this girl from an unexpected perspective and is frequently heart wrenching for the reader a second theme that emerges equally or possibly more compelling than the primary tale is the story of the brother who owns a dog that he fights and breed all his ego his passion and his hope for the future are invested in this dog the result of this exposition is that this character's soft underbelly is exposed and this is also no mean feat the brother is almost a stereotypical teenage man the type i would avoid dealing with in daily life because he is scary to me drives and old banger plays music too loud wears wife beaters and is covered in skin art and piercings yet somehow i finished the book with an empathy for this character a broader understanding of something i never knew i needed to know more about i live in the south not far from the author's home similar to the characters in the book i stayed in my home through katrina with much less dramatic results i work at an office job and my day to day is vastly different from the characters in this book i sometimes see evidence that this level of poverty exists in the world around me and admit to turning away from this just not wanting to deal with this alternate reality just not wanting to internalize this level of despair this is not an experience i would have chosen for myself i received the book recommendation from a friend and decided to give it a try i am glad i did although her recommendation also came with a warning about the substance of the story line i read the entire book in two sittings once i got started i could not put it down until about halfway through when i took a break and let it sit for a week or more at that point in the story i had a feeling that what was about to happen next was not going to be 'good' and i was anxious and worried for the characters so is this a good writer or what i was so engaged that i had to take a break a prepare myself to finish the book i actually had to make a decision to continue reading i think that in addition to all the other elements that make this book worth reading the story has had a deep impact on my psyche that will make me a better person a more empathetic and more aware person i have no doubt this story is based on many truths the author has also seen and possibly experienced in her earlier life","673":"deeply affecting work by a young author a survival tale the constant cycle of birth the struggle to survive and death all set against the harsh backdrop of rural mississippi while a killer storm katrina bears down on the community","674":"a superb novel grim and desperate but also beautiful published for adults but a story i can see some older teen readers appreciating an example of ward's stunning prose i will tie the glass and stone with string hang the shards above my bed so that they will flash in the dark and tell the story of katrina the mother that swept into the gulf and slaughtered her chariot was a storm so great and black the greeks would say it was harnessed to dragons she was the murderous mother who cut us to the bone but left us alive left us naked and bewildered as wrinkled newborn babies as blind puppies as sun starved newly hatched baby snakes she left us a dark gulf and salt burned land she left us to learn to crawl she left us to salvage katrina is the mother we will remember until the next mother with large merciless hands committed to blood comes","675":" an excellent follow up to morrison's home after i finish a book by my all time favorite author i worry that no matter the quality of the writing in the next book it will pale in comparison i won this signed copy of salvage the bones right after ward won the nba for fiction and have been saving it for a special time once i cracked open the spine of this book and read the first chapter i knew that never before have i read a book like this and probably never will ward was able to access something divine and channel it perfectly into the fine form of a book the story is of an african american family living in rural mississippi whose home stands in the path of hurricane katrina the tale is broken down into twelve days chapters over which ward spins a tale of such heartbreaking clarity and violence that i was absolutely lifted out of my being and brought to a whole 'nother realm of experience so rarely does this transcendental rise occur in the life of a reader but yet it is the moment we all yearn for and miss ward it is pleasure to journey with you to a world of your creation please everybody read this book","676":"beautifully written highly recommended","677":"very well written but very disturbing","678":"i had to keep reminding myself that the setting for this story was present day because it was hard for me to imagine this african american family living the way they were depicted in this book in current times it definitely gave me some insight into what life is like in the deep south the story leads up to the family surviving hurricane katrina a fitting end to this story of survival on many levels this one started as a 3 star but ended as a 4","679":"a beautiful story about coming of age under the most desperate of circumstances every sentence in this book could stand alone as a poem i came to love these characters even the ones i didn't like at all when i first started reading as they fight with everything they have for each other they all feel completely real to me as if they're still out there rebuilding recreating perhaps still looking","680":"not my favorite but i've read alot worse the author discription of the hurricane was very good you sensed she had been thru them once or twice","681":"parts of this book really caught my attention where other parts did not the story of the relationship between the boy and his dog were the most compelling a poetic tale of survival","682":"this was a sweet novella it takes place near the gulf of mississippi in the days leading up to hurricane katrina there is a family that includes the father daughter esch the main character and 3 sons the story is told in esch's voice she is a reader and adores her brothers she follows them around their home named the pit one brother raises fighting dogs one is a basketball star and the other is dependent on her as he is only 7 esch finds out she is pregnant be one of her brother's friends she is 15 the dad is remote and often drunk he does not say much since he wife died several years ago i really liked the story","683":"the story was interesting but i just didn't like how the sentences were structured it was just one of those books that didn't flow for me","684":"i was disappointed in how little i liked this book the dog fighting scenes were too much for me as was rape i certainly wouldn't have chosen it for the national book award or book of the year there were some passages that were beautiful but it wasn't enough to make up for the rest of the book","685":"good well written story hard to read about puppy deaths and dog fighting","686":" tob 12 once more this is the second time i've read a hurricane katrina book for tob although this one was quite different from the first the story of a girl growing up poor and motherless with a drunken father and a bunch of brothers in the rural south this book definitely had its moments the narrator who has just discovered that at 15 she is pregnant manages to defy a lot of the stereotypes as does her family but there is something about the story that ultimately didn't stick with me in some ways for me the most interseting thing about it is that katrina doesn't seem to have been some life changing thing which ruined forever this family's former world things are bad things are gone but they were already bad it might seem a little uplift y that everyone came together and found out they love each other and every little thing is going to be all right but i felt the ending struck the right balance between that and the devastation of katrina","687":"i am a sucker for beautiful prose and that is in abundance here this is not a happy story it involves dog fighting and hurricane katrina it involves mistakes but those facts are separate from the quality which is impeccable impeachable yes to the national book award yes to this book i cried while walking down the street in the terrible summer humidity on my way to work it is the epic in miniature","688":"well written the story as devastating as katrina herself","689":" jesmyn ward's salvage the bones presented this reader with an impoverished rural black south that i had seen as left behind the book tells the story of a black family dealing with the demands of hurricane katrina post katrina i heard a lot about the urban dealings with katrina's aftermath but this book gave me a window into devastation within rural communities dogs specifically fighting dogs are a looming motif in the story one of the most shocking scenes describes a dog fight in lurid detail not something i've experienced in many other novels ward does not shy away from classical allusions the story of medea is consistently referred to and is not so literati that she'll avoid a 40 oz or outkast reference incredibly readable i shot through this book in about 5 days","690":" for those who want to read a string of books about katrina and its aftermath include jesmyn ward's national book award winner from this year it is another fictional account from the african american perspective much like barthelme's waveland was a few years back it is equally as powerful her references to greek mythology are consistent and timely throughout the narrative ward should be cosidered in the next generation after walker morrison and j california cooper her story of a struggling family in rural mississippi is heartbreaking you can't help but root for this family even though the various family members are placing their hopes in a basketball scholarship dog fighting a pregnancy and the bottom of a bottle respectively ultimately they are all trying to survive this book is one of my favorite books from this past year had already placed it at number 6 before finishing it and it probably moved up a notch or two from there","691":"staggeringly sad unbearably sad actually i had to walk away from this book again and again but i returned bc it's also important and beautiful","692":"random rapid thoughts about this book a quick read while i wouldn't compare her to hemingway for who is i will give her credit as writing in a style and prose as close to hemingway as any other author i've read that said her content differs signficantly from that of ernest's the author is talented her metaphors distinct and imaginative her theme well articulated not sure that it's worthy of a national book award in the past year i've read past winners let the world spin 2009 and sophie's choice 1980 and it pales in comparison but i will note that the book is different artistic and accurate","693":"this book made me feel like i weathered a storm and came out into the sunshine on the other side wow just wow","694":"i honestly couldn't decide what rating to give this book would love to know what others think of it it's different compelling sad disturbing unique","695":"to be clear the one star rating is not due to the contents of the book jesmyn ward has an amazing voice and i hope that she continues to write with such eloquence and tenderness unfortunately the subject matter was much too much for me to handle i would not be able to read it again","696":"this book stays with you and for awhile i have to confess you feel mired in it like you will never escape and yet i wonder if that is not the author's intention to get you so deep into the heat and humidity and abject poverty and sense of no options that you just give up and slog through the pages reading the characters and hoping for a better outcome the book is about hurricane katrina but the hurricane does not appear until very close to the end the book builds as the hurricane does with growing weight and import until you feel something has to give the characters get under your skin even the ones you don't like and it makes what happens matter","697":"i don't remember why i bought this book it probably wasn't that it won the national book award for 2011 more likely that it's about the mississippi coast in the time prior to hurricane katrina i have family living on that coastline and have visited the area many times being from the not so far away louisiana \"hill country \" don't laugh - there are some i'm white though and while all southerners or all classes and races interact although they sometimes don't act like it this book has a lot to say about the underprivileged of all ilks throughout the south the book is about a black family - or what remains of one - in the two weeks or so leading up to katrina the principal character and narrator is the girl of the family esch and she's pregnant esch has an alter ego of sorts in her brother skeetah's pit bull china who in the first few pages gives birth to her first litter skeetah is something of a dog whisperer and his hold on china is little short of magical there's another brother randall who has hoop dreams and a late addition to the family junior a young lad named manny has done the dirty with esch she's in love with him and is reluctant to tell him she's pregnant she goes through all the usual throes of morning sickness having to guess what's going on in her biology but she's a plucky kid and she perseveres when katrina hits the family which has already been turned upside down by poverty and the brood's mother's earlier death is turned - i don't know - sideways but this isn't a story about victimization it owes a lot to hugo's underclass in les miserables - they improvise they adapt they attempt continually to overcome ward's book leaves us with a poignant ending but one with resilience and promise jesmyn ward knows how to hold a reader she takes us deep into the souls of esch particularly but each of the others in the family as well she paces her story like a pro never leaving us in despair with a hint of promise just over the horizon the story's details are what continued to charm me esch as narrator's eloquence her insight although she often spoke more \"street\" in dialogue - but it works into her condition the family's ongoing plight as well as their separate and collaborative dreams the attention to nature the weather of course the dog's fleas ants crawling across esch's toes the smell of the unkempt house the feel of sweat the ramen and vienna sausages they eat even the details of a series of dogfights this book clearly deserves the award it's about life and i can tell you it speaks to life as a southerner regardless of race or color or creed","698":" i read salvage the bones because i am looking for books to assign to the library's book club this was an extremely quick read it was written well and i liked that it took place over the course of 12 days each chapter being a day some of the imagery was interesting caused me to stop and try and figure out what the author was trying to do i most enjoyed the sections that focused on one of the siblings and his relationship with his dog i think that if i were to assign this book to my book club it would be with a warning about the dogs the book contains a rather graphic dog fighting scene so for people who have a hard time with animal cruelty this may be a deal breaker i was engaged enough to finish the book but as i told someone it was nothing to write home about i found that i was never invested enough in the charachters to care about what happen to them during the climax of the book i am hoping that by my book club reading it that the discussion will bring to light issues or ideas that i never thought of","699":"salvage the bones is like one of those big multi vitamins you struggle to swallow with your morning coffee you're not necessarily enjoying the experience but you know it's good for you it's a story about a poor black louisiana family staring down katrina but most of the story takes place in the days leading up to the hurricane days that are often more harrowing then the hurricane itself days of birthing dogs nursing dogs dying dogs fighting dogs bleeding dogs sick dogs fighting over dogs stealing for dogs starving for dogs if i would have known this book was more about a boy and his pit bull i wouldn't have read it i just couldn't relate to skeetah and his gleaming white dog china in real life skeetah is a michael vick training this poor savage dog for fighting and for breeding even more savage dogs but in salvage the bones ward paints skeetah to be a tragic hero i applaud her stellar writing for humanizing skeetah and i think most of her readers fall for it i could not at times i felt like she was almost romanticizing the dog fighting world urging us to see beyond the violence to convince us it is ultimately about love for the animal perhaps because members of her own family sometimes fought their pit bulls i did not buy into it so that story line fell completely flat with me i did love esch the narrator 15 and pregnant the one female treading water in a world of men the thing about esch she speaks in metaphor and simile specifically weather metaphors the book is drowning in it maybe it's the mythology book esch is reading the one about jason and the argonauts the one where they set sail looking for the golden fleece get my drift oops it's contagious i prefer less is more when it comes to story telling ward for the most part is not and that's okay here because though heavy handed her writing is beautiful toward the end ward brought me to tears with just one simple sentence and for that one quiet sentence i'm glad i read her book","700":"i thought this was a great look into a little piece of a life that is not mine and as another book club goer said an excellent answer to the question of why people like esch and her family did not evacuate before the giant scary hurricane which presumes a lot of things about wealth and privilege it's a thinking book but one well worth thinking about read more","701":"this heart wrenching incredibly engaging novel peeks into the life a poverty stricken family in coastal mississippi taking place over 12 days hurricane katrina hits on day 11","702":" the writing was beautiful but not enough to overcome the fact that i did not get into the story and the characters unlike nabokov's writing where the writing in itself is enough to make me love his books the most interesting chapter for me was the second to last one when katrina hits it was on this chapter that i actually felt something for the characters but the last chapter left me wanting more it is the national book award winner for fiction of 2011 so i had high expectations for it and maybe that is why other reviews i have read are not so forgiving i would not recommend this book to most people simply because the story is not engaging enough and like i said the beautiful writing in itself does not justify reading this book","703":"salvage the bones is brilliant or more precisely ward is brilliant i am going to put this book in my very small pile of works i want to read again because i felt torn the entire time i was reading between the pull of the story which urged me to race through the pages and the seduction of the writing which begged me to slow down and savor every word metaphor dialogue scene i never thought i would be able to tolerate a scene depicting organized dog fighting while ward doesn't allow you to turn away she neither over dramatizes nor makes the people she draws with such respect villanous any book that asks the question of what is family and then shows us the complexity of the answer is doing every one of us a tremendous service","704":"the last thirty pages were amazing however i found it slow going for the 200 pages before that i just didn't find the first person narrator esch very interesting i pitied her and her situation but i wasn't taken in by her perspective of the world which wasn't as witty insightful funny heartbreaking whatever as i would've liked i preferred her weird heroic brother skeetah a far richer character the similes were so thick and unnecessary throughout i also had a problem with the content of these similes it was just one southern nature food reference after another i don't buy that mississippians and i am one talk write like this certainly not as often as esch does for instance manny stops turning and his face is a magnolia flower tossing in the wind his eyes the bright yellow heart i left that girl with a knot rising purple on her head and a lip pink and tender as a pickled pig's lips in a jar and both of those are within 2 pages overall a tougher haul to finish than i was expecting","705":"subject matter is hard and gruesome but writing is incredible very brave and smart author","706":"i had to read this book for a class i was taking i did not like it the author follows many negative stereotypes the narrator of her story is 14 year old esch she has sex with all the boys because it is easier than saying no and she is pregnant ward graphically describes dog fighting and while it may be culturally accepted to be part of her story i find it disgraceful her book is set up as days instead of chapters it is the 10 days before the day of and the day after hurricane katrina","707":"this book was a great read i was transfixed by this world that is so much different from my own the author's descriptions were wonderful as was her development of the characters","708":"this book wasn't at all what i had expected although the writing was wonderfully descriptive the storyline wasn't especially interesting and the characters weren't well developed an author to keep an eye on","709":"this was one the most well written books i've read in a while","710":" the book is a hurricane not just the actual hurricane katrina but also teen sex and pregnancy dog fighting poverty alcohol and drug use and strained but still strong family relationships it's a very harsh book in that it lays out a very harsh life this is not a didactic moral of the story sort of book this is not a book for children this is maybe maybe a book for very mature teens who have adults they can have frank conversations with about the topics presented in the novel i think a lot of my friends might feel offended by the content and so i'm not likely to recommend it to anyone but it is very well written and rather devastating to read","711":"i almost felt like i was breathing the swampy air of the louisiana bayou as i was reading this animal lovers will have a hard time with some of the scenes and themes involving dogs worth it though for the exploration of love and family through the internal journey of the main character and the events framing the story","712":" i read this entire book sitting on the beach in punta cana dominican republic over the period of 2 3 days i didn't like it at first maybe it was because the story was told so poetically u0026amp elegantly from the viewpoint of a 14 year old uneducated girl from mississippi but as the story went on she became wiser and wiser and her view point mostly distant from where she was at during the story she told became clearer and clearer the character development was incredible i felt like i knew them all personally before the story ended","713":"a world i have never read about before i was glad to know this family not an easy breezy read lots of meat on these bones","714":"i devoured this book in a single day so maybe i need more time to think about it i liked the story it stayed with me whenever i put it down which wasn't often the story is moving and builds as we get closer and closer to katrina and the disaster we know is coming i never really connected with ward's writing style though not sure if a second read might remedy that but all in all worth a read","715":"too sad too much imagery too deep for my taste","716":"interesting read and pretty well written i chose it because it received some awards but trying to describe it to others while reading it on vacation was difficult because it's a completely different view of life than i'm familiar with breeding fight dogs deep southern poverty etc and yet i did become interested in the characters and cared about them","717":" imagine being a poor motherless girl in rural mississippi now imagine being a poor motherless 14 year old pregnant girl in rural mississippi and hurricane katrina is days from landfall this is esch the protagonist of jesmyn ward's award winning novel salvage the bones this young mother to be lost her own mother five years ago after a complication during delivering her final child esch is the mother of the household to her three brothers randall aspires to be a basketball player skeetah's sole focus is his prize winning pit bull china and junior is a typical curious and rambunctious preschooler the patriarch known only as daddy is working frantically to prepare for the rapidly advancing katrina and to protect his family despite their extremely limited resources with that brief introduction esch walks us through an eventful eleven days prior to katrina's landfall the day that changed their lives forever and one day after offering a brief glimpse into what might become after such a horrific event the batiste family is preoccupied daddy with the storm randall with the basketball scouts skeetah with the dying litter his dog just birthed and esch with her growing belly and how she will tell manny how she will tell her family ward has created a complex and very real picture of poor rural mississippi life and the sacrifices families must make when disaster hits her words are rich although a bit overwritten at times she makes up for it with fully developed and engaging characters that sometimes make you shake your head but that mostly you empathize for ward's ability to make katrina a character in this novel was exceptional the storm snuck in early on whistling through trees rustling through thorn filled blueberry bushes covering the sky in a gray haze and building a momentum that brought the story to a heart stopping and devastating climax i recently read a column by magazine editor greg zimmerman where he wrote \"nothing is more real than fiction nothing helps us make sense of the real world more than fiction nothing instills in us empathy for others like fiction \"i couldn't agree more and that's why i would encourage you to read salvage the bones it's gritty and brutal and at times hard to read but it's important ward's fictional batiste family could be any poor struggling family ravaged by a natural disaster that doesn't have the luxury of leaving before landfall they don't have the luxury of choice the only thing they can do is stay and hold onto each other hoping for the best","718":" i loved the way the author showed the loving networks that exist in a harsh environment esch where did that name come from skeetah and china junior and randall were so strongly rendered that i both read the book and listened to it the reader was superb to remember the many small moments of recognition for instance esch compares the way she and randall carry daddy back to bed and flip him on it the way they flipped wet sheets on the line when they were too short to hang them properly so many instances of having to grow up and take responsibility before most others do big henry's benediction was wonderful","719":"this is a painfully beautiful book there is tragedy all around yet life grows struggling to hang on despite all through certain stretches i put the book down because it was so difficult yet kept coming back for the writing the characters the voice i wanted to read through fingers held up in front of my face hurricane katrina is days away but times are already very lean and complicated for the batiste family esch is our narrator the only girl 15 and pregnant she has three brothers randall skeetah and little junior their father is a drunk so they mostly parent themselves skeetah is inseparable from china his prized pit bull who has just given birth to her first litter of puppies the days leading up to katrina involve sacrifices and battles but when the devestating hurricane hits the family holds on to what is most important powerful rough and fragile","720":"jesmyn ward's salvage the bones is one of the best novels i've read in the last couple of years it's a classic coming of age story growing up in poverty near gulf coast mississippi leading up to the devastation that hurricane katrina will eventually unleash in 2005 it's a slow burner of a novel filled with bitter poetry and haunting language that will move shake and make you leap for joy and cry like a baby the plot centers around fifteen year old esch who has just found out she's pregnant with her friend manny's baby and of her brothers jason \"skeetah\" randall and junior and their father suffering from a wounded hand from a work related accident growing up motherless down in the delta isn't easy and the brutalities of poverty are unflinching and often gruesomely violent as depicted between skeetah and his prized pit bull china and the dogfights she often participates in reminiscent of toni morrison's early prose \"salvage the bones\" is a bitter taut and gorgeously beautiful novel that juxtaposes its themes of violence and savagery to euripedes' \"medea\" but unlike medea it's esch's love for family and her brothers is what salvages her ability to move on with dignity and strength after the storm","721":"listening to this book on cd really brought the characters out the authors descriptions brought the scenes to life","722":"this is my least favorite kind of novel sentimental faux lyrical humorless and bursting with bad metaphors it's also incredibly boring maybe it picks up when katrina arrives but i'm sixty pages in and can't make myself go on","723":"would give it 4 stars but it's written in the infernal present tense great story characterization structure i will be looking for ward's next book a memoir","724":" i've been reading a lot of great books lately and even among those this stands out the themes of family loyalty love survival struggle and hope are so strong the setting is very vividly wrought too i could feel the louisiana heat beating down on every page esch is a fascinating narrator with a strong but vulnerable voice and the ties of her family and friends are intense all of them break out of the stereotypes presented in popular culture with their own personalities strengths flaws and hopes the gritty setting and stark events are illustrated in the author's gorgeous prose and i was sad to see it end the only issue i had with it was that the author is a little too prolific with her gorgeous language and vivid metaphors occasionally the prose blocks the flow of the narrative and i got a bit lost in the descriptors but the writing is so beautiful and powerful that it was a minor flaw","725":"this is the book i am giving out on national book night or whatever it's called on april 23 i picked it because it won the national book award and because it is set in louisiana just outside nola in august 2005 as katrina is building strength in the gulf this book is incredible as an animal lover i found it very hard to develop sympathetic feelings towards the dog fighting i simply don't approve and don't think any representation that makes it seem ok is actually ok eventually though i realized that dog fighting is presented here in a way it really exists and the family esch our narrator is poignant and heartbreaking and real her love of her brothers her father her lost mother the lives they lead in the days leading up to katrina the memories the kids share of stories of camille the only other category 5 hurricane they know about that their mother lived through the break in reality that katrina represents nothing is the same on the other side of this storm nothing not the family not the dogs not their home or their hometown of bois savage mississippi not the bayou nothing the bayou formed by the meeting of the river and the bay is as calm as it would be on any summer day and it is hard to tell the hurricane has been here except for where the wind dragged the water across the road and left it there the bayou is where we thought the water would come from the reason we thought we were safe but katrina surprised everyone with her uncompromising strength her forcefulness the way she lingered she made things happen that had never happened before here in st catherine the trees have been all mown down and there is too much sky here there is too much sky something turns in my chest spreads and drops it leaves nothing the writing is beautiful the lives portrayed hard before katrina nearly impossible after are heartbreaking and real","726":"winner of the national book award and deservedly so beautifully written compelling story about a family facing hurricane katrina","727":" this is one of the books nominated for the pulitzer but not chosen no book was chosen for the fiction prize this year i'm trying to read them all i loved this book it is narrated from the point of view of a young african american woman who lives on the gulf in louisiana hurricane katrina is coming which builds suspense as you the reader know what's coming but the characters who are so poor they are shooting and eating squirrels have no idea what is in store for them salvage the bones reminded me of as i lay dying in its simple but very rich story and the unique time and place of its setting the language is gorgeous the characters are beautifully written and fully drawn i was riveted by the story it wins my vote for the pulitzer","728":"sad and so beautiful was tough to get through some parts but was worth it for the masterful written story","729":"she's a talented writer and i wanted to read about her perspective of katrina but the ugliness of the dogfight scenes made this hard to read i also felt a little hit over the head with the comparison between the humans and the dogs it felt disrespectful somehow","730":"powerful and evocative and very moving depicting a life rarely seen in fiction","731":"i really could not get into this book","732":" salvage the bones is raw and real impossible to ignore set against the backdrop of hurricane katrina this story of the batiste family in bois sauvage mississippi reminds us that there are already dramas unfolding when a natural disaster comes along to steal the attention i tore through this book quickly like a storm the story pulled me in and kept me reading the conversations among the characters are not polished for clarity and this helps the scenes to be real but 15 year old esch's narrating voice is polished and full of poetry there were a handful of instances in the book in which i found the narration slipping into the jagged colloquialisms and improper grammar of the dialogue and these were slightly jarring but not enough to detract from the story's power salvage the bones is well worth the read i highly recommend it","733":"oh man this was so good i stayed up way too late last night to finish it when i got it i thought it was about hurricane katrina but the hurricane spends most of the book in the gulf knowing what was coming and getting to know that family while we waited for landfall it was so tense and fascinating and heartbreaking it feels like a classic like people need to be reading it in school","734":" this book was a real mixed bag for me it's a book about the hardscrabble existence of an extremely poor motherless family in rural mississippi told from the point of view of the 15 year old pregnant daughter the book takes place in the days leading up to and immediately following hurricane katrina and surprisingly to me much of the plot centers on one of the boy's prize pit bull so the mixed bag i did not care for the extreme focus on the dog and i hated the parts about dog fighting really couldn't read them but i was mesmerized by the final chapters when katrina hit i'd give 2 stars for much of the book 5 stars for the end","735":"lyrical deeply sad deeply disturbing and beautiful at the same time defies categorization both can't stop reading it and am afraid to keep reading it","736":" story takes place over 13 days in louisiana with the last 2 days being amidst hurricane katrina but mainly a story about a poor family struggling to survive with only themselves and their distant father to take care of them esch is the only girl in the house and it is her voice that tells the story a story about sticking together loving and protecting each other and knowing that even if you have nothing else family is a lot it is also in large part about their dog or should i say skeetah's dog china a pure white pit bull that is a major part of the family and the story i loved this family and i loved the writing i don't like sad animal books but i can see why it won the national book award","737":"this book is going to haunt me for awhile","738":"a sincerely crafted story woven around one of our time's great tragedies that is occasionally moving in its details but as a whole is good novel no more no less","739":"good lord this made me cry a very poetic understanding of the south katrina dog fighting devotion and what it means to be a woman","740":"i have terribly conflicted feelings about this book there is no question that it is beautifully written ward's use of simile and metaphor are masterfully imaginative i was moved by the familial loyalty among the batiste children how these motherless waifs were nurturing each other as best they could ward's descriptions of hurricane katrina were also powerful the storm occurs in the next to last chapter of the book and is so well described that the reader truly feels as if they are there before those final two chapters it is as if the coming storm is a character in the story we sense her lurking around her malevolent power building in a way that sets the reader's teeth on edge once the storm hits you sense that these people whose lives are already lived on the margins are going to have a difficult time pulling it all back together there is hope though because of the bonds of loyalty that tie this family together the two things that i didn't like so much about the book are 1 it was a little slow starting but that is true of a lot of books the more significant issue for me was 2 it is at least as much if not more about dog fighting as it is about hurrican katrina one of the main characters owns a white pit bull that he enters in fights so that he can earn money for her victories ward does an incredible job of depicting the hardscrabble poverty that would drive someone to get involved in dog fighting so i understand it from that standpoint however reading about the wounds and brutality in such detail is something i just do not have the stomach for and that piece of the story is the cause of my ambivalence i will say though that this is a story that stays with you i could not sleep for several hours the night after finished it thinking about the characters and wondering what happened to them","741":"alex award winner 2012 a haunting novel ward provides devastating insight into the culture of poverty in bois and esch's family but somehow manages to balance provide balance and even hope through mythical parallels and characters with surprising strength includes a dog fighting scene that may be more explicit than some of my animal loving friends can handle","742":"i read this book greedily couldn't put it down although it is graphic and intense at times very moving story","743":"beautifully simple story of life in the rural deep south although katrina plays a major plot role this isn't a book about dealing with a hurricane it's a story of community family and the little everyday things that bind us to each other slurping ramen noodles a child's tug on your shorts sharing the shade of a tree ward is able to make the tiniest moments into heart wrenching powerful hard to forget scenes if you are at all easily affected by stories about human animal relationships this will grab you by the guts and not let go","744":"definitely not the feel good book of the year do yourself a favor and read roll of thunder hear my cry by mildred taylor a book that proves it is possible to write a moving story about the african american experience in mississippi without graphic sex foul language hopelessness and doesn't leave you with the feeling of complete and utter dread for life","745":" i loved this novel the book describes a culture i am somewhat familiar with growing up in southeastern louisiana at first i didn't like the characters much especially skeetah because of his involvement in dog fighting but his relationship with china his pit bull has a fierce complex beauty to it despite the awfulness of the fights and young pregnant esch surrounded by her father brothers and male friends equal parts desperate for female guidance and desperate for love and desperate for her baby's father to notice her their father trying to hold the family together despite their poverty and widowhood overwhelming him as he prepares for katrina scenes of the coming storm are vivid and frightening the climax is raw but the ending seems a bit pat to me it was the ending that kept me from giving this 5 stars read it anyway this is a writer to watch","746":"lord what a tedious read","747":"i didn't connect this book until the eighth day and then it hit with full weight the storm was named the literary characters became people my heart ached for what i knew was coming well done ms ward this story has moved me","748":"it was hard to rate this book because the ending was wonderful but i had a terrible time getting into it i had to start over three times the first 2 3 of the book are so bleak that it was hard to keep going in the end i have to say that it was worth the effort","749":"excuse me i've really messed this up the previous review was actually for a completely different book salvage the bones was written quite beautifully but i simply could not finish its' unrelenting gloominess and characters grubbing about in the mud please stay posted for a proper review of the devil's footsteps by john burnside which was the book i had previously reviewed under this title and author","750":"this is a book i didn't want to read but i couldn't stop reading it the story is gutting literally pulling out my innards painful and yet i couldn't stop thinking about the characters and their story it hurt to read it hurt to not read this is the first novel i've read that features hurricane katrina specifically and the horrific aftermath and there's a lot in this book that is stomach turning violence neglect and sex are depicted with unromantic and blunt honesty the story of a fractured family struggling to survive in their own way fourteen year old esch is pregnant and hiding it from her brothers and alcoholic father her brother skeetah is raising china a pit bull for dog fighting who has had her first litter her youngest brother skates by desperate for attention while her other brother randall is convinced basketball will be the key to escaping this poverty although the narrator is fourteen this isn't a ya novel the voice is both young but knowing a child who has had to grow up too fast esch's burgeoning pregnancy and china's whelping are meant to bounce off each other giving birth nurturing life but this is not a book where the girl and dog find safety and hope in each other instead china's litter her response to her pups her owner's response reminds esch of the love she doesn't have the lack of mothering in her own life and very real unknown facing her what was so good about this book was that esch was a real complicated character she's well read and can't stop thinking in terms of mythology when china eats one of her puppies esch thinks immediately of medea a trait i found achingly familiar from my own teenaged years and it was painful to see how different her life was from mine were the novel simply about her life that would be a moving enough story but the additional impact of hurricane katrina provides this low grade tension since we know what's coming honestly i nearly ground my teeth to nubs in my anxiety to finish i don't like doing hard things for the sake of building character but i do believe in reading tough books now and then because of the enormous impact it has on my perception of the world this book challenged me frankly at times it scared me but it was so moving so well written that the odd twist of hope and melancholy at the end of the story left a knot in my chest i can't swallow it away","751":"hard to review this one because it was so hard for me to read very gritty and raw","752":"i'm not really enjoying this book i had no idea dog fighting would play such a role \"we took the back way to the hospital through miles of woods lonely houses like possums in the dark half caught and then left behind by the headlights\" 131 \"cans and bottles mostly beer lay about him like smaller versions of himself wherever he was\" 133","753":" kind of gritty for my comfort level a lot of ugliness hard to believe that such a foreign world a relentlessly poor small town in mississippi full of uneducated abusive substance addicted people is part of the same country i live in there is teen pregnancy dog fighting and child neglect and all that stuff is just the quiet background of the actual story a family winding its way through a complicated week that culminates with hurricane katrina it's just a hard book there isn't much joy or redemption of any kind despite the author's vague attempt at an enlightened ending somehow i kept reading especially in the last quarter of the book there was a compelling need to find out what happened but in the end i'm not sure why i kept reading it and not sure that i'm any better off for having done so","754":"this review has been hidden because it contains spoilers to view it click here tough book to review there are a lot of negatives 1 i've never seen poor black folk described in such a poor light they are promiscuous they steal they fight dogs they fight each other they drink they neglect their children they take drugs they betray each other they regularly do stupid things and their language skills are pretty much limited to f this f that f you no f ing way etc there is only one honorable character in the entire book big henry the central

protagonist is the worst she's 14 and pregnant in love with her abuser if you're thinking this is a book of redemption look elsewhere in a really weird twist this almost illiterate girl constantly refers to greek mythology for parallels in her life 3 the writing is terrible absolutely the worse metaphors i've seen in a published book they are so bad i took the time to write some down his voice sounded like there was a brillo pad lodged in his throat her collarbone was as dense and burnished as a brass door knob her lips were the color of azaleas his feet stuck out of the covers like bristles on a toothbrush china a dog was as pale as bisquit dough his chewing sounded like crumpled notebook paper you could find this many wince inducing metaphors on a single page at one point i started analyzing them to see where the author went wrong some like the azaleas or the notebook paper or the dough just don't describe anything but the brass door knob and hundreds like it are more interesting i think what has happened is the author has focused on one part of the object such as the color which works ok but the entire object doesn't work in other words nobody looks at a beautiful woman's collarbone and thinks door knob even if the collarbone is the same color as the door knob at one point i thought the metaphors were intentionally bad to reflect the 1st person speaker's lack of education but i doubt it 4 it's really two books the first book is about dog fighting and the people who breed and train dogs for this sport there are many long harrowing descriptions of dogs fighting the second book is how a family rides out katrina in their home the two books don't really ever come together on the plus side the book has a feel of authenticity no matter how ugly that truth is it takes you to another world although it's probably not one you'd want to go to in real life i've never seen young black men in a clearing in the woods watching their dogs fight and egging them on but either the author has or she has done some incredible research because the scenes are so real so is the squalor and degradation of poverty i guess there are bittersweet moments the brother's love for his pit bull is heart wrenching in a kind of perverse way since we know the purpose of the dog and the description of care given to the dog and how the dog cares for its puppies also has that feel of authenticity the description of the storm katrina is exciting if a bit unbelievable the way the friends unintentionally but stupidly destroy the ambitions of one of the brothers is heartbreaking actually the whole book is heartbreaking people who start out having almost nothing either materially or spiritually lose what little they have more","755":"loved it so well written i could feel every moment that was happening my heartstrings were pulled to the max for all the hardships these characters were faced with yet somehow manage to traverse","756":"did not enjoy this book and am glad it's done","757":"2 5 starsi liked the story i was not of fan of the writing style it was weird to me and seemed way too drawn out it should not take a paragraph to say they were sitting on the roof i didn't like the bad language and the sexual comments i did like the look into life in the south it really made me sad to think that any girl would ever feel the way esch did i did the love the relationship that esch had with her brothers i loved the families closeness","758":"great vivid book and memorable characters","759":"it's a testimony to the quality of the writing in this book that i stayed with it even though dog fighting dog fighting is pretty central to the plot and the narrator is a teenager who has had sex with every boy who has asked her to but it's a pretty wonderful book with fully realized characters it perfectly captures the physicality of this family's life in the mississippi bayou you feel the sweat dripping down your neck the soft hands of a friend see the red dirt and tangled trees and when i was reading about the storm katrina i felt like i could hear the wind and feel the house shaking i looked up briefly while reading that part and was actually surprised to see a mild oregon rain shower outside","760":" esch is the third child and only daughter of a poor black family in louisiana her father is an alcoholic and her mother is dead good heroines never have mothers and as a fairly direct result esch has been having sex with all of her brother's friends in order to feel loved the fact that i am reading this book at all is a direct result of you dear interwebs i read your bookish corners with morning tea and my library's request page open dropping books into my cart without reference to whether i can possibly read them in time to return them without library fines or not then somewhere between days and months later i'm looking at you bossypants by tina fey i get an email telling me that such and such a book is ready for me to pick up behold the modern library patron who has never set foot into her local library farther than the hold shelf approximately 6 feet she read 28 000 pages last year so don't knock it till you've tried it kittens anyway esch she's messed up and sad and her family is busted and there's a hurricane of the distinctly katrina shape headed for her house ward treats her with respect which is hard to do given esch's err... situation which is both gravid and grave she is a child who has grown up without a mother essentially without a father - what with him being an alcoholic and all - and who is the only woman in a family of boys her brother skeetah's pit fighting dog china has puppies at the beginning and reminds esch that her own relationship with the father of her child isn't as good as the one between her brother and his dog which is as close to tragic as i can think about without welling up he's never even kissed her but wait there's more heartache in store esch reads - like all good heroines - and what she's into right now is greek mythology specifically the jason and medea myths in fact one could say that this entire text is a re telling of the story of jason and medea in which a woman is loved makes sacrifices for that love and then realizes that her love is nothing more than a face with no soul esch is spared medea's burden of murder but only because she has not committed fratricide ward's writing style is a study in opposites her words are hard to read and hard to keep from reading simultaneously lyrical and blunt brutal and beautiful i'm not sure this book was for me but i read to the very end in order to find out six and a half yellows","761":"as the heat and tension rise during the days prior to hurricane katrina so do the hardships faced by esch and her family impovershed and motherless in rural bois sauvage","762":" salvage the bones takes place over twelve days told in twelve chapters surrounding hurricane katrina the main character esch is the

through tragedy and endured their ability to love and endure through tragedy and triumph is so heartfelt and touching to read the entire book review please visit my book blog at http www booksnob booksnob blogspot","763":"this story follows a family located in new orleans right before hurricane katrina hits in 2005 for some reason i wasn't able to become emotionally invested in the characters the book got better for me as it went along but i think by then i had missed getting to know the characters well enough it was eye opening and interesting once it got going a bit","764":"this book is astonishing i urge everyone to read it","765":" dark violent and incredibly well written there were scenes that had me holding the book at arm's length trying to escape their brutality but at the same time keeping me captive making it so that i was unable to simply close the book the clash between the violence of living in poverty and the caring compassionate nature of the relationships between the siblings creates a storm that is far stronger than the impending doom that the reader knows hurrican katrina promises to deliver especially touching and heartbreaking is skeetah's strange relationship with his dog china that he forces in to a life even more violent than his own and yet he physically cares for her as if she were human","766":"so many thins to love a about this noel such finely drawn characters developing on the page the intimacy among the family a s the struggle to endure poverty and loss and prepare for an approaching hurricane the phisical world these characters embody holds them safely teaches them of danger and prepares them for survival and the approaching hurricane gives the narrative a driving force because we all know where this is headed we just don't know how the will hang onbut they do they surely do","767":"to me this was a sad but very well written book filled with meaningful metaphors and similes","768":"this was a tough one the narrator a teenage girl preparing for hurricane katrina and dealing with the loss of her mother is heartbreaking on the one hand i found the dog fighting scenes and long passages about preparing the dog to fight to be difficult and disturbing on the other hand the story is so simply and deftly told that i was incredibly moved at the end","769":"i loved this book and have thought about it a lot since reading it several months ago beautiful and moving","770":"this is a great tale set in rural louisiana during hurricane katrina it should be required reading for high school seniors the writing is rich and evocative the characters are well developed and i miss them already","771":"this book made me miss the people whom i love the characters and story are super vivid but the writing got too poetic in parts i have no heart so it's more like a 3 5 for me would say that this would be boring book club material but solid alone time reading","772":"this is the art of telling a story at its best","773":"this book broke my heart six ways to sunday but it was such a compelling read that i couldn't put it down simply superb warning to soft hearted animal lovers some scenes in this novel may be difficult to read","774":" such a beautifully written book i kept marveling at the language as i went along which didn't detract one bit from thoroughly enjoying some very particular and intriguing characters including a dog their relationships their circumstances their manners and values throughout the book we all know hurricane katrina is coming which the dad tries to prepare for as the kids go about their kid business it reminds me of faulkner or no flannery o'connor or no harper lee the very best of southern writing at any rate a good read","775":" words to describe salvage the bones exciting frightening raw meloncholoy poignant telling i really enjoyed this book to say it was 'good' isn't enough set during the days leading up to hurricane katrina we enter the lives of a poor black american family told in the voice of 15 year old esch the reader quickly learns of her love for manny her pregnancy and her love and devotion to her brothers just knowing that the hurricane is coming a fact that is down played in the novel makes for an exciting read as well","776":"deep and thought provoking","777":"i just finished this book and it was wonderful very powerful and beautifully written there is this constant dread though what is going to happen you know hurricane katrina is out there looming waiting and the book is overwhelming with that anticipation of what will happen to this family because of it but also their own actions and decisions they are so close to one another but so strained and loving and damaged all at once it brought me to tears and almost made me pass out on the train but that may have been the cold i was getting and that i was hungry i would not recommend this book if you are squemish with blood there is dog fighting in it no it is not romanticized just fact i also was a little put off by the consistent references to jason medea references i think that is important to the author and narrator but i doubt all readers will want it so explicitly pointed out still 5 stars though","778":" since my niece was a college student in new orleans during katrina and i visited there 9 months later i felt like i had good second hand knowledge of the storm however i obviously knew nothing about the effect on rural coastal mississippi jesmyn ward has painted a portrait that will stay with me a long time her description of the hurricane is reminiscent of zora neale hurston's depiction in their eyes were watching god jesmyn ward is a talent to watch she won the national book award for this book i plan to continue to read her work","779":" a difficult book for me to read story of a very poor black family in louisiana in the days leading up to katrina the family consists of a drunken father 3 boys and a teenage girl the mother died during childbirth the girl discovers she is pregnant to a boy she loves but who barely acknowledges her one brother is trying to get a college scholarship thru his basketball play and another brother raises pit bulls to fight they are all barely making it and then they must face the fact that katrina will hit and they must prepare the storm demolishes their house and they barely make it to higher ground china the prized pit bull gets away we don't know if she is ever found there is a long excerpt of a bloody dogfight which is difficult to think about let alone read their poverty is overwhelming but this family does look out for each other and keeps pulling it together","780":" this novel takes place in the fictional town of bois sauvage ms it covers the 10 days before hurricane katrina and two days afterwards this is the story of 15 year old pregnant esch her mother is dead her dad a drunk she has three brothers and basically they have raised themselves i wanted to like this book more but found it very difficult to read i was conflicted through most of the book i had to keep reminding myself it was written from the perspective of children there is some tough subjects addressed in this novel at times i felt as if i was an intruder into the lives of the characters watching and hearing things i should not occasionally ward's use of language detracted from the story that said jesmyn ward's command of the english language is amazing and her ability to bring you into the story is superb she does an excellent job at describing katrina and her aftermath this novel is defeintely not for the faint of heart","781":"the language is rich and descriptive i can't say i liked these people and i was very uncomfortable with the choices thay made but the author makes the characters human and vulnerable the hurricane scene is compelling i couldn't put the book down at that point","782":"couldn't get in to the writing style","783":"so far halfway through this book is incredibly hard to read not because it's not written well it's very well written but because it's heartbreaking page after page maybe i should say hard to read and incredible okay done this is quite a book it grinds at your soul yet is gorgeous","784":"2011 national book award winner deservedly so beautiful and heart wrenching book","785":"i'm using the stars literally it was ok i agree with the previous review that the section that describes leaving the attic is so muddled i could not begin to picture the physics of it the biggest downfall of the book for me was that since i knew the beginning and i knew the ending every character was a train wreck waiting to happen i kept wondering what was the point of reading the middle it felt tedious to marinate in the details of each bad decision","786":"one of the best books i have ever read","787":"haunting story that is a combination of the movie key largo and the grapes of wrath","788":"great book really easy read and hard to put down especially if you like character building","789":"one of those books that really surprised me by the end the writing is so atmospheric and the characters so rich reminded me of faulkner's as i lay dying in topic and tone","790":"it took me awhile to get into this story but once i did i was drawn in this is a sad very well written story about siblings with a widowed alcoholic father in the rural south in the days leading up to hurricane katrina and the days after this is a raw and very graphic portrait of the lives of families that didn't evacuate and why and the sad devastation left behind by the storm","791":"ugly for ugly's sake wallowing in it for effect phony","792":"i quite liked this nba winner ward is writing within a well established genre and knows it but she uses it well and honors her predecessors what makes it such a moving universal story to me is that essentially it's about vulnerability of poverty of gender of hope and striving of love itself beautifully told","793":"i loved the poetry with which this book was written yeah esch's world can be very bleak empty and scary but the way she speaks and views the world makes it all seem beautiful we as readers can really see how she is able to go on living in her world due to the beauty she finds in it","794":"not really my favorite style of writing or subject matter but it was well written i found it hard to relate to the characters or their stories i think i would've enjoyed this more in a short story format","795":"one of the most heartbreaking books i've ever read in more ways than one","796":"powerful u0026amp moving","797":"i lobed this book the unique relationship between dog and boy boy and sister life in a way we never expect it i really lobed this book i wish there were a few more chapters to help us deal with the aftermath of katrina","798":"3 25 or 3 5 actually well written exceedingly vivid almost but not completely credible the i narrator is the only girl in this black family 15 or 16 i'm not sure i buy the concept that she speaks black english while comparing herself to medea she knows her greek mythology and recounts it for the benefit of all who remember the outline but have forgotten the details salvage the bones is all about details that's why it bothers me that i couldn't quite get a handle on everyone's ages and the ages matter was i reading too fast was it really not clear did i just want to get past the rawness how can people live like that and yet i know they do it's a hard book to love or even like and yet the sense of family is very strong and that is the thrust of the story","799":"3 5 salvage the bones was beautifully written lovely evocative language and beautifully narrated but i had a hard time getting into the book i get why this novel was so highly lauded when it came out it's a gorgeous heartbreaking story but for some reason i could not get a grip on the characters or the story i think maybe because their experiences were not easy for me to relate to i appreciate ward's novel on an intellectual level i just wish i could have appreciated it more on an emotional level","800":"i read this book slowly savoring the language and drawing out the plot excruciatingly since the tension and momentum caused me to want to speed through these pages this has been called the book about hurricane katrina but i loved that the hurricane occupies only a small percentage of pages at the end yet readers know what is coming and esch's family already has plenty to deal with without any storm if this had been a film i would have closed my eyes at certain parts because it was so hard to witness what was happening some of that had to do with animals in jeopardy but as much was what the young people were experiencing by virtue of who they were and the place and time in which they lived i couldn't forget this book if i wanted to the characters are indelible the language bravura the plot unrelenting salvage the bones is not an easy read if the reader has at least half a heart but its journey will enlarge most readers' compassion and viewpoint by chance i began this book right as we waited for hurricane sandy a small cousin of katrina's in most measurements but to anyone who is currently mourning the death of a loved one in nj or a flooded home in ct or waiting electricity in ny any such hurricane is life changing and hurtful","801":"disappointing considering all the hype much preferred zeitoun","802":"book club book #5 unfortunately this makes 3 5 that i did not really like it was written really well told from the perspective of a teenage african american girl in the south she comes from a poor family and it takes place a few weeks leading up to katrina it was really difficult to read very graphic and sad pitbull fights and hurricanes pregnant teenagers with no mother tough","803":" this book ended up surprising me i thought i had caught myself in another huck finn situation where one particular part of the book bothered me greatly and because that was what the book centered on i would end up not liking it but ward handled the bothersome part of this book a little differently and was able to come to an ending that was satisfactory and did not feel like she wrote herself into a corner the book was thought out well and while all of the events culminate into the appearance of hurricane katrina it trite or at all cliche it is a wonderful insight into urban poverty along the gulf and how their lives are subject to the whim of natural disasters","804":"one of the best novels i've ever read","805":"what makes a person like a book how much does understanding the setting play into liking a book how much does understanding the time and place in which the book is set matter how much does identifying with the situations the protagonist faces matter how much does getting to interact with the author play into how much you enjoy a book i came across salvage the bones by jesmyn ward a few months ago i don't remember if it was before i saw it on the list of national book award nominees or if it was the nominee list in which i first saw it i was immediately drawn to it for multiple reasons dog on the cover author from mississippi centered around hurricane katrina as i have so many books to read i added it to the to read list and kept going next thing i noticed is that the book won the national book award wow a mississippi author has not won that award since the 80s only a handful of mississippians have won the award falkner welty and alice walker color purple are the three i recognized the book edged up my to read list then disappointingly a friend of mine read it and did not care for it oh well i thought and the book slipped down the to read list not long after that though i realized it would most likely make the tournament of books and i read 4 really good reviews from several top reviewers then finally i received an email from lemuria my local independent book store that the author jasmyn ward would be in town on dec 17th to sign her book and give a reading i went by lemuria and bought the book with the intention of reading the first several chapters and getting it signed why not it is a national book award winning book by a mississippi author so i was forewarned by my friend who did not care for the book that it was not 100% about katrina and more about a dog i believe that knowing this tidbit of info aided in my enjoyment of this book believing that it was all about katrina going into it would have been a let down for me that said i started reading and could not put the book down i loved this book it is about an impoverished teenaged girl esch who is from the rural south and her family over 12 days ending with the day after katrina hit she is the only girl in a family of four her mother passed away some 7 years earlier and her father is dealing with his own demons and lets the kids take care of each other i understood this book i live in mississippi i have lived in small rural towns considered metropolitan by the communities of 50 100 people in the surrounding area i know freeny walnut grove mendenhall hot coffee new hebron blink and you just missed it i know how it feels to be young and find yourself in situations when you weren't really sure if you were old enough or mature enough to handle them i remember poo pooing the path of the hurricane there were so many false alarms it couldn't be that bad the forecasters love to incite chaos i think many of them love to predict gloom and doom just to see how fast the bread will fly off the shelves of the local grocery store i remember how hot it was that week preceding katrina and how still it was after she left her path of destruction we were without power for 3 days and it was really hot i remember volunteering at hands a charity pulled together to help those who lost everything in the storm many did not have anything before the storm and they definitely did not have anything after the storm and i understand the love and devotion to a dog no i did not care for the dog fighting in the book but i understood the relationship that esch's brother skeetah had with the dog china so is the reason i loved this book because i could identify with it so much or was it my interaction with the author saturday i cleared my afternoon to go to lemuria for the book signing i got there 45 minutes early walked around bought the hard back addition of thousand autumns of jacob dezoet by david mitchell my all time favorite book ever sat and read some more of salvage the bones and was given the number 7 i would be the 7th person to get my book signed not long after they had us start lining up a young very pretty women walked up to the booth to start the book signing obviously it was the author jesmyn ward she was very pleasant and gracious with a heartwarming smile i had my book signed congratulated her on her award and told her that i was enjoying the book and thought it was very lyrical and that i liked her descriptions what else do you say to someone signing a book i went downstairs purchased a coffee and a cookie and walked to the reading room i don't know how long it took ms ward to sign the books but before long she came in taking the podium and after a moment she laughed nervously and gave us a brief background of the book she would be reading from day 11 i was on day 6 there are 12 chapters each a day day 11 was the day the storm hit i had read enough of the book to be completely familiar with the characters and to know what was happening in the story ms wards voice was hypnotizing she read in such a way to transport me right there into the house with esch and her family i could hear the wind remember the trees bending feel the heat in the house once the a c went out the story and the story teller held me spell bound after the reading ms ward accepted questions from all topics ranging from the characters in the book to personal questions about her past and future to race issues and her book to winning the national book award she was gracious she took each question and thought about it seeming to give a very unrehearsed answer it was after 5 15 when she stopped and she stopped only because we had run out of questions to ask her i would not call salvage the bones perfect it covers some uncomfortable subject matters i love similies and metaphors apparently so does jasmyn ward maybe at times she uses the similies too flagrantly but then she will nail several descriptions beautifully plus after asked about the use of the like comparisons ms ward indicated that esch was still discovering herself and her world and her place in this world esch's descriptions were allowing her to find her own voice with what she knew and make it familiar to those around her one technique i really did find that i liked is that there were several times when two things would be going on at once instead of having a chapter for each ms ward would alternate paragraphs instead at first this was a little confusing but after realizing what she was doing it helped tell the story with the urgency as it was happening instead of going back and forth in time this book is probably not for everyone it is darker than my normal sweet southern literature it does contain underage sexual situations and dog fighting one of my other favorite books had cock fighting in it some may not care for esch's teenaged pining over a boy but i loved it and hope that ms ward will continue to right fiction in the future","806":"i almost quit reading twice i didn't think i could handle any more about dog fighting but i skimmed and skipped what i needed to in order to finish it out and i'm so glad i did the end of the book was so worth every word that was hard to read the story drew out emotions in me that i can't remember feeling in ages i am so glad i pushed through and finished","807":"a little oprah like in its southern sadness but wonderful character development and some hope at the end","808":"i couldn't really get into this","809":"so this was my first katrina book and for that reason i am slightly more into the book than i otherwise would be though some of the characters were endearing i just really didn't find anyone or any of the plot lines particularly compelling not even the pit bulls and the dog fighting sparked my interest either in a positive or a negative way which i personally think is odd given my love for the philadelphia eagles curious to see what the rest of the book club has to say about this one","810":"perfect this novel is as deep as katrina waters don't read if you find you're a sensitive person lots of graphic truth and the heart of the novel involves a gruesome dog fight but do read if you want to feel the core of a down and out family and see what beautiful shapes love and commitment can take even in the grungiest and darkest of settings do read if you want a compelling heartbreaking sociological view into what it's like to grow up black poor without a mother on the orleans coast do read if you want to witness the work of a master wordsmith who can turn dirt blood and semen into ribbons of fierce light and loyalty","811":"second time i read this book and loved it even more reminded me a bit of winter's bone","812":" salvage the bones tracks the life of an impoverished family in gulf coast mississippi in the days leading up to hurricane katrina the book is told from the point of view of esch the third child in a family of four and the only girl esch and her three brothers ranging in age from 17 to 7 are being raised by their alchoholic father after their mom's death giving birth to her youngest brother with little money or parental guidance they are left to raise themselves with only minimal input from their sometimes abusive father i enjoyed the book but felt the writing was too bogged down in metaphors and poetic observations in many cases the over descriptive passages made the book drag rather than enhancing the story also the book came to an abrupt end that really showed little growth or change in any of the characters i thought when i read the synopsis of the book this would be a 4 star title but i ending up liking it less than expected","813":"a vivid description of the mississippi coast as seen by a poor rural black teenager just before hurricane katrina devastated her home and her life","814":"the writing is stunning and gorgeous the story is brutal","815":"i couldn't finish this book when i got to the graphic i assume it was graphic i didn't read more than the first sentence or two description of the pit bull fight in the back woods of la at the time of katrina i couldn't read it that's too bad because i was enjoying it up until that part","816":"brutal subject matter simply too tough to really love it but kudos for fine powerful writing","817":"this is so good i can't even talk about it it makes my heart hurt","818":"beautifully written but damn what a depressing life these people have makes me grateful","819":"time can only feel as short as the events that occur in that span a hurricane is brewing near the coastal town of bois savage mi four siblings in their own experiences grow faster than a flash of lightning and face life that is beyond their age esch fourteen and pregnant is the thoughtful and mature narrator of this southern comfort delightful and poetically rich novel by jesmyn ward","820":" it is not often that i feel myself unable to finish a book but it has been painful for me to work through salvage the bones the book has promise and reading other reviews i do see what others found appealing it is certainly a powerful immersion into a poor southern family's daily life illustrating a cycle of poverty so difficult to transcend from poor education that leaves little room for progress or opportunity to the fragility of the impoverished family that crumbles with a mother's death to the resultant lack of confidence that leads to the repetition or worsening of behavior in the next generation in this sense it was very real and heart wrenching on the other hand i felt the story was sometimes painfully slow i can handle slow plots but reading a slow telling of something i don't care about like the never ending details of the dog's pups was too boring and unimportant to me my other issue was the writing style itself i felt ward never really succeeded in playing the role of a teenage girl her metaphors were so elaborate and sophisticated and often in needless junctions that i could not ever engage with it as a child's narration i think ward would have been more successful if she had not given the role of narration to her main character","821":"powerful story beautifully written","822":"one of the best i've read recently really amazing","823":"the best and really only word i can come up with for this novel is heartbreaking katrina and its aftermath take up a only a few pages but the heartbreak is well and truly underway long before that ward writes with a controlled prose that doesn't shirk from the realities it depicts and occasionally even wrings beauty from brutalities or just the commonplace beautiful thoughtful and aching","824":"we recently saw the movie beast of the southern wild which is set in the bayou between new orleans and the gulf of mexico they have very similar stories poor black families eeking out an existence just before katrina both with very flawed drinking fathers but who did love their kids both with mothers who had disappeared and were gone one had just left the father the other dying in child birth both from the perspective of a little girl being protected by the good in the community spoiler alert the following discusses plot and character the girl in the book esch is older and her issues harder not beautiful she is pregnant by a boy who she loves but who treats as a slut esch is not pretty and uses sex as a way of connecting or maybe gets used but the boy manny treats her purely as someone to screw he has a girlfriend does not want to look at esch when screwing or to touch her or be touched by her you want to reach in and scream get away from him the other central character is her brother skeet he has an incredibly loving relationship with the pit bull china he fights her she always wins but mostly he loves that dog the family and community of friends hang together and survive katrina if bearly but china floats away and the look ends with skeet waiting for china to return like the movie it is a good story and the relationship to the daughter to her community is at least somewhat reaffirming in the book more than the movie the members of the community felt more like real people rather than stick figures but in neither did i feel totally connected","825":" i really enjoyed salvage the bones in terms of the novel's vibe it was unlike any i've read before it was heavy severe and honest but simultaneously it was strong open and vulnerable i appreciated the depth and consistency of the characters as well as the micro intimate portrayal of experiencing hurricane katrina there is also something about ward's storytelling capabilities that makes the novel stand out after reading a couple of interviews with ward i've also come to appreciate and truly respect her writing process as well as her rationale she seems very thoughtful and aware of what she wanted for salvage the bones and this kind of care attention and devotion is something that really shines through the novel","826":" my hopes for this book as an alex award winner was surpassed when it was announced as the national book award for adult fiction this week my poor husband was shocked from sleep as i yelled yes to the npr announcement of the national book award winners at 6am on thursday morning fifteen year old esch lives in the delta with her brothers and father as hurricane katrina bears down on the delta her mother is dead her father drinks too much and esch has the responsiblity of caring for the household the voice of esch as written by ward is a work of literary excellance realistic suspenseful with a strong setting the novel portrays a way of life that escapes the concerns of many","827":"a powerful and beautiful novel about the strength of family and love looking forward to seeing more from this author","828":"thoroughly enjoyed this story and gained some major insight of the poverty level of our country hoping for a sequel to learn how everything turned out","829":"i finished this last night at about 1am i keep trying to write a review but i can't it doesn't ever sound right one reviewer on here said this book would wreck you i think that's pretty close to the truth this is one of those books i'll probably carry around in my core for a some time not for the faint of heart there's dog fighting teenage pregnancy poverty death and finally hurricane katrina it's a special one","830":"i rate this highly not necessarily because i enjoyed reading this book but because the prose was spectacular and the characters compelling the story itself was brutal","831":"powerful story of a family living through katrina","832":"this book was heartbreaking in so many ways the poverty the dog fighting and the devastation of hurricane katrina sometimes hard to read i wanted to put it down and yet i was unable to close the book this book won the national book award 2011 now i know why i highly recommend this book","833":"captivating writing and story i couldn't put it down","834":" the lines in this book are so poetic that i found it difficult to engage with initially the poetic dynamics took away from the movement of the plot which reveals the days before and during hurricane katrina's devastation to this family and community the poetic prose from the narrator esch are questionable to me at times the narration seems to be an act in free indirect discourse what are her thoughts verses the authors esch was not a sympathetic character to me in spite of her challenges and the novel doesn't focus on the impact of katrina as much as i expected it to nevertheless the novel portrays realistically the difficulties of poverty for the batiste family as they prepare for one of the worst natural disasters to strike the south i do recommend it especially for young adults because of the characters though i don't think many of them will read it i am having a hard time recognizing the national book award merit","835":"there were some powerful parts of this novel especially near the end and i think things about it will stick with me but i can't say that i enjoyed reading it","836":"one of the most amazing books i've ever read","837":"salvage the bones will grant the reader a look into rural life amongst african americans the prose is thoughtful and certainly literary at times the pacing was a little slow but still the story remained interesting there is much packed into this novel but it never feels crowded at the heart of the book is the tale of a poor family and the days leading up to hurricane katrina i would recommend it to all","838":"katrina's arrival brings the beautifully developed relationships of a struggling family which includes a pit bull to a head at that point i couldn't put it down magnificent conclusion before that i became a bit impatient with overuse of similes never thought i'd say that 2011 national book award","839":"i started this book thinking my beloved book store gave me a bum steer but after i finished it i thought it was pretty ok it is pretty grim the author does a good job of making poverty real","840":"i liked this while i was reading it i just never wanted to pick it up","841":"it's a beautiful book and you cannot help but love every character good bad human and canine","842":"the writing was good but the subject matter pitbulls breeding them and dogfights and teenage pregnancy didn't appeal to me i thought the book was about hurricane katrina which finally arrives at the end i know there are obvious parallels between the hurricane and the lives of the characters but i was glad when i got to the end i am giving it 2 stars because although the writing was quite good the subject matter didn't appeal to me","843":"this will definitely be on my top ten list for 2012 salvage the bones tells the story of a family in the days leading up to hurricane katrina it also deals with katrina and the aftermath but the majority of the book is pre katrina which is not to say you aren't aware of her her presence is felt and growing and since it is obviously based on a real event you as a reader know how bad things will be it is told through the eyes of fifteen year old esch and your heart is hers from the first chapter the loss of your heart by chapter one is something only a truly great novel can do i fell for esch as i fell for mockingbird's scout and a tree grows in brooklyn's francie i fell for her whole family and even members of her extended family i wanted to gather them and take care of them and protect them this was a coming of age story but more than that it was a story that forced you to remember katrina in my case maybe it forced me to actually see katrina properly ward said that she wrote this novel because she was upset at how katrina had faded from public consciousness she wrote it because she survived it and needed to write out her terror i can't explain and at the same time i don't want to try and describe how fantastic this book is i want you to read it one beautiful unknown piece at a time discovering and connecting the pieces together i want you to close the page and miss esche immediately for i miss her so badly i have to swallow salt imagine it running like lemon juice into the fresh cut that is my chest feel it sting p 222","844":"a brutal little book i read it in one gasp rural poverty in mississippi and that was before katrina a pregnant 14 year old a boy obsessed with his pit bull death in child birth a diet of ramen noodles and spam not comfortable but compelling","845":"compelling read loved the juxtoposition of the grittiness of the story with the beautiful prose","846":"unfortunately i felt like i was reading an extended undergrad creative writing piece not an award winning author the language is just so hard to get through everything is a simile i counted 3 uses of like to describe someone or something in one short paragraph i had to slog my way through it but i did find there were parts that intrigued me more than others and did want to read on thus not a total dislike","847":"it is a measure of this book's magic that you do feel like calling out to the characters to beware of what's gaining on them you are so frightened that their fragile lives will be ruined further in the storm that you forget about the power of resilience resolve and the other intangibles of human character there is a lot of urgency in salvage the bones perhaps it's because we know what will happen to these people in this place it is certain so the suspense the pace must be driven by other forces there is a palpable sense of foreboding we know what will happen for this reason it is a haunting haunted book we know what bad is coming we suffer through all of the smaller tragedy esch's crisis even the dog's crisis and the novel barrels ahead and we have to be swept along the language works magically to set and keep its pace so you do get it you begin to understand how the thing the hurricane came up and trapped up all of these people and rearranged everything in a short time","848":"the writing is very descriptive and the story of the family with the pnset of katrina as the backdrop is hard to put down","849":"this would be a great book for discussion some of the themes are a bit heavy motherhood and poverty for starters and some of the events are brutal and complicated dog fighting stealing sex and other events that said the writing is beautiful the characters were really well developed and the impending hurricane as a character in itself was fascinating","850":"beautiful writing that couldn't do enough to make the subject matter palatable for me so brutal and bleak","851":" this book should be required reading for all high school english classes not only is it beautiful ward's writing should be studied for its craft but the story it tells is one that everyone should hear so often when we talk about disasters like hurricane katrina or 9 11 we focus so much on the event itself that it seems it's the only thing the people who experienced it ever lived salvage the bones reminds the reader of the fallacy of this type of thinking the characters in the book are dealing with so many things decisions life changes adolescence loss acceptance katrina just seems like an afterthought and of course this is really how we experience disaster just one more thing we have our own lives before we live our own lives after disaster may bring us together or widen an already growing chasm or it may just be another bump on the path","852":"this book has such an incredible voice an amazing understanding of the characters it was written with a raw eloquence painting pictures of poverty hardship fear it is a story of a family living in the mississippi bayou in the week before katrina esch the main character and only girl in the batiste family is coming of age without the help of her mother who died in childbirth 7 years earlier it is a story about family and trying to salvage what you have when you don't have nearly enough","853":"eshe's family is dirt poor living in bois sauvage mississippi right before katrina mom died when youngest brother was born and dad's an alcoholic brother skeetah has raised a fighting dog who delivers puppies it's 12 days in their lives before and during the storm of the century i hated the parts with the dog fights and i believe there was a simile or metaphor in every single sentence the theme of family taking care of each other except perhaps skeetah who only cares about his dog and the ways they show it redeem this book","854":"to be honest when i first started this book i was not sure i was going to like it however as the book went on i really got involved in the lives of the characters and by the time katrina hit i was so worried for their well being that i did not want to stop reading until i knew that they would be okay best wishes to esch and china","855":"read this book it is beautiful interesting and heartfelt","856":"stunning difficult material but brilliant language","857":" this is a special book and one that i will be sharing with many many people irl it is pretty short for literature capital l but it packs a big punch the writing is so honest and economically makes you feel a lot in a short amount of time while there are heartbreaking elements to this story of a dirt poor rural family trying to survive their normal lives as well as the looming threat of hurricane katrina i would not say that the book is heartbreaking it manages to earn the characters some possibility at least of hope and grace i loved the teenaged girl esch who narrates the book i won't soon forget her","858":"touching beautifully written","859":"this book had promise but felt like a slice from the middle of a complete novel","860":"this book had potential and i was very excited to read it i loved the characters and who they were but i felt like the references to dogs and let me say i am a huge doglover somewhat overshadowed the characters it began to be droll and then was boring for me","861":" this book was phenomenal brought you into the mississippi bayou in an ultra personal way never felt like i was the stranger looking in was like a member of this backwoods family with their acute sense of the nature around them their parallel with a nature born common sense yet always adventurous always so humanly passionate and always full of hope and a sense that they would survive as they face the onslaught of the most devastating hurricane of our time katrina beautiful beautiful story","862":"this review has been hidden because it contains spoilers to view it click here i didn't finish this book i couldn't i couldn't even get through a fifth of it as soon as an incestuous relationship was confirmed i was like yeah i'm out","863":"i'm finished with this book but i didn't finish reading it it's well written with good strong voices but too dark for me at this time","864":" 3 5 stars this novel covers 12 days in the life of fourteen year old esch her father and 3 brothers living in mississippi this is a eye opener on teenage pregnancy poverty alcoholism and dog fighting every day this family is in survival mode yet they have an obstacle heading their way which they will have to work together to survive hurricane katrina jesmyn ward's writing is so poetic and there were many impressive moments but there was something about the overall style that wasn't comfortable to me so i didn't like it as much as i thought i would","865":"really liked this books very unique style of writing but also very good story telling","866":"i think this is more of a 3 5 for me it was a sad story that was hard for me to read at times dog fights extreme poverty teenage pregnancy and hurricane katrina i put it aside for several months and i'm glad i decided to finish it","867":"sad felt sort of young adult interesting narrative of a dysfunctional family in the days leading up to katrina very human portrayal of the ways some families work and don't work and cope with all kinds of tragedies it's well written","868":" i don't know exactly what i expected but this was not it after reading it i cannot understand why it was given so many rave reviews maybe i am just missing something but it did not move me in any major way after reading it i was just left feeling vaguely depressed and mildly frustrated it just didn't do anything for me i didn't really care much about any of the characters although i only actively disliked a few i was probably more sympathetic to the dog than to any of the humans i am not sure if i should even get in to the dog fighting aspect but i will say just a little based on the reading group topics in the back i was picking up that the dog fighting was supposed to be something with greater significance maybe a metaphor maybe a cultural commentary maybe something else i don't know all i know is that dog fighting is extremely cruel and selfish and this book tries if not precisely to glorify it then at least to normalize it and i understand that in some cultures it may be normal but that does not make it acceptable or excusable i am not going to go into this any further right now because i will get too worked up to type rationally i will say that it was an easy read i read over the course of one afternoon overall for multiple reasons i do not recommend this book and i will not be holding my breath for the author's next work","869":"i find that often when a book especially an adult book wins prestigious awards it does not end up being very readable for me call me uncultured unrefined unappreciative of the true art of writing well i don't care i am a reader a paying customer and i want to be entertained moved emotionally motivated to keep turning the pages or clicking the next page button until the very end to my somewhat surprise i actually enjoyed salvage the bones a national book award winner the story is told by esch who at fourteen finds herself motherless the only female in a family of four children living with their father in a depressed part of southern mississippi she is pregnant though she tries hard to hide it and hurricane katrina is making its way right to her front door her older brothers have their minds on other things one on his fighting pit bull china and the other on paying for basketball camp and esch is often just along for the ride taking care of her younger brother and father when she is able the author does a fantastic job of painting a picture so vivid that you can almost feel the humid warmth of summer hear the peoples' unique accent and taste the inexpensive canned meat that esch and her family subsist on a moving story and a unique perspective on katrina as well","870":" jesmyn ward's salvage the bones tells the story of one impoverished mississippi family on the days leading up to hurricane katrina the novel belongs in that esteemed group of canonized works of southern american literature here i found echoes of many of my favorite novels including as i lay dying cane the grapes of wrath and to kill a mockingbird yet ward's voice is wonderfully contemporary captivating and sure if there is one book i've read this school year that i want to share with students that i want to read alongside students it is this one i would love to trace again ward's brilliant use of tone and setting as well as read up on the medea myth to fully embrace her use of allusion i can't wait to show my students how ward is able to create a classic out of a lived experience in our nation's history one that is accessible vibrant and moving","871":"another book club book i would never had read this book on my own too much teenage sex for me i don't even like grown up sex in my books i did like reading about the hurricane and how this family survived katrina it was fascinating to read about the boy and his dog and their love but overall it was pretty sad and disheartening book","872":" tough subject matter about a little appreciated teenage girl living in a boys world in the south but i found this book very gripping i found the relationship with one of the teenage boys to his fighting dogs very interesting and gave me a glimpse into why people fight their dogs and how tied it is to their own sense of selves and power i also found the storm scene and its aftermath incredibly telling and shone light on what a lot of poor people who live in the swamps of the south often go through i read the storm scene in a small cabin with rain pounding on the roof which made me feel a little bit inside the book","873":"odd book interesting time and place a few days before katrina in new orleans suburb told from the perspective of the tween age daughter","874":"loved it her writing seems effortless","875":"i had trouble choosing a rating for this one and if i could give half stars this would get 2 5 it is in many important ways very good-- the prose is beautiful and ward builds the atmosphere of the coming hurricane masterfully patiently but i did not enjoy reading it very much this is a bleak painfully sad story about a family who by many measures have very little left to lose-- and then lose it","876":"beautifully descriptive prose story of love in many forms family love and loyalty carnal love friendship love unrequited love parental love wounded love unconditional love writing style a bit hard to follow on occasion for me","877":" what a great year for the national book awards in fiction this is an awesome book by a writer with a monster talent too folks and themes i e the importance of family that i care about i would not want to be on the board or panel of judges who have to decide who wins the national book award i've read three 3 of the five 5 nominees and i was truly impressed this is a great addition to that nomination kudos to the national book award panelists and to jesmyn ward it's going to be an interesting award ceremony next week","878":"strangely salvage the bones seems like a rewriting of as i lay dying faulkner's somewhat shoddy portrayal of women and african americans is amended by this book written by and from the point of view of a black woman as that it's pretty amazing and ward captures faulkner's intense almost mystical level of detail except from the point of view of a young sexually liberated black girl growing up in the path of hurricane katrina it's also remarkable how esch's sexuality is never presented as a negative what doesn't quite hold up is the ending which seemed a little too airy for such an earthy book at every point with faulkner and faulkner's main influence melville not only are you convinced that every little detail matters you are also convinced that every little detail matters in the context of a very important overall story and ward's story doesn't quite gel the way it should which says a lot about about how difficult it is to write in that vein still excellently written","879":"i only got halfway through the book it reminded me a lot of beasts of the southern wild it was just so bleak and i really didn't care about any of the characters i couldn't go on","880":"simply put i loved this book it had me gripped enough to cry which i can count on one hand the books that have done that for me i was engrossed in each and every character enjoyed the twists and turns of the plot and loved the writing style i'm not certain this is a five star novel but i certainly enjoyed it as one","881":"i did not realize how emotionaly invested i was in this book until the very end i found myself cringing to know what was going to happen and having to put it down because i wasn't sure i was ready to find out","882":"the story of a poor family living inthe coastal town of bois sauvage mississppi just before hurrican katrina i was touched by the family togetherness the love of a dog who has just had pups and dealing with the problems that arise before and after the storm","883":" this was one of the best books i've read recently the novel starts with the birth of china the pitbull's puppies and through the eyes of esch the 12 year old daughter of the family it spins a story of love poverty trust and hardship the prose is fluid and lovely poetic at times esch's family consists of all men firstly brother skeetah who owns tends and almost worships china the fighting pitbull china is a main character herself and her puppies might lead to enough money for basketball camp for randall the oldest brother who takes care of the family when the father is too drunk to do so junior is the smallest of the boys and seems by turns confused and hurt by life a group of young men randall's age hang around most days shooting hoop and smoking blunts manny the golden one is the object of esch's young love and the means of her deepest secret the story takes place before during and after hurricane katrina the lead up to katrina is desultory she is a vague threat that no one seems to take too seriously when she hits she is terrifying and we're swept along in the fear and horror of her rage afterward we wander the coast with her characters awed and confused by the destruction wrought by the storm there is a house sitting in the middle of the road facing us like it guards the secrets we will find farther in read this book it is a remarkable well written and touching story","884":"a little wordy but was ok not my favorite read of the year","885":"her prose literally sings to me","886":"may or may not have finished this tried very hard to like it but just couldn't","887":"this was a beautifully written and heartbreaking look at a fictional impoverished rural mississippi family in the days leading up to hurricane katrina the four children in the batiste family are motherless their mother died giving birth to the youngest child junior the father drinks excessively and is emotionally absent from their lives narrated by pregnant15 year old esch the children's love for each other is present on every page esch is a tragic character and i can only hope that life works out for her in the future deprived of a mother's guidance she thinks that having sex with boys is something she is supposed to do whether she wants to or not one boy in particular takes advantage of her naivete she loves him but he uses her for sex and shows her no affection yet she is so bright she compares her situation to those of strong females in the greek myths she loves to read she expresses herself so beautifully her brother skeetah is devoted to his fighting dog china i have always wondered how someone who loves dogs can fight them but the author shows how through the eyes of a young teen aged boy this is possible skeetah sacrifices for china and shows her the love he must miss from his absent mother it was not an easy read but was a thought provoking portrait of rural poverty and the importance of family","888":"slow paced bleak nothing uplifting about it","889":"painful with poverty dog fighting teenage pregnancy and alcoholism before katrina hits but beautifully written i finished it in one night","890":"this will become a classic","891":" extremely brutal and gritty but such a celebration of what a family is and how a family takes care of each other in less than ideal situations their mother dead their father a drunk the four siblings do their best to raise themselves and take care of each other their fighting pitbull china is the focus of much of their attention as she has puppies that need to be tended to the hurricane is coming they are trying to stock food and water and the tension mounts when the hurricane comes much is lost but the book ends on a note of hope hope for a better tomorrow","892":"a short but heavy book about a poor black family living in south mississippi in the time leading up to and immediately after hurricane katrina a heartbreaking story about family","893":"beautiful evocative language at times harrowing and grim a powerful read","894":"as coming of age stories go this one does not spare us anything loves losses relentless hardships but does so by examining the space in between gentle and harsh between love and betrayal between family and the all that lay beyond","895":" jesmyn ward weaves an intriging story of the relationships in a dysfunctional family in the gulf coast area several days before the onslaught of hurricane katrina and during the several days of the storm she paints the picture of a family that is struggling to move forward without the guidance of the wife and mother who has died and who was the strength and glue of the family the family is already in trouble before katrina hits and the story deals with how they survive and what the consequences are for the family as a whole and for the individual members it is a thoughtful book about relationships and a view into the difficult circumstances of poor folks in that region it is not always an easy or comfortable read but ultimately worthwhile","896":"i really wanted to like this book more than i did it was difficult to get into and i think what really bugged me about it was that the narrator didn't sound like a teenage girl most of the time she was just too writerly to be really believable that being said i think it's worth reading to get into this world i basically had no concept of as well as several really heart wrenching scenes throughout","897":"couldn't finish tried u0026amp couldn't too slow not interesting i quit","898":"can the poor ever be happy will they ever triumph","899":"really loved this book although it was soooo sad difficult subject matter but so layered and just written so beautifully","900":"well written","901":" i tried to push past the beginning chapters but couldn't growing up in the south has tainted novels like this as both too real and too fake the dialogue oppressive father figure poverty dialect and onrush of impending emotional wreckage... so much was familiar yet at the same time so forced that's simply because of my background i admit the novel is well written the attention to detail is good but in the end there wasn't any room to breathe here from the first pages you know where this is going and it ain't a happy place","902":"many people say the book is about hurricane katrina but i didn't think so i thought it was a story of connections among family members living in poverty i was absorbed by the love and understanding between siblings who really had little more than each other the complacent view they had of stealing their wayward father sex dog fighting their mother's death and their own poverty was eerily revealing to my privileged existence i enjoyed this book very much","903":" this was beautifully written the language contrasting with the bleak setting of black dirt poor gulf coast mississippi just before hurricane katrina hits the story is gut wrenching and hopeless feeling yet filled with little shards of hope as you wish so much for the main character esch to rise beyond her broken squalid circumstances she's the only girl with three brothers a drunk father on disability heartbroken still from her mother's death after birthing the youngest brother there's a fighting dog china who is literally middle brother skeeter's great white hope and he loves that dog like nothing else the story is about blood family love and what matters in the end when you have nothing","904":"i stumbled through several chunks of ms ward's writing but what kept me engaged were the characters at first i was just concerned with esch the 14 year old female character dirt poor and pregnant but then china the family's pit bull became my main concern if you are a dog lover as i am this is a very tough read both esch and china are used and abused by men and i just couldn't muster much empathy for the sad sorry lives of those men even though i knew they were victims themselves did any other readers think of michael vick i know the focus was on hurricane katrina and the plight of esch and her brothers but i really focused on china","905":"very descriptive poetic style of writing somewhat dark approach into revealing describing the strong family bond which i liked always love a strong female protagonist had no idea hurricane katrina was a part of the storyline should have seen it coming though interested to read more from this author","906":"this book where do i start the writing is so breathtakingly beautiful and the characters really tug at your heart strings ward paints a heart wrenching picture that climaxes with hurricane katrina and leaves your mind reeling it's a simple story that's secretly complex it's honest and real","907":"this book was a difficult read at first i thought it was just me since i was trying to work on my own project at the same time i was reading this group selection for the month then i saw others in the group were having the same problem the writing is slick but it seemed the story wasn't going anywhere plodding around in circles some in the group concluded ms ward was mirroring the activty of the storm in the gulf katrina as the storm gained strength so did the story vicious and brutal as the dog fight it is the story of the batiste family survivors of who died giving birth to junior leaving one girl esch with three brothers and an alcoholic father even as the action picked up it was still a difficult read esch a name like a whisper hush trying to find her way through the storm of life without a female role model if there ever was a character i wanted to slap straight it was esch the story tore at my heart the same way that storm did npr interview with jesmyn ward http www npr org player v2 mediapla bbc interview http www bbc co uk news magazine 16","908":"another great read from a young american writer i am really impressed with the new talent writing about difficult circumstances marginalised communities and the impact of the economic downturn in the us the setting and time 2005 and days before hurricane katrina the description of the storm towards the end of the book is terrifying and demonstrates how lives were changed forever","909":" definitely deserving of the national book award as i was explaining in book group over the weekend the amount of sheer effort that must have gone into recreating this level of sensory detail is amazing in and of itself i was left aching for all these people for the girl who has no real living mother figure for her and the rest of her family who are all trying to find something to hold onto both literally and figuratively for once i'll spare you my opinions on why this book hasn't gotten more attention just read it for yourself and spread the word","910":"thank everything holy that it's over it wasn't terrible just not for me more reflection coming soon","911":"i found the dog fighting parts of the book very difficult to read i admit to skimming over some of those parts while many aspects of the book were difficult i felt that it challenged me and had a real life feel to it i found the overall story interesting and the beautiful writing really drew me in i read the book over the course of a few days and eager to know what happened","912":"this book tried too hard the mythological stuff was just thrown in and made little sense details were unrealistic like 15 yr old being assigned mythology to read during the summer and having a chainsaw in an attic handy for the storm the characters were interesting but i wanted to know more about the dad and junior not fleshed out it seemed like it was a short story fleshed out with writing school devices it was ok but i wouldn't recommend it the description of the storm was good","913":"i quit reading at page 52 when skeet breaks the neck of a pit bull puppy i just couldn't read this one while lying in bed next to my beautiful pits i was interested in the story of esch but the constant references to pit bull fighting the monetary worth of each pit pup the treatment of the dogs in general was just too much i know ward was setting up a realistic situation for her poverty stricken characters but i guess i see enough pit abuse fighting dogs in my own neighborhood i don't care to read about it","914":"this book was very slow to start u0026amp contined to be slow until i was 3 4's into it but once it picked up i couldn't put it down ward's writing is so descriptive you can almost see the story taking place before you the poverty is painful but the hope u0026amp love between siblings is inspiring","915":"i liked this book a lot i got entrenched in the characters felt happy with them their sadness etc even china the pit","916":"i don't understand how anyone who reads this book could give it less than 5 stars but i'm just saying also any words that i try to string together here will not do this novel the justice it deserves or my just now finishing it is too soon to find the right words to express the depth of my emotions all raw with the horror of katrina and the beauty of life esch skeeter china randall junior daddy and big henry i don't think i will ever forget you","917":"this is not an easy to read book the writing is poetic and beautiful but the subject matter is rough and gritty in one scene the author writes about a pit bull fight that turned my stomach because it was so vivid and raw","918":"this book is a tough read in terms of the emotional content of the poverty the dogfights the coming hurricane it is a remarkable read in terms of the poetic language ward uses it is a universal story of family and commitment it deserved the national book award as far as i am concerned","919":" this is a prose novel written by a poet the language is beautiful and the pacing is perfect it was difficult to put this one down at night and sometimes i didn't i wish it was longer i hated to come to the last page and leave this family i have read in some places that it is considered a katrina novel however i think that would be an incorrect characterization of the book it actually is about a poor family in mississippi and how they live and how they deal with the adversity and problems of life without money or a mother the surviving parent is a neglectful alcoholic father the children are raising themselves as a result and the way they handle their problems fall somewhat short of success they are not doing the best they can but they are surviving each day despite the still fresh hurt of the mother's death in childbirth several years previously they each turn to things which best get them through their days and distract them from emotional pain at the same time each recognizes the value of being part of a family and inconsistently have each other's back when katrina does hit the author's talent shows the force of the hurricane easily with a poet's facility this book is wonderful to read","920":"ick kept rooting for katrina to hit and wipe out the family not really any redeemable characters her in my opinion at a loss for how this won the national book awards very disappointing","921":"brutal but beautiful loses a star for just too many similes","922":"a powerful novel of twelve days before and during a hurricane in a louisiana bayou there is a family of children whose father drinks the oldest of whom is maniacally devoted to his pregnant pitball the next oldest is the fourteen year old point of view character who is also pregnant the children fight the storm as best they can being both wily and physically ingenious taking shelter in the powerless cave of their house the pitbull pups die one by one and the girl narrator realizes she is pregnant there is an uptick of hope not entirely earned at the end for her there are reminders of carolyn chute's extraordinary the beans of egypt maine and also of this year's film the beast of the southern wild and like those two this book beautifully portrays odd poverty with all the dangers some times avoided of turning that poverty into a spectacle for outsider readers","923":"expected this to be depressing and it is given its setting and premise poor dysfunctional bayou family the daughter is secretly pregnant by a boy who never looks her in the eyes a son raises fighting pit bulls the week before hurricane katrina but i finished it struck by the author's portrayal of how love binds a family especially siblings and makes each one of them beautiful","924":"was disappointed in the book thought it would be much better than it was","925":"may 2013 review coming soon to my new website and will also be posted here www musingwithcrayolakym com","926":"sad but redemptive and moving","927":"this national book award winner is told in the first person by a fourteen year old pregnant girl living in poverty with her three brothers and largely absent father in rural mississippi is told over the period of 12 days in the days leading up to and immediately following hurricane katrina touching on poverty family bonds and heartache it was a good read","928":"salvage the bones was a tough but wothwhile read hurricane katrina is bearing down on esch and her family but a storm is brewing for the family esch is about 15 and has just found out she is pregnant she observes that she is naturally good at only two things swimming and sex she thinks she loves the baby's father but he wants nothing to do with her esch's mom died while giving birth to her youngest brother her dad drinks heavily and does what he can for the kids skeetah loves his pit bull china maybe more than his family china is a central figure in the story truly heartbreaking family situation","929":"it took me a while to get into it i struggled with the dog fighting but by the end i couldn't put it down","930":" you should read this book jesmyn ward has done an incredible job of pulling an uncomplicated and compelling narrative out of a powerful whirl of raw emotion the story is about loss as explored through the fifteen year old narrator esche who finds out she is pregnant her brother as he tries to care for his prize dog and her new puppies and the entire family as they continue to cope with the death of esch's mother years before all in the days leading up to hurricane katrina this book is violent and forceful in all the right ways you can feel it while you read it","931":"wow that was a great read the middle to end flew by and was really difficult to read at times what an amazing story of a horrific event","932":" this book is so simply written and yet so lovely in its storytelling it was a tough read at some points i'm not accustomed to this type of living and was cringing at the dog fighting and the sex and the drunken father however the story that ward tells about this family is so oddly heart warming that it carried me through to the end living in louisiana definitely makes me appreciate this story about the coming and going of katrina my only complaint is ward's constant mentioning of the color of the dog it's a really white dog i get it","933":"i think i could have given this book 5 stars if it wasn't so darn hard hard life hard people hard knocks if you will really well written great descriptions great language awful situation man putting myself in that families shoes sucked and then spoiler alert they don't even tell you for sure that the dog u0026amp puppies survived come on","934":"lyrical and visual in a way that forces you to become uncomfortably present in this quietly brilliant story","935":"pregnant teenage protagonist is a good character in a lousy life mother died father alcoholic tries to hold the family together with her three brothers in the face of grinding poverty and the imminent landfall of hurricane katrina on the gulf coast where they try to live the girl is an excellent english student and tries to relate her life to the greek myths she is reading and loving in school","936":"oh i love love loved this book reading it was a treat she has a poetic voice and rough around the edges tenderness that wrapped me up and made me want to stay","937":"not sure i understood it what is it that is being salvaged very subtle a lot of saying without sounding","938":"i am on page 100 of this book and am trying my best to finish there is too much going on maybe it will get better finished book today jan 21 extremely difficult book to get through this was a required bookclub read i skipped a lot of the pages because it was the same ole stuff the comparisons to the dog china i think the theme of the book was good but the author spent too much time on the dogs it was frustrating i was more interested in the last half of the book about the storm the depiction of the characters were excellent i got a vivid picture in my mind if who they were would i recommend this book probably not","939":"beautifully written and disturbing and horrifying that people must live like this","940":"chaos family loyalty wonderful and heartbreaking","941":"i read this book in spurts over the course of a couple months for various reasons i had to set it aside and concentrate on other things this happens quite a bit unlike other books though this one drew me back each time it moves along at a leisurely pace which made it easy to jump back in and the characters welcomed me back over and over again with their stories some of the sentences in this book are the best i've ever read an amazing writer telling an amazing story i was putty in her hands","942":"the characters in this book lived for me i was frightened for them by them and felt incredible pain for them extraordinary passages that build and build like the coming hurricane stayed up way to late reading it to the end","943":"this book is beautifully written it takes place in mississippi in the days leading up to hurricane katrina i admit to skimming over the much of the book because there's a lot of animal brutality pit bull fighting specifically and had i known this i wouldn't have read it at all because of this i didn't connect to any of the characters though they are well developed i really wanted more of the katrina story but that only encompassed the last two chapters and were eloquently written","944":"i simply loved this book gifted gifted writer","945":"salvage the bones was horribly beautiful it is simultaneously difficult to read and difficult to put down i found myself literally cringing hesitating to turn the page to see what would happen next but also unable to stop myself from finding out the pages of this book were dripping with emotion well crafted and heart wrenching not for those of weak constitution","946":"4 5 beautifully written","947":"just started audiobook like it so far well it seemed to take forever to finish listening to this book maybe if i had read it instead it wouldnt have seemed as repetitious i did like the tone and the almost non existent plot but it seems like it could have wrapped up a lot more quickly","948":"this book was 5 star well written but i just didn't enjoy the subject matter","949":"oh so difficult to read realism so raw that as a reader you can barely stand it there are so many reviews of this book that practically tell you everything about it but it comes down to what you bring with you to the story your sensitivities your human empathy your experiences","950":"this is the second book i've read recently with a young teen narrator describing a pretty disturbing childhood so maybe i unfairly compared the two since i loved the first one i definitely think this book deserves all the praise it has received for being beautifully written so my reluctance to give it a higher rating might be because it was such a downer it's hard to read about such extreme poverty and hopelessness and dog fighting probably going to bump it up to 4 stars from 3 now that i have thought about it","951":"this takes place in bois sauvage mississippi in the 12 days leading up to hurricane katrina the narrator is a 15 year old girl who is pregnant and living in rural poverty with her 3 brothers and alcoholic father her mother died giving birth to the youngest brother this is a real character study this group of boys who weave in and out she ties the story into some mythology in a way that works anyway ward is superbly talented i can appreciate everything she did here i don't know if it would be accurate to say that i enjoyed it although i certainly came away thinking about it the whole thing is depressing and there is a dog fighting element to the plot that i had to skip","952":"for some reason this story was a little slow to start for me i had a hard time getting into it maybe because the language seemed a little choppy despite its rich descriptive details and then not much happens in the first half other than her brother's interactions with his dog and puppies so the first half was mostly spent acquainting the reader with the narrator's esch life at home with her 3 brothers and father there is a particular focus on her brother skeetah and his interactions with his dog esch's father is preoccupied with scraping supplies together with meager resources for a storm that no one else is taking seriously none of them notice that esch is struggling with the early stages of pregnancy she is fourteen motherless and in love with an immature jerk the last half of the book was where the story picked up as the narrator's father announces that the storm that has been approaching is now a hurricane named katrina couldn't put the last half of the book down i liked that this story addressed the effect that hurricane katrina had on people who owned pets it reminded me of a clip from oprah where a man was crying over his dog because he wasn't allowed to take it with him during the aftermath of the hurricane","953":" brace yourself jesmyn ward pulls no punches in this raw portrait of a poor rural mississippi family in the ten days leading up to hurricane katrina fourteen year old esch batiste is the lone female among three boys and her father her mother died during the birth of junior several years earlier at the core of this story is china a beautiful white pit bull she is brother skeetah's prize fighter and - it turns out - the family's great white hope as the story opens she births a litter of puppies her first worth hundreds of dollars in the local dog fighting scene esch holds a special bond with china because she is the only other female in the family and esch longs to be as loved and pampered as the dog ward draws a striking parallel between these two lives just as china is seduced into the dog fighting ring because of her lot in life so is esch sexually used and abused by her brothers' friends who hang out at the \"pit\" when esch discovers she's pregnant she keeps it secret a revelation that in her family puppies are more valuable than another mouth to feed while esch observes china's indifferent even weary attitude toward new motherhood she comes to terms with her own dilemma overshadowing all of this is hurricane katrina as the storm gets whipped up by warm gulf waters so does the sturm and drang in the batiste family all of which climaxes into a powerful discordant crescendo that is unforgettable in its savagery salvage the bones won the 2011 national book award perhaps because esch and the rest of the batiste family are so achingly real they haunt you beyond the pages of the book as you wonder if they will be okay the one true hope in this story is that we at last comprehend the tragedy of poverty copyright c 2012 by peggy tibbetts","954":" it has beautiful moments and the prose is striking in its depiction of a small community in mississippi dealing with the arrival of hurricane katrina ward has a timeless and spooky quality at moments and the dogfighting sequences are particularly rough i had trouble enjoying this book but i recognized its power by the last quarter of it when the storm hits the writing goes into overdrive and her aftermath is pretty impressive and remarkable ultimately a story about a family and a community not unlike the bundrens of yoknapatawpha county salvage the bones is a strong novel with many powerful moments","955":"after my last giveaway i was a little under enthused going into this read i will also admit that i was expecting the focus of the novel to be on racial differences in the south pre and post katrina since racial tensions are what win awards i was happily proven wrong by ward this novel was fantastic the main character esch is just so real she is scrappy yet quiet and thoughtful as well i wanted to find her in real life hug her tell her everything would be all right and then make it happen growing up the only girl in a houseful of such male temperaments esch becomes at once a mother caretaker for her brothers and father and also a tomboy little girl who is the only girl at dog fights and who gives herself away too easily because it is easier that way ouch no to mention the cruel cruel words that she hears from the one boy who she truly loves and have you read the blurb on this book she's pregnant at 15 each of the supporting characters is completely round and lifelike as well a sign of a truly well written novel you have the oldest brother who loves basketball and wants to get a scholarship to college so bad not as cliche as it sounds the middle brother who loves his pit bull with a freakish passion but who still would choose his family over the love of his life dog and there is the little brother the baby of the family who never knew their mother and is doted upon by all of his siblings esch's father is rough an alcoholic who doesn't show affection or seem to care for his children much at all however esch remembers the way he stood tall and proud with her mother in the years before she died her father carries his wedding ring like a talisman and before the storm hits the one item her father cares to preserve is a plastic bag carrying pictures of esch's mother katrina herself only lasts a few brief pages she is really just a backdrop to a story about the ties that bind a family together through anything and the redemptive power of love","956":"exhaustingly depressing but the relationship between the siblings is touching and the hurricane scenes are gripping","957":" i wasn't sure what to expect when i picked this book up i was actually kind of worried that it'd be a story about dogs hey some people like that stuff but i guess you should never judge a book by its cover i was immediately drawn into the work because the writing style and content reminded me of toni morrison who i love this book is about many things and the author beautifully wove all these stories together into one big picture it's about a girls longing for love after her mother has passed the implications of hurricane katrina on less well off groups it's about family and finally feminine power i don't want to give too much away but definitely would recommend reading this one","958":"there's a lot of hurt in this novel raw stinging hurt and as the narrator reflects hard healed over hurt bloody hurt familial hurt canine hurt racial hurt but there's also a lot of poetry and through it all scarcely recognizable until it suddenly is there's saving love i knew little about this novel when i picked it up which is unusual for me but which probably helped turn it into one of the most memorable and searing reading experiences i've had in some time i knew i think that it had won some manner of prize in fact it was the national book award but that was about it i had no idea it was a hurricane katrina novel or certainly that i would finish the novel and feel convinced that there will never be a hurricane katrina novel as good as this one or many american novels of any kind as good as this one that jesmyn ward is an amazing young talent is evidenced not just by the overall harrowing power of salvage the bones but by the unforgettable and utterly believable powers of observation amidst the almost tragic dereliction of life in what her family knows as the pit of her narrator esch the loss of the family's mother after giving birth to esch's brother junior hovers around the sad scrappy and hardscrabble scenes of this narrative and there's no small amount of discomfort for the reader to endure whether it's weathering the tempests of esch's father the grit your teeth literally edginess of the dog fighting drama or when it finally comes the soggy deafening terrifying and finally heart rending china white he breathes my china punishment delivered by katrina the deep emotions and the pathos are assiduously earned and when the storm passes and the sky clears the endurance and hopefulness are in the way of great fiction both richly felt and soberingly modest and through it all is that poetry and a gathering of acutely realized cutting details we get astonishing renderings of the impoverished rural south through miles of woods lonely houses like possums in the dark half caught and then left behind by the headlights a father's injured hand wrapped up to the wrist in gauze and tape so that it looked like a webworm moth nest wound tight in a pecan tree a color based cartography that finds esch and her family living in the black heart of bois sauvage and their advantaged neighbors living in the pale arteries in this setting especially where refrigerators rusted so that they look like deviled eggs sprinkled with paprika the spirit resolve and creative openness to life exhibited by esch make this ultimately a simply stunning novel","959":"for much of this book i found it hard to keep reading it also may have been my sensibilities as a young teen girls realizes she is pregnant by a young man who wants only one thing from her and the dog fighting even though skeetah truly and deeply loves his dog china my problem was not poor or not intriguing writing but more that the life depicted was sad love is the element that lifts this story for this family a family who survives the category 5 hurricane and who with skeetah awaits the return of his dog china who was lost during the storm thought provoking and a book that will stay with me for some time i bought this book for my junior senior high library it will be marked grades 9 12","960":"a hurricane is threatening bois sauvage mississippi and esch's family is preparing for it her mother died a while ago and her father is a drunkard they are trying to stock up food but there isn't much at all esch is fifteen and pregnant and her brother skeetah is sneaking scraps for his pit bull's prized puppies the story takes place over 12 days i enjoyed this book i really loved the characters including esch and skeetah as well as the pit bull china the book describes this brutal dog fighting racket where dogs are matched up together it seemed kind of strange that skeetah cares so much for china yet he lets her fight and risk her life and kill other dogs esch is also a great narrator in this book and very observant my blog is at novareviews blogspot com","961":"the book is beautifully and lyrically written the story is an ugly one of poverty alcoholism and teenage pregnancy the story is told in a way that you sympathize with the characters and begin to understand their lifestyles a bit i thought the book would be about hurricane katrina but that is just the backdrop for telling the story of poverty in the south","962":"i found this book depressing u0026amp found it hard to pick it up thought maybe it was just me but read reader reviews u0026amp found some kindred spirits one wanted to quit her book club for choosing it","963":"this book made me feel depressed and was uncomfortable to read which is the reason for the lower rating i thought the book was more about hurricane katrina but the hurricane is only the last 2 chapters most of the book is about a poor family and dog fighting after i read more reviews on this book after i had read it i appreciated the book more but i still don't like it much","964":"i thought i would like this more than i did i liked it but it was neither a page turner or a book where the prose is so magical that reading it is worthwhile for that reason alone not that it was bad it was just kind of middle of the road","965":"beautifully written i'll definitely be watching for more by this author","966":" this is one of those books where i admired the artistry of the author's writing but found the story itself difficult and at times painful to read a 15 year old african american girl esch is the narrator of the story which covers just 12 days in the life of her family in mississippi as hurricane katrina bears down she lives with her drunken and sometimes abusive father and three brothers their mother died in childbirth 8 years earlier their lives are dismal in so many respects her oldest brother 17 year old randall dreams of getting a basketball scholarship which seems unlikely because he lacks the support and exposure he needs to catch recruiters' eyes her older brother skeetah devotes all his love and attention to his fighting pit bull and pins his hopes on selling her newly born litter yet lacks the medicines and experience to adequately care for the puppies junior the 8 year old who has no memory of their mother runs wild and acts out and esch discovers she is pregnant esch's observations are poignant and poetic frequently comparing her life experiences in the medea story she is reading in school but despite her bright mind her infatuation with a boy who treats her abominably and her blindness to his manipulation is heartbreaking and the scene of the dogs fighting for their masters made me writhe with its violence despite the author's description that elicited imagery of an elaborate dance rather than viciousness the family's miserable lives just kept getting worse and worse and the only glimmer of hope and strength was the siblings' devotion to each other through each tribulation they face and just when you think it couldn't possibly be any worse katrina hits the final two chapters of the massive hurricane's terrifying fury and aftermath were page turners and made me glad i stuck with it and finished the book","967":"loooved this great writing really observant and descriptive well written characters growing tension very minor complaint she mentions a dog sweating at least 3 times but the way she writes it you believe it can happen","968":"this is a beautifully written book despite the dark subject matter the hardscrabble life of a young woman and her family living in louisiana in the shadow of poverty violence and hurricane katrina wonderful characterization amazing climax easy to see why it won the national book award","969":"this is a tremendous work and one that is painful to read i mean that in the most complimentary way it took me a long time to get through simply because it was so emotionally tough when you are ready to take up something that tugs at your heartstrings and hopefully at your public health and social policy strings read this","970":"a great read interesting writing style strong characterization deeply touching without being obvious","971":"this book was heartbreaking hard to read but hard to put down at the same time i'm torn between 3 and 4 stars the writing didn't knock my socks off but when i think back on it the imagery was so vivid and my memory of the story is like a movie i can picture all of it especially the hurricane perhaps that speaks to the writer's skill there's no doubt that this is an intriguing story and if there were a follow up i'd certainly want to read it i wish there would've been far more chapters post hurricane","972":"amazing family loyalty tale amid squalor poverty pregnancy and an approaching hurricane","973":"i'm not sure why this would have won the national book award other than guilt it's bleak cruel violent inhumane and mostly hopeless the language is raw and unsophisticated i read it for a book club but admittedly skipped large chunks of material that were just full of animal cruelty","974":" i loved this book i was wary at first the characters seemed so stereotypical which i ward's brilliance a poor black family in mississipi with an alcoholic father the sister is a teenager who is pregnancy and her brother raises fighting dogs i mean seriously if anyone else would have written this they would have been shot down by the critics for perpetuating these stereotypes ward does an amazing job of breathing life into her characters the world they live in and the futures they dream for my favorite aspect about this book is the bonds that hold this family together even in the face of disaster i highly recommend this book","975":" this is one of those true to the core books with rich realistic dialogue and memorable characters people who don't know how bad they have it because they make the best of what they have i was going to go with 4 stars being that the book focused so much on dogs as opposed to katrina but the passages about the storm were so heart wrenching and true that i went with 5 i might not have picked this novel up if i had known how much it focused on dogs and dog fighting as i am sensitive to the plight of animals view spoiler reading about china getting swept away in the flood was almost too much to take i can imagine skeetah's despair over his beloved dog and quite frankly it was almost unbearable i like how the ending was left open to allow the illusion of china coming back as opposed to them finding her dead as would likely happen however i wished that it had ended with china emerging from the woods shining bright hide spoiler nonetheless i fought through it even though it was really hard sometimes","976":"this book was chosen by our book club for july i am tempted to leave the club for picking such a dismal novel dread despair gloom racism not a single character had any redeeming qualities the book was well written however i am not really sure what the point was was this a survival story a coming of age innocence lost story for esch that occurs while hurricane katrina approaches maybe this was a story about how four children cope with an impoverished life after losing their mother and their father is emotionally detached due to his alcoholism and grief maybe this book was about a father's failure to connect with and love his children that causes his only daughter to sleep with anyone because she is looking for love and validation another to try and escape through basketball another to find his love and validation via the love of his fighting dog and the 4th and baby child being raised by his older siblings the only way he can show love is to try and prepare to survive and weather the category 5 hurricane that is making landfall in bois sauvage i thought the comraderie love closeness between esch skeetah randall and junior was touching but that is about all i really love of the book","977":"if the whole book was as good as the chapter on katrina this would definitely been a five star read it started slow but gradually picked up pace toward the end maybe that is my fault because i am not familiar with this author's style it still is a damned good book i've read a helluva lot worse","978":" i loved this book at first i thought maybe i shouldn't read it right now because i'm trying to avoid books that are sad and heavy but i heard so many good things about it that i decided to go ahead and try it i'm so glad i did the writing was so beautiful and the characters were so intriguing that once i started reading i couldn't stop i loved the main character esch and the way she told the story of her family i also couldn't help but fall in love with her brothers and the family dog china this is another one of those books that will stay with me","979":" on its surface a novel about a family preparing for hurricane katrina jesmyn ward masterfully recreates a part of america that seems very foreign the abject poverty of a rural mississippi community i remember watching the approach of katrina on tv the stunning colorful satellite images of a humongous storm that was about to engulf everything in its path it seemed pretty clear that people living in its path should get out of the way and it was mind boggling that people chose to stay ward makes it perfectly clear without writing it in so many words that some people didn't have a choice the people in her novel don't have the internet or even good television reception that would have shown the magnitude of the storm and even if they did how would they leave in the family's dilapidated pick up truck with what money for gas when they are subsisting on top ramen as it is and where exactly would they go the automated phone call that advises them of the mandatory evacuation and warns of possible death certainly doesn't answer these questions even if it did seem different than all of the other times the phone rings on the day before a hurricane hits in the 12 days leading up to and immediately following the storm the reader is drawn into the african american community of bois sauvage neighborhood kids that hang around the family's debris strewn property an almost sympathetic portrayal of dog fighting a 14 year old girl who became sexually active at 12 and has had sex with most of the neighborhood boys schoolyard fighting neighbors who look out for one another and neighbors who don't it's a story of katrina that we didn't see on the news","980":"this isn't always an easy book to read either mechanically getting used to the language and characters can take some time or emotionally there are some very difficult scenes to read between dog fighting and katrina but it is very much worth it i don't always agree with the choices of some of the major literary awards but i can definitely see why this book received this year's national book award the author has real talent i can't wait to see what she writes next","981":"this book is amazing i am at a loss for words to describe how awesome this book is i'm sure other reviewers will do it better","982":"worth it","983":" hauntingly thought provoking and as a good friend once described another book simply a well crafted story what i find most amazing though is how most of the other reviews comment on the trauma the tragedy the beautiful writing or the way in which the author wrote about katrina but in truth i found none of those things remarkable in this book well done but not remarkable in fact i feel as though everyone has missed what was the most obvious and complex undertone of the book the concept of motherhood and femininity through oppression could not be more significant and intriguing in which the main character constantly interprets her own experiences by deciphering those experiences of china the female dog of the dogfights if you take the time to read this book don't think of it merely as an account of katrina or a poor black rural family in mississippi look for the deeper complexity","984":"this book was so beautiful and so heartbreaking i almost had to put it down several times but even though the story was about awful things happening to good hearted people it was so wonderfully written that i had to keep on reading i have to honestly say that i am glad i finished it because it tied my stomach in knots and made me cry i will read anything else that ms ward writes even if it is just as hard","985":"others rate this book high i read one third of the book and decided not to invest any more time story of sister brother cousins in poor rural area of new orleans brother gives much of his time and attention to his dog sister is concerned over her early stages of pregnancy hurricane katrina is approaching perhaps it is a young adult book with adult subjects nothing wrong with the book just not for me","986":"heartbreaking account of family life in a community not often written about a small black mississippi town is the setting of this drama each family member is strong but faces a crisis in their life in addition a hurricane is threatening their existence how they stand together to meet all of these challenges is uplifting as well as exciting","987":"riveting story with a soft and fierce southern voice loved it","988":"really a 5 1 2 or a 6 this book is a true tour de force beautifully written and structured with fully fleshed characters that i doubt i will ever forget if any recent book becomes a classic it should be this one","989":"at first i thought it was a ya book but as the book progressed it was not i've rarely ever read more gripping sequences as the dog fight and the terror of the hurricane katrina it was a fast read and i couldn't put it down","990":"'ve never belonged to a book group for several reasons the books chosen don't interest me i've already read the selection i have a to be read list five miles long and something else took precedence for salvage the bones which won last year's national book award however i chose to participate in a discussion group on goodreads the literary fiction by people of color this helped me immensely during the reading of this book as i discovered the many nuances of this story through the eyes of others esch is a fourteen year old girl in a small town in louisiana on property known as the pit since her mother died giving birth to the last son esch is the only female in this family of boys with the exception of her brother skeetah's prized pit bull china the twelve chapters of this book cover the twelve days leading to the arrival of hurricane katrina esch's father an alcoholic long past caring about much in the world is concerned about the impending storm that everyone else believes will blow over like the others he tries to take charge and have everyone board up the buildings on their property and stockpile the food they have little money for but every family member has other issues to distract them esch has discovered she is pregnant skeetah has a new litter of china's puppies to deal with older brother randall has his basketball dreams that he hopes will take him out of the pit and baby junior is on a search for the parenting he missed out on when their mother died i know that seems like a lot but i promise you that i haven't even touched the surface of this book and what happens during those twelve days the plot has its ebbs and flows but reading it with the book group allowed me to see things i would have missed during what seems to be the slower parts of the book salvage the bones was definitely deserving of the awards and accolades that it received last year","991":"this was an amazing book imagery and language story and drama set in the bayou just before katrina one of the best books i've ever read thanks for the recommendation joe","992":" i did not in fact finish this book it was poetic and all but after 65 pages a quarter of the way through i just wasn't into it katrina's on the horizon and skeetah's trying to save his dog's pups while his sister copes with teenage pregnancy in the poor rural south i'm pretty sure it's going to end in an uplifting manner but i just have trouble slogging through this story i'd rather read a more positive african american experience so maybe i'm a racist it was a good book but the subject matter just didn't keep me hooked","993":" amazing book which grabs you from the beginning with a tight fist until the hurricane hits at the end there were parts of the book that were labored and felt too contrived frequent references to medea just didn't feel right in the end this family is beautifully drawn and as with every book i assign a 5 star rating i was captivated i read a short biography of ward and she was born in mississippi and lived through katrina and its aftermath my daughter was starting her freshman year at tulane in new orleans when we were told to evacuate because of the impending storm my daughter's life was upended for six months until she returned to school in january but nothing like those who stayed in new orleans their courage and resiliency facing unbearable struggles is a testament to their spirit this book captures that instinct for survival ward definitely deserved winning the national book award for this book","994":" as a teacher in the south i feel as if i know the children in this book personally the love of the siblings is true and very familiar one brother hoping for a sports career and children wrapped up in raising pit bulls really sounds like so many poor southern families i have seen kids carry pictures of their pits in their billfolds like it is a child when parents die the brothers and sister must raise themselves because the other parent is working 2 0r 3 jobs or just drop out on drugs and alcohol esch was taken advantage of by the boys hanging around skeeter's entire life was his dog china and all of them but mainly randall raised junior the baby that was born and took the mother that had held their life together the entire book was spent watching the father prepare for a hurricane that the kids didn't think would come as i read i kept dreading what i knew what was going to happen the book pulled me in and held me to the last page","995":"the dog fights and what happened to the china was almost too much to bear very intense was probably unfavorably affected by just having seen and hated beasts of the southern wild","996":"well i have to say i did not care for this book i did not read it all but it was just to dry for me i think it was well written and that it was just not fo rme","997":"one of first novels based on katrina disaster and won natl book award has been compared with to kill a mockingbird far from it good tale which drags at times don't remember to kill a mockingbird

meet with one brother betting it all on puppies from his pit bull and katrina comes","1000":"gritty depressing and poetic as in the good southern fiction tradition reserve it from our catalog here http bit ly v8jrpe","1001":"a bit like watching a train wreck without being able to look away powerful realistic story gripping heartbreaking not a lot of hope i wonder if this was the best choice for book group looking forward to hearing other member's opinions i am certainly glad this book is over","1002":"try reading swamplandia and salvage the bones in tandem as i did and you will have a powerful visceral experience of loss and tremendous strength in the face of extreme adversity so moving to be caught up in an overwhelming desire to reach out my protective arms and rescue these two young girls both of whom have lost their mothers and whose fathers have valiantly but unsuccessfully struggled against economic collapse while trying to raise their families and keep it all together","1003":"the beginning of this book was so bleak i wasn't sure i could stand it the ending pulled it all together for me and i ended up really liking it it's one of those books you have to chew on for a while after you finish it","1004":"this book is an eye opener and heart breaker who knew how the poverty stricken coped with the idea of a hurricane approaching and finally hitting bois sauvage mississippi the family is so real the mother has just died having her fourth child the oldest randall is hoping for his school to pay his way to a basketball camp the second son skeetah is devoted to his pitbull china and her newborn puppies but the main character esch is a 14 year old girl who discovers she is pregnant by one of their circle of friends we live the prelude to hurricane katrina thru esch i hope this author writes more books she is a poet with descriptive words and phrases","1005":"this was a difficult book for me in some sections particularly the pit bull fighting i don't understand the lure of that at all however the intense portrayal of this family of motherless and essentially fatherless children loving and protecting each other through terrible odds moved me and ultimately it also portrayed hurricane katrina and the challenges of poverty in trying to prepare for it in a very personal way","1006":"beautifully written but not uplifting in any way helped me gainperspective on katrina and it's destruction","1007":"this is one of the best books i've read in a decade ms ward is the master of the metaphor every time she uses a sentence like some jewel awaits what a story what a heroine","1008":"review contains spoilers i read so many rave reviews about this book but i was just really let down i get the rawness of the story in dealing with an impoverished family from the deep south on the precipice of a disaster and their survival and love for each other but i just did not find this story that interesting i think the only parts i was really interested in reading were the outcome of the dogfight and if they survived the actual hurricane i still want to know if they ever find the dog are we just going to assume skeet waits there for the rest of his life i wasn't expecting a happy ending by any means but i just felt like the book just ended without real closure","1009":"a new favorite absolutely so gorgeous i had to stop reading sometimes feeling so breathless from the poetry of it","1010":"ward's writing is incredibly beautiful especially about things that are not","1011":"this book was really buzzed about and won a major award the name of which is slipping my mind i had high expectations and it met some of them the characters were interesting but never really developed enough for me to really care about or root for them the premise of the book is a family preparing for hurricane katrina but the hurricane doesn't hit until about 80% through the book and then is over we don't know what becomes of the characters esch the narrator is pregnant and reveals this to her family near the end of the book she makes many comparisons between herself and medea she is reading a greek mythology book for school as well as to her brother's pit bull china who has just had puppies i don't really understand these comparisons though as other than bearing children the 3 have nothing in common esch seems to be the opposite of a murderous mother or vicious fighting pit bull in fact overall this story just didn't grab me i didn't feel like anything had really happened when it was all over","1012":"there are a lot of metaphors in this book a lot","1013":"my only regret was that i read it too quickly","1014":" i had misgivings about this national book award winner at first a black family living in louisiana on the eve of katrina a pregnant girl pit bulls raised for fighting it looked like it was going to be an over the top melodrama but i was wrong it was involving believable and a comment at heart about what makes up a family what binds a family together and the destructive forces that tear apart families the girl is pregnant full of misgivings and doubts about her forthcoming motherhood but there are the parallel motherhoods of the pit bull bitch china who acts instinctively toward her young there is skeetch the brother who in his total attachment to his dog might as well be a mother to china forget his savage agenda for her future there is the mother who died in childbirth but who still exerts a strong influence over the family especially on the ineffectual father and finally the hurricane itself when it crashes into the louisiana coast it destroys the family house and nearly causes everyone to drown its force and strength is unbelievable and it is described as the mother that swept into the gulf and destroyed she was the murderous mother who cut us to the bone but left us alive she left us to salvage katrina is the mother we will remember until the next mother with large merciless hands committed to blood made me think of china comes page 255 kindle edition a mother who is a destructive force of nature will the characters recover from her ravages does life have meaning in the face of such an ordeal or is it like a ongoing battle of pit bulls there is no happy ending to this novel - only the family members stunned looking at the wreckage of their lives the comforts the flesh stripped away leaving only the bare \"bones\" of existence but at the end of the novel the daughter the narrator identifies with china who has disappeared in the katrina flood she is certain that china will return the instinctive enduring life no matter what \"she will know that i am a mother\" are the last words of the novel the only thing in the book that i didn't think worked very well were all the references to jason and medea who knows those myths anyway i didn't and i found them a distraction i think the novel would have been as good without them but that's a minor quibb","1015":"hard to read because of the material but beautifully written","1016":"this is a great novel the best i've read so far this year i wasn't hooked immediately the novel is told from esch's point of view and it took me a while to settle into her voice once i did though it made for a really compelling read the chapter that describes hurricane katrina is one of the finest pieces of writing i've read in some time it's haunting and lovely and perfect","1017":"actually 3 5 stars it was compelling with a very strong sense of place the hurricane chapters were extremely visual and had me on the edge of my seat at times i felt like it dragged a bit in the middle and i'm still not sure i really got to know the narrator but overall a good read that i would recommend","1018":"i started this on audiobook which was well narrated but i don't think the book is well suited for audio it is slow to develop and audio just takes longer it is a beautifully written book with well developed characters highly recommend","1019":"this is an achingly beautiful book heartbreaking gorgeously written poetic eye opening and somehow uplifting it was so hard to read but i'm so glad i read it","1020":"a well written painful tale of love and family and coming of age from jesmyn ward teen pregnancy poverty racism dog fighting alcoholism and abuse are all part of the story opening these subjects up to further guided exploration with groups of readers to discuss stereotypes expectations violence addiction responsibility relationship the social separation caused by classism and racism and struggles with self worth as persistent issues across society","1021":" i read it because it was on a bunch of must read lists this year and the idea that it takes place in a stretch of 12 days sounded fascinating for those of you that know me the premise was perfect poor african american family living in the south mother died giving birth to her fourth child so dad is doing his best while being an alcoholic daughter is 14 and pregnant and throw in some dog fights did i mention that the first 10 days in the book lead up to katrina what i did like about the story was the closeness and protectiveness of the main family with all the misery and anguish they really held together and stood by each other i had the hardest time with the dog fighting granted it was only one chapter but it was not something i could handle for any more than that the book was a bit like reading one about the titanic you know what is going to happen with that ship you know katrina is coming and the devastation is will leave behind i found myself using the images of people needing rescue from the news when the family was trying to ride out the storm in their home and when they talked about fema and how they were going to take care of the citizens after the storm i cringed","1022":"three stars for comfort level five stars for writing tough read","1023":"it had the potential to be great but was a little too descriptive and dragged out","1024":"at first i thought this took place in the 50s or 60s but it is actually the story of a family shortly before hurricane katrina hits","1025":"this is one of the best books i have ever read one of those stories that will stay with you so so hoping for a continuation as believe there is more story to tell in the years after","1026":"'take a lot out of an animal to nurse and nurture like that price of being female ' finally manny glances at me it slides over me like glass skeetah laughs it sounds as if it's hacking its way out of him 'you serious that's when they come into they strength they got something to protect ' he glances at me too but i feel it even after he looks away 'that's power ' 'to give life is to know what's worth fighting for and what's love ' does manny think that of me that i am weak that there is a price to this body that swallows him that pulls him and takes him until he has nothing left is manny glad because he will never have to pay it and there is nothing but mangled wood and steel in a great pile and suddenly there is a great split between now and then and i wonder where the world where that day happened has gone because we are not in it","1027":" fantastic in the wake of katrina fifteen year old esch is pregnant her father is not a participant in the lives of his children since the death of his wife randall the oldest is busy trying to get scouted to a good school with basketball skeet is too involved with his pit bull china who has just had a litter and junior the youngest is like a wild animal running around and yet they are still a family they don't come any poorer than esch's family and the circumstances of her family's life may not be ideal to everyone else's but in a way it teaches them about survival at its truest form katrina is coming and before the horrible storm hits the family is already slowly building in heat and rage itself esch is carring the child of skeets best friend randall feels the burden of being the father figure and skeet is so wrapped in his dogs well being all else is secondary in his eyes there are elements in this story that are repugnant like the dog fighting and the living conditions of the brothers and sister and yet there's something deep in this story too esch's own understanding of the character medea from the book she reads for comfort and escapism randall's young handling of his family especially junior the youngest and skeet's love for his dog and the love the dog shows skeet the story is told from esch's pov and its the love these siblings have for each other that shines thru the most i find this story true to life and i prefer to know what is as to what could be its just a preference of mine you choose","1028":"amazing beautifully written","1029":"i had a really tough time getting into this book maybe it's because i was reading it in between doing other things i generally prefer to block out a big chunk of time so i can really get into a story especially with fiction maybe it's just because it wasn't really that engaging it's the story of a family living in mississippi countryside in the week u0026amp a half before hurricane katrina hits the story is narrated by esch age fifteen u0026amp the only girl among the four siblings randall one year older is a basketball prodigy hoping to get a scholarship to basketball camp u0026amp get scouted by college recruiters skeetah is one older than him u0026amp is obsessed with his white pitbull china who has just had puppies skeetah hopes to sell the puppies when they're old enough to send randall to basketball camp is he doesn't get the scholarship he also enters china into dog fights junior is the baby of the family at seven the kids' mother died giving birth to him their father is around but he's an alcoholic u0026amp the kids mainly do what they can to parent themselves the book reviews u0026amp descriptions make a big fuss over how esch is pregnant which she is u0026amp it's definitely part of the story but probably 85% of the book consists of esch observing skeetah's relationship with china seriously it's weird to me that there is almost nothing about this can you even really call it a plotline when it's almost the entire story the entire book is just skeetah obsessing over the puppies skeetah panicking when one of the puppies seems sick skeetah recruiting esch to help him break into the neighbors' barn to steal some deworming medication skeetah getting into a fight with another dog fighter who thinks he is entitled to one of china's puppies skeetah fighting china mere days after she gives birth in order to retain his claim to the puppies skeetah busting his ass beyond belief to try to save china u0026amp the puppies during the hurricane i guess maybe there was supposed to be some metaphor or allegory there skeetah loving china u0026amp being an excellent surrogate father to her puppies while esch comes to terms with being pregnant u0026amp is summarily rejected by the baby's father who is in a serious relationship with another woman maybe but if that's what ward was going for it was awfully heavy handed almost as heavy handed as esch's periodic ruminations on the story of medea i'll just leave it at that maybe this was hard for me to get into just because i am not a dog person i am not kidding when i say that the dog was the central focus of nearly the entire book i was really bored until we got to the hurricane scenes which were horrifying the writing was not great i had trouble visualizing exactly what the author was describing especially the sequence in which the family makes for higher ground to escape rising floodwaters it was all very poetic u0026amp everything but it wasn't really very descriptive but the poetry of the language did succeed in creating an atmosphere of terror because the book ends the day after the hurricane the reader has no way of knowing how things transpired for this family after the storm in a better book i think i would have felt more curious i am kind of idly curious about how esch does with her baby especially because the author really ladled on the idea that with all her brothers u0026amp all her brothers' friends the baby will not be hurting for father figures which kind of ignores the fact that people do not often maintain an interest in children for the entire 18 years it takes to raise them to adulthood even when they are their own children let alone when they belong to some neighbor girl but that's it it's not a bad book but it's not a great book i honestly believe absurd as this sounds that you'll enjoy this book a lot more if you like dogs u0026amp if you can make your peace with the dog fighting scenes i gave it an extra star for the storm scenes","1030":"this is a book i will not forget it is a story of man's best friend and love between siblings and family in the face of poverty and a natural disaster hurricane katrina during the twelve days that the novel takes place i became invested in the batiste's as they bonded and showed the true love and dedication of family the writing of jesmyn ward is beautiful she writes here there are swimming holes that are fat puddles and some the size of swimming pools fed by skinny clear creeks but the earth makes the holes black and the trees make them as filthy with leaves as a dog is with fleas there are clusters of magnolias that are so tall and green and glossy they are impossible to climb and the air around them always smells like peaches her use of simile enabled me to fully envision the pit bois sauvage mississippi and each character including china skeetah's dog","1031":"a young girl during hurricane katrina finds out she is pregnant touching coming of age dark","1032":"family in la who lives thru katrina","1033":" i didn't think i'd be gripped but i was i ripped along through the language the images and the metaphors some of the reading hurt it was painful to watch esch's pain her brothers' pain her father's pain but i was buoyed and cheered her strength and courage ward builds a beautiful picture of a family that is often ignored overlooked assumed is failing it is limping but whose isn't the pacing is interesting the weakest part for me is the unfolding of the pregnancy i've been pregnant so its 0 50 in a few days didn't quite work for me","1034":" what an amazing read too bad there's only five stars to give it took a chapter or so to get into the reader's voice but once i did ward wove such a vivid story about this motherless family you feel the ways they fill her loss but still look out for each other all against the backdrop of hurricane katrina narrators like esch are rare even rarer is this glimpse into small town mississippi the many things that make it beautiful despite poverty of course ward won the national book award for this best thing i've read in a really really long time","1035":"a beautiful heartwrenching novel it's completely unflinching in its portrayal of rural southern poverty and a very broken home but also somehow incredibly life affirming highly recommended","1036":" i would love to discuss this book with someone clearly there are remarkable characters living lives in the mississippi bayous that few of us would wish to emulate a drunken father a much loved but now deceased mother three brothers and a sister preparing for hurricane katrina one brother loves is pit bull china but uses her to win dogfights the sister who says the only 2 things that came easily to her are swimming and sex is pregnant and the baby's father really isn't interested in her and she has no idea how o tell her family the oldest brother is a fine basketball player hoping to get a scholarship to go to college through basketball but loses the opportunity when is family gets into a brawl and the exhibition game and when he punches the window out of white neighbors home hoping to find enough food for the family to see them through the hurricane the story i think is deeper than this about motherhood and race and definitely worth reading","1037":"really beautiful writing with a perspective that is not always heard worth reading","1038":"stunning in all senses of the word","1039":"very moving book about a family in the south in the year prior to katrina i learned a lot from this book and it opened my eyes to the day to day struggles of so many kids who are practically raising themselves in extreme poverty the writing was outstanding poetic sad painful at times but it made me feel more empathy","1040":"2011 national book award nominee \"salvage the bones\" by jesmyn ward has turned out to be the book of the 2012 year for me as one reviewer on goodreads says \" i feel my insides crumbling and my heart breaking and my memories reeling and i know i have read something extraordinary jesmyn ward just gives us words but words like none other has written \" please take a moment to listen to author jesmyn ward read an excerpt from this wonderfully written work her craft is has moved her to a literary level not commonly available in these days and times the main character is 14 years old and the setting is in mississippi during the time of katrina i would recommend this not only as suggested reading for our advance readers faculty and staff i would push the envelope a foot more and recommend this to be added to required reading for high school jesmyn ward reads from her novel salvage the bones at the 2011 nba finalists reading from national book foundation on vimeo","1041":"a well told though down beat story of a family that struggles to survive not only poverty but hurricane katrina through her writing and her voices i could see the people and the place esch the 15 year old female narrator is an interesting layered personality who intrigued me once i started this was a difficult book to put down","1042":"beautiful prose at times the symbolism can be heavy handed","1043":"normally i would not read this book my fifth grade teacher taught me that the first sentence of the book tells all if you don't like the first sentence you won't like the book needless to say i didn't like the first sentence however this was required reading for school it turned into a great story i can't say much without giving anything away but it is a story of growth a story of the next generation like some of the praise on the inside cover said it is the first great novel about katrina and it is needed literature although i didn't like the first sentence the last sentence was probably the best i've ever read summing up the entire book beautifully in 8 words just as extremely loud and incredibly close delved into 9 11 this delves into katrina and i would recommend any and all survivors to read it","1044":"started this book friday morning and could not get into it read the lost wife instead will try again after carry the one i will admit that i did enjoy the writing style patience","1045":"coming of age story in gulf coast mississippi describing the events of 12 days as hurricane katrina hits land wonderful first person account written by 14 year old esch describing her family life in abject poverty her three brothers and a white pitbull exhilarating and disturbing as any great novel should be national book award winner for fiction 2011","1046":"cold budweiser1 chill a can of budweiser in the refrigerator 2 remove can and wait until condensation forms on the sides of the can 3 serve in the can","1047":"this is a difficult book to review because i'm unsure if what i disliked was less a shortcoming of the book and more my own personal baggage its true really good fiction can transport you to a different place and time unfortunately in this book it was not a place or time that i wanted to go even the writer's really artful way with prose was not enough to overcome the sense of dread i felt every time i picked up this book i guess i just couldn't overcome the pervasive unrelenting melancholy and i admit this is probably more a reflection of my limitations than that of the book but there you have it","1048":"this was a shocking honest read about a brutal set of circumstances conversations events the language and events actually made me cringe sometimes they were not comfortable warm or fuzzy in the end this book was about family sticking together whatever that family looks like","1049":"some of the writing is beautiful and there's some real love and affection among members of this poor louisiana family it just didn't quite hold together for me","1050":" it's a good effort i didn't love it i don't find it as poetic or the words as flowery as others seem to plenty of description metaphor after metaphor but it's all stuff you feel like you've read before like it's not really her work weirdly i found it both compelling and repelling at varying moments spoilers set in a small mississippi bayou town immediately before during and immediately after hurricane katrina a 14 year old girl named esch deals with a newly discovered pregnancy while trying to help her dad and brothers prepare for a storm you don't actually find out it's katrina until deep into the book it's a lot of day to day and therefore pretty slow to get started especially if you're not entranced by the writing there's also the fact that esch's brother skeetah has a pit bull named china so get ready for lots and lots of dog fighting action i think it's important that we know he makes the dog fight because it's part of their relationship more on that but i don't think bloody descriptions of every fight are necessary unlike most people on here i didn't skip them but honestly you're not missing out on much if you do it's more for shock value than to drive the story though china winning that last fight is important to her relationship with skeetah which is probably the most interesting part of the book skeetah loves that he can get money from fighting and from selling her puppies but he also clearly loves the dog a great deal they have a connection and it's one of the more real relationships in the book oddly enough right down to their heartbreaking end like i said it's simultaneously compelling and repelling so there were moments when i was clutching the book taking in every word despite being horrified by some of what i was reading but then a third layer the bored to tears layer it's the kind of book that you really have to care about finishing to make it all the way through but it's hard to become drawn to any of the characters until it's too late","1051":" i felt an affinity with this book right away because i grew up in the area that serves as a setting for the story it's very poignant the way it's poised right on the cusp between what the gulf coast was like before hurricane katrina and after it has a timeless quality to it and could have taken place in a number of different eras to the point where i found it jarring to hear references to present day things katrina car stereos with woofers etc i thought the writing was a little rocky in places so many similes in the beginning of the book i found myself waiting in anticipation for the next one some were good some were a bit cringe worthy i would describe this as a novel full of characters who 'don't know any better ' esch has promiscuous sex beginning at a very young age because she finds it's easier than saying no her brother purportedly loves his dog but also uses her in dogfights he's also using the dog to breed puppies that he can't afford to care for properly without stealing supplies from neighbors the dad isn't living up to his responsibilities as a single father to say the least the kids break into their neighbor's house right before the storm to steal food but then don't even go inside they just walk away leaving the plywood and the window busted out and leaving the house exposed to the storm they're a bunch of jerks what they all really need is a smack in the back of the head but there's no one around to do it the dogfighting alone had me thinking i didn't care if these characters got washed out to sea by katrina so the author created alot of fiery conflict in me it reminded me of the way jane austen makes me hate emma as the story unfolded though i decided to give them the benefit of the doubt maybe if their mom hadn't died they would have turned out to be decent people perhaps she was the glue that held them all together by the end i was pulling for them in that way you pull for any human being in danger of being squashed like a bug by mother nature i have my fingers crossed they'll go on to be better people non dog owning better people","1052":"this was wonderful sad and thought provoking novel that i really enjoyed","1053":"one of the grittiest books i've ever read not to say i didn't enjoy it because i did it stirred some heavy emotions in me and the ending was great the concept of this book to me was amazing seen from the point of view of a storm before it happened instead of after as i've sometimes seen was very refreshing i enjoyed this","1054":"story is raw but very good","1055":"for the longest time while reading this book i thought i didn't like it the dogfighting was hard to relate to in any way but about halfway through i really began to appreciate the poetic metaphors and the vivid descriptive language that really put me in esch's world by the time it ended i was sad to leave the characters because this book really was more of a character study then a book about a storm i think they will stay with me","1056":"ward's writing is beautiful she has a gift for metaphor and simile you don't see everyday the problem i had with this book is that i kept waiting for something to happen and nothing ever did a book with one of our country's greatest social and political failures threaded throughout and nothing actually happens it was a disappointment","1057":" gorgeous language used to depict the horrific circumstances of a family living in abject poverty in mississippi just before hurricane katrina hits the buildup of tension is well done but its release with katrina's landfall of course is a little predictable the action near the end is hard to follow which is odd because there are early action scenes that are vivid and coherent the story is unsentimental though it pulls more punches than i would like such poetic devastation should come with higher stakes","1058":"there is something about salvage the bones that is beautiful and graceful almost lyrical but there is something savage and desperate in the pages as well there is a sadness here and tentative beauty that any reader of fiction could embrace salvage the bones is set in the southern mississippi town of bois sauvage literally savage wood in french on the eve of hurricane katrina esch is pregnant scared and in love she scrapes out an existence with her father and three brothers who swirl around her like planets flying around the sun i found myself embroiled in these characters invested in their survival the things that remain unspoken between them often highlight their loyalty and love for one another i wanted to crawl into the pages and hug little junior the youngest brother whose birth lead to the death of their mother junior is sweet and innocent and his suffering floats through the pages a by product of their poverty each character has been richly developed each is an individual with complexity i could almost expect to find this family still living on the gulf coast if i were to travel south and look for them i almost didn't read this book but i'm glad i did the truth is some things are hard to read i hope that you pick up salvage the bones and enjoy it thoroughly a good book doesn't always leave you feeling happy but in my mind when one leaves you feeling is when you know you've really found a treasure","1059":"difficult subjects handled beautifully could not put it down","1060":"gripping loved the voice","1061":" i loved this one a gorgeously written glimpse into a slice of america that many are unaware of with fantastic wit and of course i was mesmerized by the clarity and understanding in describing skeeta's relationship with his beloved pit china i have to admit there were a quite a few points where i had to stop and process how well miss ward is able to put into words the incredible bond between a dog and their human the dog fighting bit was a tough pill to swallow but it fit in with this book's unapologetic portrayal of this demographic highly recommended","1062":" next in line and the only female at age fourteen she finds herself pregnant junior the youngest is about seven years o salvage the bones by jesmyn ward february 26 2012 the batiste family is ridden with poverty and live in the backwoods of mississippi

together to save their family","1063":"this is one of the most intense raw beautiful books i have ever read the characters are so real and the way it is written is captivating i highly recommend this book","1064":"beautifully written book i know all the characters particularly esch and skeeter will be kicking around in my head long after i set this one down","1065":"really intense look at a family before and during katrina","1066":"based on the reviews i figured this for another hurricane katrina novel the events in the book do take place before during u0026amp after katrina but it's definitely not about katrina the main character is a female african american teen living in rural bayou louisiana with little future before her she's had sex with most of the local boys seemingly because they expected it of her but is in love teen crush obsession with one particular guy a couple years older who really doesn't give a darn about her the story is told from her point of view but her brothers u0026amp father are also key characters in the book she escapes through books especially the kind of books assigned in high school honors programs her favorite character is medea as i was reading this i kept being struck by two feelings 1 the ebonics the author uses in telling the girl's story doesn't ring true for someone as literate as her even if she does live in rural black louisiana and 2 this book made me feel anxious almost from start to finish you know bad things are going to happen and that creepy feeling persists throughout the book","1067":" ugh rarely has a book so utterly failed to not live up to its description as the twelve days that make up the novel's framework yield to their dramatic conclusion this unforgettable family motherless children sacrificing for one another as they can protecting and nurturing where love is scarce pulls itself up to face another day a big hearted novel about familial love and community against all odds and a wrenching look at the lonesome brutal and restrictive realities of rural poverty salvage the bones is muscled with poetry revelatory and real i almost gave this 3 stars because it actually improved slightly at the end but i could not i seriously do not understand how this won the national book award it was full of overwrought and tortured prose and pages and pages of tedious nothing an entire page of dogs barking multiple descriptions of the same characters over and over and none of them actually descriptive on a physical or emotional level plus the dogs god the immense amount of dull details about the dogs and the dog fighting and it was just wretched the worst thing is there were some great wonderful characters randall big henry i loved them but they were mostly ignored the dad's story and shift between who he was when his wife as alive and his fall and sorrow at his death and how that was transitioning now that was a story worth telling the story in the description 'a big hearted novel about familial love and community against all odds' also would have been a story worth telling but it wasn't told in the very end for about 10 pages there was a window into that story but that was it instead we had hundreds of pages of bad metaphors overwrought prose and descriptions of dogs and dog fighting yay only my annoyance at what terrible sentence would emerge next made me force myself through to the few decent pages at the end","1068":"great writing a tough story to read in that i felt for the main character all the characters really but worth it","1069":"this book is beautifully written however it is dripping with despair there is no glimmer of hope at all i think it's an important book dealing with poverty teenage pregnancy and dog fighting however it's not for everyone as it delivers a huge wallop of sadness","1070":"i am applauding the author jesmyn ward for not only getting the descriptions of the deep south correct but also the genuine language this is a great book","1071":" i find myself at a loss for words to describe my feelings about this book it's well written and close to masterful at evoking an atmosphere however it's also so bleak throughout most of the book that i can't truly say i enjoyed reading salvage the bones this book touches on several issues that enrage me neglect of children sexual double standards animal abuse and i'm fairly sure it's not a book i will choose to revisit in some ways it reminds me of knockemstiff by donald pollock another book i was torn on definitely going to read something light now","1072":"i am not one to write a lengthy review i usually briefly state whether i like a book or not salvage the bones deserves so much more i held on to each word even re reading parts to take it all in throughout the book i felt an intense weight of sadness my heart ached but i could not get enough this is one of the most beautifully written books i have ever had the pleasure of reading","1073":"it was like reading a story written by someone who had followed all the rules they teach you in high school there were no rewards for slogging through the slow parts just more uptight writing","1074":"salvage the bones brings poetry to the ugliness of poverty neglect catastrophic mother nature and dog fighting beautiful writing though if you are not a huge fan of figurative language you may find the gorgeous and frequent analogies tiring but i loved them","1075":"this is a well written bleak and disturbing story i admit i read just enough of the dog fighting scenes for the jest of the story because i found it difficult to read those parts however i will say i was surprised to read about the love between the dog breeder fighter and the dog at times i did not like this book but i am glad i finished the story","1076":"this was a very moving book about the real life effects of family poverty and hurricane katrina","1077":"struggled through this book it's well written but too bleak violent and abusive to me the hurricane actually felt like a respite from their desperate lives","1078":" this powerful book is set in the woods of mississippi in the days leading up to hurricane katrina it's a gritty story about a family of 3 boys and their father told by the 14 year old sister esch who discovers she is pregnant she is a lover of mythology especially the story of medea and jason and her ideas of medea and jason surround her unrequited love for manny her sun who made her pregnant but rejected her esch's brother skeetah loves his pitbull china who has just given birth to puppies which he hopes to sell to pay for the older brother's basketball camp there is the youngest junior whose birth was their mother's death and who has been cared for by all of them their lives are filled with grief from the death of their mother and their father's most important possession seems to be photos of her west's writing is earthy and filled with metaphore as well as love and respect for this family living in desperate poverty","1079":"there were too many metaphors and similes thrown around that they stuck out like black eyes and took away from her obvious talent i blame the editor also disliked the detailed scenes during esche's de flowering and the dog fight did not feel the value add","1080":" four siblings are left to fend for themselves after their mother dies in childbirth and their father becomes an absent alcoholic 14 year old esch is a strong girl capable of keeping up with her brothers and their friends but when she ends up pregnant with no one to confide in her secret slowly torments her her oldest brother skeetah becomes obsessed with his pitbull and her new pups and will do anything to help ensure their survival high school student junior is set on winning a basketball scholarship and escaping his homelife while young junior vies for attention and tries his best to fit in with the older kids life in hard in this coastal mississippi town there is little money education or parental love and when hurricane katrina closes in on this family they must use what they have to survive i liked this book because it was so dark and bleak and the voice of pregnant esch was traumatized and honest however there was lots of dog fighting scenes that i could do without and some of the prose seemed to ramble that's probably why it won a literary award","1081":"a very powerful look at the bonds of family and the harsh realities of what it is to be poor and in the countryside salvage the bones is laden with incredible metaphorical language and while the inclusion of the story of medea that the book so frequently visits can feel laboured it eventually pays off in the incredible finale","1082":"salvage the bones is everything you want need a book to be thank you jesmyn ward thank you very much","1083":"beautifully written book","1084":"this was not an easy story to read but still a worthwhile read the story is pretty raw and i had to skip over the chapter that described in too much detail for me any way the pitbull fight because it was just too painful for me to read","1085":"have you read this elaine","1086":" what a great story told by a great storyteller having just witnessed hurricane sandy destroy so many lives and living a few days inconvenienced without power this book was read at the perfect time i had to keep reminding myself that it took place in the 21st century because the life of this family truly sounded as if it took place in the 1950's or 1960's to have nothing to begin with and than lose what little they had was truly devastating yet the love within the family is a bond that cannot be broken by the terrible hurricane named katrina","1087":"best book i've read this year amazing characters amazing language","1088":"outstanding book if difficult subject matter","1089":"this was almost a dnf for me because of the dog abuse","1090":" brutal and beautifulfrom the heart disarming and emotionalthis is a slow build over a few days and these are the days leading up to hurricane katrina an already devastated family coping with death and poverty is about to face the wrath karina and deal with further loss the family is poor black motherless and living in a mississippi bayou it could all be so melodramatic but it's not it could all be so depressing but it's not there is wonderful emotional depth there is a lot of brutality and neglect but the overall story is of family loyalty and support it is told through the eyes of a young girl old before her time and spoken with a clear and haunting voice this is one of those novels you want to describe with ___ and ___ descriptions lyrical and savage poetic and raw poverty and resilience uncompromising and confronting unsettling and uplifting powerful and real and i could go on all these and more i may have to come back and change this from recommended to favourite i have a feeling that it is one that will haunt","1091":" first a confession i skimmed the last half of the book i couldn't help myself one of the main story lines revolves around a new mother pit bull named china and her puppies who basically fight for their lives throughout the entire book anything in which a dog is in trouble brings my anxiety level up to begin with this book sent my anxiety levels through the roof with all of the dog mishandling that happened between administering meds without a vet to dog fighting to animals trying to survive during katrina i couldn't just sit back relax and read this book i had to skim to know exactly what was going to happen as quickly as possible while i liked the characters and thought it was well written and sadly most likely realistic it really just made me want to pet my golden retriever and move on to something different","1092":"i kept waiting for the hurricane to come through thinking that then it would all be worthwhile i was wrong","1093":"hmmm 3 stars or 4 i wish goodreads allowed half stars this book was an engrossing story of a family preparing for hurricane katrina while dealing with poverty loss alcoholism and the unexpected pregnancy of its teenage protagonist please don't view that as a spoiler her pregnancy is mentioned on the book's back cover when the book is good it's amazingly good i could hardly put it down and i really connected with the family their history their closeness and the way the neighbors helped one another however there were long stretches of the book which dealt with the birth of puppies and neighborhood dog fights among trained pit bulls which were far less enjoyable i just wanted the story to advance quicker and spend more time on the story lines that i cared about","1094":"this book was recommended to me by a friend who is also an avid reader i have not been let down by any of her recommendations yet and that includes this book i feel this was a 3 5 rating but alas there are no 5 marks on goodreads i would've given it higher marks but there were a few sections i felt the prose got long and i skimmed them instead of actually reading them do not read this book if you are looking for a quick light feel good read this book is steeped in gloom doom and the complete realness that can be the harsh reality of growing up in poverty salvage the bones follows esch a teenage girl who finds out she is pregnant only a few days before hurricane katrina hits lousiana where she lives with her father and three brothers and all of the boy's friends i felt every chapter was harder to read due to the brutality and harshness that the characters lived through part of what was really hard for me to read was the dogfighting i am an anti dogfighting advocate and there were parts of the book i could only skim because i didn't want to read about the dogs being ripped apart on the flip side the relationship between esh's brother skeetah and his pit bull china is just beautiful probably one of the better relationships storylines of the whole book and also the open ended question at the end of the book i thought most of the book was going to be the family living through katrina and the days after but the majority of the book takes place the days preceeding katrina with the last chapter dealing with the hurricane and the hours after if you need a definitive wrapped up ending this book is not for you if you want a bit of a deeper read where you feel steeped in this family's lives and ways of being then this is your book","1095":"beautifully written and suprisingly universal one of the only qualms i had was with the ending it wasn't a bad ending i just didn't think it was time for the story to end yet","1096":"this is a raw slice of life novel told by a poor and pregnant 14 year old girl in rural south mississippi and taking place just before and after hurricane katrina the hurricane is not the focus of the story it is just a character like some of the others the development of the central character esch is the main focus and the author pulls this off wonderfully salvage the bones is one of those books you just can't put down","1097":"this author took on hurricane katrina and won","1098":"beautiful writing and character development you can feel the physical storm and their personal storms building throughout the book","1099":"excellent hard to put down until near the end when i had to slow down so as not to be done and also because it was such a rich story","1100":" i received this book as a goodreads first reads giveaway written in first person point of view 'salvage the bones' is not a good book there were several reasons i was turned off to the book one in particularly unfortunately was right in the first chapter because of this inaccurate moment i found myself constantly judging the book for truth and veracity in other scenes let me explain the author portrays the birthing of dogs incorrectly in the first chapter it shows she either didn't do her research or she didn't write clearly enough the fact is that after each puppy and with each puppy there is an afterbirth and a placenta instead the author writes how all the puppies afterbirths come at the very end in one big purge not right the author shows how she doesn't know about dog births and didn't do her research so this made me frustrated i don't like it when i invest time into a book and find out that the author is getting published and they haven't even done thorough research they just assume and this is why i give this book two stars there were other awkward sentences that i had to re read to make sure i read them correctly on page 172 there is a scene where kilo is chewing at another dog's leg in a pit bull fight it is china's leg but wrongfully the character changes to rico pulling at the dog's leg when it should read kilo on page 195 it reads into me room are these irish characters all of a sudden that doesn't make sense another moment is when the characters are searching for food and gathering eggs and supplies before katrina hits and they find that china has killed one of their chickens they just leave the chicken there with china and walk around her why wouldn't they have grabbed it from the dog and cooked it for meat also they collect eggs that have been from my reading sitting out in the yard in the hot sun and weather for days they never tested them for rottenness there had to have been at least one they couldn't eat little things like these that just didn't add up or make the book that interesting for me plus the greek mythology for intellectuals and the connection to the characters didn't correspond for me i didn't make any of the parallels that the author represented for the reader they were strange also since the perspective is from a poor uneducated female teenager her word choices didn't match ward the author has her saying low dirty uneducated phrases and the next she's using the word 'detritus' doesn't match plus the author uses the word detritus way too many times ugggh i didn't like this book and thankfully i got it for free through the goodreads first reads giveaway section thank you giveaways it is always my pleasure to review unrevised editions and to submit my honest and unadulterated opinions","1101":" i really wanted to like this book ward has a beautiful way with words i can't recall an author who has so successfully crammed in as many metaphors as she has with her text never bordering on trite and she paints a vivid louisiana setting and memorable cast of characters ward perfectly captures the voice of a pregnant teenager who is simultaneously fragile and strong yet the beautiful prose does not come close to saving the plodding bare bones plot which is interminably stretched over the week leading up the arrival of hurricane katrina i found myself skimming at the end and not caring which is a shame given the set up perhaps ward's novel would have been more successful as a short story","1102":" at times during this read i found myself thinking okay get on with it but after a few dogfights which i am morally opposed to so that certainly didn't help the case i settled into this narrative very easily the language is beautifully poetic the author gets into the head of the protagonist so keenly that i was surprised it wasn't an autobiography and you can add this to the growing number of books that makes me cry openly on the 2 train to work stunning work sad as hell but raw and real","1103":"so why did this book win the national book award the second to last chapter a taught gripping play by play of a desperate escape from a flooded house during katrina made all the more powerful by the knowledge that versions played out all along the gulf coast simultaneously on that day i think that it's worth it to pick up the book and read that section in the bookstore even if you don't know the characters you will still be riveted by the action and moved by their plight as a faulkner junkie i found many more parts of this book to like ward carefully describes the setting of her family drama and you know each bit of junk on their rundown estate the way you know each corner of the compson's farm in the sound and the fury the relationships between the siblings and their father seem real at times loving at times confused and unavoidably abused given the circumstances however noticeable cracks run throughout the work there's a forced comparison of esch the narrator to medea which seems to obvious a literary device the children swing back in forth from naivety to hard edged maturity with too much ease and ward does not do enough to prove the authenticity of these characters she can flawlessly paint narratives of dogfights hurricanes and teenage sex but she does bring the same authority to her portraits of everyday life in that context the melodrama of some moments shakes the novel's necessary foundation in reality","1104":"this story of a damaged family trying to survive in rural mississippi is unrelentingly sad four motherless children with a dysfunctional father eke out an existence trying to find love food and hope one tries to find love and future through his fighting pit bull another through basketball and a third with pregnancy it all comes to a head during katrina well written you can taste the heat dust and hunger and incredibly depressing","1105":"the voice of a young girl age 15 in charge of caring for her alcoholic father and siblings because of the early death of her mother she struggles to understand make sense of and prepare for hurricane katerina and deal with her own pregnancy she is intertwined with her brother's pit dog having a litter and losing some her own understanding of life is limited yet a part of her knows life is different in some places she brings out controversial subjects of racism alcoholic ism teen pregnancy and more at times the character's voice seemed a bit mature for this little one alas her life had been difficult minor editorial issues but a good read a fiction writing based on actual events of katrina","1106":"amazing book tensions builds up as you see the family's state rapidly spiraling towards disaster with constant references to the loss of their mother and how things changed afterwards the approach of the hurricane katrina only makes things more urgent and yet the author shares a little compassion for her characters and her reader at the end","1107":"ms ward's writing captures the reader very early on somewhere near the top of page 1 and keeps his attention right up to the end this is one of those books you're reluctant to put down until it's finished and then you wish it would go on and on and on","1108":"it was in many ways deeply uncomfortable to read but it made a tremendous impact i felt the heat the looming hurricane could see the scrappy woods and got a view of serious country poor","1109":"salvage the bones didn't resonate with me but i still found it to be an interesting story because of the hurricane katrina element","1110":" i don't like to read about animals suffering i think i read this so fast so i could find those sections and then skip them but even though the book jacket discusses puppies starving it isn't too bad there was a dog fighting scene i had to skip though aside from the animals this is the story of a poor rural coastal family and their daily struggles in the couple of weeks preceding hurricane katrina in 2005 and the immediate aftermath the descriptions of the pit really allows me to visualize their surroundings and attach myself that much more to the characters excellent read","1111":"this book is about a very poor family in mississippi on the eve of hurricane katrina each of the 13 chapters covers one day during this time at times it is hard to read because they live in such poverty and with so many difficulties but i grew to love the characters and the way they took care of each other once the hurricane hit i could not put it down i also loved the ending the characters including china the dog are sticking with me","1112":"this was a rough and raw read i couldn't put it down because i needed to know how it turned out for this family seering and painful but the power of family pulls this story together","1113":" started slow and with weird metaphors but i really felt a liking for this forsaken family after the mom passes the family still adheres but it's kind of like struggling swimmers clinging to each other to stay above water the narrator is sympathetic as are her siblings and her yearning to be loved by a non caring boy rings true as does the aftermath of katrina when the whole town looks around to see what still remains the calm at the end of the storm is really more about the shock or surviving it and the devastation and disbelief the end is satisfying as the whole family and friends are waiting for the next bad thing kudos to china i hope they find her this was a good read","1114":" this is a hard book but the language makes esch's life beautiful savage but worth fighting for for me it's a glimpse into a culture that i could never imagine real hunger exists here despite many claiming poor people live fat and lazy on taxpayer dollars it's a tribute to ward that she can beautifully humanize one who i didn't think capable of humanity a boy who raises pit bulls to fight it's so frustrating that even now people are mired in generational poverty ward raises a voice for them","1115":"absolutely almost tragically perfect beautiful characters beautiful prose stunning","1116":" there is a moment in the beginning of this book when i want to put the book down the birthing of puppies there is a point in the middle when i breathe raggedly as though from a gut punch ward's description of the dog fight and there are long stretches at the end of this book when i cannot take my horrified eyes from the page when i feel my insides crumbling and my heart breaking and my memories reeling and i know i have read something extraordinary jesmyn ward just gives us words but words like none other has written she has put them together in a way that creates a world apart but with all the love pain pathos hope fear and loyalty that we will recognize from the finest examples of our literature when she describes the color and texture of a man's arm or the watery pressure of a new pregnancy or the terror of discovering rising water through the floorboards of one's living room jesmyn ward has caught that thing as though it were alive when i try to say in a few words the story of this novel everything i write is inadequate a poor family lives outside a town but near the coast in mississippi our narrator is fourteen with hair that frames her head \"like a pillow \" she has three brothers a father that drinks too much and several paramours but one in particular katrina hits and we experience the storm this is classic literature and difficult as it may seem at first wholly appropriate for teens it is a little like saying a long way gone memoirs of a boy soldier by ishmael beah is a teen title that book about a teen forced into soldiering in sierra leone is similarly hard hitting it might be better for our teens to know than not to know they are exposed to so much anyway a little reality might improve their outlook i wouldn't require this novel but i would add it to reading lists teens can do much worse than experience the exquisite sense of language in this wholly original work","1117":"painful to read had to do it in bits and pieces the story line is solid the telling of it less so","1118":"beautifully written page turner","1119":" a heartbreaking book about a poor black family in louisiana in the days prior to hurricane katrina told from the perspective of esch a pregnant motherless 15 year old girl in fact the only girl in a family that includes a alcoholic father and an older brother obsessed with his pit bull and her new puppies i never thought i could read a book that includes dog fighting but as brutal as that is it is oddly critical to this story which literally reads as a greek tragedy a difficult yet riveting read","1120":" this was an interesting book to read i have been completely unaware of this part of the society and i felt like ward described it really well i was surprised by the frankness of the tone of the narrator especially in regards to sex but once again this is not a demographic that i can claim to be familiar with i was a little disappointed at the ending i know that we would all be upset to find that china or any of her puppies had died but i didn't like leaving skeet sitting in front of a bonfire waiting for the dog i wanted ward to take it a little further rather than petering out and ending it a little abruptly i loved how big henry stepped up in the end and i would have loved to see manny get pummeled in a non figurative way i guess all these opinions and feelings mean that ward did a great job and that i was emotionally moved by this book i received this book for free from goodreads first reads","1121":"if i could i'd give this book a 3 5 this is an extremely well written book but the content is just heartbreaking","1122":"amazing language imagery weaving of story lines","1123":" i couldn't put this one down a family in mississippi lives through katrina most of the story takes place before the storm the family lives in poverty that i've never known existed they are eating squirrels in their own way each person is dysfunctional the father is an alcoholic the teenage daughter is pregnant and the father doesn't give a crap about her but they always stick up for each other and they weather the storm admirably the writing style flows so well i felt like i could feel smell see and hear everything","1124":"beautiful fascinating and also hard to read because you become so attached to the characters and they're so much danger looming on the outskirts you hold your breath waiting for the difficulties that you know lie right around the corner to besiege them and you cross your fingers hoping they'll be okay","1125":"lordy lordy lordy i did not want to read this book i wasn't interested in a book about hurricane katrina how very wrong i was who can beat an image like this his hand wrapped up to the wrist in gauze and tape so that it looked like a webworm moth neat wound tight in a pecan tree a yarn of larvae eating at the ripe green leaves beneath to burst forth in black winged fury in the throat closing heat of fall read this lyrical book i mean it","1126":"some very vivid descriptions and imagery","1127":"review to come","1128":" this was a hard book for me to read each page is weighty and sometimes too raw for me and i almost gave up on it with each page my gut tightened with anticipation of the ending this is the story of a family who lives on the outskirts of a fictionalized small town called bois sauvage can't help to wonder if the name of the town is a play with the sound boys savage esch the female sibling of skeeter randall and junior narrates the story their mother died giving birth to junior but is given a presence in the story via esch's memories the story is very testosterone driven and esch gives the reader a great visual of the physical ness of her brothers and moves with ease in connecting it to other aspects of her memories and surroundings and events esch and skeeter remind me of the sankofa symbol with two crocodile heads who share one stomach esch's observations and need to be loved seen for who she is gives off female energy while skeeter's gruff heroic deeds provide the male counterpart both of them are unflinching randall and big turner carry the nobility that can be found in the story and little junior seems to be the trickster of the tale the main but not over riding two backdrops to the story is it begins 12 days before hurricane katrina and esch's comparison to the greek story of madea and the argonauts which she is reading the father is an side fixture in the story and almost seems to have no body but voice only the most dominate physical presence is when he looses his fingers in an accident and is that not signifying on the loss of presence he shows little attention to the children as he goes about his fixation on preparing for katrina and his beer drinking ward uses the physical landscape in a way that makes me feel the humidity and heat of mississippi in august the swamp like conditions surrounding their home the thick carpeted forest floor the red dirt that gets into everything the shallow pit of water that surrounds their land seems so thick and murky that when they are swimming in i could almost choke the book is written tight in that every page carries the heaviness of their lives but her matter of fact tone suggest the family is just living life as they know it","1129":" from amazon a hurricane is building over the gulf of mexico threatening the coastal town of bois sauvage mississippi and esch's father is growing concerned a hard drinker largely absent he doesn't show concern for much else esch and her three brothers are stocking food but there isn't much to save lately esch can't keep down what food she gets she's fourteen and pregnant her brother skeetah is sneaking scraps for his prized pitbull's new litter dying one by one in the dirt meanwhile brothers randall and junior try to stake their claim in a family long on child's play and short on parenting i was very impressed by this book while many of the subjects in the book range from sad to very disturbing the book is written with great compassion and feeling the characters are incredibly portrayed and i found myself 'accepting' some topics that i would normally find horrifying just because the book is so well done the only complaint i had was that there were several times when i would be absolutely sucked into the story and would hit a sentence with odd phrasing or a word that just seemed wrong which would yank me out of the story as i reread the sentence over and over again trying to make sense of it despite this i definitely recommend the book with the warning that it does deal with a number of topics that are best handled by a mature reader","1130":"i admit to not necessarily giving this beautifully written novel the full focus that it probably deserves due to too many other reading requirements fresh off of taking the top prize for fiction at the national book awards a surprise winner the story centers upon a struggling family and community on mississippi's gulf coast as hurricane katrina ominously coalesces offshore the novel is not a hurricane survival tale in fact the storm doesn't arrive until the closing 40 pages instead this is a visceral narrative of a steely pregnant teenager her grieving recently widowed father her two remarkably well drawn brothers and a small cast of clearly delineated young male neighbors maybe one of the most complete characters is actually her brother's trained fighting dog breed not clear named china several of the human characters' lives spin around her an animal we don't really want to get close to but whose strength and fierce perseverance we can't help but be drawn to salvage the bones possesses one of a kind voice a memorable protagonist images that will linger and a set of closing pages that make you thankful to be a reader","1131":"what a beautiful book an insightful look into the lives of the poor deep south during an impending natural disaster of unprecedented size the relationships between each of the characters is exquisitely defined i felt like i was present during the entire story perhaps watching from a tree odd no there were scenes that i dreaded reading and were hard to stomach but written in such beautiful prose that i could not give up this is a story about loss and the beginnings of regeneration","1132":"a bleak story about the days leading up to hurricane katrina family of four siblings must deal with an alcoholic father and their own struggles losing their mother poverty teen pregnancy the dedication of the family to stick together during difficult times is what makes this story unforgettable","1133":"a little hard for me to get into at first well written clever and touching relationships in this portrayal of a poor motherless family facing life and hurricane katrina difficult to read about the pit bull fights that were integral in the story","1134":"overrated by the numbers weighted down with annoying metaphors to sound authentic","1135":"i found this book as a roller coaster of emotions just when i didn't think i could read another sad thing about this family wade would write something so poetic and beautiful that i would be filled with hope for them and thus could not put the book down however what little inkling of hope that was given was quickly swept away and the reader was once again left to pain for the struggling family","1136":"i just couldn't get in to this one it's about a family before and after katrina and alot about their dog giving birth to puppies maybe i missed a metaphor somewhere but it just didn't flow for me","1137":"this book tugs at your heart from the first page to the last the reader is invited to share a family's abject poverty and deep unwavering love for one another","1138":"raw and terribly beautiful","1139":"my sister got this for christmas and i picked it up that was it finished it in two days in the spare minutes i could find read it once for the story ordered it on kindle and will read it again for the writing it was marvelous","1140":"this review has been hidden because it contains spoilers to view it click here i did like this book but i found myself asking a lot of questions that i felt should have been answered throughout the entire story we wonder if all of the boys know about manny and esch it seems obvious that they would but it's never stated until it's blurted out towards the every end of the novel i also felt that it took esch way too long to stand up to manny i know that it's certainly easier said than done but esch was certainly one of the weakest female characters i have ever come a i did like this book but i found myself asking a lot of questions that i felt should have been answered throughout the entire story we wonder if all of the boys know about manny and esch it seems obvious that they would but it's never stated until it's blurted out towards the every end of the novel i also felt that it took esch way too long to stand up to manny i know that it's certainly easier said than done but esch was certainly one of the weakest female characters i have ever come across when it comes to men she was so strong in everything else i couldn't understand how she could put up with manny young love stupidity who knows the dog fighting scenes were definitely hard to swallow i didn't like reading them and i appreciated that the author was able to make these scenes real enough that i wanted to put the book down overall i really liked the story and this is the first tale that i have read that takes places during katrina but i can't give it more than three stars due to my annoyances with esch and lack of information about some things my favorite character was by far junior and i wish there had been a little more about him more","1141":"the writing was amazing but the whole thing was just brutal it was one of those books that makes you feel like you've been beat up every time you put it down if you're a pet lover some of the scenes with dogs fighting etc were just sickening again she's a great writer but i couldn't enjoy the darkness of the whole thing","1142":"really interesting strange set in a rural place and makes on realize what a great life one has","1143":"wow this was a good book not an easy read by any means but a great book i found i had to skim over some of the parts about dog fighting which i am vehemently against but i understand that it's part of the culture just be warned though if you are an animal lover you might have to gloss over those pages the book held my interest until the very end please have kleenex ready","1144":"this is a wonderful book that i would recommend to anyone looking for an enjoyable read i finished it in four days the characters setting and timeline of events are fantastic i especially loved skeetah's relationship with china his pup but you know me i'm a sucker for dogs anyways if anyone reads this i'd love to hear your thoughts","1145":"the national book award winner in fiction usually carries some weight of lofty expectations for the reader and as such a book i feel this book just accomplished this the prose and voice are brilliant a mix of some tweed jacket wearing poet and a ghetto adolescent ward's voice never feels pushed or unbelievable but it works in a very odd way the plot is where it lost points with me while the previous year's winner a visit from the goon squad was stuffed with interesting plot details salvage the bones goes no place unexpected who needs to read 40 pages of absolute destruction caused by hurricane katrina when we all saw it on cnn while ward's personal experience much of the story is autobiographical brings out the beauty and terror of the storm the hurricane is in some ways diminished as she turns it into a simple literary device instead of a historical moment while i did enjoy the style the characterization of males in throughout the novel greatly took away from my potential to recommend this novel the rough and violent lives of blacks in the ghetto of louisiana parallel the violence of the males of the story they are illogically violent and portrayed constantly as sub human there are truly just three female characters esch the narrator china the literal bitch and katrina the storm each female is potentially destructive but not in a malicious manner read the novel to understand perhaps ward was unaware of this reading from a gendered perspective but this is hard to justify as the subtly in the closet big henry is the only respectable male i would recommend this book for those who look for style and prose which is extremely unique but read with a critical eye","1146":"story unfolded in a lovely pattern writing was very good somewhat forgettable","1147":"brutal book but loved the writing","1148":"yes and yes and yes to the national book award committee for choosing jesmyn ward who deserved this a hundred times over","1149":"this was such an intense read it is the first book i've read about hurricane katrina and probably will be one of the best before the hurricane actually arrives the tension builds and builds through events that are really difficult to stomach dog fighting problematic teen sex scenes sad memories of a lost mother alcoholic yet caring father and just sheer poverty and feelings of powerlessness despite all of the despair i didn't want to stop because this is so well written i really cared about all of the characters and animals and the hope and connection shared by the family members was inspiring esch 14 years old and pregnant is the narrator like my friend karen says in her review http www goodreads com review show her jason medea allusions are overdone and overly sophisticated but nonetheless i loved her voice and perspective especially regarding her feelings about her 4 brothers i think it is really interesting that this beat tiger's wife for the 2011 national book award i'll definitely watch jesmyn ward's acceptance speech when i get a chance http www nationalbook org nba2011 html","1150":"it's been a long time since any book wrapped me up so well jesmyn ward's meditation on love motherhood and revenge is gorgeously written and nicely paced sometimes the writing does feel too rich and heavy handed the chapter where daddy ruins his hand and china ruins her pup is a good example a chain saw in the attic when they most need it maybe maybe not still it's a book i'll go back an author i'll read again and again","1151":"salvage the bones is well written there's no arguing that fact so maybe it's my own fault for assuming it was entirely about something it wasn't namely hurricane katrina for the first eleven of its twelve chapters the novel bucked my expectations and instead focused in on the lives of one poverty stricken family living in a small community in mississippi that's chock full of one unlikable person after another all who are struggling to get by read more http www opinionless

do a writing workshop for the teens in dc public library so powerful","1153":" this was not an easy read it was well written just an incredibly sad story poor family drunk father dead mother pregnant teen dog fighting and katrina just to name a few the difficult parts however the siblings are very loving loyal and supportive of each other i skipped the dog fighting parts and skimmed through the last chapters i just wanted this story to end the ending left me feeling like maybe there was a little hope for this family but i realize that families like this usually have little to hope for and even fewer opportunities it reminded me of another katrina story i read a few years ago zeitoun by david eggers it was nonfiction and much better 5 stars","1154":"well written but so depressing i gave it four stars for the writing alone but the subject matter was very dense and tough to navigate","1155":"i wasn't sure i was going to like this book during the first couple chapters but it kept pulling me along really glad i didn't quit early by the time katrina strikes i was almost breathless as i read","1156":" an incredibly powerful story about a young girl and her family in rural poverty stricken mississippi there were very graphic scenes involving dog fighting which was difficult for me to read but ward's poetic language and seamless ability to take the reader into esch's experiences was beautiful this is not a 'light' read this story is full of heartache and reality and although they were abrasive at the start in the end i was filled with great admiration for esch and her brothers this book won the national book award","1157":"wow what a beautiful but incredibly difficult book to read this is one of those stories in which the reader knows about the horrors to come in this case hurricane katrina and the characters don't this book isn't just about katrina it is about extreme poverty dog fighting teen pregnancy and family not easy stuff to read about but worth it","1158":"this is a beautifully written book but uncomfortable to read the impending arrival of katrina blended with poverty alcoholism teenage pregnancy motherless children and dog fighting made me want to stop reading in the end it's really about family and what we love and do to survive still i wanted to turn away in the same way that the movie and book push makes you feel","1159":"the 2011 national book award winner for fiction deserved it here's the ny times review surviving katrina by parul sehgal surviving katrina new york timeswww nytimes com salvage the bones","1160":"quick read reminded me of beasts of the southern wild intense","1161":"a beautifully written story involving a poverty stricken family living on the mississippi coast spoken from the point of view of the 14 year old girl in the family after the loss their mother the elements of the story make it compelling it is just a few days before hurrican katrina is about the hit the coast but the story is about everyday life pit bull fighting teen pregnancy limited food funds and living without their mother the author's prose is detailed eloquent colorful and at times somewhat disturbing but these qualities transforms you to their world the author won a national book award for this and i understand why","1162":" so i had to skip the parts that were about a description of the girl losing her virginity to her cousin details of her sexual escapades at age 15 details of the nausea vomiting and frequent need to urinate that accompany pregnancy overwrought descriptions of the pups being born and the comparison to blooming flowers i'm pretty sure the two are not even remotely visibly similar descriptions of the mother dog's suffering after her owner almost poisons it in an attempt to cure it of worms by giving it a dewormer that is meant for cows detailed descriptions of dog fights the boy's supposed love for and devotion to the dog that he enters in dog fights a lot of other descriptions of animals suffering and dying probably i managed to miss them i think but the remaining 20 or so pages were not bad","1163":"wow told from the point of view of the only female character esch the main story spans only a few days before during and immediately after hurricane katrina yet ward seamlessly shuttles you back and forth through years of memories and stories of grandparents and a mother long dead to the present drama of her daily life it's a brutal life in a depressing place the kind of place we all know exists and do everything we can to avoid ward eloquently puts in you their shoes and makes you ache for the characters and a happy ending i have added ward's other books to my to read list i can't wait to see if they have the same magic and hope in them","1164":" this book was ''about dog fighting'' but it wasn't about dog fighting it's about motherhood it's about the way that even perfect love remains at times imperfect and the way those imperfections create a unique and beautiful love at times love is violent and messy because it holds so much the love between china and skeetah and between esch and manny are parallel examples of imperfect love that though forbidden and broken are pure in motivation each china mother and katrina form an artist's rendering of motherhood its failings and success its beauty and harsh reality if we take away ward's unfortunate worldview or at the least accept it as unfortunate we see the song she wrote to love perhaps in her background of pit bull fighting showing us the true complexity uniqueness and incomprehension of true love she lets us see and understand that there are just some things that are not understandable they just are","1165":"we are deep into hurricane season so this book set in coastal mississippi is the one that i finished reading today for our third tuesday book club discussion tomorrow night august 20 2013 it is also a revealing window on a way of life lived in coastal mississippi by those who are poor and is a book i enjoyed reading although in many ways it is not an easy read it is august in bois savage mississippi which is somewhere between gulfport and i 10 and esch would be poor white trash if she wasn't black she is fifteen and lives in a ramshackle house near the pit where years ago her grandfather let white men pay to haul dirt away her father appears to not have much of a job except for drinking beer she has two older brothers randall aged 17 who has hopes of getting out via his basketball skills and skeetah aged 16 whose passion is his female white pit bull china esch also has a younger brother junior whose birth at home seven years ago caused the death of mama while the older kids go to school during the summer they are left to their own devices randall and skeetah's friends including marquise manny and big henry hang out with them run through the woods shoot hoops and drink beer and smoke weed randall spends most of his free time shooting hoops and skeetah devotes his life to his dog who as the book opens has just had puppies these puppies are worth money they have good fighting dog bloodlines and skeetah of course fights his dog away back in the piney woods esch the only girl hangs around with the guys for her summer reading she is making her way through edith hamilton's mythology and has just reached the tale of jason and the argonauts with medea who esch identifies with she also can't keep much down that she eats which concerns her meanwhile daddy has heard that there is a hurricane in the gulf and has been exercising himself more than usual to get the house prepared for the storm i know coastal mississippi south of interstate 10 pretty well and the geography of this book is quite accurate and i loved how the family in this book loves each other even though at times they barely inhabit the same emotional or mental areas","1166":"i received this book from goodreads comthis book was written in a style that was difficult for me to read it's not bad just not familiar to me it's a very sad story all that seeming negative i didn't want it to end where it did i want to know more about what happens to these people","1167":"this book has dead puppies and dog fights and alcoholic dads and teen pregnancies and poverty and dysfunction and jerky boyfriends in other words it's sad and it's not what i usually like to read if it weren't for the final scenes with the family pulling together in hurricane katrina and it is written with an interesting voice reminds me a lot of the movie beasts of the southern wild","1168":"this was one of the most intense books i have ever read it was like i was reading an action movie the entire last chapter went so quick and i couldn't put the book down until i finished it it was a little sad to read about all the animals were hurt in this novel but i quickly got over that when i realized the human characters were at a much bigger risk i loved this novel bit slow in the beginning but you had to learn about the characters in order to struggle along with them through katrina","1169":" the protagonist is flat and at one point i found the constant references to jason and medea so irritating that i yelled at the book enough already that said china the pit bull is awesome and the book is worth the read for the nail biting description of a dog fight in which her fate lies in the balance oh and one more thing i could tell by the middle of the first paragraph that ward was playing with faulkner's voice trying to channel as i lay dying ten pages later the fifteen year old protagonist claims she read the novel in school the previous year seriously they're teaching faulkner to high school freshmen in backwoods mississippi as a product of the public school system in rural north carolina i have my doubts","1170":"heartbreaking and beautifully written top pick for me","1171":"fast read reminded me of swamplandia","1172":"it's been awhile since a book has turned me inside out the way this one did oof","1173":"kind of sad nothing happy about it reality smacking you in the face","1174":"holy s$u0026amp this book is phenomenal outstanding writing outstanding storytelling","1175":"powerful and devastating the kind of book one needs to recover from","1176":"gritty must read jesmyn ward has an excellent command of the american language when describing the life of this family featured in salvage the bones","1177":"an absolutely brilliant piece of work about hurricane katrina the story follows one family and their small poverty stricken community in louisiana through the days immediately preceding and following the devastating hurricane the main character's voice is unforgettable and haunting it is a book you finish and think about for long time afterward it was heart wrenching without slamming you over the head with the tragedy it really sneaks up on you and you realize you are in emotional turmoil the language was stunning in it's simplicity and genius jesmyn ward has created a book about hurricane katrina for the ages","1178":" some writers have a tendency to fall in love with a word ms ward's word is desultory or desultorily 1 without purpose or intent aimless 2 occurring haphazardly random american heritage dictionary 4th ed another word is detritus the characters were caricatures the themes are overused southern gothic dumped like mashed potatoes overdone vegetables and a fried piece of mystery meat on one's cafeteria tray however the writing is very good a writer would appreciate ward's craft the story improves in the last two chapters","1179":"wow what an awesome treat i never re read books but when i sadly got to the last page of this one i flipped right back to page 1 and started over again the language and imagery was just so beautiful that i wanted to linger over it again when i wasn't paying attention to plot and storyline very sad story but great read","1180":"language that gives grace and depth to esch's hard life really want to read ward's first book","1181":"this book follows a family days before during and following the attack of hurricane katrina make no mistake this is not a book about the devastation caused by katrina though you do get to see it it is about this family it was hard hitting and extremely realistic if it had been a movie i would have had to cover my eyes at points sometimes i loved it sometimes i hated it but i never could put it down","1182":" argh goodreads ate my review i haven't the energy to rewrite it summary beautifully written although i thought the authenticity of the narrator's voice suffered for it at times the story was totally gripping but unfortunately the rest of the book often dragged and got mired in description and metaphor if i had the time and quiet to really delve into a book the way i used to i think i would have been able to appreciate the subtleties of the story but unfortunately i haven't got that luxury so i don't think i really did this book justice anyway i'd put this at a 3 5","1183":" salvage the bones is a small but vibrant novel about the life of one small family preceding and during hurricane katrina that i found myself reading strangely fortuitously as hurricane sandy ripped through the east coast including my home state of new jersey it was one of those odd coincidences esch's descriptions of the storm felt powerfully immediate as i read by flashlight the wind howling outside trees falling ward's language is lush and metaphor heavy several of her paragraphs are practically perfect blinding in their loveliness in other areas the repetition of metaphor feels tangled and unwieldy but the book definitely succeeds as a archetypical journey as a portrait of a young poor pregnant girl unapologetic of her body and sexuality as a parallel to the myth of jason and medea that esch reads pre hurricane and relates to so much ward's writing is at its high points more poetry than prose and i will never look at a pit bull without a bit of reverence now","1184":"terrifically good","1185":" i guess i should admit that i did skip a tiny bit of the book view spoiler i could not read about the dog fight i thought i could but ended up just skimming through it until i saw that it was over hide spoiler overall i found that this was a really hard book for me to read the subject matter was raw and included a lot of not so happy stuff teen pregnancy dog fighting and alcoholic father essentially ward did a wonderful job portraying a family that had to fight for what they have but enabled me as a reader to still see the love and devotion that they have for each other the story takes place right before hurricane katrina hits the gulf shores of louisiana mississippi and alabama with their father largely drunk and always worried about hurricanes the kids do not see why this hurricane is something to be feared especially when they have puppies they are trying to keep alive a pregnancy to deal with and a basketball dream to work towards i guess i should mention to that the family still is dealing with the loss of their mother who died when little junior was born as the story unfolds i realized that their pitbull was not just a family pet but also fought in dogfights i have always had a hard time with this activity and found it hard to come to terms with the fact that skeetah could be a good person and love his family and his dog and still put the dog in such a horrific activity i attribute my complicated feelings to ward's wonderful characterization the characters in the book are so complex and are not perfect in fact the characters are more raw and real and flawed i do not know much about life in the bayou or what it is like to live in poverty in a rural area but i did feel that ward did a good job portraying the everyday battles that may be part of a family's life down there it was a hard book to read but it was one i am glad that i did read even though i skipped a tiny part of it my only gripe with it was the ending view spoiler i like a happy ending and i think she tried to give me one but there was so much left open she does not say whether or not china ever comes back but alludes that they are holding out hope for her return not only that but they really never resolve what happens with manny or the father i do wish i got a little closure on some of the issues but i guess this is one of those books that the hope of the future is better than what probably did happen hide spoiler","1186":"beautifully written national book award winner","1187":"i'm shocked i loved a book that featured so much dog fighting this much i felt like i was covered in dust and sticky in the mississippi august humidity the whole time the plot is really straightforward how a struggling family prepares for and then responds to hurricane katrina but each character is complex and dealing with their own issues i loved the protagonist and her understanding of her brothers and their friends who are always over are subtly rendered but feel so real","1188":"a powerfully captivating story of innocent people battling the elements of poverty and nature internal dialogue whistled through the characters minds like weather through the state and testified to the struggle that those born into financially disadvantaged situations have in fighting to feel significant and act accordingly many parallels exist between the destruction and violence that's enacted externally and internally both as uncontrollable as the other life is hard and beautiful","1189":"a strangely sad but decent read of a struggling family as they prepare for a hurricane in mississippi","1190":"heartbreaking lush superior voice lyrical a must read but be ready ward squeezes you all the way through wow","1191":"beautiful writing the pit bull fighting stuff was brutal to read","1192":"as one of her reviewers said impossibly beautiful she gives a powerful lyrical voice to the lives loves and challenges of the rural poor in louisiana in a way that is honest raw and nonjudgmental she has marvelously tossed aside all politics political correctness partisanism feminism liberalism and all the other isms to lay bare the lives of those who aren't captured in the radar of the mainstream but whose challenges and triumphs are no less wholly human","1193":"painful beautiful brutal honest unflinching this needs to be required reading at the high school level this left me reeling as hurricane katrina left these characters this is the kind of book that will always keep me reading in search of other books with the same power","1194":"lucid storytelling on some touchy subject material michael vick gave the book six stars out of five","1195":" i finished salvage the bones by jesmyn ward the other night although i had to take several breaks from reading because of its intensity i thought it was really wonderful i pretty much wept through the last two chapters reading a synopsis you might almost think that it's an alternate setup to john mulaney's \"new in town\" bit esch is fourteen her brother fights dogs katrina is about to hit and she's pregnant but esch is such an enlightened enlightening narrator that it's ok this isn't misery porn esch stands tall unblinking and faces everything that's thrown her way i loved these characters i loved ward's writing i plan on seeking out her first book where the line bleeds and i'm excited for what's next ooh and i can loan the e book to someone for two weeks let me know if you want to try it out","1196":" cons this book is bleak and worse gives grueling details on dog fighting--so beware if you know beforehand that you aren't going to be able to stomach it i had to skip those pages entirely also this book is too chock full of similes which i found distracting like one long poem the similes trumped the action which is never a good thing and i spent so much time trying to visualize the comparisons that i felt like i was working instead of being swept away the first half of the book was too slow on the plus side the last quarter of the book where the family is trying to survive a hurricane is riveting truly incredible in this section i was totally swept away as i watched the characters try not to get swept away by the storm i will never forget the scene or the emotions it pulled from me so for this reason i recommend it but with reservations","1197":"the book takes place in bo's sauvage mississipi over 12 days leading up to and during hurricane katrina i loved the writing the subject matter is pretty difficult at times it's an upclose look at poverty in america but also includes an upclose look at dog fighting","1198":"it was a easy read throughout the chapters not one for dog fighting still a enjoyable book","1199":"i am loving this author's descriptive skill great book some reviews have called this a bleak story but to me it reads with truth and a real voice looking forward to reading the rest of this book ok finished the book loved it hopeful there is a second book for this family this writer turned the english language into flowing water into puffs of dandelion into mouthfuls of ripe fruit her descriptive skill is genius i will be reading anything else she writes i don't care to read many books that have ur standard problem standard solution and then ur happy ending this book had none of those so i was all over it it is sad and wrenching at times a few unexpected losses and then comes hurricane katrina i thought the storm was going to be more of a main character to this story but she is just churning and growing off shore for most the book paralleling the protagonist's inner storm","1200":"the balance between the brutal subject matter of this book poverty dog fighting teenage pregnancy and the beautiful writing is very disarming like looking at a beautiful but deadly flower it took me a couple chapters to get into it but by the end i didn't want the book to end i wanted to know how the future would unfold for the characters ward gives us clues but no certainty just like real life","1201":" this was a beautiful beautiful book but it was a terrible tragic read it is full of violence people and animals and despair the story follows one family in rural mississippi in the days leading up to hurricane katrina the hurricane is devastating but the reader gets a sense of the longstanding devastation due to isolation and racism and lack of resources there's so much to talk about here the way the author uses mythology as an umbrella for this story the discussion of gender and motherhood the way love and violence work together but if you choose this book be prepared for a grim experience","1202":"plot what more can i say ward layers stories within the story interweaving greek myths and flashbacks of her mother on top of the coming katrina creating a deep and compelling read filled with complication tension and conflict which makes for a refreshing read in the land of literary fiction the language was beautiful although a bot over written in parts and the story started on page one and never slowed down every time i though it was at the worst ward ratcheted up the tension note there are graphic dog fight scenes","1203":" it don't have a daddy you wrong this baby got a daddy esch this baby got plenty daddies this book was rather disturbing from the first page to a good ten pages in but quickly switches i swear it i know so many who've told me they didn't get past page five because the descriptiveness of the dog china giving birth all i've been telling them is keep turning those pages it gets so much better i pinky promise usually first person books are meh to read even more so when they have incorrect grammar but salvage the bones was perfect it was like a chocolate cake with hard white fondant covering the top-- you have to break the fondant the spine of the book or first few pages in this case in order to find the beauty that is chocolate cake the brilliant story excellent characters and fantastic descriptions for being written in first person","1204":"i hate this book i hate what happens to the characters i hate the rawness of it i hate how profoundly it moved me","1205":" and yet another book that gets two stars over one from me only because i finished it what a maddening book the narrator went from intelligent and observant to completely idiotic within the same paragraph how could she be so smart and so incredibly stupid at the same time completely unbelievable and the brother who supposedly loved his dog so much but made money on dog fights with her aaaaarrrrrggggg i'll admit to moments of stomach tightening anxiety while reading this but the glimmers of magnificent writing in no way made up for the rest of the story","1206":"beautifully written and enormously depressing novel about how poverty affects human beings and families","1207":"this is one of those books that i find i must sit in a place that just feels horribly uncomfortable but unlike a movie i can't look away","1208":"it's been a while since a book created this much anxiety and urgency as i turned its pages beautifully crafted taut and compressed a story that binds the private and domestic to the public and political with a light hand at times the metaphoric weight of the mythic references felt unnecessary and even a bit forced but otherwise an incredibly satisfying book on both the prose level and the thematic and conceptual levels","1209":" this is a book i had to digest before writing a review it was an intense reading experience with so much visceral action especially the brutal dog fights the strong and grounding narrative voice of the protagonist esch and her tender love for her brothers really carried me through the book i came to care about this family who are caught up the trials of poverty in rural mississippi and then in the madness of hurricane katrina you'd have to have a heart of stone not to be moved by this honest beautiful tale the ending just wrecked me i hope this novel wins the 2012 tournament of books and i'm keen to read ward's first novel where the line bleeds now","1210":"salvage the bones is written in a poetic prose that some found endearing and engaging i found myself getting lost in regards to the story who was doing what exactly what was going on in the present as well as the past in twelve days the central family undergoes many life changing events just trying to get by as young children of a motherless household and dealing with poverty and an impending storm spoiler this book has dog fighting scenes which might upset the reader","1211":" i picked this up after it won the national book award and my good fortune is such that it also ended up in the morning news tournament of books but really i'm glad i read this book because it was a good book it's about a fourteen year old girl who lives in mississippi on the gulf coast while a storm named katrina is heading for landfall the girl esch has three brothers and a drunk crazy dad and she recently discovered that she's pregnant so i thought this was a good book for its portrayal of contemporary black rural poverty because i think everyone wants to believe that situation is historic this book has gotten a lot of criticism for being too mfa workshop writerly which is honestly a fair criticism i am not convinced that some of the rich flowing poetic descriptions of esch's surroundings were accurate to her perspective however i loved esch's flights of fancy she is focused on mythology of medea and jason which feels so genuine in that escapist fantasy coping mechanism sort of way i also appreciated the relationships in this book especially between esch and her brothers and esch and her dead mother katrina lit as a genre wears me out but i loved esch her brothers china the pit bull the puppies the hens who hide their eggs and the bleak life made almost bearable by esch's internal monologues so much of the book was on the cusp of this intense transformation you know the storm will make landfall but when will they be prepared what will happen to esch her brothers china her dad as an animal lover i need to warn you that there are some graphic dog fight scenes in this book","1212":"there's some deep dark wisdom in this book that it feels almost wrong to have discovered i wonder if the gods will punish ward like they did prometheus for this one and be prepared to hurt as you read this it felt like having a sun burned slapped repeatedly but oh sooo worth it","1213":"beautiful imagery deeply moving characters","1214":"hated this one like not only did not like reading it but wish i hadn't because the experience was so bad it was bleak and uncouth very regionalistic i think they picked it because it had hurricane katrina in it natural disasters and death guaranteed book awards right","1215":" i really didn't like this book at all in fact i'm now having a hard time looking at pit bulls and their owners for some reason while the story was very raw and real i didn't feel much for the main character or most of her family except the basketball playing brother the book takes place in 12 days and for me it was 10 days too long the most interesting part of the story was living through katrina with the family you really did feel like you were there the worst part about it was i really didn't care enough about the characters to route for their well being i definitely wouldn't recommend this book","1216":"this review has been hidden because it contains spoilers to view it click here jesmyn ward's salvage the bones puts us in the skin of esch a girl who is pregnant in her early teens and who faces with her brothers an incoming hurricane that would birth devastation for the lives of many throughout the chapters esch plays her part in an all male environment follows her brothers through their respective stories and struggles to keep her family on the same page all while preparing herself for hurricane katrina the book confronts us with jarring reality on all its fronts jesmyn ward's salvage the bones puts us in the skin of esch a girl who is pregnant in her early teens and who faces with her brothers an incoming hurricane that would birth devastation for the lives of many throughout the chapters esch plays her part in an all male environment follows her brothers through their respective stories and struggles to keep her family on the same page all while preparing herself for hurricane katrina the book confronts us with jarring reality on all its fronts tthe vernacular of the narration had its way of grating on my tolerance but it was honest and felt real while i appreciated a lot of the metaphor--the comparing and contrasting bits that esch did during narration--it seemed a bit overdone i spent a lot of time crawling through the pages sighing and saying \"yes esch we understood how you felt nine metaphors ago \" i wasn't particularly impressed with the dialogue either--not to mention some of the scenes that bordered on the grotesque i can only handle a kid telling me so many details of her sex life weird tthis was one of those cases when after flipping through about a hundred pages i started to realize that the dog was my favorite character i thoroughly enjoyed reading about china and her exploits told through the perspective of esch china even seemed to be the most developed character at times with the exception of the narrator obviously the symbolism that can be drawn from the situations different characters and china are due some credit good storytelling in this manner is something i can always be enthusiastic about tthe book was not horrible albeit a little unbearable to read at times the book was not amazing albeit i couldn't keep myself from reading the next few pages at times the age old \"kid and his dog\" story with a bit of \"generic teen pregnancy\" thrown in and you have something pretty close to salvage the bones well perhaps after you also stick the unwanted details of your teenage niece's life into the mix if you put your mind to it you may get a powerful read out of it call me insensitive but i did not particularly sit down and read a chapter or so before you spend your money more","1217":"short on hope inspiration or insight i skipped to the final chapter","1218":" when i finished the last page of the book my first thought was this is why i am a reader to be immersed in a place and situation that completely carried me away jesymn ward used vivid descriptions relying heavily on novel metaphors that helped me to understand the history and dynamics of the batiste family the pacing of the book was excellent planting seeds of apprehension as the story progressed through the 12 days that led up to hurricane katrina as the parent of a 15 year old i thought that that age was an excellent choice for esch the narrator who guided me through her world balancing both the insightfulness that a teenager can have along with the occasional misplaced optimism the content of the book easily could have been overly dramatic or overly saccharine but instead the complex story was parsed out with an even hand descriptions of the book that focus on a poor coastal mississippi family and the time preceding hurricane katrina do not do it justice instead it is a book about familial dynamics parenthood survival and the possibility of hope i highly recommend it","1219":"i get why people don't leave their homes whenthere are warnings of imminent danger after reading this book","1220":"well written wasn't quite ready for the dog fight brutality read those sections quickly","1221":"pretty compelling read especially as hurricane katrina gets closer and the only one in the book who seems to take it seriously is the drunken ineffectual dad i liked the characters especially esch and her brother skeet but glazed over the greek mythology bits very well written and almost poetic 3 5 stars","1222":"the prose was beautiful and the story and characters were good unfortunately the middle part of the book was so repetitive that i found myself skimming over most of it it felt like the author needed to add pages to fill a quota rather than to enhance our reading experience we finally got to the hurricane in the last couple of chapters and the book did finish beautifully","1223":"actual rating 3 5","1224":"jessmyn ward knows how to weave words together while esch is our main character and a delightfully honest narrator it was her brother skeet who grabbed my heart i ached for his losses and dreams the book is not perfect but is certainly worthy of the national book award as readers it leaves us with as many questions as we gain answers","1225":"just finished this tonight i am not sure who i would recommend this to fierce love dog fights mythology and family the dog's name is china","1226":"this would be a great book group book rural poverty big hurricane misery and tenderness i'll be giving this to someone for christmas","1227":"took more than an adjustment to the cadence of low country culture to experience this book's true message","1228":"excellent book it was tough to read at times because it did go into dog fighting and i'm a huge dog lover otherwise this was a book that kept me up at night because it was so good","1229":"i did not want to like this book but despite myself i did horrible tale about a dirt poor family i believe living near the louisiana coast during the time of hurricane katrina builds slowly from a lanquid meandering pace to the finale and blowing hurricane ending could not put it down at the end and i ended up caring about this family despite their many failings and horrible situations","1230":"beautifully written salvage the bones gives the best gifts having read it my world has grown my heart has grown my understanding has grown and i loved every moment of it","1231":"this book was excruciating to read full of tragedy and struggle and beauty in unexpected people and places and i could not put it down i am still thinking about the characters especially esch and her voice i have vivid pictures in my head of this rural mississippi setting and ward did a wonderful job of juxtaposing a big event hurricane katrina with the small daily goings on of this unique family i have never been poor black southern motherless and pregnant and yet i found myself nodding my head when esch was in the grip of adolescent unrequited love disclaimer if you have a hard time reading about animal mistreatment sickness death this book is not for you","1232":" i received this book as a goodreads first reads giveaway i wanted to like this book i really did but much of it churned my stomach let me explain the writing flowed beautifully jesmyn ward clearly has a gift for writing and pulling you into the story i did have two favorite characters big henry and junior since those were the only two in the entire story with pure honest hearts and it seemed any kind of sense with that said i very much disliked all of the other characters and did not sympathize with them in the least the graphic sex scenes with teens i felt was highly inappropriate as were the dog fighting scenarios great writing but not my cup of tea","1233":" this book was brutally honest raw and emotional ward expertly created an atmosphere wherein i felt like i was literally in the backwoods of mississippi with these characters the characters were well drawn and three dimensional from the start and although their circumstances were desperate ward created a story that did not elicit pity so much as empathy this is not a trite re tread of the coming of age novel but is an elbow deep exploration into the lives of these characters over a twelve day period leading up to and after hurricane katrina it is original and in many ways defies categorization but was a profound moving read","1234":"2011 national book award fiction winner rough and tumble family survives hurricane katrina while wielding a turbulent set of circumstances within","1235":"this was an intense book dealing with a father and his four children as katrina was evolving and taking place what is love what is family how does one go on","1236":"not a pleasant read but maybe an essential one","1237":"i did not fully enjoy this book i liked the bond between the siblings in this book but found some of the other situations frustrating i also thought the author's descriptions were often overdone and unnecessary overall an interesting story","1238":" poverty single parent family teenage pregnancy alcoholism dog fighting dismemberment hurricane katrina as top line topics go salvage the bones touches on some pretty big bummers that being said there is a constant breeze of humanity and family blowing through jesmyn ward's pages strongest after the storm has passed and the waters have receded people much smarter about literature and the written word awarded this novel the 2011 national book award for fiction so i write this with a heavy amount of consideration that there's a good chance i'm missing misunderstanding something about this novel this is not to say that i found the book to be poorly written or any such thing to the contrary there is quite a lot i enjoyed about this book the story language and characters all have a way of sticking with you but until one of those smarter people are able to explain to me what i'm missing i would have to opine that it is not the best book i've read published within the window for qualification for that prize yeah i preferred the tiger's wife sue me this may all come down to one perceived flaw to be honest it is such a big flaw however i'm surprised it didn't hinder the novel's rise to glory and that i haven't read other reviews finding fault with it of course all that means is that it's probably more a personal hang up and those smart people would just shake their heads at my words in disappointment this would be sad because i know victor lavalle to have been among the panelists who selected the award winner i like lavalle i have to say however that it eventually drove me crazy how many times esch the narrator and protagonist refers to medea as she's reading about her in edith hamilton's mythology and becomes an uber obvious parallel for her own story well there are elements which might not be as clear but un luckily ward and esch are there to point them out for you page after page after page it's a little maddening making me want to scream alright i get it already except that i often read during my bus commute to and from the city and would at least be an unwelcome drawing of unwelcome attention at most i could be thrown off the bus due to the misunderstanding anyhow this became such a prominent thing within the story that it began to hinder my enjoyment of the otherwise masterful storytelling i distinctly remember turning a page and quickly skimming to see where the next reference to medea and jason and the argonauts would be not finding one for three consecutive pages felt like a triumph a triumph i celebrated quietly i hate to linger on this singular issue too much especially as it seems to have not bothered anyone else too much it is my review however and it is a huge part of my overall experience of having read the book since it was not enough to otherwise ruin the book for me though i shall proceed ward does a great job of drawing her scene and characters the pit and its inhabitants are memorable and likable warts and all esch and her brothers randall skeetah and junior are the primary family members through which you experience the story with their deceased mother's spirit playing as big a role emotionally as their daddy does physically you'll instinctively love big henry and be suspicious of manny in fact i think those two secondary tertiary characters are as memorable as any i can think of generally i don't do story recapping because i don't really like to read story recaps in book reviews i think it's fairly well known this book takes place in the week leading up to hurricane katrina hitting the gulf coast it would be a mistake to confuse that event to be the novel's subject matter it certainly has some allegorical qualities but this is a much smaller hence larger story about people and family and overcoming and love love as certainty keep in mind before picking it up however there are some heavy heavy topics in this book remember the first line of the review if it's going to just bum you out then sorry if you can see through some rough times reading about dog fighting isn't going to appeal to many i'm sure you'll get a lot out of this book even if the continued referencing to greek mythology gets tired","1239":"i would give it a 2 5 rating","1240":"painfully sad but very well written story of a 15 year old living in poverty in rural louisiana in the week leading up to hurrican katrina","1241":"the second half is the most powerful ward's prose takes off and the pathos reaches a fever pitch with get greek allusions she sets herself aside alongside the authors of the western cannon her future books will determine whether or not she's found a permanent seat there","1242":"read this for my book club parts i liked the nice similes and writing the moments of suspense the symbolism linked and repeated throughout the book dislikes dog fighting unanswered questions constant references to medea and sometimes the story ran a bit slow","1243":"i really loved this book on both a strong emotional level and on a writing level i found the writing style gorgeous the book is able to be gruesome and beautiful at the same time i loved the bonds of family and friendship i highly recommend","1244":"a beautifully written novel carefully and interestingly structured about a dirt poor family in mississippi in the days before hurricane katrina and the days after heartbreaking in some ways uplifting in others","1245":"extremely well written however the topic was not personally engaging my entire book club raved about it so maybe i simply wasn't in the reading mood","1246":"not digging the pit bull fighting and breeding but it got great reviews","1247":"the themes are hammered home fairly strongly but by the end of the book we do feel we have lived closely with this family for ten full days before and during hurricane katrina","1248":"so authentic","1249":"gorgeously written and moving depiction of a family on the edge in lots of ways poor black and rural on the edge of the mississippi delta on the edge of dissolution all of the characters emerge as deeply complex flawed human beings and ward's prose is often really beautiful and lucid","1250":"nba finalist a bit of a gross start but still engaging it's easy to see why this was a finalist the whole time i kept thinking can it get any worse and it does despite all the helplessness and tragedey its kind of a hopeful book","1251":"pretty good read","1252":"jesmyn ward paints a beautifully poetic picture of rural mississippi life vivid and full of depth the emotion of esch her pain discomfort and longing for something big is exemplified to the largest extreme as hurricane katrina lands culminating in a scene full of hope direct from the innermost part of a youthful teenage spirit","1253":"originally reviewed at minnesota reads i completely understand why salvage the bones by jesmyn ward received the national book award it's a moving and depressing portrait of race poverty family education and hurricane katrina with a little bit of mythology woven throughout the story it takes place in the days leading up to and during hurricane katrina fourteen year old esch her brothers and her father are very poor and live in a rundown house in mississippi near the gulf of mexico over the summer esch and her family have been hearing about storms getting stronger and we readers know what's coming which made me cringe reading descriptions of their household and the lack of food throughout the summer esch has been reading greek mythology about medea and this is not by accident to give a brief and very poor overview of medea just know that she marries and has two children with jason but then his wandering eye pulls him towards a princess and away from medea medea poisons the princess and her father kills her children and leaves jason ward weaves the aspects of medea's life surrounding betrayal unrequited love and motherhood with esch's life especially when she finds herself pregnant by a man who doesn't love her esch is a fascinating tragic character but she hasn't had the best life so the poor choices she makes seem believable because she is reaching for something she and her brothers have raised themselves because their alcoholic father is almost always passed out or raging i wanted esch's older brother to be more of a fatherly figure to her but he's more wrapped up being a father to his pitbull china and her babies china's babies are valuable she is a star in underground dog fights and her babies are bound to be as good as her thus making them worth a lot of money that the family needs the idea of family and motherhood is present with esch but also with the pitbull china is vicious when people come around her puppies yet when they become ill she is vicious towards them esch observes this in interesting ways and with her references to medea i couldn't help but think of medea esch and china when it came to motherhood and family and what it all means this was a hard book to read i constantly wanted to shake esch and her family to talk some sense into them not only for the impending doom they would face with katrina but of the poor choices they were making they were more surviving than living but with poor education and no money what else could they do this is a close look at the poverty we saw after katrina hit where we watched people on their roofs waving at the helicopters begging for help i know so many people speculated \"why didn't they leave when the evacuation order came in \" but where would they go with nowhere to turn and no resources this is a really wonderful book i loved the descriptions of the household the family china's babies and esch's life it's beautifully lyrically written and it really does bring this family and particularly esch to life this may not be for everyone but it is destined to be analyzed in college literature classrooms for years to come","1254":"i tried to like this book i really did initially i was drawn to this book because of the critical acclaim it received and by the fact that it is set in rural mississippi on the brink of hurricane katrina each night i forced myself to read a few pages of the book hoping that the plot would pick up speed but that never happened i finally tossed this book to the side when the secondary plot surrounding china the pit bull made my stomach churn i have never been a supporter of animal cruelty and brutality even if it is in the name of literature usually i donate books to the library when i am finished with them but i don't even think this book is worth the shelf space my recommendation for this book skip it","1255":" hmmm what to say about this book this book is set during the period prior and during hurricane katrina in mississippi it's not really about the hurricane tending to focus more on the example of a family that was likely affected by that hurricane more about rural poverty bad choices hopeless conditions and a shameful culture but also includes loyalty compassion gratitude and that spark of hope left in us even during the worst of times not a book i would recommend to just anyone not a pleasant read author teaches at university of south alabama with my daughter which prompted this selection and as i was reading i heard president obama interviewed saying he too was reading this book cool to think of that as i turned the pages","1256":"this is a powerful story but its not a pretty story it's about a poor family living in bois savage mississippi the mother has died the father is unable to parent his four children although he is there the 14 year old girl thinks maybe she's pregnant one boy is nursing his pitbull female after her puppies are born puppies he hopes to sell to earn some money almost peripheral to the story is the hurricane they hear is coming katrina","1257":"i was expecting a story of a family during the hurricane but read about a dysfunctional family and their issues right before and right after a hurricane enjoyed the book thoroughly","1258":"interesting story of poor black family facing katrina dog fights theft sex teenage pregnancy basketball etc","1259":"amazing jesmyn ward's ability to draw the reader in and keep them captivated is truly remarkable i read this book in my engl comp class for assignment and may i say that i have the upmost respect for ward as well as my instructor for choosing this as our reading","1260":"the dogfighting abuse mixed alternating with affection u0026amp love was really hard to read at times especially sitting next to my pittie i wanted to know more about esch's life outside the house and more of her back story in general the author portrays the twisted situation with clarity clearly this is a family in bleak times and you really want to shake the dad and tell him to get his sh t together liked the writing still a bit conflicted by the story overall","1261":"this review has been hidden because it contains spoilers to view it click here i liked how the ending was hopeful but everything was not tied up neatly the use of so many similes was distracting but overall i enjoyed the writing","1262":"glad i read this through to the end the story of the rage of katrina was well done and the story overall was beautiful if only the author didn't try to jazz up every sentence i just wanted to get on with the character esch and her brothers what a warm and loving family ugh don't use undulating in a novel the descriptive camel's back was already broken for me but when i saw that word i knew she was over the top and couldn't help herself","1263":"this was good but oh not a national book award winner a poor dog loving dog fighting family in new orleans in the just before katrina period deals with love and loss i suppose a lot happened unrequited love unplanned pregnancies breaking and entering fisticuffs katrina but i was never sucked in and good lord please if you are writing novels learn when to use lie and when to use lay that was maddening","1264":"wow this is breathtaking novel that reads like a classic ward is an exceptionally beautiful writer i know that a few metaphors and sentences in here will stick with me for years and this raw terrible story is told with compassion and honesty a warning the subject matter here is pretty graphic and difficult dog fights abuse and violence family struggles but i strongly recommend it because ward finds beauty and hope in some of the book's darkest subjects the novel tells of the days leading up hurricane katrina through the eyes of a teenage girl and her family on the mississippi coast this will surely live alongside dave eggers' zeitoun among the best books to tell the story of katrina the book's strengths are in character development and its lyrical prose i tend to read books for the prose more than the plot so all readers might not love the book as much as i did the plot can occasionally be a bit jumpy or unclear","1265":"i seriously loved this book though this is fiction jesmyn ward lived through katrina so i have no doubt she has created a very true picture of this small town in mississippi so vivid and painfully clear she writes like a poet and i am completely impressed by her","1266":"it was a little tough to read about the dog fighting and the way that the family in the story lived i thought i was going to be reading about the aftermath of the storm it was a heartbreaking story that ultimately revealed people who had a strong sense of community without judgement","1267":"salvage the bones by jesmyn ward begins 10 days before hurricane katrina hits the family's town bois sauvage mississippi and is mostly narrated by esch a fourteen year old girl esch has three younger siblings skeeter randall and junior the children's mother died in childbirth with junior the children's dad is an alcoholic which forces the children to take care of themselves since there isn't any other family around to help rear them there are twelve chapters in the book which represents the 10 days leading up to the storm the day of the storm and the day after the 2 subplots includes esch finding out that she's pregnant and how she deals with her situation the majority of the story and also about skeeter and his prize winning pit bull china for me there were three major issues with this book the book presentation storyline and characters which are basically the major components of the book's content 1 the book cover makes you feel like you're about to read a children's book and not necessarily a women's fiction book which is the genre that the book is listed under the synopsis nor the story really supports the title of the book my entire book club had to really try to connect the title to the book because the book was really about a family preparing for the hurricane and the dog was really a subplot i had a problem understanding why the book was called salvage the bones or the relevance of the title to the entire story outside of the skeeter trying to save china and her pups from parvo disease and the storm which wasn't the main plot with all of this to consider the title and cover didn't quite make sense based on the synopsis and content of the book 2 the second issue with the book was the storyline itself the book is told over twelve days altogether which i think is a challenge within itself because it's such a short amount of time to make everything make sense and the story believable also the story was mostly about the children in the family and i really wondered with the book cover and the fact that the story is based on the kids if the book was really in the correct genre altogether maybe this particular book would be better serviced in young adult fiction instead of women fiction minus some of the profanity and the dog fight scene from chapter to chapter not much changed with the family at all the storyline lacked depth which made it very difficult for me to want to read further into the book i also felt that i didn't really get an ending to the story as we all know there's definitely a story to be told when it comes to natural disaster survivors so i was puzzled when the book ended on the twelfth day and didn't really let us know if or how the family got back on their feet and the struggles that they went through to get there or if they didn't at all so i was left unsatisfied because there weren't really anything known about what happened to the family other than they survived i think the story would have had some redeeming qualities had ms ward focused on giving us more background about the family and then maybe a few days prior to the storm and moved us forward with how the family rebuilt their lives for these reasons the storyline itself were forgettable 3 the third issue with the book was the character development ms ward didn't provide enough information about the characters to make us feel any sort of way about them it was extremely hard to connect with any of the characters and made the book itself even more of a challenge to continue to read i really didn't feel any sort of way about the characters and felt that the author fell flat with describing the characters in the book i really wanted to feel something for one of the characters even the dog at some point but the lack of character development made it too challenging the only redeeming quality for this book is that there were no grammatical errors and the book was priced accordingly i cannot in good faith recommend this book to anyone based on the kc girlfriends book club book review standards i give this book a 2 star rating our book reviews are based on five components 1 book presentation 2 the price point 3 storyline 4 character development 5 editing","1268":"excellent book about esch a pregnant teenager and her 3 brothers in louisiana right before and after katrina their mother is dead dad's a drunk and they have raised each other","1269":"and more","1270":"tough but excellent read reminiscent of faulkner's as i lay dying in some parts this book catalogues the days leading up to katrina if you read for nothing else the tenderness shown between the siblings in this book is astounding yet believable metaphor is strewn throughout the book in a useful and imaginative way i am still so moved i may read it again","1271":"this is the best book i've read this year gritty and raw but astonishingly beautiful","1272":"some will tag this book as being about hurricane katrina others as a coming of age tale still others as a contemporary where the red fern grows and while they are all correct for me this was a book about brothers and sisters too often the sibling fiction a rare bird in its own sense i've read focuses on the ways siblings betray the ones they should be closest to but this book is refreshing in its bent towards the opposite the ways brothers and sisters protect and plan and sacrifice for each other even in a time and place where there is seemingly nothing left to give esch's voice drives the narrative along like a quiet hurricane in itself we get a clear picture of all 4 siblings and their individual wants of their father and of the pit bull china on whom so much is staked equally well drawn are the exquisite descriptions of place from the water and junk logged pit that is the home of the batiste siblings the lone bathroom in the school gym to the spectacular finale of the hurricane itself this is a slim volume that takes place over a mere 12 days but it is a book that stays in the mind long after the reading is finished it's that good","1273":"the language was brilliantly descriptive but the story was too dreary for me","1274":"this was a wonderful book very touching i would highly recommend it not light hearted so be ware very sad and real","1275":"very affecting sad and compelling novel of mississippi rural folks getting ready for hurricane kartrina shows the bitter deep poverty of this family and how even though things them 'the system' everything is against them they are still human and deserve dignity and compassion winner of national book award 2011","1276":"my main issue with this book is the almost glorification of dog fighting i cannot comprehend where the honor she speaks of in her interview is in it you are allowing an animal whom you share a bond with almost like family be injured even quite possible killed for what honor let's be clear there is no honor in dog fighting it is animal cruelty you are causing an animal pain for your own purpose that combined with detailed descriptions on teenage sex because saying no took some sort of effort just left me with a sick feeling in my stomach","1277":"this book will take some thought which is one thing i like about it this book is violent dirty scary gritty poignant my favorite character is esch i like her progression set against the backdrop of the mythology of medea and the occurrence of hurricane katrina from little girl to potential mother the violence of the dog fighting is shocking and saddening but it is part of these characters' world i won't soon forget this book","1278":"this book was heart breaking i just wanted to reach in and rescue esch but absolutely amazing writing i loved the way she painted skeetah so that you slowly grew to realize that the book was just as much about him as it was about esch jesmyn ward is a master the words whether they're describing a vicious dog fight pounding rain or a hug between siblings bring tears to your eyes hard to read but worth every minute","1279":"another view of katrina ravishing the mississippi coast dirt poor family survives vivid and engaging","1280":" tournament of books 2012 mother figures and their absence are a big theme in this year's tournament here a new orleans family struggles to adjust after the death of their mother as hurricane katrina approaches using the narrator esch a pregnant teenager and katrina ward explores the myth of medea and the power of motherhood to create and destroy i liked this book despite my initial expectations ward spins a story with a great deal of ugliness in it but it is also balanced by the love and attachment between the characters this is the only tournament of books 2012 book so far to put a lump in my throat it is also the only book that i would have done bodily harm to someone who tried to interrupt me during the last 50 pages powerful","1281":"not for light reading","1282":"this book made me rethink almost everything i thought i knew about every topic it touches poverty katrina even dog fighting an important beautiful book hard to read in places probably even harder to write these characters will stay with me for a long long time","1283":" this is the story of esch who at 15 finds out she is pregnant she lives in poverty stricken mississippi with her brothers and father her brother skeetah is preoccupied with his pit bull china and her pups her brother randall wants to get into basketball camp so he has a chance at going to college and esch is terrified of the baby growing inside her the entire book takes place over the 12 days leading up to hurricane katrina it involves preparing for the hurricane taking care of their drunken father and the dog fighting culture that seems to prevail among the men in the area it is a very well written book with a likeable main character but it is not for the faint of heart","1284":"one that will surely be declared an american classic salvage the bones gives voice to an often ignored largely marginalized group while honestly and sincerely shedding light on an american tragedy and those affected by it jesmyn ward is a brilliant writer who knows how to find and bring to light the most human moments in inhumane situations","1285":"i heard about this book when it was announced this years winner of the national book award for fiction the author is from and still lives in a small coastal town in mississippi got her mfa at uofm and teachs creative writing at the university of southern alabama to say that this is a powerful story is putting it mildly it begins slowly 12 days before hurrican katrina arrives and then just like katrina it moves along rapidly to the aftermath to quell the physical and emotional violence and uncover the characters in this place of new beginnings although sometimes too nasty to linger over i had to keep reading ward 34 accepted the national book award saying i understood that i wanted to write about the experiences of the poor and the black and the rural people of the south so that the culture that marginalized us for so long would see that our stories were as universal our lives as fraught and lovely and important as theirs in her acceptance speech ward said she was inspired to become a writer because the loss of her younger brother inspired her to create something permanent the award in some ways makes her novel more permanent she said i definitely feel that way it's funny because later that night there's an after party with drinking and dancing all that time my characters from salvage the bones kept flashing through my head i kept thinking about them this is going to sound weird but i was happy for them because i feel like they were being recognized and they were being seen and that this meant that the audience that would read their story and live with them would be even larger so in a weird way i was happy for my characters because they gained this audience this novel should make you sad and angry and appalled i will never live the life that these characters experienced but reading this novel took me there and left me satisfied and hopeful they and jesmyn ward deserve a larger audience","1286":" as much as i love laura miller and her reviews i did disagree with her argument in salon a few years ago that prizes like the national book awards were becoming irrelevant by picking less popular books i hear too much about the marriage plots and karen russells and jonathan franzens of the world much as i appreciate and love many of them if it wasn't for this book's win i would never have discovered it or its talented and promising author this slender novel chronicles the lives of the poor batiste family before during and after hurricane katrina decimates their town our narrator is the articulate and thoughtful teenager esch who worries about her newly discovered pregnancy even as the hurricane looms it's by no means a perfect book while the medea passages are ravishingly beautiful -- esch has recently learned about the myth in school and is taken with the parallels between the forlorn medea's life and her own -- they're hammered in a bit too much for my taste nevertheless esch is convincingly achingly young and desperate and the novel is filled with such poignancy such beauty and tragedy that many of my qualms about it were mitigated jesmyn ward frustrated by her earlier lack of success was about to enter a nursing program before her first novel was accepted for publication if the prizes like the national book award can point attention to lesser known and marginalized yet talented writers such as ward then i think they've done their job","1287":"oof this book is set in a poor town in mississippi in the days immediately before hurricane katrina hits and the sense of foreboding just permeates every page there's a real sense of terror here both about the storm and the life ahead of the main character heartbreaking and scary","1288":"powerful story although i had a hard time with china not at all my image of a dog i still think about this book often","1289":"ok i have to admit it i felt an abundance of awe while reading salvage the bones by jesmyn ward the sort of awe inspiring admiration an avid reader's experience while reading a novel whose lyrical prose is so breathtaking that you know you've just discovered your new favorite author ward has received numerous notable attentions for this novel including the national book award for fiction after reading it i can undoubtedly understand the reason the accolades were given the novel begins on a humid mississippi summer in 2005 readers are introduced to the batiste family eleven days before hurricane katrina makes her violent mark upon the coastal town of bois sauvage ms the story is told in first person narrative by the main character esch a coy fourteen year old girl who seems to waddle in despair over the failure of an idolized crush and holds an immense amount of uncertainty of her self worth esch is the sole feminine presence in the household which consists of her father and three brothers esch's mother rose had an untimely death years before resulting from the complicated birth of junior the youngest member of the batiste family with no female influences present esch has taken on the role of the mother of the house only to discover that the role may soon become a permanent responsibility in her life although the novel spans twelve days and leads up to the climatic point of when the storm lands ward demonstrates a remarkable ability at creating relatable characters esch is the main character however her three brothers and fathers are also notable figures in the book the batiste family resides in a rural poverty stricken area in the coastal regions of mississippi randall is the oldest sibling in the family and the most athletic with his keen and precise basketball skills he is presented as the practical figure in the family especially when his drunken father claude is uselessly milling around their yard searching for junk and scraps this spacious area of land is known as the pit jason also referred to as skeetah is the second oldest and is described as an incredibly fearless and unapologetically stubborn young man he also shares a seemingly passionate love affair with china a female pitbull doused in a pristine white coat and regarded as a vicious dog fighter within the community the relationship between skeetah and china borders the union between man and wife lastly there is junior the youngest at seven years old and is described as the typical energetic boy whose curiosity of the world allots him with mischievous adventure salvage the bones is a brilliant novel that showcases the unconditional love of family the enduring support of community and the unconventional love that can be forged between man and animal the narrative delves into the harsh realities of poverty while illustrating the power of survival with each turn of the page ward not only offers a memorable story however readers are engorged in such melodic lyrical expositions that it reads like poetry i highly recommend this book to others","1290":"ward is a gorgeous writer weaving together beautiful prose the myth of medea jason and the argonauts and hurricane katrina parts of it are a bit grisly for what i typically enjoy reading but i'm glad i read this 2011 national book award winner","1291":" wow i was hesitant to pay 14 99 for my nook book but after picking it up and flipping through it i figured it would be money well spent i was so glad i did this book actually got me hooked and attached to each and every character i talked about this book to anyone who would listen i remembered where i left off without having to go back a paragraph it was poetic and gripping i had some issues with the dog fighting paragraphs in the middle but the author did well making sure nothing happened to china as im sure she knew it would alienate her readers i wont give away much more but i will put this on my highly recommended list","1292":" how can something so raw and violent and bleak and hopeless be beautiful and sentimental and push through a tiny glimmer of shiny shiny hope if someone told me i would read a book with dog fighting as a central theme and come away with snot streaming from my nose and tears wiped all over the backs of my hands and not tears from mourning any dead dog but tears hoping hoping hoping for better things on the other side of the hurricane why i just would have said we'll see about that expecting to tolerate the book and then swearing off jesmyn ward from here on until eternity but nope i've just added where the line bleeds to my to read list the story of the batiste family has been moving toward a swirl and burn since rose died and with the backdrop of a category 5 storm building building and choosing it's target of destruction more things than any human spirit can handle come bulls eye toward this family made up of esch skeetah randall junior their father and their dogs","1293":"so here i was thinking this book was going to be about hurricane katrina waited a long time to read it because i didn't want to taint it with my opinions of zeitoun nor have my opinion of that one be ruined by another katrina book then it was about dogfighting well not all about it but too much for my liking the katrina parts were actually my favorite i think it is worth reading but it wasn't as good as i was expecting","1294":"finished with my heart in my throat then saw pictures of hurricane isaac's devastation towards the end of the book a recurring refrain alive alive alive alive","1295":" wow this book was amazing but incredibly hard to read esch's lack of self esteem and slavish devotion to a boy who treats her like crap is so painful but she does mature some and at the end of the book there is hope that she is starting to recognize the value of being with a boy who cares about her and treats her with respect still she has a baby coming and no matter how much support she has 14 is simply too young to become a mother her fate is sealed even more difficult is the dog fighting i volunteer with a dog rescue that rescues a lot of pitbulls and the idea of those poor sweet animals being forced to fight just kills me i had a very hard time with the idea that skeet could truly love and be devoted to china and still fight her especially after she had just given birth real love doesn't put ego ahead of the object of one's affection","1296":"wonderful story of a really poor black family in louisiana during time of katrina author evokes the setting characters with a deft hand language is gritty this book is not for the faint of heart some of the scenes where pit bulls are fighting for money and glory are absolutely horrific the family bonds are touching yet never overdrawn the reader is treated as an intelligent being who doesn't need to be told what to think","1297":"i bumped this up to two stars based on the last couple of chapters where the book finally started to hold my interest i just could not get into this at all definitely underwhelming i can't even quite pinpoint what it was maybe the writing it was quite a slugfest and the only reason i completed it was because i had committed to it for the lfpc group now let me run over there to read the discussion then 1 see why the majority liked it and 2 say why i didn't like it","1298":"i have a soft spot for books told in the pov of smart young girls in the heat of the south admittedly some are better than others tale of modern day hidden poverty low land living and scrappy survival that climaxes in a first hand account of hurricane katrina at times the writing was beautiful","1299":" i feel like a jerk had i not known that the impending hurricane was katrina i would have thought this was written in the '60's or was taking place in the 60's ie playing in the tarpit no floor for the dogs b w tv with rabbit ears birthing a child at home getting pregnant at an early age stealing from the white man's farm running barefoot through the woods one of the hints i knew it was in real time other than katrina was the purchase of ramen noodles for the storm i guess not much has changed over the years maybe that's the point and why it was so sad and why i feel like a naive jerk","1300":"i think this book could have done so much more if it were more focused i like the characters but i wish a couple of them weren't so stereotyped","1301":"i'm not sure the voice of the narrator always rang true as a teenager but apart from a few quibbles this was a very good read it also made for a terrific discussion at today's book club thought provoking stuff i'll be very interested in reading her upcoming memoir","1302":"violent heartbreaking hopeful and full of a raw beauty first novel i've read centered on hurricane katrina ward also gives an authentic portrait of poverty family and the south","1303":" i wavered between 2 and 3 stars and wish i could have marked a 2 5 i felt for the plights of the characters but i just didn't like them too well i'm an animal lover and had a hard time with all the dog fights i had a hard time with esch giving herself to any boy who wanted it definitely not a role model i realize esch is not intended to be a hero but i would like a stronger character as the protagonist yes the characters are a product of their upbringing but i had hoped to see characters who rised above their unfortunate childhood randall almost did with basketball but i feel as though esch will be lost forever the writing was beautiful the characters just didn't do it for me","1304":"loss of innocence i get it already a more accomplished storyteller could convey her message without hitting you over the head with it over and over and over","1305":"i almost gave up just a few chapters in too brutal too sad to see small things die esch drew me back in though i couldn't forget her and even though i skipped a part i finished the rest of the book in one sitting ward's prose is brilliant and unblinking","1306":"took me a little more effort to finish but an interesting story about a mississippi family the week of hurricane katrina the storyline somewhat reminded me of a great movie i recently saw beasts of the southern wild i e a poor family must scrape together supplies to prepare for the pending storm while dealing with strained friendships and relationships","1307":"read this book you will not be disappointed the writing is excellent and the characters truly are unforgettable your heart will break reading about esch and her family and the extreme poverty they live in plus you won't be able to put the book down once hurricane katrina makes her way to their home and starts wreaking all sorts of havoc consisting of twelve chapters each one representing a day in the life of the batiste family salvage the bones tells the gripping story of four siblings and their drunken father all of whom are trying to make do with the various situations they find themselves involved in we have a pregnant fourteen year old named esch who is trying to work up the courage to tell manny her crush and brother's best friend that he is about to be a father all the while hiding her baby bump behind baggy clothing an older brother nicknamed skeetah who is obsessed with making sure his one true love china is mending well after giving birth to her first litter of pups and then their is randall who is trying to figure out how to get himself to basketball camp and junior the baby brother who always seems to be in the way rounding out the story is claude the patriarch of the batiste family he's busy drinking and talking about hurricanes that he has no idea what his children are really up to throw in a hurricane of epic proportions and you got yourself a story so mesmerizing that you won't be able to take your nose out of your book i haven't felt so emotionally engaged with a book in so long that reading salvage the bones was a great reminder of how fantastically riveting literature can be this book focuses on family tragedy abandonment and poverty in such an honest way that you can't help but become consumed by the batiste's dramas and livelihood you want nothing but the best for these four forgotten children who have had to grow up too fast too soon on a personal note having experienced a hurricane as devastating as katrina firsthand mine was hurricane andrew i can definitely attest to the realistic portrayal of the flooding howling winds and destructive aftermath of trees bent in half roofs torn off buildings cars overturned and houses reduced to piles of rubble reading all about the preparations of boarding windows gathering supplies filling the sinks and tubs with water and hearing about evacuation instructions made me think back to my own experience i could remember the feelings of uncertainty fear and disbelief at not only witnessing the destructive storm but also upon seeing the complete destruction of my home and the town i grew up in it was as if ward had taken a peek at my memories about a storm i had long forgotten about and brought them out for me to revisit my heart was racing as i read about the batiste's house flooding through and how they struggled to find shelter from the storm i felt like i was getting pelted with water and if a book can touch you on a variety levels just like this one did for me then it is definitely a book worth reading i would recommend jesmyn ward's salvage the bones to everyone it is a must read you will love it","1308":"depressing but i couldn't put it down","1309":"one of the best things i've read this year walk a mile in esch batiste's shoes","1310":"disturbing at times but loved the authors ability to tell a story i would definitely read another book by her i also admired the willingness to not insert any political message but stick to plot","1311":"interesting story about a family's struggles with life","1312":"a good read although it can be difficult for the reader to work through the sexual abuse of a young girl but the story draws you in and holds you the brother's relationship with his dog is fascinating and the whole family dynamic is absorbing beautifully written raw and memorable","1313":"i loved her lyrical use of language and couldn't put this book down it's obvious to me why this was voted national book award winner for 2011 and now i want to read her first one","1314":" brutal and enchanting salvage the bones is a contemporary coming of age story set in a rural coastal town in the deep south the narrator esch struggles with an unwanted pregnancy unrequited love and keeping her family an alcoholic father three largely unattended brothers together in the ten days before hurricane katrina hits ward handles her subject matter gracefully and unsentimentally the story focuses on the character development instead of the ravages of katrina itself her prose is lyrical but never maudlin even in her explorations of heavy topics rural black poverty animal cruelty alcoholism a scene about dogfighting shows ward's strength the best it is particularly hard to read but well constructed despite the terrible act taking place as a reader you can empathize with the dogs dog owners and bystanders alike highly recommended","1315":"one of the best books i have ever read powerfully written with prose so moving it will take your breathe away i was so moved by this family with their sense of loyalty and togetherness amidst their overwhelming poverty i could feel how devastating a hurricane could be yet you could feel they still had hope after everything they had been through fantastic book","1316":"beautiful poetic this book reminds me a lot of the movie that came out summed 2012 beasts of the summer wild","1317":" salvage the bones is a beautifully crafted depiction of the raw brutality of poverty in the deep south when you read the book jacket you think you are about to engage in another account of the horrors wrought by katrina on those living on the gulf coast while the storm is certainly present throughout ward's novel this is less a story about a storm's devastation and much more a compelling drama about how much it sucks to be poor in a land of so much wealth to be black in a country where race still matters more than most want to admit to be a woman in a male dominated world to be hungry when your more well off nieghbors seem to have so much and to be injured in a world where access to care is not truly available for those without means ward crafts the tale of a poor rural family and chronicles the hope that somehow drives so many through this despair even if that hope is merely representative of the most needy clinging to dreams that are likely to never materialize she masterfully creates skeeter who longs to make some big money by breeding puppies via his pit bull china esch who we learn becomes pregnant at age 14 yet trusts that manny will one day love her the way she so loves him randall who hopes he can overcome an injury and make it to the nba daddy who hopes to garner some quick cash cleaning up in katrina's wake and all the residents of bois sauvage who belive they can ride out the storm and return to their lives alas china is lost in the storm randall loses a scholarship to a basketball camp when his borthers disrupt his practice before the scouts manny refuses to admit paternity and falls for the local hussy daddy loses his fingers in a freak accident and the storm washes away the community hopes dashed yet the characters somehow find ways to cling to new hopes and carry on ward dramatizes this quixotic human condition perfectly in the form of skeeter who refuses to leave the hollowed out shell of the family home insisting that china will return the novel ends with none of the outcomes of these hopes known everything is up in the air the reader only gets to know the characters for a few days but becomes so familiar with their troubles and the paths they long to pursue to lead them to a more promised land ward's literary genius leaves the reader hanging though much like the characters are left hanging and waiting and hoping for a better life to come along a life we all know is not likely to materialize ward's prose is lyrical at times her characters are vibrant and richly developed she paints a picture of the south like harper lee or hawthorne or karen russel in swamplandia this is a fine fine work and well deserving of the accolades it has received","1318":"this was a tough read poverty hurricane katrina teen pregnancy and dog fighting are not subjects that make easy reading i enjoyed the author's prose the language may not reflect what the character would actually say but i feel that it reflects what a bright teen might think to herself i really enjoyed the book despite the rough ingredients it is more than the sum of its parts","1319":"it is a completely new world to me rural poor and black in the days leading up to the arrival of hurricane katrina i could listen to jesmyn ward write about the weather all day i feel the throat closing heat like a wet blue blanket and hear the sounds of the summer insects","1320":"really compelling saroyanesque ward's writing is lively and sharp she portrays rural mississippi without getting bogged down in flowery language i was turning the pages because i had to know how the family fared when hurricane katrina hit","1321":"enjoyed this and tore through it quickly but i found the greek mythology tie ins unnecessary and forced maybe because i'm not familiar with that story but i felt like the story was strong enough to stand on its on so the insistence on returning to that just felt like too much despite that it was a captivating story and provided some precious insight to the question a lot of privileged folks asked why didn't those people just leave","1322":"a beautifully written tradgey definitely a worthwhile story","1323":"it was hard to read about dogfights but really well written and a gorgeous portrayal of anticipating katrina enduring the storm and her terrible aftermath the thing i truly enjoyed was the way that esch was blatantly honest even though sometimes just in her mind and comes of age in a way that nobody should have to but gets on with life anyway uncomfortable but beautiful at the same time","1324":"so disturbing but so wonderful i could not quit reading it although it made me uncomfortable she has created characters you do not believe you can care for and then you do i loved it","1325":"salvage the bones is set in the small mississippi town of bois sauvage which is about to be devastated by hurricane katrina it's not really a disaster novel really though it's more of a family drama the family in question are the batistes esch the 15 year old daughter and only girl of the family her mother died giving birth to her younger brother junior is the narrator she has strong bonds with junior and her older brothers randall and skeetah rounding out the family is the father a tragic man who hasn't really coped with the responsibility of raising four children and the job of raising junior has largely fallen to his three older siblings the novel commences with a birth skeetah's dog china gives birth quite graphically i might add to a litter of five puppies one of which is stillborn we learn very early that esch is also pregnant a fact that she wants to conceal from the world as long as possible it should be clear by now that the notion of parenthood is a key theme in this book whether it be china mothering her puppies skeetah mothering china esch coming to grips with being a mother to be or randall taking on the role of emotional father from the biological father that is not up to the task it's a theme that is explored from many angles i have not only given salvage the bones a 5 star rating but i've also placed it in my favorites folder it's beautifully written and has powerful stories running through it what really impressed me though was how it transported me into another world i didn't just witness the events unfolding i experienced them that's not to say that they were all pleasant experiences they included a chapter devoted to a brutal dogfight which i found sickening and compelling in equal measure i sometimes have a perception that female authors struggle with this type of prose but ward has done an excellent job of creating realistic and uncomfortable scenes that hover close to a line of decency without ever crossing it these scenes are powerful and absolutely essential i obviously recommend this book","1326":" it saddens me that this contemporary story of poor rural southern blacks should be so similar to that of their early 20th century forebears as told in zora neale hurston's their eyes were watching god so little has changed for these americans like hurston's ward's novel is vivid with powerful imagery and as moving as greek tragedy both climax with a devastating hurricane salvage the bones should put the essential katrina story on the shelves as a classic for all time that i didn't award it five stars is because of my aversion to pit bulls and dog fighting so central to this tale but that is on me not on this immensely talented young author it does perfectly convey the harshness and brutality of these people's lives their struggle to survive the characters spring off the page in their authenticity and the action builds along with the approach of the hurricane both are intensified by ward's lyricism selfishness and cruelty abound but in the end are overpowered by the nurturers and protectors even if their triumph is only to have found the best in themselves","1327":"read this if you liked beasts of the southern wild and vice versa","1328":"pointless references to mythology punctuate the animal savagery of this rather bestial family for whom life seems to revolve around fucking and dogfighting not my favourite read so far this year","1329":"this book made me feel such a mix of emotions and made me feel them so powerfully that i know ward is an amazing writer i'm glad i picked it back up and finished it","1330":"this is not a book i would normally pick up it was recommended by a podcast i really respect this book had a great scene with a dog fight that was really well written","1331":" salvage the bones is a very powerful and moving novel about a father and his four children who prepare for and survive hurricane katrina there are some books that hurt as you read for instance disgrace by jm coetzee beloved by toni morrison and bastard out of carolina by dorothy allison these books are not only sad but strike a cord that rattles you to your core there are sad books that make you cry but don't have the same effect where you are seeing the injustice of the world and are only able to observe and not kill the raper or the abusive father or the slave owner salvage the bones struck a similar cord esch is a 15 or 16 year old girl whose mother died in childbirth when esch was seven years old she lives with her two older brothers skeetah and randall her younger brother junior and her drunk father they live in the backwoods in coastal mississippi and essentially survive off of disability checks in the days leading up to hurricane katrina her father is obsessed about preparing for the storm skeetah is obsessed with keeping his new pit bull puppies alive and esch discovers that she is pregnant what really hurt me was esch's lack of respect for herself and her body she would have sex with any boy who wanted it because it was easier to say yes than no she didn't seem to understand that she was an object to them and not a person to make matters worse she is in love with manny the father of the child who deserves not one ounce of love and respect out of all the boys in her life she loves the worst one it was hard to read happily esch seems to come out of the storm a stronger and more confident woman with a family that will support her i also had a hard time reading about skeetah's dog fighting i absolutely hate the concept and i hate everyone who partakes it in there is only one dog fighting scene in the book and i quickly scanned over it till i got to the outcome of the fight esch's family is not perfect but they come together in the storm the author jesmyn ward was caught in hurricane katrina and her experience and esch's family's experience really sheds light on what it is like to ride out a storm and how easy it is to get caught in a situation that you cannot handle it was a very beautiful in a sad and tragic way novel about the poor south and what it means to be a family","1332":" i think part of my frustration with this book is that the setting and character mannerisms are depicted by in part by a culture and society that is so incredibly foreign extreme poverty uneducated yet familiar american south which makes some of decisions they make in the novel or way they think about things a bit hard to digest the story here is all about heart and it does very well on that front but there were times where i felt that the characters were just too unreal in their decision making to make me empathize as much as i should","1333":"this book brought hurricane katrina to life for me","1334":" this book won a national book award and i can see why both characterization and plot tension are so well done its strong sense of humanity draws the reader in it is a hard book to put down ward calls herself a failed poet and you can see the poetess in the book's lyrical style juxtaposed against the unfathomable tragedy of katrina throughout ward makes use of a medea metaphor which due to her exceptional writing skills isn't out of place or forced it gives the story a universality that reaches beyond the circumscribed setting and time ward makes use of other metaphors and of symbols that resonate throughout the book it is one of the better books i've read this year","1335":" let me begin by saying that the composition and the heart of this story deserve five stars that however is not what the goodreads rating system asks did i like this story hmmm not really the characters alcoholic father marginally employed young teen who found sex at 12 and has engaged in it pretty regularly since deals with pregnancy her brother skeetah raises a killer pit bull and a litter and the pit bull kills even its pups the older brother who loses out on a basketball scholarship and labors with a bum knee the family lives in the bayou in a place falling down impoverished katrina is in the offing and by the end levels the home and the family's lives there is never any real hope for any of the characters except except the last chapter set in katrina's aftermath offers some in a brilliant sort of fashion homes lie ruined trees lie leveled people scrounge for supplies the pit bull was lost in the storm and the boy who loves her waits and believes in her return the boys' siblings wait with him and watch","1336":"warning dog lovers set in an impoverished mississippi bayou where dogs are bred to fight and are better fed than children salvage the bones portrays 1 family u0026amp their pit bulls up until then during katrina i don't do spoilers but suffice it to say several plot lines are delicately woven into this gripping poignant u0026amp very real story stick with it through the grit u0026amp you may be stunned at the poetic writing u0026amp mesmerizing events i was drawn into a world i know nothing about u0026amp came away with bit of an understanding of it","1337":"$2 at half price books so i figured what the heck and taking a break from my self indulgent escapist summer of sci fi 2013 cue fanfare surprisingly i really loved this book ward a native of mississippi is a deep thinking storyteller who crafts a coming of age story with tones of greek myth and throws in pitbulls to create a gritty b i usually steer clear of books about katrina 9 11 or other prominent news events but i picked up this national book award winner on clearance for $2 at half price books so i figured what the heck and taking a break from my self indulgent escapist summer of sci fi 2013 cue fanfare surprisingly i really loved this book ward a native of mississippi is a deep thinking storyteller who crafts a coming of age story with tones of greek myth and throws in pitbulls to create a gritty bloody katrina survival story she writes what she knows her own family having lived through a direct hit by katrina i love her insight into the complicated relationships between the members of this family which is the true focus of the story so very modern and at the same time so very greek tragedy like","1338":"beautiful poetic writing jesmyn ward is a native of mississippi so she writes the rural deep south perfectly her metaphors never stray and you can feel the sticky hot sun and smell the woods and the rain the characters are a loving family trying to survive as hurricane katrina is building in the gulf my only hesitation at recommending this book is that part of the plot involves dog fighting in graphic detail i had to skim some of it to be honest recommend with reservations","1339":"writing at its best an outstanding story teller a credit to a long line of southern writers","1340":"loved it innovative great writing made me think for days","1341":"gritty visceral read","1342":"i thought this was a very intense story of humans dogs gods and mother nature all in one this book is not for the queasy","1343":"beautifully written but the subject matter was difficult to read","1344":"this was one of those books that stuck with me days after reading it always a sign of a good one in my opinion having spent a large part of my life in mississippi i enjoyed the reference and appreciated the compassionate yet matter of fact portrayal of the characters and story","1345":"excellent piece of recent historical fiction","1346":"sad story but amazing writing","1347":"verbose yet heartwarming tale of a teenage girl who discovers she's pregnant days before hurricane katrina hits i could have done without the mythology parallels especially since i thought her story was better mirrored by that of china her brother's champion fighter pit bull a great read overall","1348":"this review has been hidden because it contains spoilers to view it click here this is a powerful and beautifully written story about love love among siblings the tremendously misplaced love of 15 year old esch the narrator for manny the father of her unborn child the love of a man for his lost wife the love of children for their lost mama and the all consuming love between a largely abandoned boy and his dog the setting is the home of a very poor family in rural mississippi in the days leading up to hurricane katrina ward structures the book like a diary with e this is a powerful and beautifully written story about love love among siblings the tremendously misplaced love of 15 year old esch the narrator for manny the father of her unborn child the love of a man for his lost wife the love of children for their lost mama and the all consuming love between a largely abandoned boy and his dog the setting is the home of a very poor family in rural mississippi in the days leading up to hurricane katrina ward structures the book like a diary with each day having an entry the language is often poetic even when describing some very brutal events the story is told from esch's point of view esch has been reading greek mythology her summer reading assignment from school and sees parallels between her world and her reading isn't that the point of reading which give the novel more heft than it would have otherwise it also increases the anxiety level which is plenty high already with what the reader knows is coming to the gulf coast as katrina bears down on them as i read there were a lot of parts where i thought i knew what was about to happen and didn't want to watch the pacing of the writing was so pitch perfect that i couldn't look away the ending is what it needed to be spoiler alert it is for the most part a happy ending this is ward's second novel she published where the line bleedsin 2006 salvage the bones won the 2011 national book award more","1349":"the nba winner is a powerful novel which is very tough and realistic a poor motherless family of 3 teens and a 7 year old believe that they are not in a danger zone as katrina approaches their la home one of the boys is passionate about his fighting pit bull and her pups the young teen age girl looks for love and sex with the wrong boy it is a brutal story which also becomes very exciting it is a sad and difficult book","1350":"i really fell in love with the characters it is a sophisticated and nuanced story set immediately before during and immediately after hurricane katrina every paragraph feels full of detail painting a vivid picture of the characters and their environment i felt moved by the slow and persistent re surfacing of their dead mother throughout the story via their memories of her the force of this gentle and important person that is missing from their lives had such quiet power","1351":"there are two areas in this novel that were so compelling the pit bull fight was described with such ferocity that i was flinching as i read it i was also overwhelmed by the upcoming strike of katrina knowing what i know i was just petrified for this family overall an incredible read","1352":"a very strong narrative voice and an intimate introduction into a world very unfamiliar to me i would recommend this book to everyone","1353":" reading a distinct artistic voice remains one my great pleasures even if i know ahead of time that the writer's voice and acclaim precedes him her the surprise of the journey through the novel stays with me for a long time steinbeck's the winter of our discontent grabbed me like that so did kerouac's on the road along with mccullers' the heart is a lonely hunter rand's atlas shrugged robinson's housekeeping ishiguro's the remains of the day de saint exupery's the little prince and so on this morning i read jesmyn ward's salvage the bones in one sitting just under five hours ward is an artist make no bones about it the novel builds in subtle intensity and hits its stride just past the halfway mark i physically felt the anxiety and squirmed with impatience to read through the next page i had to slow myself down however so that i did not miss the joy of her craft beyond the story the layering of language is unlike anything i've read recently the first thing i want to share is that this is a love story the layers of love some frayed some broken some deep just dominates the subtext of each page from the mother's final words to the father never changing the bedroom to the photographs dad kept to way skeet attends to china the pitbull to what the protagonist craves from manny to what manny will never give her to the protagonist's coming to grips with what is growing inside of her the love of the father for his children to the love extended by neighbors after hurricane katrina hits to final images and moments in novel when big henry extends his love for the unborn child to skeet sitting and watching and waiting this is a brilliant study and journey of love and sadly i will not put it in my 8th grade classroom because of the mature nature of some of the scenes i don't hold it against the book or author by any means and perhaps i shouldn't be so cautious with a beautiful book but it's just the world we live in now which is a shame but that is another story however this does not in anyway reflect on the book i make the point of it here to illustrate the power between these pages this novel is a shared experience i defy you to read it and put it and down and pass it off and out of your memory you can't do it the raw beauty ward etches into the reader can be traced to her command of nuance within the severity of the subject matter my personal loathing and discomfort for dog fighting should have triggered my hands to clap the book closed hey i can't even watch marley and me however i didn't close the book until i read through to the final page a strong case can be made that this story belongs to the main pit bull in the story china to a certain degree this is her story used as a pawn on the surface the reader slowly discovers that the money china earns from birthing pups because she is a legendary fighter will go to this family it's what they do it is a part of the culture barely making it on ramen noodles and eggs found around their property additionally and most relevant china's owner loves her and she loves him back i'm convinced of it it is hard to imagine making a main character a dog who doesn't speak so ward gives us esche the only significant female in the story who isn't killed off we live the story through esche and while she has the arc and she experiences change and the story runs through her i have to argue that much of the same can be said about china china's journey in many ways mirrors esche's i'm a new and enormous fan of ward and salvage the bones through some raw and gritty subject matter she grabbed my bones and wrung them out for just over four straight hours until i was left with nothing but empathy and wonder in my heart i know what happened to china and it is just devastating to walk away from the final page of the book because i also know i'm going to carry it with me for a long time","1354":"a very difficult read if you love dogs the description of dog fights were way to graphic for me the description of the hurricane a little unrealistic and the characters were not well developed","1355":"this was a national book award winner for 2011 and and alex award winner for 2012 bleak but lyrical tale of a young african american teen girl who narrates twelve days before during and after hurricane katrina hits in her rural community in mississippi two older brothers one younger brother and an alcoholic father","1356":"the last chapters about katrina i couldn't put the book down and had tears in my eyes the whole time amazing","1357":"i read salvage the bones because it was the first fiction i have seen on the topic of hurricane katrina and won the 2011 national book award for fiction i gave it two stars for those reasons but really it's only a one star for me the story line is uniquely told from the voice of a young poor pregnant girl who is very limited by her circumstances i appreciated the attempt to expose her situation but found nothing in the story to move me beyond being a very distant viewer the hurricane served more of a back drop and also was lacking in its emotional draw i wanted to feel more but i didn't what a disappointment","1358":"this winner of the 2011 national book award for fiction is a harrowing read but what i enjoyed most was the story of the sibling relationships","1359":"a story of the 11 days before and the day after hurricane katrina hits a mississippi town the national book award winner was excellent","1360":"this book while beautifully written has sections that get bogged down with metaphor detail mythology and sadness it does possess a certain faulknerian feel but something separates it from the great author the characters are well developed their situations dire and there is a feeling of hopelessness throughout the book that for my taste never had a chance to improve set against the warnings of hurricane katrina we follow a motherless family in rural mississippi as they prepare or in this case really don't prepare for the hurricane that is to come there are several graphic scenes in this novel most that involve dogfighting if you have a weak stomach this isn't the book for you i never felt he pay off at the end while the book certainly ended stronger than it began i didn't take a lot of satisfaction from reading this while the author has a strong voice and a story to tell it just wasn't for me","1361":"i really wanted to give this three and a half stars but oh well i didn't completely buy the voice and the ending why that ending page otherwise i was enthralled and invested","1362":"there is a lot of hub bub about this book i totally don't get it if someone else reads it please let me know i did not get into this at all","1363":"like in the story of edgar sawtelle this is a book in which a dog is definitely a central character the dog lover in me winced at the view spoiler dog fight that skeet enters her in hide spoiler still it is obvious how much he loves his dog as is evident from the lengths he goes to in order to take care of them esch narrates the novel but her own story felt secondary to that of skeet and china it did however go a long way in explaining the state of life for esch her siblings and her friends ward has a way with metaphors and descriptions that would make this book worth the read even without the interesting storyline even the weather comes to life almost like a character unto itself","1364":"almost too brutal and depressing to describe beautifully written perhaps too many topics in one book had to skim because it was too hard to read some parts","1365":" few things get my attention as quickly as a come from behind award win by a new or not widely known author and the 2011 national book award was won by a come from behind not widely known author jesmyn ward author of the previous novel where the line bleeds ward is assistant professor of creative writing at the university of south alabama for 2010 2011 she was the john and renee grisham writer in residence at the university of mississippi from 2008 2010 she had a stegner fellowship at stanford university need i say it she is a writer of exceptional talent and potential and hello world now everyone knows it salvage the bones is set in the mississippi gulf hamlet of bois sauvage in the days leading up to hurricane katrina the patriarch of the batiste family is attuned to the impending disaster smelling danger in the air having delivered his family through the furor of camille preparation is his obsession makes my bones hurt daddy said i can feel them coming meanwhile china veteran dog fight winning pit bull is preparing to give birth to her first litter of puppies and esch the fifteen year old daughter is coming to a realization she's pregnant by one of her brothers' friends juxtaposed with both of these events is the memory of their mother's death after giving birth maybe you need to help her china push i esch say sometime i think that is what killed mama i can see her chin to chest straining to push junior out and junior snagging on her insides grabbing hold of what he caught on to try to stay inside her but instead he pulled it out with him when he was born the batistes are a close family whose love and loyalty to one another are central to the story stronger than the job like challenges they face and stare down the father is an alcoholic who sometimes flies into drunken rages mostly taken out on his son skeetah but even that doesn't diminish their cohesive family unit they are as attuned to one another as their father to the oncoming storm as china the pit bull to her owner skeetah their love unconditional as the oppressive heat pushed ahead of katrina bears down on them esch skeetah and their father face the personal trials of their lives esch filled with the story of medea she's been reading is trying to conceal her pregnancy from her family while dreaming the father of the child will love her as she loves him skeetah fights for the survival of first china's puppies and then china the two as intertwined as lovers and their father a widower fighting to raise his family alone goes from strong family leader to an injured helpless man reliant on his children to take on his role for the protection of them all the layers in this story could be analyzed the references to mythology traced but frankly how many readers really want to never mind all that leave it to the professors to note the themes of love water blood and violence and tie them up neatly the story is urgent the characters burrow themselves under your skin then comes katrina the off stage character waiting three quarters of the book to make her appearance teeth bared and sharpened she furiously slams down her fist as they huddle together realizing with growing horror she is no camille the final quarter of the novel is a nerve wracking race to the finish life vs death katrina the god orchestrating the maelstrom the water rises the wind howls and ultimately it's up to skeetah most clairvoyant of them all to make the decision that will save or undo them and the writing is gorgeous it is terrible it is the flailing wing that lashes like an extension cord used as a beating belt it is the rain which stings like stones which drives into our eyes and bids them shut it is the water swirling and gathering and spreading on all sides brown with an undercurrent of red to it the clay of the pit like a cut that won't stop leaking it is the remains of the yard the refrigerators and lawn mowers and the rv and mattresses floating like a fleet it is trees and branching breaking popping like black cat firecrackers in an endless crackle of explosions over and over and again and again it is us huddling together on the roof shaking against the plastic it is everywhere daddy kneels behind us tries to gather all of us to him skeetah hugs china and she howls daddy's truck careens slowly in the yard so much talent in such a young writer so much to look forward to","1366":"i really enjoyed this book the narrator has such a powerful voice and the storyline while meandering at times and a bit jumpy kept me coming back for more highly recommend","1367":"i liked the characters a lot but i found the writing painful to listen to i had audio version a simile every other sentence","1368":"the only good part of the book was the ending i got tired of reading about the dog it would have been better to have more of a background of the family whether they were educated and how they interacted with the outside world of the pit i would like to know more about surviving after katrina or if that too happened in a day","1369":"this was a book set in new orleans just twelve days before hurricane katrina hit it is the story about a poor black family who love their family and their pet so much but are missing their mom who died in childbirth loved the voice in this book did not enjoy so much the dogfights really loved esch","1370":"in the 1950s the great movie studios painted sky high sets the 'outdoor' backdrops against which movies were filmed jesmyn ward set her stage with hurrican katrina katrina builds and threatens behind a family strong in their loves losses and disappoingments i felt the grit of the dirt in which they live experienced the intense feelings of a teenage boy and knew a teenage girl's need for love this is an amazing novel","1371":"a good story where a dog out shines the human characters an inside look into poverty and how the coming and aftermath of hurricane katrina affectedthat class","1372":"fifteen year old esch just found she's pregnant she keeps this secret to herself while watching her brother skeetah take care of his prize dog fighting pit bull china who just had puppies her oldest brother randall struggles to take care of the family while their alcoholic father tries to prepare for a coming hurricane their mother died giving birth to their youngest brother junior and the family's life in rural mississippi has been extra hard ever since this book was beautiful and raw both uplifting and upsetting it was a wonderful story about survival in the midst of poverty and adversity every character is really well developed i was both sympathetic to and frustrated with most of them at one time or the other this novel is told in the first person by esch and takes place over the twelve days leading up to hurricane katrina as the storm grows closer the tension builds the descriptions are so vivid it felt like i was there with them i could not put this book down for the last two chapters as the storm grew closer i'm not the only who loved this book - it's a national book award finalist for fiction this year winners will be announced november 16","1373":"this book won an alex award but i don't think i'll be ordering it for my school library although ward's portrayal of the brutal poverty and hurricane katrina is brilliantly descriptive the plot of the novel moves so slowly i'm not even sure i'd recommend this one to adult readers","1374":"beautifully written but brutal and depressing the story was still very compelling though","1375":"4 5 stars but rounding up this book is heartbreaking and brutal i couldn't put it down and now i can't stop thinking about it the reviews on the cover say it is bound to become a new classic and i can definitely see that","1376":"this story takes place in rural coastal mississippi covering the 10 days leading up to hurricane katrina the day of the hurricane and the day after the story is told from the perspective of 14 year old esch who at the beginning of the novel finds herself pregnant and desperately trying to capture the attention of the baby's father who cares nothing about her except for sex esch is the sole daughter in a family of four children being raised by a single father their mother died giving birth to junior the youngest son she also has two older brothers randall and skeetah this book is essentially the calm before the storm you see this family going about its lives but with the sense that something larger is brewing but without really understanding what it is unfortunately most of the characters seemed only caricatures i never really got a good sense of who randall junior or the father were they seemed to be side notes each with their own quirk even esch who is the narrator of the story seems to be not very well drawn mostly what you know about her is that she is pregnant and has been sleeping around because it seemed easier than not doing it when boys started going after her skeetah is really the heart of the story though the relationship he has with his pit bull china and her puppies that serves as the real meat of the story can be hard to take it is very obvious that he loves this dog more than anything else in the world and would sacrifice himself for her and yet this is juxtaposed with his use of her to make money and status through breeding her and entering her into dog fights it fits with who the character is even though it seems counterintuitive to think that someone who puts his dog in such horrible situations could love her so much the part about katrina was actually the weakest part of the story and i think that it actually would have been better for the author to end it just as the hurricane was arriving the descriptions of what happen during the hurricane to this family made little sense to me and the aftermath just seemed rather anti climactic to what you knew was building the entire time","1377":"probably one of the finest descriptive writers i've ever read what a gift she possesses the book was extremely gripping in that the reader knows what is coming and the characters don't the author did a tremendous job of relaying the thoughts and fears related to the surroundings and katrina as difficult as some of the chapters were to read it will leave an indelible mark in my thoughts and heart for the victims and survivors of that momentous hurricane","1378":" book was set in a low income coastal african american community near new orleans just prior to hurricane katrina the book was reviewed as an instant classic i would guess because of its insider view of the culture and interpersonal relationships in such communities certainly it was eye opening window into a world whites would never see it is the sense of seeing the hidden culture which gives this book its fascination even though some of what is seen is horrific by the standards of mainstream white america not knowing the background of the author i have to wonder whether it was based on personal experience or is simply yet another stereotyped outsiders view the story line builds with an increase sense of impeding doom knowing as we do what eventually happens in new orleans post katrina in that sense the book is somewhat disappointing with the storm and aftermath relatively anticlimactic given the events leading up to it","1379":"interesting book about a dirt poor family living in the outskirts of new orleans in the 10 days prior to hurricane katrina definitely a page turner interesting characters the dog fighting disturbed me but only because of the illicit details i could envision the people and places as i was reading both before u0026amp after the hurricane would recommend for an easy summer read but not fluff has substance","1380":" esch is a fifteen year old girl living in bois savage mississippi a hurricane is a brewing over the gulf of mexico and her father is growing concerned a hard drinker and largely a blank slate he doesn't show concern for anything other than the hurricane that he is preparing for esch and her three brothers are stocking food but there isn't much to save lately esch can't keep down what food she gets because she's fifteen and pregnant her brother skeetah is sneaking scraps for his pitbull's new litter dying one by one in the dirt by what they believe is parvo at the same time their brothers randall and junior are playing in the dirt going wild and having practically no parental supervision whatsoever will esch and her weak family be able to survive this hurricane especially with esch being pregnant a variety of people would enjoy this book most people would find this book to be entertaining and insightful i feel that the majority that would like it are young teenagers that can respect what this young girl is going through one specific target that might want to read this book is pregnant teenage girls they can definitely understand and feel what she was going through so they would definitely be able to connect with esch and this book in general my overall satisfaction with this book was a 3 star i honestly chose this book because of the dog on the front and that was a slightly misleading thing i like the idea of the book but it was really slow going plus it just wasn't what i had in mind now when i chose the book i had no idea that the girl in it would get pregnant and that there would be a hurricane but that it sure what happens also it has a lot of sex in it which i prefer not reading about especially if i feel like it will be about dogs","1381":"i loved this","1382":"do you ever hear that a movie is critically acclaimed and it makes you want to not watch it because critics evaluate movies on all of these esoteric details that aren't the same as the factors you use in rating movies i do i tried to read this book i tried to enjoy the book in the end i decided that this is the book equivalent of a critically acclaimed movie it's probably a fabulous book to novelists critics and literature professors","1383":"the book wasn't what i had expected after reading why the author wrote the book but it presents an engrossing if depressing view of poverty in the path of katrina","1384":"besides winning awards i wanted to read this because it claims to be the first novel about hurricane katrina only about the last 25% really has the storm in it the rest is preparing for the storm and the story of a poor family the girl is pregnant one boy is obsessed with his dog and another with basketball i liked the book","1385":"i picked this book up at the library on the new books shelf i am so glad i did it is one of the best books i have read this year jesmyn ward you are a voice to be reckoned with thank you","1386":" it can't be denied that this is a talented author the book is beautifully written and some of the plot is quite harrowing at certain points it's impossible to stop reading because one has to know what will happen still for me this book serves as an example that perhaps it's possible for a writer to overdose on the use of similes even if they are carefully crafted and often seem very original i found the onslaught of similes to be relentless at times to the point where in my mind i was crying out enough but perhaps i'm being overly picky about this it's a worthwhile book and i'm glad i've read it","1387":" the kind of book you don't want to finish the kind of book that inspires you to write that restores your faith in storytelling and in publishing i read slowly and savored everything i don't feel a need to summarize the novel you can find that on here or on amazon etc but i do feel the need to attach a sample of ward's gorgeous and gut wrenching prose truly inspiring when it comes to writing teaching setting in creative writing an excerpt from jesmyn ward's novel \"salvage the bones as we walk into the center of bois sauvage away from our pit the houses appear gradually hidden behind trees closer to one another until there are only ragged lots of woods separating them we walk past big henry's incongruously narrow shotgun house marquise's small pink house which has only three windows and sits in a yard so clustered with azalea seems like one more faded flower rich boy franco's house is green and for some reason someone in his family has painted the bottom two feet of the tree's trunks in his yard white some older boys named joshua and christophe have a blue gray house with a screened in porch along the side with bougainvillea grown to riot under the oaks in the yard and then there is mudda ma'am's yellow house faded to tan choked with wisteria manny's trailer is on the other side of bois sauvage away from this side of the neighborhood the small catholic church the haphazard cemetery skeetah mowed the county park with the dirt parking lot which strives to impose some order some civility to bois it fails the woods muddle the park's edges mimosa trees arch over it with a basketball player's long graceful arms and drop pink flowers like balls pines sprout up in the ditches along the edge of the park aside the netless basketball goals under the piecemeal shade of the gap toothed wooden play structure sinking into the earth beside the stone picnic tables with their corners worn smooth by rain even in the middle of the baseball field overgrown with grass maintenance workers usually county convicts in green and white striped jumpsuits come out once a year and halfheartedly try to trim back the encroaching wood mow the grass set to bloom the pine seedlings the wild things of bois sauvage ignore them we are left to seed another year","1388":" so strange to listen to this on my commute in december in minnesota though the long drives will always remind me of that beginning of the school year time my first year teaching hearing about the devastation on npr and slowly having my classes fill out in one's and two's with bewildered students coming up from the south for as long as they could stay for as safe as they could feel but really while the storm is there and its hugeness cannot be ignored it wasn't like other books that have come post events where the event seems stiff and makes the characters behave awkwardly instead ward integrates the warnings naturally just as naturally as we face dog fighting or fighting to save the dogs and unexpected unsupported by the father pregnancy there is a seamlessness that i admire in this storytelling i was eager to return to a longer drive so i could spend just a bit more time with the narrative","1389":" i thought that this book was pretty amazing it grows in intensity and as hurricane katrina unspools so do many subplots i loved the narrator sister her relationship with her brothers neighbors how they dealt with the death of their mother and grief alcoholism of their father i thought that the language was powerful poetic without ever being too mysterious or disorienting and simply beautiful to read its power and spell over me grew as the book progressed the characters grew more interesting their stories more compelling and the final katrina scene was tense gripping beautiful","1390":"this was an unsettling but fantastic book about all different kinds of survival set just before and during hurricane katrina","1391":"a very good book about a family during hurricane katrina","1392":" as the novel opens a hurricane named katrina is forming in the gulf of mexico and will threaten the mississippi coastal town of bois sauvage home to the batiste family - claude a widower and his four children randall skeetah esch and junior esch narrates the novel and is the only female save for her brother skeetah's pit bull bitch china even before the devastating natural disaster we all know katrina became this family struggles with personal storms every bit as devastating ... the death of their wife mother the bone crushing poverty and lack of opportunity the father's increasing reliance on alcohol to numb his pain and despair randall pins his hopes on basketball despite a bum knee and little hope of making it to the pros skeetah becomes the \"breadwinner\" - breeding china to make money on her pups so he can help pay for things his siblings need or want esch reads greek mythology and struggles to apply what she learns from the stories to her life while reaching out for what she thinks is love and junior tries to be the little boy he is - playing under the house fascinated with the puppies wanting to tag along with his older brothers and sister there is much here that should make a gripping work of literary fiction i generally love books like this but this one left me feeling decidedly \"meh \" and i'm having trouble defining why perhaps their situation is just so different my own that i couldn't relate to them but i've read many a book with characters whose lives are very different and i had no problem understanding and relating perhaps it was the very slow almost nonexistent plot but i've enjoyed plenty of character driven books with slow moving storylines perhaps it was the violence of dog fighting but i've read some books with graphic violence including animal cruelty and i was not put off by it the casual sex the rough language the use of dialect - aspects that have been criticized by other reviewers - are all elements i've appreciated in other books one area that i definitely felt detracted was her use of greek mythology i just did not think these references served the story well though i appreciated the poetry of these passages i think it must be the combination of all these factors that left me feeling dissatisfied i appreciate ward's writing but i didn't love it","1393":"there's nothing pretty about poverty or the cruelty of dog fighting however jesmyn ward writes about both in her latest novel \"salvage the bones \" with spectacular beauty esch the narrator is fifteen and living in a small mississippi town along the gulf with her alcoholic father and her three brothers one of whom loves his pit bull beyond all reason esch enthralled by the myth of medea and jason begins to see the story mirrored in her own life in her dealings with manny the young man she imagines she loves and in her brother's dog china whose instinct to kill seems to be fiercer than her instinct to nurture motherless esch is left the only girl in a house full of males and when she figures out she's pregnant she tells no one ward structures the book using time the story begins twelve days before hurricane katrina hits and each chapter is a separate day we're all familiar with katrina's devastation so tension is already built in but ward doesn't stop with a little bit of trouble she gives us characters so poor they'll eat ramen noodles uncooked and chase them down with a packet of dry spice she gives us a father stuck in his grief a pregnant narrator who's too young to be savvy in affairs of the heart and a mother pit bull raised to fight all on top of the category five hurricane bearing down on a family unequipped to properly prepare ttthe story gripped me from the start and there were a few moments in which i found myself holding my breath but what elevated this story from compelling to an absolute must read was the quality of language \"daddy said that randall and skeetah and me came fast that mama had all of us in her bed under her own bare burning bulb so that when it was time for junior she thought she could do the same it didn't work that way mama squatted screamed toward the end junior came out purple and blue as a hydrangea mama's last flower she touched junior just like that when daddy held him over her lightly with her fingertips like she was afraid she'd knock the pollen from him spoil the bloom she said she didn't want to go to the hospital daddy dragged her from the bed to his truck trailing her blood and we never saw her again \"despite all the tragedy this is a hopeful book a testimony to the power of love and community currently \"salvage the bones \" is a finalist for the national book award and this is one reader who's rooting for it review previously published in the pilot of southern pines","1394":"loved this book however scenes of dog fighting were difficult to read","1395":"so so bleak but so so beautiful there is a paragraph on page 255 that is some of the most gorgeous writing i have ever read in my life","1396":" i was impressed by the rawness of the characters and story in this book told from the viewpoint of esch a 15 year old motherless and pregnant child the book takes you through the life of a rural family that along with esch consists of an alcoholic father the oldest son hoping to get into a basketball camp as his ticket out an older brother raising a female pitbull to fight and a younger brother who has been raised completely by esch and the oldest after their mother died after his childbirth the author does not gloss over the plight of the rural poor and shows the strength of family motherhood is a constant theme running through the book from the loss of their mother to esch's pregnancy to the pitbull and her puppies and even to the hurricanes especially katrina i picked up the book on the recommendation of a friend and in turn i recommend this book to anyone who wants to get a vivid real picture into the life of possibly a neighbor","1397":"extremely well written with excellent character development thought the ending was a little too clean for such a gritty storyline though","1398":"brutal to read i had to put it down several times but poignant there are some plot devices i'm not a fan of the protaganist's obsession w the greek figure of madea felt forced but its a great story","1399":"never in a million years would i imagine reading never mind loving a book that has a pit bull as a central character the story is so powerfully written and violent and moving whew i need to take a break from any more katrina based novels for a while but it is incredible what stories have come from that disaster","1400":"did not finish it it was too disturbing for me","1401":"really enjoyed the book while the family is very poor the siblings are intelligent and trying to do the best for the family for one brother it is dog fighting and the other brother it is basketball they try to take care of each other","1402":"it took me about halfway through the book to get into the storyline this was very slow moving incredibly slow moving maybe because i expected to be snagged right away salvage the bones takes place in the days leading up to hurricane katrina and centers around 15 year old esch and her destitute motherless dog fighting family no matter how tragic a family reading about hurricane preparations and likewise dog fighting preparations isn't apparently my thing that said this is a very raw and brutal book at times beautifully rendered though the prose was kind of up and down \"desultory\" or some version thereof is used at least a half dozen times there are some things i loved i found esch's lackadaisical attitude toward her sexual activities heartbreaking and true the relationship esch has with her brothers and that of skeetah and his prized dog china are stunning the skeetah china juxtaposition of his absolute love for this dog versus the fact he puts her in dangerous situations e g dog fighting is powerful the whole medea thing wasn't quite working for me though and i actually rolled my eyes at the last few sentences for a hurricane katrina dogfighting novel this is actually kind of quiet i enjoyed it am glad i read it but expected to be knocked over nonetheless i am sure it is a work that will stay with me for a long time","1403":" i always feel a bit strange when i don't adore a book that has been generally met with high praise but i guess it can't be helped i just didn't feel like there was anything holding the narrative together including the voice of the young protagonist which could have been much more powerful there were too many themes without enough exploration into those themes is the book about survival in the face of extreme poverty is it about the strength of family is it about teen pregnancy is it about dead mothers and alcoholic fathers is it about hurricane katrina is it about fight dog breeding hint it's mostly about fight dog breeding ward's prose is beautiful for sure but i couldn't get my footing with the actual story","1404":"salvage the bones is a beautifully written harrowing story of the days leading up to hurricane katrina told by the teenage esch her widowed father is feebly attempting to prepare for the hurricane and is virtually ignored by his children who are absorbed in their own pursuits randall with basketball which may give him with opportunities that don't otherwise exist skeetah with his dog china whom he loves without measure and who seems to love him back junior with his need for physical contact and affection and esch who has just learned that she's pregnant esch longs for the love of her baby daddy a friend of one of her brothers even though he is clearly a jerk she and her brothers long for the love of their mother they try to recall things she has taught them and told them skeetah has already forgotten what her voice sounds like junior never knew her the only actual \"mother\" in the story is china who has just given birth to her first litter but don't think that she's portrayed as the angelic mother figure there's a depiction of a dogfight that was horrific to read as was another gasp inducing event involving china the family survives katrina no spoiler here the final chapter is titled \"alive\" although this is a work of fiction it gives us a view to what it was like inside those houses that we saw on tv in 2005 as grim as the circumstances are esch shows us the calm after the storm loyalty and hope win out i have a teensy tiny quibble with some of the author's metaphors in chapter 4 she tells us that the dog's bark was like a shovel dragged along asphalt wearing away to stones later in chapter 12 skeetah's voice sounded like a rake being dragged over rocks the first quote was poetic the second felt like a retread overall a really really good book","1405":" my short take on this was it was good but not great i was a bit surprised because it won the national book award and had heard ward interviewed on studio 360 and found her really interesting the good parts i think ward had some well developed characters and settings and their real life struggles poverty loss felt authentic the weaker parts for one nothing really resolves itself for good or for ill in the book and the descriptive prose and the literary allusions enough with the medea already were so overdone that it was distracting","1406":" wow i see that many of my friends loved this book i didn't the last two chapter of the book were it's salvage pun intended it felt like those chapters were written as a very powerful short story and then she tried to go back and write the rest of the story in my opinion the use of metaphors and smilies was way overdone many of the things on my list of strong dislikes in life appear ing this book my life as a vets wife made me hate parvo pit bulls and dog fights i had strong sensory reactions to the scenes where they appeared the occurrence of katrina will be forever linked to the death of my mother although they are not related louisiana my dad's wife blew in to our lives from louisiana on the tail winds of katrina the character development was strong but the characters are weak people who obviously have struggled with direction and morality since the death of the mother this book and the book life on the river are definitley part of the ongoing tragedy of american poverty the question in both of these books was how much is choice and how much is what they have been subjected to by society","1407":"didn't catch my attention even after 90 pages on to the next one","1408":"this novel was really enjoyable the narrator esch is someone that is easy to understand and sympathize with the novel covers the eleven days before katrina and one after ward does a good job in somehow allowing the children to bloom into full characters in a short amount of time and pages this was a good book club choice and the mentions of medea brought me right back to ib english 11 this would make a good weekend read","1409":"blech hated it and i'm actually pretty easy to please at first i thought the characters were somewhat interesting u0026amp then i just stopped caring way too slow moving u0026amp overly descriptive plus i abhor dog fighting which is a good portion of the story and it made me dislike most of the characters due to their involvement truthfully i only read 50% and then i started speeding reading skimming and skipping sections i cannot recommend this to anyone i know","1410":" it did not completely live up to it's praise but it could be that i was highly distracted while reading it salvage the bones was moving and sad and i would recommend it for students that want more out of their young adult reading than twilight or hunger games the characters are tough in their humanity and convincing as resilient we never stopped crying we just did it quieter we hid it i learned how to cry so that almost no tears leaked out of my eyes so that i swallowed the hot salty water of them and felt them running down my throat this was the only thing we could do i swallow and squint through the tears and i run 206","1411":"this is a phenomenal book beautiful immersive lyric powerful totally deserving of the 2011 national book award","1412":"well the heroine has a distinctive voice but i realized i didn't want to hear it depressing horrifying poverty and dog fighting and a devastating hurricane redeeming moment none predictable nice guy helps out when cool loser blows off girl dog is lost in raging waters sigh no","1413":"i can't really decide if i liked this book or not the writing style was interesting sentences within a paragraph were often disconnected of content but there was something poetic about the writing style the story itself seemed realistic almost too realistic it gave a clear picture of a family that obviously loved and took care of each other no matter what","1414":"life is reduced to raw essentials in this story and all the time you can feel the approaching train wreck that is katrina bearing down on louisiana poverty lives here and there is no hope no parental guidance and no money i was horrified enlightened and spellbound by their story it pushed and pulled my emotions in every direction until i felt wrung out and abandoned jesmyn ward uses language in a beautiful way that is unique and will not be soon forgotten","1415":"incredible great read","1416":"i thought this was a very good look at how impending tragedy does not change our every day lives","1417":"i was expecting the ending to be more climatic after the slow pressure build up to the storm instead i felt vaguely unsatisfied at the end and felt the prose itself was somewhat over the top nothing about the book really lingers with me","1418":"amazing literary tale sometimes very difficult to read especially the parts about the dogs still i kept reading and was rewarded by meeting a truly amazing real family characters fully developed thank you jesmyn","1419":" this novel was astounding i read it during a flight this weekend and when finished held my head in my hands and just cried this novel follows an impoverished family for the twelve days counting down to hurricane katrina the writing is raw spellbinding and visceral i was most impressed by the expert way the author integrated the tale of medea into the novel as a warning it does get graphic at times but so is life ugly and beautiful raw and poetic heartbreaking and uplifting i can't recommend it enough","1420":"quite good but i don't know that i bought the falsely hopeful ending it felt like she wanted to give readers a sense of redemption or a reward for persevering through brutality it didn't feel honest though","1421":"11th book out of a goal of 12 read in this year's tournament of books hoping to read the last brother next","1422":"brilliant writing unforgettable characters","1423":"i almost didn't read it when i read the plot summary but it is amazing it tells the story of a poor black family in the days leading up to and following katrina the narrative voice is strong and clear the characters are defined sometimes the author overwrites just a bit with too many similes but i was willing to forgive i just loved it","1424":"salvage the bones had quite a few beautiful and beautifully tragic passages for sure but alas by the halfway mark i was just ready to be finished and on to something more lively and engaging","1425":" i expected this to be a book about a family that endures hurricane katrina struggling to keep their children and pets alive instead katrina is a mere backdrop to the story and doesn't rear her head until the end the pets in the book are actually dogs raised for fighting underneath this is a powerful story about siblings who take care of each other and of unrequited love unfortunately there is so much detail about dogs raised for fighting that just didn't interest me that i almost didn't finish i'm glad i did but i won't be recommending this one","1426":"encouraged to read by daughter in law after having seen the beasts of the southern wild this story took on probably more significance for me great flick great bk about a life i live around but yet know or understand precious little well told w o pity or judgment acolades deserved","1427":"i waffled between giving this book 3 or 4 stars it started out a little slow for me but by the second half of the book it ramps up high when i started this book i knew that it takes place before a big hurricane sweeps through louisiana but somehow i didn't know the hurricane in question was katrina reading about the lives of esch and her family father and a bushel of brothers mom long dead i thought it was a time a lot farther back than katrina shows what i know about life in bois savage mississippi nothing as the hurricane approaches we mostly learn about esch and her interesting way of wording the world she sees around her we meet her brothers and their friends some of them nicer than others we also get a lot of dog pitbulls this book reiterates the well worn path of guys and their dogs one should never get between them china is a fighter dog and if you get squeamish at that you might need to hold on when you encounter that scene i had to look away when katrina hits devastation occurs and we all know this by now the way it is written blow by blow in the escalation and horrible surprise of what is happening makes it agonizing luckily it reads swiftly and is brief by this time you've come to know the members of the family and you worry with them and root for them to make it out","1428":"what a book","1429":" i don't think any book has made me feel as emotionally distraught as this one did a few movies requiem for a dream dogville have made me this wrecked but never a book i got on the wrong train twice today i blame the book and it wasn't that i was caught up in a page turning what happens next way i was just a mess living with these characters i hated this book and i loved it it is relentless unflinching and utterly lacking in compassion for the reader it's a force i'm half obsessed with the story and the writing and the audacity of publishing something so batteringly heartwrecking and can't stop telling people about it but i also can't imagine recommending it to anyone i want everyone to read it and no one to experience it","1430":"this book gives a compelling look at how naive uneducated people might fail to get out of the way of a hurricane and in many other ways let the pitfalls of life happen to them it made me remember how many people criticized the new orleans poor who lived in the low lands remaining and then ending up in great danger many many people in the u s and elsewhere live lives like the characters in this novel it's always good to have a fiction writer put the reader right in the middle of a life not the reader's own so the reader can gain an appreciation for such a life the characters the description of the setting and the action the interplay of it all with the hurricane bearing down and some of the characters thinking nothing would happen from the hurricane creates a great story i was reading sula at the same time and in both women were engaging in unsafe sex with what many would see as multiple partners with little concern for anything i saw some reviews indicating that people were put off by such descriptions but again it's important to learn the perspective of others in this world i learned of this author and this book because jesmyn ward appeared at and participated in the bea book expo america recently in new york city i'm glad i learned about her and the book this was a great book","1431":" for starters i have to pat myself on the back for making it through this i have three dogs and i love each one dearly dog fights no no no noooooo but ward is a very gifted incredibly talented woman she can make dogs attacking one another seem lyrical a girl who has no love for herself but a heart open for others is poetic the backwoods of louisiana is lush and beautiful even at it's worst points i was under the original impression this book told the story of a family's journey through hurricane katrina instead katrina is the catalyst for the joining of a family that is utterly broken each character is convoluted enough that i never knew if i truly liked daddy or skeetah or even randall the only characters that appeared to be black and white were manny and big henry the pretty callous boy and the large teddy man a solid 3 5 stars and a good book as good as the hype around it no but good nonetheless","1432":"i was mesmerized while reading the part when katrina comes ashore","1433":"exceptionally well written instead of an author merely telling a story this one uses prose as fabric weaving and binding and building each word essential with nothing left to spare a perfect study of the craft of story making","1434":" esch batiste is a 14 year old girl who lives in a rural town on the mississippi gulf coast along with her father claude and her three brothers randall skeetah and junior who was named for his father after his mother died soon after giving birth to him the kids are mainly left to fend for themselves subsisting on ramen noodles bologna and the hidden chicken eggs they gather as their father often drunk hostile and emotionally distant from them each of them has a main focus which serves as an escape from poverty and hopelessness randall seeks a college scholarship to play basketball skeetah owns a mother pit bull named china whose puppies he plans to raise and sell for dogfighting esch is obsessed with manny a boy who desires her sexually but does not love her and junior the youngest tirelessly seeks the attention of his siblings mainly by annoying the heck out of them it is the summer of 2005 the middle of the atlantic hurricane season and a storm named katrina slowly gathers strength in the gulf of mexico claude obsessively follows news reports the path of the hurricane but his pleas to his children to make preparations for this storm mainly fall on deaf ears as they are distracted by their own hopes and desires and doubt that this storm will be any different than any of the other ones they and previous generations of batistes have lived through claude decides that they should ride out the storm despite the mandatory evacuation warning a decision they will all regret once katrina makes landfall esch the precocious and sensitive narrator of this story identifies herself with medea the wife of the greek mythic hero medea and with skeetah's dog china who is tender toward her owner and her pups but fights ferociously and relentlessly against anyone who opposes her salvage the bones is an unblinking and unforgettable coming of age novel about the despair of the lives of an impoverished rural family in the deep south whose disparate members are often at odds with each other yet their fierce devotion to each other binds them together in moments of crisis this novel may not be appropriate for some readers due to its vivid description of dogfighting but i would highly recommend it to everyone else","1435":"part of mississippi reading kick it's short but not an easy read i felt true emotion for the characters 11 11","1436":"harsh sad well written","1437":"wow this was a tough one to give one star but the dog fighting was just awful and colored the whole story i didn't buy that this was a vital element of the story there are ways to express pride and rising above poverty other than by fighting dogs i'm sure if i had read more before i picked this up about the actual story i would never have read it there were parts that were excellent the end of the story really flew by and i was actually glad i didn't give up in the middle as i almost did but this was not a good reading experience and i would not recommend it just because of that really horrific part of the story","1438":" this is a fantastic portrait of life among the gulf coast poor beautifully written and painstaking in its authenticity the climactic hurricane i'm not spoiling anything by saying there's a hurricane is detailed enough to leave any actual hurricane survivor shaken and its description of day to day life in semi rural poverty rings true in ways that may seem alien to readers unacquainted with the south yet for all its wonders it somehow left me wanting more perhaps that's the result of its national book award which has historically been given to volumes both denser and less poetic than this still a fantastic read and well worth the trip","1439":"this was my favorite book of 2012 until i read a visit from the goon squad it won the national book award in 2011 and i see why it is haunting heartbreaking and just enough hopeful i loved the structure of it starting slow building to a whirling destructive climax then ending in the devastated aftermath of hurricane katrina the characters were so crisp to me that i could almost see them as i read and i don't think i will soon forget this family esch the pregnant teenage protagonist and her brothers randall skeetah and junior skeetah's pitbull china her father manny the uncaring father of her child all alive on the page all gritty all desperate all frustrating this novel is compelling but heavy and at times violent there is one dog fighting scene that is particularly savage but it is also a story of family love in this case siblings and survival somewhere i read that it reminded the reviewer of the works of richard russo or russell banks both writers i admire and i can see that definitely recommended a thousand times over","1440":"exceptional well written book about dirt poor down and out people who are all crying for love","1441":"not quite so captivated as i anticipated i got bored with the style but the scene was wonderfully presented in all its rawness","1442":"hurricane katrina is the backdrop for this story of a poor rural family in the bayou in the days prior to hurricane katrina brutality is juxtapositioned with tenderness and love and strength are shown in atypical ways there were sections i found difficult to read because of the brutality and the entire tone of the story created a sense of dread that was uncomfortable but the characters and their stories have stayed with me resulting in 4 star rating","1443":"wow this is an arresting portrayal of living without without love money food respect or even a mother true sadness ripped at my heart in this book but the love of family did shine through as one way to survive life's storms","1444":"i'm a champion of this book winner of the national book award some people have dared to suggest that if jesmyn ward weren't african american beautiful and smart this book wouldn't have gotten so much attention well i have news she is smart she's a smart articulate writer with a fascinating story i found it totally believable and heartbreaking you may not agree but it's a good read worth your time","1445":"this was a fantastic book i loved the way the author wrote the mississippi town of bois sauvage came alive at the time of hurrican katrina the narrator of the story was a teenage girl and the stars of the story were her family it just felt so real and although the reader should feel sadness regarding the family's plight and abject poverty there was a spirit that made one feel good this is a terrific read","1446":"the author does a great job at creating a delicious sense of foreboding not only from the oncoming storm but from the father's drunkenness or the viewpoint character's pregnancy dilemma although esch has her own personality and problems it is the relationship between her brother skeetah and his pitbull that is the main draw","1447":"beautifully and masterfully written a heart wrenching and compelling story that i found hard to put down","1448":"this was a book that i had a love hate relationship with the subject matter bothered me sometimes but it still managed to keep my interest thoughtout the entire book i hated the thinking that people still actually lived like esch it was a really touching story about skeetahs love for his dog and their relationship i also enjoyed the fact that the book told the story of what effect hurricane katrina had on mississippi extremely well written and i think anyone would enjoy","1449":"great book poetic","1450":"this is the first book i've stayed up late reading in months beautiful prose and compelling characters","1451":"i have to say i liked this so much more than about 98% of my book group not sure what it was i think i liked it because it was refreshingly different i am so sick of the story lines these days it's all the same stuff was interested to read something not pretty set in an area i know very little about set at a time i have not thought about sadly in some time during katrina found the characters so strangely sympathetic and while the writing was a bit heavy handed sometimes one too many poetic diversions i thought it worked overall","1452":" jesmyn ward's book raised conflicts in the mind of this reader a quick sketch of the story line we meet a tight knit motherless family about ten days before katrina is due to hit the low lying parish in louisiana where they live the father is an alcoholic the older children take care of the younger ones a middle child has a dog that gives birth to a litter of puppies so far so good layer on the dog is a pit bull whose puppies along with the mother are bred and trained to fight layer on the father's drinking problem which leads to disrespect from the older children layer on the fact the fifteen year old daughter is pregnant to an older teen who uses her for sex but has no emotional ties to either her or the child add a fresh voice add realistic black dialect add a strong survivor instinct that even against the odds of a category 5 hurricane hitting their home the family chooses to ride out the flooding rain the great elements are almost but not quite strong enough to wipe out this reader's revulsion about dog fighting it's necessary as the story is framed but there could have been other ways to bring the main themes to light i give the book two stars for the dog fights and four stars for the authentic voice","1453":" for the first 20% of the book i had a hard time staying interested in the plot however the book hit its stride and i was dragged into the struggles of esche and her family over a twelve day period leading up to hurricane katrina and its aftermath the portrayal of a fifteen year old female is accurate and raw this is not a feel good novel and the characters stayed with me long after i put down the book i want a sequel to tell me everything worked out ok so i feel more at ease with the ending","1454":"ward depicts 12 days in the lives of the batiste family who live in a decaying home surrounded by discarded appliances and rusting vehicles in the fictional town of bois sauvage mississippi the story is told through the eyes of 14 year old esch who pregnant by a young man who dismisses her as a slut when she reveals her pregnancy seeks to escape her hard scrabble life through mythology esch and her siblings have largely raised themselves since their mother died in childbirth 7 years before daddy dragged her from the bed to his truck trailing her blood and we never saw her again esch's father has taken up odd jobs fuels his anger with alcohol and remains on the periphery of his chidlren's lives esch and her brother randall a college baseketball hopeful raised their younger brother junior while their other brother skeetah has pinned his hopes and dreams on his cherished fighting dog china and her puppies although beautifully written this novel of hurricane katrina dogfighting unwanted pregnancy and poverty is not for the delicate","1455":"it took me a while to get into this beautifully written book by jesmyn ward it was the mayor's pick for austin texas this year and i was determined to finish it and i'm so glad i did a powerful poignant story about 14 year old esche and her family leading up to hurricane katrina the audio version was great although there were two passages that were very violent and very difficult to listen to had i been reading the book i would have skimmed the pages","1456":"sort of like reading an nyu creative writing major's final project the story of a poor black family right before katrina it's so heavy handed especially with the greek imagery it should be annoying but somehow it works there is one dogfighting scene which is horribly violent and disturbing but absolutely gripping and amazing read it just for that","1457":"poetic and beautiful but so difficult to turn the pages at times i loved it","1458":"saving my review for book club","1459":"a twelve day by day look at the complicated issues facing a family in a small mississippi town as they await hurricane katrina","1460":"i actually did not finish it this is probably one the third or fourth book in 10 years i just couldn't read i read almost 40 pages but for some reason it was just not my cup of tea i really wanted to care for the characters and to be understanding as i know that this sort of thing went on before katrina but it was like overkill maybe i will pick it up down the road but for now it is on the shelf away far away","1461":"incredible super intense visceral writing","1462":"this review has been hidden because it contains spoilers to view it click here esch lives with her brothers skeetah randall junior and her father her mother died after giving birth to junior but she still has a large presence in the book her father is an alcoholic and often leaves esch and her siblings to fend for themselves skeetah fights his pit bull china who has puppies at the beginning of the book the puppies get sick and one dies china then kills another puppy later in the book esch is pregnant with manny's baby she loves manny but he has a girlfriend and on esch lives with her brothers skeetah randall junior and her father her mother died after giving birth to junior but she still has a large

get sick and one dies china then kills another puppy later in the book esch is pregnant with manny's baby she loves manny but he has a girlfriend and only wants esch for sex when he finds out he is repulsed by her this book follows esch and her family days before hurricane katrina when the storm hits the remaining puppies dies and china is swept away in the water esch and her family survive by making it to their ancestors' old house which is on higher ground in the end we see the destruction of the storm skeetah is determined to find china and esch's pregnancy is revealed her family is shocked but stand behind her this isn't a review really just some highlights of the book the writing is beautiful and many times heartbreaking the dog fighting scenes were disturbing and i felt very emotional reading them overall a beautiful read about some difficult subjects more","1463":"this book is vivid interesting detail intriguing plot amazing voice i see why this book won the national book award her language is potent like choking on smoke from a haystack fire i must admit it took a little bit for me to get into but once i got there i couldn't put it down yes","1464":"descriptive beautiful writing with wonderful spare imagery ward tells a young woman's story of internal pain while weaving in the story of her brothers and friends i enjoyed every page of this book","1465":"well written but incredibly sad too much dog fighting for my taste certainly but that's not the only reason i didn't love it ultimately it didn't completely reel me in but the picture of rural louisiana life up against hurricane katrina is full of telling particular details and some vivid characters and ward has a strong voice","1466":" i picked up salvage the bones because on more than one occasion i saw jesmyn ward compared to william faulker and kate chopin in her ability to capture the cadence of southern language and culture i am not familiar with gulf coast and bayous but i am fascinated by this complex and deeply historical community and ward offers a story of how a poor rural family scraped by before the storm i struggled with the pacing of the book initially with hindsight i urged the characters to make haste in preparation or to flee from katrina who was a hazy background character i was struck by how remote the batiste family is from the outside world and how resilient they are in a place with little public services and the ghosts of beloved family who represent a happier and more prosperous time ward writes an epic novel in a spare style evocative of mythology esch is a stoic teen who gathers eggs and defies a hurricane as her mother did before she died cares for her younger brother while she is still a child herself and yearns for a boy to love her with the devotion her brother held for his pit bull china salvage the bones is a fascinating novel with rich characters and heartbreaking tragedy","1467":"exquisitely written story about a motherless poor family of five in mississippi days before hurricane katrina the author writes poetically with descriptions that could paint a canvas","1468":"really great book but i would recommend only reading small parts at a time and preferably alternating it with some good mind candy romantic comedy because this is a tough story to get through and you'll probably need something to lighten the mood","1469":"beautiful language engaging plot and a creative way of telling a story for which we already know the ending i really liked that esch had this complex inner voice and worldview but when she spoke it was simple but not in an over the top new orleans dialect thankfully i also thought it was a very original and useful approach to the sexuality of young poor women a perspective that's not usually shared without judgment highly recommended","1470":"excellent wrenching account of the days leading up to katrina told from the viewpoint of a young poor black woman the details were somewhat difficult to take at times but sure rang true","1471":"beautifully written","1472":"beautiful book it took me a bit to get into it but once i was i couldn't put it down","1473":"incredible heart breaking shattering opening poetry in motion commendable integration of literary traditions of fact and fiction of innumerable opposites historically culturally pertinent a must read","1474":"this is the best book i've read in a long long time ward's prose is gorgeous poetic sharp and flowing the audiobook narrator does an excellent job bringing each character to life the story is not an easy one four motherless children neglected by their alcoholic father living in deep poverty in rural louisiana but oh this one is richly deserving of its national book award","1475":"incredible prose but i had difficulty following the book not for lack of understanding just key points seemed anti climactic ward's words though are haunting i'll probably revisit the book at some point in the future to see if my mind changes","1476":"difficult subjects leading path to natural disaster katrina teen pregnancy dog fighting poverty not endearing topics but end up rooting for all of characters and hoping they beat the odds","1477":" i received this book as a first reads giveaway from the description i thought it would be good it was not overall the book was just boring i found nothing insightful about any of the characters i don't really know what the point of this book was other than to just tell the story of a random family in the days leading up to hurricane katrina in the end i think the author was trying to show that this torn and struggling family was brought together by the tragedy of katrina but i feel that this particular family will be back to the status quo for them in a couple of weeks ward gives the impression that esch's baby will also bring the family together but i don't buy that either considering how the rest of the siblings seem to act like junior the youngest of them is such a burden also some warning about the animal abuse which is a big part of this story would have been nice i don't know if jesmyn ward has written any other books but i won't be reading them","1478":"read through the first half of the book and then skimmed through the rest it didn't grab me it's very dark i can do dark and in fact really like dark sometimes but this just felt like being beaten up maybe my brain wasn't lofty enough to wrap around it","1479":" some random thoughts a boy skeeter raising pitbulls to dogfight this is a boy who in any other setting would rightly be a villain this telling humanizes him and portrays him with such delicacy that i actually felt his deep deep love for his dog and understood his need for her to fight to win even in her weakened condition she is mother to pups skeeter is a pitbull himself fighting for survival weak in so many ways from his age to his race to the poverty in which he lives his sister esch pregnant at age 14 the narrative voice of the novel she is deeply protective of her brothers a contradiction of emotions believable in her vulnerability and strength the metaphor here is mother nature violent and unpredictable esch is discovering the mother in herself the strength that she needs to survive the storm both literal and not the love that she clings to fiercely in the face of utter destruction the beauty of the story lies in its subtlety the violence of the storm that overlaps and is metaphoric for what all of the characters face in their lives images of eggs fetuses u0026amp birth that run throughout the story that i believe are intended to compensate for the destruction of the storm to indicate how life goes on this book had me riveted during the katrina scenes a storm i lived through during my first year in baton rouge while baton rouge escaped much of the storm's wrath the destruction to which i was witness afterward helping evacuees from new orleans and later seeing the destruction in new orleans first hand allowed me to visualize with extreme clarity every single moment of this family's battle for survival to think that scenes of this type were occuring all across the gulf coast in our day and age leaves me cold","1480":"this book really seems to capture what day to day life in the impoverished south is like","1481":"i just couldn't the first two chapters are so beautifully written that it was compelling but i really can't make myself read of that savagery toward the dogs i know it happens i know it's realism but i don't have to have more than the hideously insidious idea in my head people who can read this probably could stomach the idea of dog fighting what is happening to the people is bad enough but i know what's going to happen with the dogs and jesmyn ward's writing is too beautifully relentless to bear what she's writing about i'm not going to read on page 66","1482":"a little slow at the beginning strong last two chapters chapter 11 especially had me holding my breath thanks to the strong build up beforehand honestly it was for $1 in the kindle store i don't resonate much with a 14 year old pregnant girl in louisiana but good writing and strong characters made it worthwhile","1483":"a powerful read this should be required reading for 11th or 12th grade students jesmyn ward captures the human condition of a family living in the poverty stricken rural south readers can comprehend how the family did not realize the magnitude of the impending hurricane katrina","1484":"as many reviewers have said this isn't really about katrina but instead is about a painfully poor family in the rural south the characters are wonderfully complex and flawed the only minor detractors are that the allusions to medea are a little heavy handed and some of the descriptive writing is a bit much","1485":"who would name their daughter esch brother name is skeetah skeet i can see this as a nickname but real names early part of the novel it goes in and out of china having her pit pups and esch hanging out with her brother friend s especially manny who she lets do her and remembers others that were inside of her you have to keep up with these short passages going in and out of these scenes synopsis these lines made me want to read it a big hearted novel about familial love and community against all odds and a wrenching look at the lonesome brutal and restrictive realities of rural poverty salvage the bones is muscled with poetry revelatory and real i liked the middle to end best lfpc book club read for january 2012","1486":"loved esch the protagonist but i have to admit that the dog fighting scenes were difficult to read kind of lost me but i guess that was sort of the point challenging the reader to imagine a life so different from one's own","1487":" this title got better and better as the story went on i found it a bit hard to get into at first but then couldn't put it down since this book was on my list to be read when i went to the la times festival of books in april i made sure to attend the panel ward was on i enjoyed listening to her speak and was struck by a criticism she received of the characters apparently some people didn't believe a poor family could include of smart creative people i was flabbergasted but then when i described the book to a friend he commented that the first person perspective would probably be limited in the type of character portrayed i responded with she's poor not dumb so so so is there an assumption that poor people are dumb how have i missed this anyway i had a great time occupying the mind of the main character and i loved how she connected with her summer reading assignment it was about greek mythology and she would think about it as she went about her random summer activities this is also a fascinating look at how a rural community was affected by katrina","1488":"i liked it but some parts were tough to read about","1489":"this book was a beautiful read it was an interesting window into life for some in the south and was very clear and precise in the way it got down to the heart of what it is to love family love brotherly love and lust love right before i read this book i finished 1q84 which went on for 900 pages and i don't know if it told as much of an epic story as salvage the bones","1490":"it is probably the mood i was in the book was too dark too depressing i don't understand what the author was trying to convey to the reader","1491":" hmmm how to describe this book this is a story of four siblings esch randall skeetah and junior living in coastal mississippi during the days immediately preceding hurricane katrina and a few days after the book spans about 12 days the father figure in the story is pretty distant and removed from his children skeetah has a prized pit bull named china who is having puppies when the story opens and 15 year old esch has just found out that she is pregnant there are some pretty disturbing themes in this book that i won't mention but this story is very well written i really enjoyed this once i started this book i couldn't put it down","1492":"so hard to describe this experience not just a book but an experience i must admit that i skipped or scanned some of the middle of it agree with some others that it could have been shorter though not a long book did not have the fortitude to read the dog fighting part to read about these lives that were destroyed before katrina and again by katrina is heartbreaking and disturbing the writing especially the metaphoric style is outstanding i know this is reality in some parts of america but it is difficult when it slaps you in the face like this book does you will think about these lives long after you finish reading and wonder how close to you these things are happening i can't say i liked it exactly but it was amazing","1493":"it took me awhile to get through it the concept and the characters of the book are unique but i never got into the flow of the writing i get thinking that if i had more literary background knowledge i could appreciate her writing more","1494":"very well written with palpable imagery and emotion having had family and friends physically touched by katrina and personally seeing the devastation later that year i felt involved in the story go blue jesmyn","1495":"ward has a unique ability to make you feel like her protagonist from the physical discomfort and pain caused by poverty to the unconditional bond with family this book felt ever present from the moment i began reading until well after it was over this story about a family who struggles with poverty and the impact of katrina made it difficult for me to sleep at night it was so real it felt almost as it was happening to me","1496":"difficult to read but very well done gave me an understanding of the poverty and devastation of the people unable to flee hurricane katrina also gave me an unexpected understanding of how dog fighting happens and is accepted","1497":"interesting take on the life of one family leading up to hurricane katrina slow moving but got good at the end","1498":" slow moving prose but gripping and cinematic despite the climax of the book is literally stomach turning and i got invested in these characters even especially the dog china who has more of presence in the book than some of the humans they felt real honest and complex i wanted to dig deeper into the father character but i also understand that the book belongs to the narrator and that the father belongs in the background where he resides as an emotionally absent part of her life my biggest complaint about the book is its tendency to lapse into self indulgent tangles of language that belongs more in poetry than prose sure enough an interview with the author in the back of my copy of the book has jesmyn ward describing herself as a failed poet there are plenty of poets who can write fabulous prose and plenty of novelists whose prose is poetic but when salvage the bones goes poetic it slows down the action frustrates comprehension and pulls you out of the moment rather than pushing you deeper i'm thinking in particular of the scene where the protagonist is crying in the bathroom at the basketball game after the father of her unborn child assaults her and this moment could have been so much more powerful if the author has just let us sit with the frank and bald nature of the protagonist's pain not tangle us up in this machete metaphor that removes us from the scene with multiple layers of figurative language if i could give this book 3 5 stars i would","1499":" wow first book in a long time that i have given 5 stars beautiful and haunting it is one that i will keep and be happy that i have copy for my hands to hold it is one that i will not likely loan out unless i have two copies on hand anyone living along the gulf coast will be able to relate to the descriptions of hurricane preparations and affects of barometric changes anyone not living in a hurricane area will get perfect scenes painted for them powerful force of the love of family and friends blows fiercely throughout wow","1500":"not really my cup of tea but that's because of the dog fighting however it is clear to me that ward is a very talented writer lots to talk about but may leave some readers disturbed or they may give up before the story really takes off","1501":" when i finished the book i realized that the hurricane's presence in it had been much stronger than i had realized at first even though katrina occupies only two chapters it seems as if the prose breathes hurricane weather in and out in every chapter through water heat stifling humidity the stillness of the air and then the non stillness of the air as the trees sway in a wind that gives no relief hunger dirt restless sleep you know it if you've been in a hurricane but i think having followed one on tv may be enough the tv though doesn't give much of a sense of the tremendous heat the heat and the humidity are enormous so this book is pretty amazing brave really because it tells it seems to me a rather unconventional story using the weather as the thing the book is about the atmosphere the book's events are wrapped in and a metaphor for various elements of the narrative this is a book that is rife with metaphors but they didn't seem heavy to me also i don't mind heavy the story is unconventional because these are people who are truly at the margins of representation poor rural black people appear in movies and books only as color if they play any role at all other than that it is to be bit characters in genre fiction there are just not a lot of places where you get to see rural black folks in their communities as fully developed characters with rich interesting and complex lives my personal experience proves nothing of course but i think i've encountered these people only in slave literature and then they were not these people at all i'm mentioning them only because they were black rural and poor so really this is interesting and beautiful because it opens up a space for other people to be met seen and known it enlarges the scope of representation it enriches the cultural village there is a huge blank space in representation and this book helps fill it and these lives are interesting they are fascinating they are rich with love desire family courage survival communication growing up trying to be good trying to do good they are not alien lives they are intense and nuanced lives minus air conditioning square meals and working televisions this should not need to be said and maybe my saying it is offensive but i think many of us just don't realize it because we never see it poor rural black people are just about as othered as people get in our society i think i feel more connected to poor black folks in other countries than to poor black folks in the united states if our culture does anything about poor rural and urban black communities it teaches us to be afraid of them this book kicks this fear in the teeth i think by the way that jesmyn ward did the exact right thing in not trying to represent accents and regionalisms in the writing because that would have reproposed the othering there is so much more than can be said about this book in fact i have spoken not at all about what happens in it but we are discussing this in january 2012 over at literary fiction by people of color so there will be plenty of time to get into the intricacies of the story when the discussion gets started link to come what i wanted to say here was mostly that this is a beautiful and brave novel and that everyone should read it and then maybe a movie should be made of it and that people should start getting to know each other beyond the heinous stereotypes hammered into us by the stupid news","1502":" over the days building up to katrina through the hurricane and the day after 15 year old esch narrates her life in a poor rural area of mississippi esch's mother is dead her father is drunk more often than not her brother randall is hoping for a basketball scholarship her brother skeetah is obsessed with his pit bull china and her puppies and their youngest brother junior tags along with whichever sibling will let him as the hurricane approaches esch realizes she's pregnant but the father her brother's best friend won't acknowledge it there is a striking difference between esch's interior monologue highly literate observant insightful lovely and the characters' dialogue she don't know how you got to we was just about to i ain't cooking you no noodles but it's not a dialogue rich book recommended for fans of southern literary fiction fans of girlchild by tupelo hassman bastard out of carolina by dorothy allison the homecoming of samuel lake by jenny wingfield to kill a mockingbird by harper lee quotes we pass what used to be the elementary school and suddenly there is a great split between now and then and i wonder where the world where that day happened has gone because we are not in it 251 he will look into the future and see her and when he sees her his face will break and run water and it will wear away like water does the heart of stone left by her leaving 258","1503":" i surprised myself by reading this book raising pit bulls to fight a struggling and motherless family teenage pregnancy preparation for a hurricane not usually attractive nor necessarily comfortable topics for me to read about but believe it or not and i have a hard time believing it myself this is the best book i have read in the past year the author jesmyn ward writes smoothly yet with strength and purpose though gruesome in parts the family dynamic and loyalty is so compelling i couldn't put it down","1504":" i decided to take a break from the fantasy world of westeros and read something a little more grounded in reality this book is about as real as it gets i had a hard time rating it because i'm not sure that i necessarily liked the book but i certainly did respond to it one evening i was laying upstairs reading and at one point my fella called up something big happened huh i realized then that i had been audibly gasping and groaning as i read the story takes place over twelve days beginning about a week before hurricane katrina hits while the storm is building off shore the narrative is also building to a fever pitch the overwhelming feeling of the novel for me was dread dreading the impending storm dreading the consequences of the characters' decisions dreading the inevitable losses that are about to occur the storm itself does not take up much space in the novel but the description of it was intense and pretty unforgettable it definitely gave me a new perspective on what these people went through and made me think twice about ever living on the gulf coast","1505":"small tight story characters start slow but then pull you deeply into their world i liked this book more and more the further i read","1506":"this author deserves the praise and critical accolades she has received for her literary prowess without being tedious or emotionally manipulative she brings to life a tale of characters immersed in poverty and all the brutality that severe poverty brings the continual presence of instability tragedy and hardship does not undercut the familial unit and the underlying hope of a better day as bleak as this book feels at times i appreciate the presentation of these african americans as more than a sick sad collection of dysfunction and psychoses","1507":"yes beautiful prose but too depressing for where i'm at in my life after reading the last page i felt heartbroken","1508":"character development was weak","1509":"love what wonderful imagery and characters a must read","1510":"it is hard to read such an incredible and heartbreaking story of my own community but it is so beautifully written and perfectly balanced that it was a joy it won the national book award this week which should bring it to the attention of many more readers savor this book you are unlikely to forget it","1511":"depressing ugh this book turned out to be the total opposite of literature and more like a cheap novel i could not care any less for any of the characters and the uncle tom florid prose just made it worse if i could give a minus 5 rating i gladly would awful","1512":" this story may seem like it is about survival during one of the most damaging storms in us history but it is really about a storm of a family that is grappling to grow up and get by amid poverty violence and the gaping hole left open by their dead mother and a father distant angry and most of the time drunk though ward won the national book award for this her second novel i still was not prepared for how much i'd fall in love with this beautifully written sad survival story full review at zoratonimaya","1513":"i was skeptical not wanting to read just any katrina book but these characters were lovely and flawed and it was a dog fighting unique entry into this catastrophe","1514":" i had to read this book for a class i am taking the book is set up by days as opposed to chapters it is the twelve days leading up to hurricane katrina and also the day after i am on day eight the book is loaded with stereotypes and prejudice i understand she is writing about a poor black family but the images she paints are horrible the narrator is esch a fourteen year old girl she has sex with all the boys because it is easier than saying no she steals she is pregnant her brother skeet loves his dog china and she just had puppies he also puts her in dogfights and steals medicine for her from the white farm her other brothers randall and junior do not stand out at all this is an award winning book which makes me think there must have been some agenda for it to be awarded maybe the next four days will reveal something that makes it all make sense but i doubt it","1515":"difficult book to read so sad but worth it","1516":"i had a really hard time getting through this book not because it is boring or not because i lost interest but because it is a brutal story it took a lot out of me this is the story of esch who at 15 finds out she is pregnant she lives in poverty stricken mississippi with her brothers and father her brother skeetah is preoccupied with his pit bull china and her pups her brother randall wants to get into basketball camp so he has a chance at going to college and esch is terrified of the baby growing inside her the entire book takes place over the 12 days leading up to hurricane katrina it involves preparing for the hurricane taking care of their drunken father and the dog fighting culture that seems to prevail among the men in the area it is a very well written book with a likeable main character but it is not an easy read","1517":"heartbreaking and beautiful the characters will stay with me for a while","1518":"review coming soon","1519":"i thought it was ironic that i won this book on goodreads giveaways because i went through katrina while pregnant i felt that the first half of the book was hard to get into but the second half really caught my attention i loved the characters but really could have done without the dog fighting","1520":" i have been avoiding writing this review because i know it will be unpopular and i still don't have a strong defense for my equivocation this book was supposed to be great yet somehow it came up short for me the ingredients were all there raw themes of teen pregnancy alcoholism rural poverty brutal dog fighting family survival and a killer hurricane the writing held so much promise and the characters were fleshed out in exquisite detail why only three stars then for me the author got bogged down in the craft of writing and let the story slide by the wayside too many times she lost me i recognize her gift of language as something that will win awards from academics with lofty appreciation for poetry but for me the story must come first the story is about fourteen year old motherless pregnant esch her three brothers and their neglectful alcoholic grieving father eking out a subsistance living in the wilds of mississippi during the 11 day build up to hurricane katrina the whole novel takes place in 12 days and i should have whipped through it like katrina through the gulf but somehow it dragged i guess that's the reason for the three stars nonetheless the themes and the writing and the fact that everyone in the world but me loved this book make it worth trying when you're seeking a window into an entirely different existence from your own","1521":" here is a book that qualifies as good fiction well written at times i felt myself drawn into the story but only at times there is a self conscious quality to the narrative that i couldn't quite shake and then there's the danger of narrating from the 1st person when your character thinks and tells the story not like a 14 year old girl from a home on the margins but like a college educated writer with serious chops incongruous still the subject matter is close to my heart and the final scenes of katrina's aftermath in coastal ms were so heartbreakingly familiar i think i want to like this book more than i actually did","1522":" this was excellent although a very uncomfortable read it was a great premise how a poor family faced braced for hurricane katrina and or how they didn't and the characters were engrossing it essentially ends a day or two after the hurricane which was haunting i will continue to wonder re these characters for some time a good segment of the story was about dog fighting which was difficult for me to read or understand but it shows how deep seated it becomes in communities and how some really count on it to make money or to get by a very different perspective than anything i had been familiar with","1523":" unique and beautiful language perfectly illustrates a poor louisiana family in the week before katrina as four children and their father live a life of dog fights sibling rivalry and a hidden pregnancy it's powerful and frightening for the reader who knows what katrina means who cringes when the children ignore the storm warnings no surprise this got the national book award the writing is gorgeous ward finds descriptions and comparisons an adult would never make achieving a rich and believable voice for her 15 year old female narrator the book's a little like the proverbial train wreck you can't look away from but it's still both refreshing and fulfilling very real very highly recommended for nearly anyone","1524":"this turned out to be a rather amazing work of fiction though the first bit felt like a slog i'm glad i stuck with it through all the poverty and devastation to reach the strong and hopeful ending","1525":"great new voice loved her characters and her story telling will definitely follow her future efforts just felt she needed a bit more editing grew tired of her over use of poetic prose applied in more abundance than a drag queens make up as though she was showing off for her creative writing students still all in all an interesting read a wonderful insight into a group of americans i'm glad to have met","1526":"beautifully written heart wrenchingly sad","1527":"set in the rural south this is one intense novel it centers around a dirt poor family in the days just before hurricane katrina packs it in the young narrator a girl named esch captures profound details and observations about what's happening to her and her family with a pluckiness that's heartbreaking the coming of the storm and esch's relating unfolding events to the story of medea and jason build and intertwine creating a classical dramatic ending","1528":"very well written in a unique style i have never read anything like this book before the author's descriptions are so vivid you can almost feel the dust grit and sweat that permeate this book the subject matter is very raw and looks at a part of our american culture that is so foreign to my own experience","1529":"though this book is a national book award winner it was almost too intense for me her phrasing and descriptions sometimes too 'poetic' the story is about a family and their neighborhood of poor blacks preparing and some not for hurricane katrina narrated by the only daughter esch who is 12 and pregnant much most of the story centers around the second son skeeter whom she feels closest to and his pit bull china though hard for me to read it's very well written","1530":"brutal and savage story told almost entirely in the present tense i found it both repelling and compelling in my opinion it had little to do with katrina the hurricane and more to do about surviving in a savage land most of the descriptive writing is eloquent but at times it could have used better editing now i'm looking for something that does not use the word detritus once","1531":"a unique rough and devastating book the first post hurricane katrina novel i've read but focuses on so much more than the looming storm what i can only imagine is a painfully accurate portrait of a rural poor community on the gulf coast this book will stay with me for a long time","1532":"powerful sad rather exhausting to read it's what lingers in my head at the end that makes me sorry i read it","1533":"an excellent read that uses hurricane katrina as the backdrop to a story about a family in bois sauvage mississippi fictional gripped with finding their place in a world that is parsimonious with opportunity and replete with challenges","1534":"this book kept me company as i drove from home from north carolina it was definitely deserving of the national book award the voice of the narrator is lyrical and conveys beautiful lush imagery the novel explores maternity through the myth of medea including hurricane katrina as destroyer i cared a great deal about this narrator and her family by the end","1535":"unparalleled use of metaphor beautifully rendered to create a slow building tension hurricane katrina floats above the narrative as a spectre until the story reaches its climax poetic languid rich","1536":"a story about a poor rural family in southern mississippi the days leading up to katrina and a couple of days after the narrator is a young girl 15 talking about her single dad and 3 brothers and their friends and life katrina is a major part of the story but not the only story line","1537":"this novel feels a little like the film beasts of the southern wild with some pitbull fighting thrown in it's exquisitely crafted and drops you into a world of heat swamps and poverty the dog fighting scenes were some of the most compelling and horrifying i've ever read","1538":"so gut wrenching it was hard to read","1539":" this is a beautiful brutal book every page is full of the very real trauma and neglect that esch batiste and her family face in extreme rural poverty it's heartbreaking even without the climax the destruction of hurricane katrina despite the brutality including alcoholism dogfighting stealing and sexual relationships there is great beauty in the very human characters ward has created esch is thoughtful and caring very capable of love and an engaged reader who identifies with the mythic character medea who she is reading about medea's betrayal of her brother and subsequent heartbreak after being betrayed by her lover provide a good foil to both esch and the only other important female character in the book china a fierce pure white pitbull who only has eyes for her caretaker esch's brother skeetah the other characters are just as beautifully human skeetah and his loving if occasionally misguided care for china and her puppies esch's brother randall who shows a clear love for the youngest child junior a willingness to play the role of father and intensity as a basketball player and big henry the only friend of the batiste boys who doesn't get esch to sleep with him and the only one who clearly cares about her for me this is one of those rare books where everything comes together the story which occurs over a week and a half is action packed but ward sacrifices neither character development nor language and style to further the plot looking forward to reading more of ward's work themes hurricane katrina family jason and medea betrayal life and death rural poverty children raising children alcoholism teen pregnancy dogfighting","1540":"nice writing style but couldn't go on b c of subject pit bull dog fight ugh","1541":" i am not a fan of what i call the southern stream of consciousness writing the author places you in a room filled with characters and it is up to the reader to gradually sort out which are related who is a strong or weak or even which ones are the good guys versus the bad guys the author places the reader here into a pit literally a swamp of a family that it takes a few chapters to even figure out this would be an excellent discussion starter with high school students especially about morality what about esch who started having sex at age 12 and then had sex with any boy who wanted her without ever having a qualm about it are her brothers even her brothers and the dog fighting theme has a lot of possibilities what is the definition of goodness is it who you are what you do how the community sees you the author makes no such judgments which is rare in ya lit this is an alex award winner so it is written for adults maybe the author did not feel that this had to be a story in which the those who act outside of what society deems to be moral get punished for their actions or maybe they did this is also a katrina story so i like the idea of anyone who is coastal virginia or north carolina reading about hurricanes my advice to other readers is to get past the first 50 pages or so until the story grips you it's not one that you will feel good about reading but you will appreciate having read it","1542":"it's one of the best books i dislike it's well written but the metaphor usage was too heavy i liked the madea and jason parallels but then it got a bit heavy handed the reveal with the brother's name was the last straw it's a pretty bleak novel with loves of violence isolation and motherlessness it's a beautiful and well written book but i didn't like the themes so it averages out to 3 stars for me","1543":"strong characters beautiful descriptive writing very emotional","1544":"the author jesmyn west won the national book award for this book this year it seems to me that many times these american awards go to people who write about marginalized americans and gruesome circumstances this book follows along with my theory rape pit bull fights floods razors in the mouth chopped off fingers set against the backdrop of the looming hurricane katrina the descriptions are exquisitely crafted by a fine feminine writing conveying the familial love to offset the gruesome details the poverty stricken 16 yr old pregnant narrator is a literary type comparing her life to that of medea plugged my way to the end of the book with a newfound awareness of the lives lived by the poor in the woods of today's louisiana","1545":"difficult to read at times because it is so emotional","1546":"i found this book hard to get into and the characters hard to relate to at first but the story quickly moved onto a more universal theme and i couldn't put it down the human cost of katrina and the main character's incredible strength will stay with me for a long time","1547":"the main character is a young woman esch the story centers around esch and her family preparing for and enduring katrina the underlying story is of the fundamental dedication to family regardless of the effects of poverty abuse unwed motherhood impending hurricanes etc","1548":"very sad yet beautiful book","1549":" the title of this book intrigued me and i just had to read it this story is about the violence neglect and sex of a 14 year old girl and her three brothers struggling to survive in rural bois sauvage mississippi it is about poverty at its lowest level with love of each other at its core it is about the love of one of the brothers for his dog and what he will sacrifice for him hurricane katrina is on its way and one of the poorest families has to prepare it is a heartbreaking read i couldn't put it down i will think about this for a long time","1550":"disturbing story with a book that has no ending","1551":"salvage the bones was probably the best book i read in 2011 from the opening sentence i felt a tremendous weight the writing is so poignant so full of emotion salvage the bones begins with the batiste family preparing for hurricane katrina while facing the day to day obstacles of their lives in spite of all of the sadness this book also left me with a feeling of hope in the power of the human spirit and the awesome power of family","1552":"clearly some powerful themes and a fascinating setting but the book was overwritten and dragged maybe it was partly my own anxiety i forgot this book was about katrina until i started reading wouldn't have consciously chosen to read this as sandy roared outside my windows but i did find the heavy use of metaphor and symbolism tiresome after awhile on the other hand esch's vulnerability and need is well drawn clearly a young developing talent","1553":"extraordinary it takes courage to approach poverty and teenaged pregnancy and dog fighting with the grace of a classic myth beautifully written","1554":"not sure that i would rave about this book as it seems most reviews do but i did like it","1555":"well written that much is obvious but i like stories with a beginning middle and end and i'm usually too tired when i read to enjoy the symbolism and other more sophisticated aspects of literature clearly they're in there they just went beyond what i was willing to give to this particular story characters setting bottom line i more respected than enjoyed it","1556":"just finished thus wrenching story no bourgeois fantasy this novel ward writes masterfully always turning our gaze back to what is most personal","1557":"this is a beautifully written novel about race gender and class the main character esch truly forces you to check your judgements and explore her world in a way that can challenge many preconceived notions the descriptions of hurricane katrina are breathtaking but it would be a mistake to think that this book is just about the hurricane","1558":"one of the biggest obstacles in enjoying this novel is the language it felt like i was being constantly bombarded with similes and metaphors and of course the endless comparisons to the myth of medea was the author given a large quota of literary devices to meet also the author's figurative language which was often beautiful at times made descriptions of events confusing i found myself re reading some sections including important ones during the storm and still coming away scratching my head there was also so much of this figurative language that it sometimes felt clunky or just exhausting and more than once i found myself skimming over paragraphs to find some solid dialogue or plot although i knew before starting the book that it takes place around the time of hurricane katrina i had to keep reminding myself that it is set in 2005 and not some long ago time in the past there is something about the writing that does not fit the time period it describes and i found this disconnect uncomfortable while i was reading the time frame of the novel 12 days also seemed ill fitting to the development of the story and the characters and i didn't realize the story took place over such a short time until the storm actually hit lastly and most importantly i was disappointed in the characterization there's so much potential to relate to a character like esch but she comes across somewhat flat and unfinished like most of her family members although she is the protagonist the one we get the clearest picture of is her brother skeetah and even his dog china seems to have more character development than most of the human characters the tone of the novel also seems out of sync with the fourteen year old perspective through which is told which contributes to my ambivalence toward esch as a character all in all there is a lot of potential to this story that was unfulfilled and it left me feeling disappointed at the end i didn't mind the open ended conclusion at all but this novel seems unfinished in other ways it hints at a great deal but does not always follow through and perhaps tries to tackle too many large issues to address any of them satisfactorily","1559":"a katrina story so teachable lots to love and admire the sad and powerful voice of the girl telling the story the formalism and poetry of the narrative voice contrasted with the vernacular dialogue the parallels ward makes to the story of jason and medea the clear differentiation of every member of the central family and how they relate to each other the portrait of intimacy between an adolescent and his dog more still literary and fresh","1560":" this book was heart rendlingly beautiful and i don't even care if that's a real word we sometimes forget what real poverty is and this book reminds us that while its easy to talk about the american dream it's much harder to do it when you are born in a certain socio economic situation this book shows things that we take for granted others have not even seen in their entire lives this book is not an easy read but any author that can make you root for a pit bull in a dog fighting ring without any social judgement is an author well worth reading","1561":"\"salvage the bones\" by jesmyn ward was a novel of extreme depth and loss there was nothing glamorous about this novel it is filled with real people living lives that are nothing they could have imagined them to be but become everything they want to hate a fifteen year old girl becomes pregnant she is the only woman left in her house after her momma died giving birth to her youngest brother she lives with three brothers one who has an obsession with his dog named china another has talent on the basketball court and the other the baby of the family follows everyone's shadows their father is an alcoholic widow this story takes place in a series of days leading up to hurricane katrina in these twelve days we see the naive understanding of the world these characters live in things that seem like no big deal are huge compared to the hurricane taken with little seriousness it is so easy for us humans to look at our lives as being the center of the universe we see us as the most important thing but for this family the hurricane was something much bigger than they could handle maybe it's because of all of the bad things that have happened to them whether self inflicted or not that has made them so numb to the reality of the hurricane i think though that after the hurricane hits it makes them realize that something is greater than them so they pick up their boot straps and they soldier on not in the reality that they are owed something but in the reality that something is greater than them i say god and they just have to keep on pressing on you can't expect your life to get better if you wallow in the mud huddle around camp fires or play basketball for just the dreams you have to take action take responsibilities maybe that is why for me the dad was my favorite character in this story because it took a hurricane for him to see his hurting starving family and to grab hold of the opportunity to fix it to start anew","1562":"i thought it was neat that this book took place over the course of only 12 days it really made me think about the areas and people who were hit by hurricane katrina","1563":" esch's drunk daddy is warning their family about the upcoming storm building in the gulf but she and her siblings have more pressing concerns esch is 14 and pregnant skeetah is worried about the newborn pups from his prize winning fighting bull dog randall is trying to get a scholarship to basketball camp and junior just wants to play under the house as the storm katrina builds in intensity so do everyone's problems forcing the characters to take drastic measures to get through and survive their poverty stricken lives this book is pretty unique and will stick with you jesmyn ward has a very descriptive way of writing which will make you feel the intense heat of louisiana just has much as you'll feel the love skeetah has for his dog china the characters are all really fleshed out to the point you have a good feel for each sibling after pretty much the first time they're mentioned and the story is incredible i'm sure many families experienced the very same situation before and during katrina definitely a book worth reading","1564":" this was both beautiful and really hard to read i had to skip a lot of the dog fighting parts because you know dog fighting i can put aside my white liberal outrage to recognize it as the only way some very desperate very poor fictional characters can earn money okay but i still can't read the play by play and speaking of white liberal outrage i was very glad to read a book told from the point of view of a rural pregnant girl who has had no access to contraceptives or sex ed she was written sympathetically she was a great character and i felt like i understood her point of view given what she'd been through but good god i could never write that i could never put aside my feelings about contraceptive availability and sex ed long enough to write a book like this a book that's about not politics or our educational system's failures but to borrow a phrase from madonna what it feels like for a girl that's why ward is the national book award winning novelist and i'm not i'm thankful that she's out there because we need more perspectives like hers","1565":"ward's writing style lends itself to getting the feeling that you know the characters in this book she creates a great tension about hurricane katrina's arrival that makes the book hard to put down near the end the story centers on the lives and problems of a family who are very poor and living in rural louisiana","1566":" i started the book not impressed and ended the book not impressed i wasn't blown away by ward's writing which i did not find poetic or beautiful kundera is my standard for breathtaking prose however the story line is solid and ward tries to give an acute portrayal of the twelve days leading up to katrina for the batiste family there are many reasons this novel didn't work for one ward fails in many key descriptions while she can minutely detail the beauty of the woods in other areas such as when the house is filling with water and the batiste family needs to jump branch to branch to get to another house her scenic words leave me confused and bewildered how is that even possible why did esch's dad push her how were they not sucked away by the swirling currents but saved by a random tree why is the tree not uprooted and itself lost in the whirlpool secondly while the book is set in the modern era 2005 ward writes in such a way that is reminiscent of older bygone times she uses language and imagery i can see in uncle tom's cabin but i find hard to believe exists in our world today particularly because she never provides the context and background that as a reader i need in order to situate and conceptualize myself in the work lastly the characters are so disappointing as the main voice esch is a rather passive perspective she sleeps with men she doesn't want to sleep with because it's easier to and she rarely shows her steely personality it's incredibly hard for me to relate to esch despite her unrequited love her coming of age and her blossoming motherhood she is a juxtaposition of contradictions an incredibly smart mature beyond her years tween reading medea in her free time to a blundering shifty timid and insecure child i can't figure out who esch is this is in part to ward's ill advised use of esch as the narrator esch is ward's sole channel of expression but still has a character role to fulfill in the story randall and daddy batiste aren't given much personality or focus and junior is incredibly irritating slightly twisted and always lingering in the shadows either way the only winner is skeetah and china and what ward captures with these two is a wondrous love between man and dog that even katrina can't destroy","1567":"six word review mother china mother esch mother storm","1568":"didn't finish this book got about 43% done didn't care for it at all","1569":" i wanted to love this book but didn't it didn't grip me it didn't hold my attention it didn't captivate me so much that i couldn't put it down the first 3 4 of the novel i was barely interested and would have been less so had it not been for skeet and china even the narrator esch left me wanting it's just that we were told a whole lot about her but she didn't actually do anything she was more an observer but the last 1 4 when the hurricane started did captivate me that was the best part of the book it was fascinating to see what happened how they survived and the aftermath i was comforted by a sort of happy ending knowing that in the end they had each other and that would be

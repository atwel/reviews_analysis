thought this was a great read loved it quick read enjoyable didn't initially love the ending but it grew on me","2":"it was very readable as in i finished it in one day readable i really liked how the author didn't make either one of the main characters a villian they both had their foibles i actually thought he did a better job of characterizing the woman lucy he does a good job of showing her very human weaknesses without making you root against her i also think it's cool that this is apparently the author's first novel and he was something like 64 when it got published it gives me hope that maybe i actually will get off my ass someday and try to write something","3":" this book was given to me in exchange for an honest review often when i read a book i read the notes the author adds to the beginning of the book...this author added a note to the front a book about a conversation with his daughter that caught my attention he was asked to summarize the book in 15 words he described this book as what seemed like a simple love story i have to disagree there is so much more to this story then to label it as that there's love there but it's jaded and heartbreaking as well as eye opening and intriguing it's a love story written real world style even though there was beauty and money added in to the story they were fixes this is not a story about the sad lonely rich girl marrying mister right and settling down in the white picket fenced house with two kids and a dog and happy ever after this is a story about how hard it really is to make a marriage work and that sometimes you cannot matt and lucy's story is one that is sad and yet beautiful at the same time the story is written in two separate points of views lucy's and matt's it flips between them every other chapter this type of story does not always work but was well done in this book i was impressed at how well the author kept the chapters separate and allowed you to truly see both sides of the story as i read i found that i actually kept my sympathy more on matt's side all the way up until the very last chapters of the book as a mom and a divorcee i was surprised to find my sympathies lying with matt it wasn't that i couldn't sympathize with her as a mother it is often second nature to question whether you are good enough it felt that lucy took so much longer to grow up and accept her parental responsibilities then matt did it was not until lucy finally seemed to turn her life around that i felt like she deserved that sympathy in the end my greatest sympathy was left with the children and how much they went through and the scar's that they most likely bare from their parents it was an eye opening book for me in seeing that relationships can really be very complex it was interesting how much lucy clung to unhealthy relationships and that she never felt quite completely when she was in a boring normal one with matt this book is a must read but with that i will give a caution if you are looking for a feel good book with a feel good love story to make your day complete you may want to look elsewhere if you want a story that will get you thinking read this i love a story that makes me really think i was constantly putting myself in their shoes and thinking about how i would handle the situations it really is an amazing book that allows you to step outside yourself and think a little deeper i have to thank james thomson for the opportunity to read this book it is a story i won't soon forget","4":"why do people continue to make wrong choices when they know they are wrong and their lives will suffer this book had miserable female characters that you just wanted to some shake sense into especially lucy the main character who amazingly got her life back on track it was a compelling read not being sure of the ending until the end","5":"he makes excellent use of the alternate viewpoints going between lucy and matt to get a more complete honest picture of each perspective life isn't always black and white and this part came across well at first i was annoyed at lucy for always giving in for letting griffin run and virtually ruin her life then it was like watching a train wreck i forced myself to continue just a little more to get a sense of how it would play out and it did improve but not to an extent where i felt i enjoyed it so 3 stars","6":"3 5 stars... this is a cautionary tale of what happens by not trusting your inner voice or instincts and by becoming involved in a toxic and torrid relationship it's a story of matt and lucy who become involved get married and have children when each has their own reservations about their involvement the story is told in alternating prospective one chapter from lucy's point of view and the next from matt's it begins with lucy being very narcissistic and involved with a dubious character griffin with whom she has a very sexual and debasing affair matt a respectable police officer is set up with lucy on a blind date he falls head over heals in love yet he does have a gut feeling that she's stringing him along this novel is about lies you tell yourself and lies you tell others although lucy's starts out fairly vile in this reader's opinion her character does mature into a likeable person matt's character is fairly consistent i don't provide major plot twists to be fair to the next reader but i will say that matt does a questionable act that would be a great book group discussion was he justified or was he wrong what is great about this novel is that thomson wrote them as both likeable well lucy became likable both are flawed but reasonably flawed i had compassion for both characters an interesting read which is beautifully written it's a fast and intriguing read","7":"i enjoyed this book i see some previous reviewers compared this book to gillian flynns' gone girl i find that to be quite contrite the only thing these two books have in common is that they are both about marriages other than that they are no where near the same i disliked both characters in gone girl some disliked both in this but i found matt to be quite likeable lucy didn't deserve those children matt did what he had to and in the process made a pretty good story i would recommend this to my fellow married friends","8":" once i had the time to get fully engaged in this book i didn't want to put it down i found that the characters both made me so angry yet their thoughts and feelings were very human we all think some of the things they did what frustrated the heck out of me was their decision making and execution of those crazy thoughts it was very real though very plausible interesting to me was how captivated by the book i was despite not caring for either main character lovely writing intense storyline","9":"the lies you wanted to hear were the easiest ones to tell i loved this book i couldn't put it down it was beautiful and poignant and suspenseful and ended perfectly the writing was great and i loved hearing the story from alternating perspectives no one really ends up being the villain because life is too complicated for that love loved it","10":"really good until the very end","11":"i just finished this book today lucy is a horrid creature beautiful self centered egotistical spoiled bratty etc you get the idea never in all the books i've read have i disliked a character as much as i disliked her and maybe it's due to the fact that i didn't find she was a very good mother at all she was married to a guy who may have been somewhat emotionally distant but if she were my wife i'd keep my distance too lucy can't grow up and mature enough to say this is the life i really want at the beginning of the book i felt bad for her but as the story went on it was all woe is me my life sucks i'm rich and i've got men falling all over me do i want good and safe or bad and unstable about 1 2 way through the book i started skimming her sections there was nothing new but the last quarter of the book did bring her somewhat back into my good graces a very small bit overall i thought it was a good story and it makes you think about what you would do in a situation like this i would recommend this to others","12":"this book had me hooked from the beginning and kept me wondering the entire time but i really hated the ending left me feeling confused and annoyed","13":"so so predictable good character development but tired worn out characters bad mother father takes the kids later the kids find her and have a nice relationship with her despite dad doing all the upbringing bleh","14":"this book is like gone girl in that there are two sides of the story and my opinion of matt and lucy kept changing in this the author did a good job of showing that not everything is black and white and not everyone is completely good or bad i didn't like lucy for much of the book but she still didn't deserve what happened to her i also didn't like how time sped up too quickly and the cop out ending in more ways than one","15":" this is a story of matt a cop in boston who meets lucy the spoiled party girl with a recurring party bachelor ex lucy and matt wind up together with a family and make some insane decisions that drastically alter their futures i really churned through this book quickly it was so well paced and moved i was so surprised at how i went from really siding with matt to lucy to matt to lucy to not knowing what i thought at all this was such a great read to get you wondering about your feelings on the subject matter from so many perspectives i recommend this to anyone who liked the dual narration of gone girl it will be reviewed in people magazine on november 18th and it's an october libraryreads pick so be sure to check it out","16":"great book i was so invested in these characters could not put it down need one of my reading peeps to read it so i can process it","17":"i expected this novel to be a page turner but i had trouble getting into it it sparked up towards the end but i really couldn't relate to the characters and had little sympathy for them while i deeply respect this author along with all authors i can't say it is one of my favourite reads","18":"well written with great plot twists and insight into relationships","19":"very well written and held my interest but not destined to be a classic i would recommend it just not in a huge way the ending left me baffled why did he do that what does that mean about his other big decision","20":"this book is about a relationship built on lies and betrayal and the price all those involved pay very well written and emotionally charged i was left questioning who the true villain was","21":"just on the verge of being good","22":"this is a gripping contemporary tale of a man and a woman who marry and have children but don't live happily ever after thomson has done a great job of telling the story from each point of view the reader is pulled along caring about the characters but clearly seeing their faults and questionable decisions a great first novel","23":"the author information was very interesting his first published novel at 67 i didn't think i was going to like it but it was a good read jodi picoult is one the authors who has a blurb on the cover of the book and the book has a jodi picoult slant to it what would you do if you were in the same situation","24":"loved this book","25":"surprisingly i read this one in a day i was hooked from the beginning interesting story about the one of the worst outcomes when you settle marry the wrong person and have children together lucy and matt are relatable to an extent but do some despicable things to each other that many people may not be able to relate to the lies you wanted to hear are the easiest to tell such a powerful statement because it's true it eventually falls apart though as lies usually do this book gets extra credit because i read the actual book and liked the way the pages felt and the writing looked lol weird maybe i'm sure some people will understand what i'm saying","26":"loved it couldn't put it down and it kept me guessing the entire time i had to fight the urge to skip to the end","27":" i started this book and read about a chapter then put it down for two months but when i revisited it i was caught up the characters aren't all that likeable but the story they are embroiled in seemed easy to relate to and you find yourself wanting to see what the final outcome of their bleak and somewhat predictable future will be the story flows from the two lead characters point of view and each chapter switches between the two voices as you see them meet fall in love marry and so forth this isn't a happy story but it is definitely an enjoyable read","28":" this is compelling enough would be a good book to read on a plane while it's cool that he got his first book published at age 67 you can really tell this is a first novel something is just really off tonally for pretty much the whole book and the ending is a little abrupt and not believable some early scenes between lucy and her friend come across as how men imagine women talk to each other if i tried to write male dialogue it would probably come out like dur dur dur my balls dur dur fart and these scenes are basically the flip side of that i feel like i'm being a little nitpicky with this one it's a perfectly decent domestic drama i just feel like it could have been better 3 1 2 stars","29":"i thought this was good but i still felt kind of let down at the end it had a lot of emotional build up throughout the first half almost first 3 4 but the later part part iii i think seemed sort of forced and rushed i'm not sure what to make of the ending","30":"loved it once i started it i couldn't put it down new u0026amp vibrant story line well done","31":"new book with a first time au thor was a big hit with me telling people what they want to hear because it makes life easier for whom this book really makes one think about communication within a relationship even in building one also looks at communication within a family serious stuff and if you communicate by driving off into the sunset","32":"it was an easy read to follow but as someone that has been married it was sad","33":"meh unrealistic situations and no likeable characters interesting morality questions","34":" lucy a young woman with an attraction to bad boys becomes disenchanted with her on again off again relationship with her lover and settles instead for marriage to matt a kind responsible police officer who adores her but when her old flame shows up in her life again lucy's actions lead to tragic consequences although this was a heart breaking story i found myself rooting for matt rather than lucy because matt was a much more likable character i viewed lucy primarily through matt's eyes so i had trouble sympathizing with lucy's plight until the very end perhaps it was the author's intent to have the reader look at this kind of story from a different perspective similar news stories today would have painted matt as the villain this was an interesting story that made me take a hard look at both sides of a moral issue","35":"couldn't put it down","36":" a mesmerizing story of two flawed yet believable characters in a doomed marriage lucy's inability to let go of a past relationship finally causes the marriage to implode matt moves out and within a short time takes their two young children sara 4 and nathan 2 and flees telling them their mother has perished in a house fire that also destroyed their jamaica plains home matt and the kids live like gypsies for a few years eventually settling across the country in california with new identities matt becomes adam sara because of her age is still sara but with an h and nathan becomes elliot matt adam is pleased with the comfortable drama free life he has created for his family and as the years go by looks over his shoulder less and less back east lucy moves on but never gives up hope that she will see her kids again things unravel when nathan elliot opts to go to college in boston when he goes to the library to research the fictional house fire that killed his mom he finds the news reports of his own abduction setting in motion a reunification with lucy for him his dad and sister several of the reviewers indicated that they found lucy's forgiveness and accommodation at this point to be not believable based on an event in my own life i disagree with this assessment although i was surprised at how easily my sympathies were with matt adam in 1972 my youngest brother was abducted by my stepfather at nathan elliot's age under similar circumstances told our mom had died and our family had no contact with him the next fifteen years when we finally found him our family with my mother at the helm chose to set aside the hurt and loss moving forward and established forgiving relationships with those involved maybe truth is stranger than fiction all in all i found this book a wonderful read and can't wait for the author's next effort","37":"nice reada scary thought that this happens a lot kept me turning the pages to see when he'd get caught good book","38":"disturbing story the lies you wanted to hear were the easiest to tell","39":"i was very disappointed in this one the description made it sound so promising but it fell flat there wasn't one character i liked or who had my sympathy nothing really happened until about halfway through this was a first book i hope his next one is better","40":" it's interesting how similar this is to gone girl and at the same time how different for the record i wasn't a big fan of gone girl probably the hype and the ending was not my cup of tea too shock value uh really for me at the same time i did appreciate the exploration of relationships and how misunderstandings and what you tolerate can really determine what you will spend the rest of your life with that said i think lies did a much better job on this front and was much more effective and believable though i don't think gillian flynn was necessarily going for believable so that's really just my thing not her fault as a writer it just ruined the moment for me i didn't realize i was reading a thriller i first heard of this book is an npr interview with the author i was attracted to the descriptions of a he said she said story with the host portraying it as a book where you truly empathize with each side it is true that you go through that feeling of identifying with supporting the one characters actions but not to the extent the host played it out i never really felt like one parent was so right with their actions and then in the next halter flipped to the other side rather you can definitely see the reasonings behind possibly even justify the actions of the father but despite having felt that way really empathize with that the mother went through well done the author got his idea from a true story that happened in massachusetts where the father was eventually found and taken to trial i read about the case before i read the book so much of it was in my head while reading lies in both cases there isn't a stereotype of the kidnapping father being a bad evil person rather someone who followed through with his promise to protect his kids and give them what he believed to be a better life so it creates a conflict for the reader and that too is done well in the book","41":" my husband was too perfect i was tired of trying to love him tired of the burden of being loved how could anyone live with all that devotion and understanding the scale was tilted so far in my favor it felt like an unbearable weight a fortune i was compelled to squander he embraces me i know it's supposed to make me feel safe but it's suffocating with my non husband lover it's the complete opposite it's like he frees me to be myself ouch not the most sympathetic protagonist","42":" there are a few male fiction writers who 'get it' about women wally lamb comes to mind and khaled hosseni now i will be adding james whitfield thomson to my list lucy is as true a character as i have ever read about there are many familiar things about her life to me we are close in age we lived in the same geographical areas in the 1970's and other similar experiences from those times her story kept me interested and concerned and in the end somewhat content i even think there are men who will enjoy this beautifully written story","43":"this is a great book not too much i can say about it without spoiling the story","44":"greatly enjoyed james whitfield thomson is a fantastic author with the ability to create realistic characters looking forward to his next book","45":"this book really burned my hide there are spoilers in this review be warned it does ring of shades of gone girl but i felt this was more palatable than gone girl however instead of despising both characters i actually ended up rooting for lucy she was not so despicable to have deserved what matt did to her i wanted matt to be punished and it infuriated me he felt no remorse whatsoever for his disgusting actions that the book riled me up so much is a good thing","46":"this book was somewhat of a surprise to me very easy read easy to get into and kept my interest throughout it wasn't what i expected based on the blurb which might have helped make it more enjoyable since i really didn't have any expectations my only complaint and it's a small one is i never really connected with any of the characters or felt any sympathy for any of them i never found myself rooting for someone but despite that i enjoyed this quite a bit","47":"this was a really great book i don't usually like books that go back and forth with characters in different chapters but it worked so fluidly in this book the little details that james provided without making you feel like you should skim read kept me staying up late to get to the end you will go from rooting for griffen to hating him and rooting for matt and then back the same will happen with lucy u0026amp matt in the end i was torn about lucy u0026amp matt i can 100% agree and understand why he did what he did but i always felt my heart reaching out to lucy for what she went through all those years the only part that kept me from making this a 5 star was the very ending i guess i didn't fully understand the very last part about matt i refuse to call him adam","48":"i really didn't like either main character they were both horrible in their own ways however i guess it was compelling enough for me to actually finish the book","49":"this was a very good read it's about a marriage that was doomed from the beginning because of a lie it also shows the length a person will go when they think they are right and want to inflict revenge","50":"a good read with an interesting perspective from both sides of a charged situation","51":"a terrific book the author has a real ear for dialogue a strong storytelling sense and a refined understanding of the human heart notably the female human heart a rare virtue in a male author","52":"fun read all the adult characters behave badly and it's interesting to see how their stories unfold","53":" this is a family drama about a marriage gone wrong matt and lucy meet and fall in love matt much more so than lucy marry and have two children the marriage is never the strongest but things really start to unravel when griffin a bad boy from lucy's past reappears soon afterwards matt makes a decision regarding the welfare of his children a decision that has dramatic and long lasting consequences the novel is narrated by both protagonists in first person point of view alternating chapters this approach adds depth in that the thoughts and feelings of both are revealed what become obvious are the lies each tells the other and him herself lucy eventually tells matt \"'the lies you wanted to hear were the easiest ones to tell '\" but matt could have said the same to lucy and it would have been as true one problem with the book is its slow pace at the beginning matt and lucy's relationship is developed in great detail the problem is that this development has little suspense readers know from the first meeting between matt and lucy that theirs will not be a forever and for always relationship after devoting three quarters of the book to a five year time period the author then glosses over 18 years in the last quarter characterization is weak lucy is not a likeable person she is the typical spoiled rich girl shallow arrogant and self centred the reader is to believe that she matures but even in the end she is still focused on herself she doesn't berate matt for how his actions impacted the children instead she rants about what he did to her matt's initial portrayal is just too good to be true he is the ever faithful and ever reliable husband and father in case the reader misses the point that he is a good man the author gave him the name dobryshev which is derived from the polish word dobry meaning good the minor characters fare no better they are flat stereotypes griffin is the proverbial bad boy a foil for the stalwart matt and jill is the steadfast friend and there are issues with realism would a therapist be so judgmental as to tell a client that she finds it difficult to support her because she is very good at making poor choices there are other weaknesses in terms of realism a woman becomes pregnant after missing one birth control pill and is she likely to say \"now that i had said it - i'm pregnant - i couldn't conceive of my life in any other way\" at one point lucy says \"'i love matt \" but then later she says \"i was tired of trying to love him\" why would matt promise to call lucy on a particular day if he has no intention of doing so especially since that missed call will arouse suspicion and jeopardize his plans the novel spans the years 1977 to 2000 the author took pains to establish the year in which events occur the flaw is that he always uses music movies and fashion to convince the reader of the time period for her first date with matt in 1977 lucy debates between \"that white charlie's angels one piece or the salmon mini dress \" later they go and see the movie annie hall and there is reference to a poster for the spy who loved me to indicate that it is 1982 the author has lucy listening to \"john cougar mellencamp singing 'hurt so good' \" for 1999 the movies the end of the affair and deuce bigalow male gigolo are mentioned the impression is that the author did a pop culture search on wikipedia for each year he wished to differentiate the book was disappointing because of its slow pace stereotypical characters that arouse the reader's frustration and annoyance and issues with realism note i received an arc of the book from the publisher via netgalley please check out my reader's blog http schatjesshelves blogspot ca and follow me on twitter @dcyakabuski","54":" my thoughtsthe lies you wanted to hear spans decades in the lives of matt and lucy retelling the complexities of their relationship the story details their introduction growing affection sacrifices disappointments and betrayals i came away from this book disturbed by the knowledge that people do crap things to those they are supposed to love it was quite depressing really there was nothing wrong with the writing and there was really nothing wrong with the content there was an allusion to danger that the author portrayed quite vividly i turned the pages dreading what was going to happen the potential for serious escalation was there but it just didn't eventuate and i couldn't decide whether to be relieved or disturbed by that the lies you wanted to hear is actually a great discussion book in fact there are topical questions to explore with your book club listed in the final pages that are designed to encourage the reader to analyze their responses to what they have read which is fantastic if that's what you're after this book and i were just not a good match i read for pleasure to escape the everyday concerns and enjoy some light fantasy if i want to wax poetic about moral versus ethical issues i'll attend a philosophy class if i feel the need to debate the levels of sin determine who's lies crimes are greater i'll visit my pastor if i want something heavier i'll put myself in the head in a detective and maybe solve a crime want i don't want what i'll never need is to involve myself in the righteous misery that some people think they are justified to inflict on each other my rating disclaimeri obtained an arc from the publisher via netgalley with a view to providing an honest review the thoughts expressed above are entirely my own i don't really like the concept of rating novels as they are subjective and subject to change a five star book today may be re evaluated when compared to future novels","55":" this was a book that is hard to rate at times i hated the two main characters lucy and matt for being too selfish the story is advanced from chapter to chapter from the point of view of lucy and matt as their relationship begins starts to fall apart and then matt taking the drastic action of kidnapping their children i wanted to throttle both character at various times that being said the book was thought provoking i think it would be good for a book club with the caveat that people who have gone through a contentious view point may have a completely different perspective on the book and the choices made by the characters","56":"a great book discussion book","57":"i liked the way the author wrote each chapter from a specific characters point of view being that it only took me 3 days to read the entire book you can tell it definitely kept my interest from the beginning to the very end","58":" 3 5 this is a family drama filled with moral ambiguity it's worth a read if you are interested in those kinds of issues lucy likes bad boys one in particular she knows her choices are bad for her so she forces herself to go for the good guy she knows is head over heels in love with her the problem is that she feels like she is living a lie always denying her true nature things i liked about this book 1 the shift between matt's point of view and lucy's worked well it highlighted the total disconnect 2 lucy's struggle with herself anyone can relate to that tension between what you want to do and what you know you should want to do 3 the nuances and moral complexity of what ultimately happens neither side is innocent but i feel for both things that didn't work as well for me 1 i felt slightly manipulated and lied to by the author in that characters portrayed as one way in the beginning seemed to change radically at the end 2 i hate when books make me feel depressed and hopeless 3 character development for secondary characters is lacking this is really about matt and lucy this is mainly about a doomed relationship and the repercussions of living a lie there is a major event that results and which is also horrific and complicated i don't want to give that away though you'll have to read it to find out","59":"i enjoyed this book despite two lead characters who don't give you much to like","60":"i'm on the fence about this book my immediate rating was a 4 since i devoured it in a few days and loved to hate both main characters but the more i continue to digest the book i have second thoughts about the wrap up at the end and how i feel cheated","61":" a very readable story all be it a very simple one i kept reading for the sake of my book club however without that requirement i never would have picked it up in the first place i suppose stories like this just aren't my cup of tea it never felt like a challenge to my intellect or to my personal philosophies the egalitarian in me would like to say that the male author is capable of writing from the perspective of a fully realized three dimensional female character but i felt like an archetype of the damaged selfish woman seeking redemption in the eyes of a wronged man character i give it three stars because it was engaging in the sense that i felt compelled to read ravenously in hopes of finding something special in its conclusion i did not","62":"the story of matt and lucy was doomed from the get go lucy was a wild fun sexual woman while matt was the honest to god good guy every mother wants for her daughter lucy had been and quite honestly was still in love with her ex griffin lucy and griffin had that kind of raw magnetic pull to each other that was all wrong they only things they shared were sex and drugs nothing \"real \"lucy decides to go out on a blind date with matt and wasn't really interested but kind of used him to get over griffin after months of dating matt she finds out she is pregnant and just when she was going to tell him griffin shows up instead of pushing griffin away she spends one last night with him fast forward a few years and lucy and matt are married and have one child and another on the way lucy is starting to feel trapped she thought she could be happy with matt and live that \"perfect\" family lifestyle after having her son she suffers from post partum depression she feels lost but with the help of matt she begins to find her way and decides to get a job to help her get out of the house for a few hours that's when it happens...she spots griffin lucy just can't help herself and she begins to have an affair soon after matt founds out and the drama begins griffin is like lucy's drug all she thinks about is him knowing he doesn't want anything serious while filing for divorce matt wants custody but at that time the mother always got custody matt doesn't give up hope he wants his kids after realizing lucy is unfit to take care of their children with drugs and other men around he wants better for his kids so he decides to take matters into his own hands on a family vacation he decides he will kidnap the kids and start over not to give it all away but let's just say there are years of being on the run and things aren't so easy for lucy either while i didn't like the character of lucy being selfish and all you can't help feel her pain in wanting to find her children but was it all lucy's fault she was always very clear to matt about who she was and about her past matt always knew he was second in lucy's life...after griffin but he always thought he could change her so it is true we only believe what we want to believe we all know deep down what is right and what is wrong but sometimes our hearts lead us and not our heads this is what makes me love this story however the ending... made me want more i'm that kind of person who needs everything tied up in bow and wants no stones left unturned this is a wonderfully written story about family love and sometimes doing the wrong things for the right reasons i highly recommend this...please read this it will definitely make you question if we are really truthful with the people in our lives but most importantly are we honestly truthful with ourselves","63":"this book was great but there was a few things annoying about it first why is the resume so revealing i read it a long time ago when i decided to put that book in my 'to read' shelf and then while i was half through it i decided to read it again bad idea it spoiled it all i still kept on reading and the last hundred pages of the book were really intriguing while i was waiting for a big twist at the end i was a bit disappointed but happy of my reading overall","64":"i loved this book so much i def recommend you to read","65":"this was ok but it really didn't make me sit up until part 3 and then it ended i'm not saying the end didn't gel with the story because it did adam reacted true to form it just felt lazy without giving to much away i think the physiology around spousal kidnapping could have been developed more as well on the whole not a bad read","66":" 4 0 out of 5 stars the lies you tell yourself are the ones that hurt you the most this is another tale of love gone wrong a fairly common theme for the story of a modern tragedy but it's not what happened to lucy and matt that makes this novel hard to put down but why it happened lucy and matt meet on a blind date set up by lucy's best friend jill lucy's on the rebound but barely after a long and heartbreaking romantic thrill ride that ended with griffin just walking away she's definitely not ready for matt a nice loyal good guy who is immediately smitten with lucy's edginess and he falls hard matt is a hard working cop who treats her like a princess unfortunately lucy isn't honest with herself or with matt and that's where it all starts when your relationship is built on a foundation of little white lies and big black ones how can things go well when is good enough not enough and then what i really enjoyed this fast paced and entertaining read it went in a direction that i didn't really expect the characters were well developed and though i did not like lucy at all i came to empathize with her told in alternating viewpoints by lucy and matt who attempt to give the reader their side of the story it grabs hold right away the reader can sense that something is coming and when it does the urge to judge is right there and begs the question what would you have done this would make a great book club read as there are many issues for discussion recommended thank you to netgalley and sourcebooks landmark for the ebook to review","67":"somewhat ok seems unfinished","68":"a complex story that is simply written but the fact that its not overwritten is what i found so appealing really enjoyed just getting sucked into the story","69":"3 75 stars this is a really interesting story in 3 parts that didn't go at all the way i expected told from the alternating perspectives of lucy and matt whitfield lets you into the headspace of both which is an interesting place to be unlike many stories told this way thomson has a way of switching your loyalties back and forth until you can't decide whose side you're on or who you're rooting for thomson made some interesting and imperative choices when writing this especially with the timeline and i appreciate that he did his research i'd recommend going into this book knowing nothing besides what's on the back cover it was an adventure for sure and spoilers would make the adventure significantly less surprising i struggled with a few things 3 specifically view spoiler for the first third of the book it was less back and forth for me and i spent a lot of time being frustrated with lucy she had this great guy in front of her but kept being drawn back to loser griffin made for a good story but i definitely felt bad for matt and what he was getting into with her i also found myself wishing their voices were slightly more pronounced from a storytelling perspective they were easy to tell apart but a tiny bit more personality maybe just in the way they talked could have made this a 5 star book the whole thing was pretty believable until matt left with the kids it just didn't seem to fit with his personality he was a cop for crying out loud it worked but i wish i'd seen more flaws in matt from the get go to make it make sense he was a level headed guy throughout most of the story then to go and do something huge just didn't seem to quite fit but i don't have kids and i'm sure loving your kids will make you do crazy things hide spoiler definitely a solid debut from 67 year old thomson on par with his younger contemporaries","70":" a compelling story that combines both a constantly evolving plot and a wonderful development of characters from the beginning to the end the reader is held in suspense about in which direction the story will unfold there are no heroes or villains in this tale but rather ordinary people caught up in events that rapidly turn their seemingly normal lives into surrealistic experiences best of all is that the author does not allow the developing tensions and conflicts to resolve themselves in an artificial feel good ending but instead forces the reader to consider both the darkness and the light that are part of all true life resolutions a great read","71":" this book for me was a great read there are two characters who are trapped in a marriage that was doomed from the start they partake in this complex relationship that adds two children who later are part of a suspenseful trek around the country first there's matt the seemingly good guy and lucy who he loves beyond reason to understand lucy the reader must realize that she was damaged before she met matt and then there's griffin who drifts in and out of her life i myself couldn't put this book down and was infuriated at these characters for making repeated mistakes once i finished this read i was sad that it was over and i felt sorry that matt lost his grip of reality at the end","72":"more like a 3 5 easy enjoyable beach read shows how the little things so quickly turn into big things when the love has vanished i didn't care for the wife much in the beginning but ended up feeling as though the husband matt was a self righteous smug man in the end","73":" this book is excellent i am so excited about this author i can hardly believe it is his first novel his writing is perfect in my opinion smart poetic when it needs to be gritty when it needs to be and compulsively readable this is a long book and with 3 children i can spend some weeks on just one book but somehow i made time for this and finished in a flash because i just couldn't put it down the reader goes on such a ride with this story my emotions were all over the place you find yourself going back and forth both loving and hating the three main characters which is rare for me the title reflects that lies you wanted to hear i mean a lie is bad right but that wording makes it sound like the teller of the lie has no responsibility and is off the hook because the other person wanted it that tortuous you made me do it mentality is a recurring theme in this book and i think that is what makes it so hard to choose a side i am glad i stuck with my usual plan of skipping any intros and prologues until after i finish the book when i went back to the beginning after the last page it was heartbreaking and also would have given a lot away not reading it kept the suspense going and i had no idea what matt would end up doing until it happened great read lots of on point domestic descriptions on married life and parenting which honestly was surprising coming from a man he took the racy parts just far enough to be totally believable without crossing the line into offensive or gratuitous and that is important to me a lot of otherwise great men writers fall into that at times but thomson's voice is clear and flawless throughout","74":"i couldn't put this book down i finished it on 24 hours which i haven't done in years i can't say that i loved the characters but i needed to find out what happened to them much better than gone girl in my opinion","75":"loved this book interesting to read right after gone girl similar in that lies can unravel marriages i liked how he developed his characters and how he ended the book very melancholy great first novel definitely worth reading","76":"gut wrenching and very emotional read especially if you have children not for the faint of heart hoping he continues to write more novels","77":"a good book about what draws us to the people we love and what tears people apart i loved the first 2 3rds of the book i really wasn't sure about the last part","78":"uninteresting characters that i could not relate to the ending was good but not enough of a payoff for the plodding stretched out story that comes before it i understand how this book could really work for some people it just didn't do anything for me like a slow incline leading over a cliff 2 5","79":"not a bad read but fizzled out at the end","80":"the main character lucy is spoiled and selfish but keep reading it's worth it i stayed up all night to finish this thought provoking","81":"emotional roller coaster it took me a couple months to finally read this book and i am soooo glad i did the trouble with the past is it's never really over just keeps coming back and biting you in the ass this book is full of lies hurt and betrayals a must read for this summer","82":"it has easily became a favourite it broke my heart and reminded me with so much parallels i was the child then i was the mother then i find myself being the sister this book is so fresh and it is something my mind has been craving for since i've been stuck up on tarryn fisher i loved the writing i loved how ultimately if this were to be categorised as a love story it wasn't a romantic one but the best kind of them all parental and utterly unconditional","83":" 4 5 stars james whitfield thomson's extraordinary debut novel lies you wanted to hear is a compelling story about the disintegration of a marriage and its messy aftermath impossible to put down this spellbinding tale of love gone wrong will leave readers questioning what choices they might make under similar circumstances lucy thornhill is on the rebound following the demise of her long term and tempestuous relationship with griffin when she agrees to a blind date with matt drobyshev hard working loyal and all around good guy matt immediately falls for lucy and although he clearly sees her faults his feelings for her make it easy for him to overlook them while lucy likes matt she is not in love with him but she continues to date him although she still harbors feelings for griffin when griffin re enters her life lucy makes a fateful decision that sets into motion a chain of events that spans over twenty years lucy and matt are richly drawn and highly complex characters lucy is overwhelmed by motherhood and plagued by feelings of inadequacy matt is very comfortable and at ease with fatherhood and he remains deeply in love with lucy following the birth of their second child lucy suffers from a severe bout of post partum depression and despite matt's patience and understanding their marriage never quite recovers once again griffin's reappearance in lucy's life spells disaster for the struggling couple lies you wanted to hear is written in first person from both protagonists' point of view the chapters alternate between matt and lucy's perspective and provide the reader with each characters' viewpoint of unfolding events lucy's actions and dishonesty paint her in a very unflattering light for much of the story it is much easier to sympathize with matt especially when the marriage begins to unravel but in the aftermath of matt's questionable decision lucy becomes the more sympathetic character and by the novel's end she is one who undergoes the most dramatic transformation lies you wanted to hear poses some very interesting questions about the unwitting repercussions of the choices we make many readers will be able to relate to the struggles of both characters and all will be left wondering what they would do if faced with the same situation all in all an amazing first outing by james whitfield thomson that i highly recommend","84":" this story of a contemporary family told from two perspectives lucy and matt husband and wife the writing style makes for an easy to read and fast moving narrative as in many if not most relationships there is conflict this conflict grows more pronounced with the arrival of lucy and matt's two children a page turner you won't want to turn out the bedside table light until you reach the end once you close the book you may not have liked either matt or lucy and they may have seemed a little contrived but overall a good first novel from author james whitfield thomson","85":"intense story of a troubled marriage told by both parties of the relationship a great look at how we can fool others and even ourselves i found this to be a gripping and interesting novel","86":"review on my blog https girlygirlbookworm wordpress c","87":"well written debut literary fiction it kept me hooked and moved quickly i read the whole book in one afternoon i felt like the author did a good job developing the voice of each character and giving equal weight to both sides of the story i also think the authors backstory was interesting","88":"so well written it's hard to believe that it is the author's debut novel stayed up way past my bedtime to finish this book","89":"interesting novel on two very different people who fall in love lucy is spontaneous a risk taker and charismatic matt is rigid traditional and frugal the lies they tell twist throughout their marriage then matt decides he can no longer risk his children's lives by allowing them to remain in contact with lucy the choice he makes is shocking the story is told by matt and lucy in alternating chapters i came to care for both","90":"not serious literature but an interesting premise at what point is it acceptable for a parent to take drastic custody measures where children are concerned told from alternating viewpoints it's easy for the reader to keep switching alliances the parents who never should've gotten married as it happens were married the same year i was and the children in question born around the same time as mine so that certainly kept me engaged","91":"i enjoyed this story it at times was a bit predictable but the author left you hanging enough to keep the pages turning i gave it a 4 because it was just one of those books i didn't want to put down a good easy summer read","92":"it's been a while since a story's characters pulled me in like lucy and matt if i had the time i probably would have read the book in a weekend but had to read in bits over the course of a few weeks each time i put the book down i couldn't wait until i could steal more time to read on this is a good book for a discussion or reading group","93":"loved this","94":"great read thoughtful look at relationships in an unthoughtful society although the title mentions lies this book talks to me more about rationalizations exactly what is it that can push a regular guy's actions over the line what keeps many of us from being honest with ourselves","95":"good but i was expecting something far more dramatic at the end","96":"a gripping tale like watching a train wreck and being unable to avert your eyes","97":"this was a very entertaining almost perfect summer read at the end i wanted to know what would happen next","98":"i mainly finished this book because i needed to know how it ended unfortunately the ending was disappointing while i liked that the chapters alternated points of view between the two main characters the husband and wife ultimately the characters didn't click for me","99":"this was a really interesting book when lucy and matt meet it's love at first sight for him but lucy is still hung up on her on again off again jerk ex boyfriend griffin matt is perfect on paper but she knows she'll never love him like he loves her but when she finds out she's pregnant she decides to make a go of it with matt but a few years later griffin comes back on the scene and lucy just can't resist him i don't want to give anything away but both matt and lucy have to deal with the consequences of their relationship and how that affects their children when matt does something drastic lucy realizes just how much she loves her kids and the lengths she would go for them overall it was a really interesting book that really makes you think about how every act has long term consequences even when you think you're doing the right thing i did think the ending was a little too vague and that's why i didn't give this one more stars the story definitely kept me going wanting to know what would happen next but i don't like vague endings","100":"very catching story and you shift your preference for the protagonists during the cause of the book i read it all on one plane flight","101":"quick read parts of the book made me think about what i would have done felt like the ending was rushed","102":" i was engaged from the moment i started reading this wonderful debut book from author james thomson it is brilliantly written sophisticated literate thought provoking all the superlatives that can be so dry but in this case apply the use of first person voice for the protagonists in alternating chapters was pitch perfect allowing the characters to speak their mind perhaps trying to influence us to see their perspective are they being coy self deceptive rationalizing in this way thomas plunges the depths of the characters revealing vanity and justifications the ambivalence ambiguities and inconsistencies of every mortal their evolution over the years the changes in perspectives and morality to me matt seemed more rigid and lucy more morally brave willing to take a cold hard look at her behavior that may have precipitated events yet certainly didn't justify matt's actions i also wondered was lucy's last smile to matt \"smug \" as he originally thought or was she putting aside grievances and asking him for that brief moment to join together as a family to show what could have been or was her smile something else entirely that is thomson's great strength in giving the reader complex believable characters they stay with us and for me bouncing around in my head long after i had finished the book as an attorney i wanted to face lucy and matt getting them to admit half truths and on a personal level i wanted to shake them and shout \"don't do that \" i remember the news story this was based upon but thomson has made it so much more interesting and complex like thomson as revealed in the author interview i had wondered how the children could be so accomplished and how they could stand by their father it was perfect for thomson to change facts and have one of the children discover the secret i don't know why but it struck me on a gut level as right keeping the drama within the family i loved the ending the pivotal question looking in a mirror could matt say and believe lucy got what she deserved i have my own answer to that but i'm pretty sure every reader will have his or her own i highly recommend this book and i look forward to more great books from author james whitfield thomson","103":"it was abook i could not put down i read it in two days excellent characters","104":"what a wonderful book the characters come to life and you feel as if you know them personally the author writes the book in alternating pov her side and his side matt fell in love the first time he saw lucy on their blind date he loved her deeply and with an open heart accepting her just as she was lucy only went on the blind date to make her best friend happy she had broken up with her boyfriend and was still very much in love with him the longer that her boyfriend stayed away the more lucy thought he would never come back so she eventually let matt into her life lucy discovers that she is pregnant and is planning on telling matt the day that griffin her x drops in to see her she takes off with griffin and is gone over night but returns to matt the next day when she tells matt that she is pregnant he drops to his knees puts his head in her lap and cries with joy she never tells matt that she slept with griffin the night before this is a very emotionally charged book with lots of ups and downs for the couple and a somewhat surprising ending i loved it and look forward to more from the very gifted author goodreads win thank you","105":"i liked this book got me interested right away and kept me interested throughout","106":"i really enjoyed this book it had me hooked since the very beginning i loved how the writing really drew me into the story line and how emotionally attached i got to the characters the ending left a little bit to be desired but i loved it anyway","107":"this was much in the style of gone girl but not quite as good it is a story told from two different perspectives and is really interesting it was one i didn't want to put down","108":"excellent best book i've read in quite some time","109":"enjoyed very much lucy was not bad enough for matt to do what he did once into it finished quickly characters were real life and believable","110":"hard to believe it's his first book compelling engaging authentic voice complex characterization couldn't put it down great storytelling in depth understanding of the nuances of relationship dysfunction very balanced representations of male and female viewpoints the reader can't really pick sides because both lucy and matt are so painfully human","111":"heartbreaking and so realistic","112":"lucy and matt meet on a blind date and he is instantly drawn to her but she is still dealing with a recent breakup and carrying some emotional baggage from the relationship the relationship develops and they marry but the secrets and scars that lucy hides from her previous relationship begin to forge a deep rift between them until they divorce and matt takes a drastic course of action which he believes is the only way to protect the children from lucy lots of hype about this one but i'm sorry to say it didn't really live up to it all for me the early part of the story the beginning and early years of the relationship were interesting as was the bitter breakup and divorce but the conclusion left me feeling completely unconvinced your ex husband leaves taking your children with him and you don't hear from them for 20 years then when they turn up again it's all pretty easy and you accept it without bitterness or anger sorry not this little black duck ok but disappointing","113":"very good read read it in three days it really makes you think what you would do in lucy or matt's situation i never really rallied for one character or another as i had a love hate relationship with both just really makes you think in the end","114":"not a typical guy book but i found that i couldn't put it down once i started reading the fact that the characters were always headed toward a train wreck kept my interest throughout and i found myself thinking about the characters after finishing the book which is something that rarely happens to me","115":"2 5 stars rounded up to 3 i didn't like this book as much as i wanted to like it but i can't quite pinpoint why the story was interesting the characters were well developed for the most part i just never really felt moved by their stories","116":" it's a shame the book had such a weak ending because the heart of the story was so delicate and intricately woven into the fabric of the book as i was reading this book i realized this is one of the only books i've read where i haven't necessarily liked a particular character in this book both characters are rather crazy but in separate ways it reminded me a bit of gone girl but a little more fluffy and involving the two children of the parents as you read the book it makes you more cognizant of how as humans sometimes we hear what we want to hear and not what is actually being said as well as how one little lie can completely spin out of control","117":"i always enjoy a book told from multiple character perspectives and this title is no exception lucy and matt both contributed to the demise of their marriage but certainly they see things differently a story of flawed adults making questionable choices and the consequences of those choices lies you wanted to hear really questions how depending on your perspective bad choices can still be the right thing to do or are they","118":"debut novelist at the age of 67 i am so inspired i really loved this one told in alternating perspectives from two people in a doomed marriage it would make a fantastic book club discussion i found empathy for both sides of the story a rarity in most books the ending left me lingering wishing for more of a conclusion between the two but maybe that is what made it so good it leaves the reader with the ability to draw your own conclusion","119":"a very captivating read wonderfully written i couldn't put it down the only thing that was a bit disappointing was the rushed ending so much time was taken in getting us to know the characters the ending felt too hurried","120":"couldn't finish it","121":" this is the author's first book and i thought it was impressive it is definitely not a feel good happy book it is told in alternating chapters of lucy and matt at different points in a long and tumultuous relationship the relationship is toxic and eventually there are a couple of kids involved at times it was depressing but at the same time i thought realistic without giving anything away what i thought was the case at the beginning of the book was not and what was actually the case turned out to be very interesting as it is not something you hear a lot about from that particular point of view sorry to be cryptic but i don't want to ruin it for anyone worth the read","122":" spoiler alert i loved the writing style of this book from two different pov's and that it took you from the beginning of their lives to some 20 years later or so and you grew and developed with the characters and felt like you were on their journey with them i was engrossed in the story and kept wanting to know more i just didn't like the ending cliff hanger ugh the worst way to end a book that's why i'm not giving the full 5 stars otherwise it would have been i despise cliff hangers and never knowing exactly what will happen you could ponder and assume but that's not exact and i hate that oh well a good read to pass the time by wish the author would write a sequel or something some things seemed left unsaid and i would love to be in these characters minds once more i also found myself siding on matts side a lot i didn't like lucy she was a cheating betraying woman although i didn't think she deserved not having her kids around ok enough about my rant book was great nonetheless","123":"thought it was trashy","124":"harrowing for a new mom","125":"i just have to say i absolutely love this book and couldn't put it down james thomson really knows how to make the reader be in the characters shoes lies you wanted to hear is a definite must read such a gripping tale that relates to everyday real life situations","126":"i won this book through a goodreads giveaway and i must say i was so surprised at how amazingly well this book was written i couldn't put this book down i think i'm going to reread it just in case i missed anything i absolutely will recommend this book to everybody i know bravo james whitfield thomason bravo","127":"gripping story a real page turner in which each narrator has an authentic unique voice i could empathize with matt's belief that he had no other choice and could feel lucy's loss however the first 3 4 of the book was so filled with emotion i was disappointed in how calmly the resolution was achieved","128":"back when lucy was younger she had two men falling for her the bad boy griffin and the good guy matthew if lucy had only thought with her heart then she would have picked griffin if she had picked with her attraction then she would have picked griffin yes lucy loved griffin but griffin was not one to settle down even for lucy so lucy chose matthew years later lucy is divorced lucy had two children but they are also gone now lucy is faced with the past and the lies she told to get to where she is now that means seeing griffin again to be honest i kind of struggled with this book on the one hand i found the story interesting but on the other hand i was not in love with the characters and found the same story to be long winded and moving very slowly in the beginning i was interested in lucy's story however as i got to know her i was turned off by her she seemed weak and uninteresting also in the beginning i could not see why lucy saw in griffin i found him to be too much of a loner he treated lucy like dirt and not someone that he loved i was rooting for matthew he was the nice guy that was finishing last however he did get the girl as the story progressed i still never became that enthralled by the characters but the story the author was trying to tell with lucy matthew and griffin is a sad one there really are no winners in this book all the lies they told each other kept them from having real happiness this book does show you that lying leads to no good outcome","129":" i found this book a compelling read my favorite line the lies you wanted to hear were the easiest to tell thomson does a good job of telling the story from a first person narrative switching back u0026amp forth between the two characters giving the reader an excellent perspective into the motivations driving each character's actions so that even when they make deplorable choices i found myself equally dismayed by u0026amp sympathetic to each i was immediately engaged in the story u0026amp thought it well written","130":"loved the story of matt and lucy's beginning from the two perspectives felt everything the author probably wanted me to feel was a bit thrown by the twist and how quickly things were resolved in the last few chapters of the book","131":"one of the best novels i have read in years skillfully crafted story with complex and like able characters despite bad behavior i cannot believe that a 67 year old man who is a first time novelist wrote this i was only disappointed that the book ended at all","132":"wow keeps ya thinking","133":"i couldn't put this book down even though halfway through i still didn't even like the characters they were so flawed i haven't forgiven the book for what happens in part 3 but part 1 and some of 2 raise a couple of good questions i come out of this book feeling conflicted somehow but without a lot of strong feelings or passion about what happened or how it went down ultimately i can't forgive part 3 thus i cannot properly rate this book","134":" i've thought about reading this book ever since listening to an interview with the author on npr the interviewer talked about how difficult it was to take sides in the novel how the alternating points of view really played with the reader's perception i have to agree that the author did an excellent job fleshing out both matt and lucy i couldn't put the book down and it made me feel grateful for the honest relationships i have in my life but i absolutely came away favoring one of the main characters over the other the book will make me think for awhile","135":"good story line i liked the way the story progressed through time i was conflicted who i should be sympathizing with matt or lucy hard situation that was well written","136":"this review has been hidden because it contains spoilers to view it click here i don't know why but i just couldn't quite sympathize with lucy from the beginning i just don't understand her 'obsession' towards griffin yes obsession is the right word indeed not love maybe it's his bad boy charm but as the story goes it just went too far the obsession i just caught myself thinking that she deserved what she got because she's such a selfish person it's okay if you're obsessed with a boy when you're a teenager who doesn't know any better but it's another story whe i don't know why but i just couldn't quite sympathize with lucy from the beginning i just don't understand her 'obsession' towards griffin yes obsession is the right word indeed not love maybe it's his bad boy charm but as the story goes it just went too far the obsession i just caught myself thinking that she deserved what she got because she's such a selfish person it's okay if you're obsessed with a boy when you're a teenager who doesn't know any better but it's another story when you're a grown woman with such devoting husband and 2 children i felt really bad for matt because he just couldn't help it he loves lucy with all he's got and i think he did the right thing maybe i'm just too young to understand more","137":"wow this sucked me in sort of like waiting for tea to boil and then being like ah yes worth the wait author to watch","138":"this was a good book and an easy read i would recommend it this is james' first book","139":"so much time was spent explaining how the characters got to where they were then a huge chunk of time passed with no coverage i wasn't a huge fan of what was happening but that decision made this review go from 3 to 2 stars","140":"amazing that this is from a first time author very compelling read","141":"i applaud the author's first book we need more noteworthy books to read genius writing the chapter sequencing was unique and easy to read the characters fell into place and the author made you care about them all the twists and turns were so delicious i couldn't put it down the author i hope will write many more books and the title tells it all i received this free book from goodreads first reads i predict a best seller","142":"this book was fantastic i don't know if i liked the way it ended but mr thomson had me hooked from the first page","143":"audiobook reader could not put it down honestly there were times i thought i was reading a bio a newspaper account the story was riveting to me-a mother who lost custody in the divorce a thousand years ago beautifully written riveting story excellent readers adept crafting of the story alternating between mom and dad wanted to tell lucy to stop being so stupid so glad she finally got her act together","144":"a debut novel that will keep you turning the pages","145":"flawed people in an unhappy marriage so often the children suffer as a result interesting ending","146":"very tragic story with characters that i hated back and forth they are parents and not once did they think of the children they only ever thought of themselves i understand why matt did what he did but what did it solve prove nicely written and easy to read","147":"i read a lot but it's been a while since a novel has kept me up half the night this book is terrific it has a great story very compelling characters and a satisfying conclusion i highly recommend it","148":"fell in love with the main character could relate to a lot in this book","149":"the more i read lies the more i got hooked until i couldn't put it down as the characters and the issues grew more complex i found myself challenged as to what is fair and what is not as the story progressed thomson's even handed treatment of the two main characters compelled me to reexamine my allegiances and that always makes for a good read","150":"i have not been so enamored with a book as i was with this one in a very long time and finished it in one day i found myself wrapped up in the lives of these characters and was reading long after my eyes were burning begging me to stop the ending was haunting and left me with many questions desperately wanting to know what becomes of these people for a debut novel it was stunningly written","151":"if i were to give a letter grade to lies you wanted to hear it would be a very strong b first i'll go into the pros and there are a lot of pros with this book its very engaging and fast paced and it keeps the reader wanting to turn the pages and get the the next chapter to see where our two main characters matt u0026amp lucy are headed the premise of the book is very simple matt falls in love with lucy head over heels to be exact while lucy not so much she is caught between matt the great on paper guy the type most mothers would tell their daughters is a great catch and griffin the kind of guy most mothers warned their daughters to stay away from naturally lucy is in love with griffin but decides to make a go with matt when she finds she is pregnant with matt's child they get married have another child and try to make it work lucy struggles with being a wife and mother and sometimes makes questionable and sometimes just downright wrong choices regarding her children but i never doubted for one second that she did not love her children with her whole being matt on the other hand took to married life and fatherhood like a duck to water despite that i did not like matt something about him bugged me there were a few instances in the book were a much darker side would emerge eventually push comes to shove and matt u0026amp lucy decide to end their marriage and that's when all hell breaks loose another great thing about this book is each chapter is told in alternating pov's from matt u0026amp lucy you get to hear both sides of the story in each s own words also i think its cool that this is the debut novel from 67 year old thomson major now for the cons really there is only one con that keeps me from getting it an a and that's the children's reaction when they finally find out what their father had done they were so nonchalant about it i just did not buy it i think most children would be very angry at what their father had done maybe even want him to be criminally prosecuted that part of the book just did not fit or work for me other than that i loved lies you wanted to hear diffidently makes you think and take a walk in both characters shoes and leaves you asking yourself what would i do","152":"i give it 3 5 stars it was okay the beginning was a bit slow and confusing at some parts i am not a mother so i don'really know about those feelings i can only imagine them but it must have been hard for both of them matt and lucy they both made mistakes and did things they believed were the best for everyone view spoiler during the last chapters you could feel that lucy grew as a person and as a mother this whole experince changed her and her point of view to the family and i'm really glad that matt told them and made them decide for themselves even though he feared that they might drift away hide spoiler","153":"this book was good i did like the writing but it seemed like neither main character was very likable","154":" 3 stars it was good what the synopsis does not say is that this book is very child centric with much focus on parenting had i known that i would have never picked it up as those types of books typically do not appeal to me and that would have been a shame because i quite enjoyed this novel my latest favorite flavor of literary candy appears to be train wreck marriages and relationships and as promised that love gone wrong factor is present and made for a very interesting story however this novel also brings up a lot of serious discussion points and could make for an interesting book club selection though childfree readers may have a difficult time answering many of the most controversial questions it was well paced being neither fast nor slow and felt much like watching a based on real life events lifetime network movie right vs wrong is not always an easy label to apply to difficult choices and this is thoroughly explored in the novel the characters are both flawed yet i had a definite favorite i agreed with most of the decisions that person made yes even the big one if you have read this you will know exactly who and what this refers to if you haven't read it this book will be far more enjoyable if you let it unfold naturally and are not spoiled i would caution against reading many reviews as some give away too much information the author weaves in numerous nods to literary works which is always a bonus for me what avid reader does not love books in their books lol be sure to also read the interview at the end of the book as the author lists many of his all time favorite novels i love that the author published his first book at 67 years old very inspiring and reminds us that it is never too late to follow your dreams favorite quote people say don't lose hope miracles happen as if hoping might have some bearing on the outcome but hope can be such a cruel companion hope never lets you grieve and be done with it hope is the abuser you keep hoping will change first sentence i hate flying the woman in the seat next to lucy says","155":" lies you wanted to hear was a book i could literally not put down i got myself to the gym one morning on the promise that i would have an uninterrupted hour of reading time on the elliptical once i got there true story lucy is the girlfriend wife mother you love to hate but also empathize with on some deeper level she can't quite seem to love matt as much as he loves her she's not quite a good enough parent she's gorgeous smart and has an underlying dangerously rebellious streak that she has inherited from her lush of a mother matt is the perfect boyfriend husband father he is a boston policeman that plays by the rules he buys flowers waits to have sex and changes old ladies' lightbulbs when he's walking down the hallway matt is so deeply enamored with lucy that he gladly overlooks her shortcomings the lies you wanted to hear the book is told by both matt and lucy each chapter alternates narrators and tells the same events from matt's or lucy's perspective i had absolutely no idea what was going to happen from one page to the next which is part of the reason i think this book had me hooked the writing is excellent filled with intelligent and creative metaphors that perfectly summarize life for example she was in the third grade and one of my reading junkies kids who read on the school bus in the lunch room outside at recess they finish one book and immediately start another like a chain smoker lighting his next cigarette off the last 329 i felt the book lost a little steam in the second half the story went from utterly real and believable to nearly incredible and that is the reason i gave 4 stars instead of 5 i'll leave it at that for risk of spoiling it for other readers all in all this is the perfect beach vacation read clear your schedule sit down on a lounge chair and read this book from beginning to end","156":"i enjoyed this first read about a dysfunctional couple and the lies that surrounded them i was torn over the characters in this book and i will try to explain without giving the story away i hated with a passion lucy's character from the very beginning i found her to be selfish arrogant self involved and truely unlikable matt although a little boring and naive got more sympathy from me as the story progressed to a part that you will know when you read i began to feel a little sorry for lucy and have a bit of sympathy for her at this point i started to like matt a little less understanding his motive but not agreeing with his actions the fact that you get both sides of the story neither being right is what made this an enjoyable read","157":" lucy is a gorgeous sexy woman who has a bit of an edge likes the wild side a bit she meets matt a policeman and an all time nice guy they have two kids she starts having an affair with an ex boyfriend he takes the kids and exits claiming they aren't really safe with lucy i can't quite figure out the meaning of the title i thought something hidden lied about was going to pop out at the end instead it ends quite peacefully one comment lucy makes is people say don't lose hope miracles happn as if hoping might have some bearing on the outcome but hope can be such a cruel companion hope never lets you grieve and be done with it hope is the abuser you keep hoping will change good words","158":"i loved this book the story kept you captured i didn't agree with the actions of one of the main characters but the story was told by both so you understood their emotions","159":"wtf i don't even know i was going to give this a 3 but the fact that i just finished tells me this is at least a 4 the short version is this i never really connected to lucy i kind of passively hated her she never did anything truly outrageous other than try to love a man because he was such a great guy which isn't a crime in theory i empathized with her dilemmas but it felt throughout out most of the book like even she didn't actually care she would be hateful if she wasn't so fucking lazy which just made me disgusted she wanted to love matt but couldn't really bother to but didn't feel compelled enough to leave him my feelings can be summed up by whatever bitch only later was i so absorbed in my hatred for matt i did finally work my way up to hate for him that i began to feel some genuine empathy for lucy but anyone would feel for a woman who goes through what she goes through i didn't feel like i understood the characters well enough but the writing was solid and the story was very engaging this is going to be one of those books that no matter what sticks with you for a full dissection view spoiler i want to scream at who or about what exactly i don't know but i'm so confused and angry someone needs to hear about it so that will be you dear reader who has clicked on the spoiler link this would be a good book club discussion but i will try to keep this as brief as possible here's the thing lucy wasn't a terrible mother she didn't smoke pot in front of her kids she wasn't ever high around them i dont think her kid breaks her wrist playing with griffin but that kid was a daredevil it wasn't like she wasn't there it wasn't like sarah had never played on the trampoline before her mom had been doing better people do stupid shit like falling asleep with a cigarette in their hands so matt's decision to abduct his kids is so goddamn unreasonable it was hard no imppossible to have any sympathy or understanding i get jealousy i get playing games with dropping the kids off later because you want to punish the mom okay great but you thought these kids didnt need a mother what in the entire and complete history of fuck is that even if there had been a hint a whiff of some sort of impropriety or danger from griffin actual negligence i could have gotten on board with this but she had post partum depression and tried to cope with an extra glass of wine i mean how is this in any way a decent thing to do and then all of a sudden he was a raging psychopath sorry kids mom's dead oh yeah and griffin too yep nanda and grandpa all dead and it just rolled off his tongue like okay it's all for the best granted if you're kidnapping your kids it's probably the safest answer at that age i wasn't upset that he said it as much as i was how easily he said it and how guiltless he felt about it more than that i was confused only afterwards did lucy reflect on how he didn't want anything to do with his mom and how that was f ing crazy but without these little tidbits the switch between matt and adam was too disjointed to believe nothing about good upstanding matt would do this beyond my outrage it just didn't make any gd sense and then the reunion are you seriously kidding me with this shit i understand that lucy told nathan she wouldn't press charges because she didn't want to run him off sara h too but then they get to the house and they are just bickering like bitter divorcees no you stole her fucking children we're past one liners okay maybe she showed some restraint so as not to go to jail for actual murder which would have been highly appropriate but they just settled into this routine like they were going to casually try to deal with each other for the kids he ruined her goddamn life again i am forced to query what in the entire and complete history of fuck is that and these kids i get that they love their dad i get that he's the only family they know or have but they heard that story of all of lucy's crimes and just said yeah ok makes sense to me you can't be serious especially nathan he felt like an outsider all his life i think he would have given moms a pass for dropping a fucking cigarette but the kids wanted to have this how can we move on from this again where is the logic i'm looking but i cannot find it and then the ending happened and i thought i should be cleaning my house she smiles at him what and he thinks he has the right to get angry rufkm because she's smug i literally don't understand that reaction she is smugly not stabbing him in the throat which is a far better fate than he deserves smug about what hahaha my kids still want to have a mother figure in their lives i'm too angry to find a humorous yet apropos gif for this so then because of this smug smile which he's not even sure is what she intended matt father of the gd millenium leaves his daughter's engagement party your kids come first and you'll do anything for them unless your wife maybe or maybe not tries to give you a take that look then you bail i'm tired of hearing myself say wtf so i'll end this rant here but my rage will live on forever hide spoiler update after ranting a while in the spoiler section i'm going back down to a 3 i can't fault the writing or the plotting but the irrationality of some of the characters is too hard to overcome","160":"this is an extraordinary book a best seller in my estimation i loved it the characters are rich and complex and thomson is a master story teller using the characters to reveal their lies and 'truths' to the reader with colorful detail and raw emotion i began reading the book thinking of the author who is a long time friend but i soon got caught up in the lives and lies of the characters and found myself swept away in the story there were many times that i didn't want to put the book down and other times that i had to put it down because the dynamic tension was so intense i needed to process my feelings for a while i didn't want the story to end and i am still pondering the ending don't know if this is a writer's hook for the next installment of the matt and lucy story but the ending still lingers with me this is a book that will be read by millions i look forward to the next one","161":"lucy is a magnet for men and they loved her beyond reason matt whom lucy is married to and is the father of her two children griffin her old flame the only person with whom she felt a connection comes back into her life and she starts drifting towards him the lives of these three individuals and the choices they make is the twists and turns in this novel sometimes human relationship take such unusual turns people end up taking strange decisions which affects everybody they for around them","162":"this was a great anti love story","163":"horrible read","164":"lucy meets griffin and they begin a affair to remember when she gets pregnant he insists on an abortion and then disappears she can't get him out of her mind and whenever he reappears their torrid romance resumes then matt comes along a good guy a cop honest honorable and when lucy gets pregnant with his baby they marry the lies you wanted to hear are all the ones lucy tells matt every time griffin returns","165":"hard to know who to feel bad for in this story definitely worth the read","166":"very good love giving new writers a try he did not disappoint kept thinking a female wrote this looking forward to his next book definitely worth reading","167":"i absolutely loved this book it was honestly such an amazing story i would recommend it to anyone","168":"lucy is a young woman in trouble when we first meet her unfortunately she is not in love with matt the boyish policeman who falls for her hard on their first date eventually the two marry and have a couple of kids but then her irresistible ex appears on the scene and matt decides that his children are no longer safe with their mother well written and sympathetic to both characters this is an absorbing first novel i was surprised to find out the age of the author he does a great job with this book writing in each character's voice and developing them","169":"i loved this book a very moving story and thomson did an incredible job of portraying each character with enough sympathy so that the reader has a hard time siding with either one in their conflict i was drawn to this because the author was my high school english teacher for one semester many moons ago i ran into him again in the early '90's when i worked for borders and he came to a reading signing by his mentor andre dubus i was thrilled to learn he had published a novel hopefully the first of many and happier still to have liked it so much","170":"really liked it a lot would have liked a slightly different ending but an excellent first book","171":"sometimes it helps to hear a lie instead of the truth it hurts to hear the truth sometimes it makes you feel better to be in denial eventually you start to believe the lies told to you you start telling your own lies and you begin to believe those too what happens when those lies catch up to you will your world totally collapse will you have the strength to pick up the pieces all of that and more is going on in lies you wanted to hear by james whitefield thomson matt was a man who lived by rules and reason he stays inside the lines but after a blind date with the free spirited lucy matt is immediately smitten lucy is wild lucy is outspoken lucy doesn't take life too seriously lucy is the opposite of matt reading the book i thought he should just run from her lucy is still pining away for her on again off again boyfriend griffin matt is more of a distraction for lucy than actual boyfriend material matt is the man you take home to meet your parents griffin is the man you sneak around with in the backseats of cars and seedy motel rooms read the rest of my review at http www asiturnthepages blogspot c","172":"this was written by a 69 yr old first time novelist i liked it once i started part 3 i had to finish it to see how it ended kept me up way too late i saw myself and so many other women i've known in lucy part 1 wasn't expecting the ending not sure how i feel about the last page","173":" an easy read mr thompson writes a realistic woman's voice there are no big surprises nor twists in this novel a woman's secret is discovered by her husband who takes their children and disappears the book tells the story of both husband and wife then final resolution a good story for those who enjoyed light between oceans and the husband's secret i read all three in succession and while all three were worth my time and recommendations i'd advise breaking them up with other books in between","174":"very good book hard to put down","175":"good book club book boston area setting 1970's 1990's love deceit drastic actions was anybody right or wrong who was likeable and who was not why did people do what they did lots to think about and talk about","176":"i really enjoyed this novel and still can't quite believe its written by a first time author although this novel is essentially about the imploding of a marriage and the disastrous results of lies and betrayal it definitely isn't a depressing or sad novel i found the pacing to be good as was the overall story arc thomson creates complex and interesting but ofen difficult to relate to characters that i enjoyed learning about and trying to figure out definitely a solid read that i recommend","177":"i really liked it until i didn't i kept reading to see what happened to the characters though it would be a good book for a book group club to discuss as it involves controversial topics the writing was very good and i liked the way the story played out but wasn't a fan of what happened if that makes sense","178":"couldn't make it through this one skimmed the rest and did not feel my usual guilt i didn't like lucy enough to deal with her through an entire book","179":"this was a fantastic book the characters were crafted so well i felt like i knew them personally i can't wait for more from this author","180":"i couldn't connect with any of the characters in the very focused relationship driven book the style was not for me","181":"i had trouble getting interested in this book in the beginning and i strongly disliked the main character lucy matt did what he did out of love for his kids and like lucy said near the end of book it was worse than any prison sentence","182":" spoilers okay first just because the setting is boston do you really need to throw the f word in all it's various forms into the dialogue at will i don't think it's necessary second turn the one semi likeable character in the story into a child kidnapper really i understand the need no the gut wrenching ache to protect your children from harm however a fall from a trampoline resulting in a broken arm and forgetting things in an overnight bag do not an unfit mother make i do agree that riding with an alcoholic grandmother was seriously a bad decision but really to take her children away for 18 years i get it divorce is ugly people do stupid things even or especially to those they love but the decision to take children away from their mother simply because she cheated on you probably never loved you to begin with and didn't fit your idea of a perfect mother is lower than low","183":" thoroughly enjoyable realistic and relatable hard to believe this is a debut novel about the complexities of relationships marriages family relations and lies all sorts of lies small lies big lies lies we tell ourselves lies that are better than the truth lies we want to hear the story unfolds in alternating narratives of lucy and matt reminds me of gone girl because there's always two sides of the story it's a life like drama in which i found many thoughts feelings sentiments i could relate to and at the same time it really made me think it wasn't just pure entertainment nor was it easy to choose sides quite touching fully recommended","184":"at first i wanted the story to move along faster but then the plot thickened and i sped through to the end","185":"people claim there are three sides to every story yours mine and the truth in lies you wanted to hear james whitfield thomson's stunning debut novel the story of what happens to matt and lucy is presented with the narrators alternating chapter by chapter and the reader is left to decide what the truth is the format reminded me a bit of gone girl by gillian flynn and i think that if you loved that book you will love this one too i don't want to say too much about the plot because where things begin and where they end is quite shocking but also absolutely plausible please read this book before people start telling you about it or giving things away or you see a spoiler online lies you wanted to hear opens with a prologue in 1990 where lucy is imagining how her son might be spending his 9th birthday why isn't he with her what happened why is she alone and drinking wine and writing about him in a journal in an empty house the story then jumps back to 1977 when beautiful lucy and nice guy matt her soon to be husband first meet in boston he's a cop and she is working for harvard after she's been dumped by her bad boy lover griffin if you have experienced a failed relationship you may have noticed things going off the rails gradually or you might have seen your partner chewing with their mouth open one day and known immediately that things were over but in some cases relationships are doomed before they even begin and mr thomson gives us the unraveling of matt and lucy in a way that i found to be so true i had to step away from the book a few times to let my racing pulse calm down and if you are a parent some of the scenes are going to break your heart have tissue nearby i found myself wondering about the things that spouses put each other through can we ever truly know someone else a lot of people that have been blindsided in a relationship will look back and say well there were some red flags at the very beginning are any of us all good guy or bad guy or do we have the potential to constantly be switching between the two and i'm reminded of the talented mr ripley where they talk about how you rarely meet someone who thinks they are actually a bad person is it possible for us to justify just about anything by blaming someone else james whitfield thomson said that it took him four years to write lies you wanted to hear i tore through it in two days but the story and these characters will stay with me forever p s is there a way to give half stars in the ratings i wanted to give this one 4 5 stars with a 5 being the great gatsby or a farewell to arms lies you wanted to hear is outstanding and i recommend it to anyone and everyone p p s i found it very inspiring that mr thomson is a first time author at 67 so if you have a book inside of you go for it it is never too late","186":"i liked the characters i just didn't find that they were very interesting this was the worst ending ever","187":"i liked that this book had a twist i was not expecting otherwise it would have been a 2 as i really disliked the characters lucy and griffin i found the ending unbelievable as i think the children and lucy would not be as forgiving","188":"loved it this is the story of a relationship based on lies it really takes off about halfway through becoming a book i couldn't put down one of the characters says the lies you tell yourself are the ones that hurt the most sometimes i sided with matt sometimes with lucy","189":"3 5 stars i love that it's the 67 yr old author's first book it kep me captivated until about chapter 28 hated the ending","190":"i couldn't read this book all at once i had to spread it out over a week it was tough it poses a lot of questions your initial reaction is to be angry so so angry at things but then you have to stop and consider how would you really respond in that situation i enjoyed it the storyline the characters but especially that it was thought provoking and not just fluff although i do enjoy fluff every now and then","191":"i likes parts of this and thought the overall idea was interesting but parts of it were a little slow for me","192":"this book was interesting and held my attention for the most part but i hated the way it ended also although i was engaged in the plot i never felt connected to any of the characters even though they were all going through so many emotions i couldn't seem to make myself care i mostly just wondered what was going to happen next in general without any personal investment in any particular character","193":"compelling but lots of holes and too many excess characters that don't help move the story","194":"i didn't think i was going to like it but it was okay","195":"page turner finished in three days","196":" i first saw the summary for lies you wanted to hear a few months ago i was intrigued what had happened to this woman's children why was she having to imagine their lives instead of watch them grow up but as intrigued as i was i didn't have the chance to read the novel until just recently i'll admit i found the novel a bit slow in the beginning but once it picked up i was hooked lies you wanted to hear switches between the point of view of each lucy and matt the novel tells the tale of their relationship right from when they first meet i liked following their relationship i wanted to see where it would go and whether it would end happily though the novel's summary had me fairly certain the novel wasn't going to result in a completely happy ending i won't tell you what happened here though because i don't want to ruin the novel for you there's definitely a mysterious element to it and i believe that going into that with too much information will leave a reader somewhat unsatisfied with the novel so i'll give you the goodreads summary at the end of this recommendation as usual but i'm not going to get into the specifics of the plot here but i will tell you that as gripping as the plot of this novel was my favourite element of lies you wanted to hear was the characterization lucy and matt were both so well developed i sympathized with them while also at times wanting to knock them on the head and get them to listen to some common sense they were both good people and they were both bad people all in all they were human and i kind of loved them for that this review was originally posted on my blog","197":"intelligently written novel great characters great story","198":"a good novel by a new author which explores relationships the birth and death of a marriage and the lasting repercussions on its children i felt both the first and last third of the book were the strongest would have liked a little more detail during the fifteen or so years skipped in the middle kept my interest and i did care about the characters","199":"blaaah didn't care about the characters","200":"a great ending","201":"i really enjoyed reading this one i was hooked right from the start and i was going to give it 5 stars but the ending left me wanting a little more","202":" i was completely engrossed in this book for at least the first half was thinking five stars five stars wish i'd written it i still fully recommend it but for me it actually slows down once the big event occurs i won't share the big event as it would be a spoiler i'll just say that before the event there are a lot of scenes and afterward it's a lot more summary the scenes were more compelling for me but i continue to admire the book and the author immensely he's 67 it's the first book he's published and if you do read the book make sure you read the q u0026amp a especially if you're trying to be a publisher writer yourself","203":"i received this novel as part of a goodreads giveaway i found it to be an easy read despite focusing on a darker topic without giving anything away about the plot it makes me thankful that i live such a simple and at the end of the day uncomplicated life","204":"this review has been hidden because it contains spoilers to view it click here this girl got into a relationship with a no good guy she had abortion and he took off he is

going to turn him in and send him to jail the kids turned out great it ends with him driving away from the party should have gone no further more","205":"i really loved this book i couldn't put it down i didn't love the ending bc it was unrealistic and far fetched it was also confusing i really enjoyed the story line and that the narration changed between the characters","206":"it's hard to like a book when you hate one of the main characters but somehow he made me like it anyway very well written","207":"i would have given this 5 stars but i didn't like the ending","208":"good book liked the ending but was waiting for a little shocker at the end overall good book","209":"i had to top reading i couldn't take anymore of lucy's pity party shame spiral each chapter she voiced made me want to should shut uuuuup editing to add one the relationship broke down and the characters hated each other as much as i hated them the book became more tolerable","210":"such a great story i couldn't put it down","211":"this was an easy read but also one of the hardest books i've read it hit way to close to home i couldn't put it down but wanted to stop reading it aside from the mother being a crappy parent i feel like this is what's happening in my life","212":"this is a first book so i am loathe to be too hard on it however i didn't enjoy this much it has the bones of a good story but the writing is banal and trite and the ending just seems to peter out i could see it as a soapy tear jerker on the tv","213":"wow i continued thinking about this book and the characters for quite awhile after finishing it i don't want to say too much to give anything away but justifying things that are just plain wrong is never ok never i would definitely recommend this book i loved it","214":" listened to this book on audio through audible though the readers were at times monotone i think it lent itself to the way the characters viewed themselves and their responsibilities in their roles as husband and wife while at the beginning of their story i didn't like leslie much and felt sorry for matt by the end if the book i really did not like matt and his i am better than leslie attitude leslie grew as a person she recognized her fallacies and tried to make herself a better person isn't this what all women especially mothers strive for","215":"three and a half stars a book with a troubled relationship that will make you think lucy is trying to make her marriage work but her heart isn't fully committed lucy can't get over griffin the sexy rascal she met right after college lucy and griffin carried on a torrid affair full of ups and downs steamy sex infidelity and excitement yet the wild careless griffin refused to be faithful even though lucy and griffin fought constantly and she knew he was cheating she couldn't resist the allure of the bad boy the relationship finally breaks when griffin takes off after lucy has an abortion months later lucy meets matt a cop who is kind sweet and hopelessly in love with her a romance ensues and marriage and children follow but lucy has never gotten over griffin when he unexpectedly shows up again it is all too easy to fall back into a damaging and torrid relationship with him unfortunately this spells the end of her marriage and soon matt and lucy are battling over custody of their two children lucy returns to her wild reckless ways causing matt to fear for the safety of his children finally matt has enough and he comes up with a daring plan will lucy every recover from the lies she has sown what i liked i will be honest it took a good long while before this book really took hold the first two thirds of the book present the troublesome and turbulent relationships between lucy and griffin and lucy and matt there isn't anything particularly new or original in this portion of the book it is an old familiar tale of love gone wrong and the break up of a marriage due to cheating however the final third of the book presents the aftermath of what happens when one parent decides to take decisive action to protect his children it was interesting and devastating to follow lucy in the aftermath especially as a parent the final third of the book gave me plenty to think over and it stirred emotions in me that really made me sympathetic to lucy and her plight if you are wiling to be patient this is a read you should try i know i will be thinking about it for days to come i always enjoy books that convince me to change my feelings toward the characters in the beginning lucy is your typical young woman engaged in a detrimental relationship it is nothing but lust and passion and there is little healthy emotion or feeling lucy drinks smokes cigarettes and pot and continues to indulge in sex with griffin even though he is nothing but trouble once matt comes along she attempts to change but she never wholeheartedly commits to the relationship matt is too good and perfect compared to griffin and she misses the bad boy it isn't long before lucy reverts back to her bad behavior she tries to be a good mother and she truly loves her children but she makes plenty of mistakes and inadvertently puts the children in danger matt is the complete opposite of lucy he is a cop and he is indeed patient and good and he doesn't use drugs he does whatever he can to please lucy matt is an ideal father and a wonderful husband he loves lucy unconditionally everything changes once the marriage falls apart matt fears for his children so he does something that will change lucy's life forever in the final leg of the book you see a whole new side of matt and lucy matt is no longer blinded by love he does some shocking things lucy is consumed with grief but in the end what happens changes her for the better i liked seeing how lucy handled the tough situation and how she ultimately becomes a better person for the majority of the book i was completely sympathetic toward matt and i couldn't stand lucy because she was selfish and immature i actually thought at first that perhaps she deserved what she got but then once i saw how she grew as she navigated through her hurt i realized that she doesn't deserve to go through what she does as a mother my heart ached for her i couldn't even imagine her pain through it all lucy becomes a much better person she gives up all the vices in her life and becomes a kinder gentler lucy i had a new found respect for her and i appreciated the changes whether or not she would have matured and changed for the better without the painful life changing event is hard to say but i am certain she wouldn't be the strong woman that she is at the end without living through it she certainly made plenty of mistakes but she didn't deserve her fate i love that i ended up completely changing my mind about her and that i ended up liking her i had an entirely different opinion of matt at the end as well i couldn't condone what he did even though he did it with the best of intentions i thought his behavior at the end was immature as well i appreciated that this book is told with dual narratives i liked getting in both lucy and matt's heads and seeing things through each of their eyes it is always interesting to see the same events played out through each perspective i am a big fan of two alternating view points and i thought it played out well in this book if you are looking for a good book to read with a book club this would be a great pick it is the type of story that opens up numerous channels of discussion and it gives you many things to think on the author even provides some interesting questions at the end to help start a conversation and the not so much the pace is slow and a bit tedious the first part of the book is interesting as you get to know lucy matt and griffin by the middle though i found the pace slow i didn't particularly enjoy watching the relationship spiral into decay the entire premise of a marriage gone bad was nothing that i haven't read before even though it was all important to the story it dragged once you hit the final third of the book things really pick up the pace moves at lightning speed and in fact the story rapidly moves ahead in time skipping years into the future in fact i thought that things advanced too fast and i wished that it slowed down at times to explore certain events better after spending the majority of the book in a three year time frame it then speeds through eighteen years in a handful of chapters griffin is such an important player in for two thirds of the book and then he fades away and we don't hear from him again even though he wasn't my favorite character i found that i kind of wanted to know what happened to him at the end where did he end up did he settle down was he happy was he a better person the ending was puzzling it is an open ending and i was left with all kinds of questions i didn't like the way it just faded out and i thought it ended on a strange note i was hoping for a bit more resolution and i would have loved an epilogue down the road i wanted to know how the children adjusted i also wanted matt to make amends for what he did after all the drama and emotion i was a bit frustrated i wanted a better pay out i don't like endings that are open to interpretation lies you wanted to hear is an interesting and troubling look at what happens to a marriage gone wrong it isn't an easy journey and there are plenty of dark and painful steps that lead to a frightening and heartbreaking event that changes everything this is a book that will get into your head and your heart and make you think it will change your mind and leave you with an entirely new perspective at the end this is a story that will start a discussion as you ponder over all the complexities and moral implications that are presented if you are looking for a thought provoking read i suggest you give this a chance favorite quotations the trouble with the past is it's never over just keeps coming back and biting you in the ass when an old man drinks either he starts thinking he's young again and makes a fool of himself or remembers how old he is and ends up getting sad i loved my children beyond measure but i had a hard time finding my rhythm with them as if mothering were a dance and i had to keep looking down at my feet my good intentions no substitute for self assurance and grace i received a copy of this book from the publisher in exchange for an honest review all opinions are my own and i was not compensated for this review posted@rainy day ramblings","216":"good book two sides to every story","217":" fyi attn goodreads it is very difficult to write this review when there is a penguin book ad in the middle of the box that i am trying to write this review in this ad won't move over or close out i had to save a partial review then go back to edit in another screen now on to the book review this was a really good story that was a mind jolting good read where i strongly disliked one main character lucy and really liked the other main character matt adam i did not want to put the book down yes in my opinion lucy got what she deserved wow i am a woman and i say matt adam was right in playing god and kidnapping those kids i disliked lucy from almost the beginning of the book the person who told the most lies was not the person who told the biggest","218":" i finished lies you wanted to hear in two days once you start it really is hard to put down the story of a marriage between lucy and matt twists and turns down a never ending road of pain the chapters alternate between characters and while i was reading it i thought boy this book will be a great book club book because there is so much to discuss there is no good guy in this but you can certainly see how it all happens reading their thoughts was enlightening and stopped me from judging them from day one it is amazing what people will do when they are in pain and to do the right thing","219":"i can honestly say i don't think i've ever hated a character as much as i hated lucy at the beginning of the book i couldn't decide what to make of her other than she was self absorbed as the story wore on i found myself grumbling about her and closing the book more then once i had to remind myself she was a fictional character when you can get so angry with someone who isn't real says it all for me anyhow","220":"if you liked the silent wife and gone girl you will like this book neither matt or lucy are horrible characters to the reader because thomson has given them flaws that we can all relate to they are however horrible to each other lies deception and consequences","221":"i really enjoyed this book but i hated the ending","222":"a great thought provoking book i empathized with all the characters i read the whole book in 1 day i want the publishers to publish gone too long please honest and fascinating read","223":"i thought this book by first time author james whitfield thomson was easy to read and a real page turner the mismatched couple in the story are parents to 2 children she drinks and smokes marijuana he's a police officer who's follows the rules they divorce after about 7 years of marriage lucy can't shake the feeling that she's not very good at parenting she also doesn't seem to be able to sever contact with her former boyfriend who she knows is selfish and unreliable after a series of bad judgements u0026amp decision making on the part of the wife mother the husband father decides it is too risky for the children to remain in her care even part time he takes off with the children and is gone for a very long time 16 years the ending of the book deals with these 2 children as adults as they uncover the truth about both parents and how this impacts the family of 3 that was once very close and very trusting","224":"excellent book i loved and loathed the characters and was invested in their story hard to believe this was a first book for the author","225":"long winded didn't like the main characters","226":"a heart rending novel told from his and her viewpoints true to life in that the ending leaves many unanswered questions and unresolved emotions the author invokes self introspection","227":"wonderful read for the authors first book enjoyed his writing and read the book in three days","228":"lies you wanted to hear are the easiest ones to tell a relationship based on lies the choices made from it and how the truth always comes out","229":"fairly tragic story of the relationship between a really screwed up young woman and the husband who does something unforgivable to her in the guise of protecting their children it's a quick read and could lead to some interesting discussions about responsibilities in marriage and parenthood","230":" though this book was almost impossible to put down i found myself disliking both main characters i have to hand it to thomson he did a great job keeping up the tension and kept me wondering what would happen next to these two people as their marriage fell apart that's quite a writing feat his style is straight forward no high lit allusions here but he managed to give both characters lucy and matt distinctive voices and complex personalities i have to say i din't buy lucy's transformation from semi slutty mom to librarian but other than that i think the book held up i saw thomson read from the book and talk about its publication though this is his first published work it's actually his 5th novel i'm hoping he writes another with some more liable characters but the same pacing and tension that made this one so compelling","231":"lucy and matt married 2 children but lucy never can get her ex griffin out of her mind or life a nasty divorce and some bad decisions by lucy and matt takes off with the kids story told in alternating chapters so you get lucy and matt's versions of events","232":" quite a good book i could not put it down once i started to read it it felt like it was going to be along the lines of a gone girl style plot i kept trying to figure out what the trick was but in the end there really is no trick it is just an intriguing story a story about the lives of how people interact and how their personalities affect their relationships how a person showing up at the door or not showing up on a particular day can change the pattern of your life how the decisions you make can change your life and the trajectory of the lives of those around you there is plenty to think about in this story and many characters to love and or hate today i just want to add that i met the author when he came to talk to a book discussion group i was attending he is a sweet and wonderful man it was a pleasure to meet him and hear about how he conceived of the idea for this book and hear his opinions about the characters and the story as has happened for me in the past the discussion has made the book even more enjoyable and interesting to me i definitely recommend you read this book and find some people to discuss it with maybe even contact the author to visit your book group","233":"the story wasn't really anything exciting or unheard of but i was very wrapped up in his writing style i really enjoyed the way it was written it was descriptive but not overly so this book does have one of the most unlikable characters that i've ever read about but if you can tough it out this book does deserve a read","234":"i couldn't put the book down mainly because i kept waiting for that moment which never happened it was a depressing ending i thought i had trouble envisioning an older lucy it was too much with her new boyfriends and such just didn't fit in","235":"fun to read on a snow day there are sad results when we make stupid choices","236":"is it better to be the person in a relationship who loves more or the one who is loved more told in alternating perspectives his and hers a husband and wife tell their versions of their relationship and the choices they make this is the first book published by a 67 year old author and the first one that really deserves a comparison to gone girl","237":"pretty amazing debut from a 67 year old writer","238":"all plot driven it ends abruptly right when we might be getting to the most interesting part or the story how do you go on","239":"very interesting book something everyone can relate to since we are all guilty of telling people what they want to hear i found it refreshing that even though neither character is especially likeable you can still understand how they found themselves in the situation they did a good read i would suggest for anyone who enjoys contemporary fiction","240":"i read this book during a twenty four hour period this book explores the dynamics of a relationship and marriage between two very different people the lies you wanted to hear were the ones that challenged the relationship between the two people great read","241":"takes about 50 pages to really get going but once it does the book is hard to put down chapters alternate from lucy's point of view and matt's point of view interesting in that in the beginning you empathize with matt and feel he is the victim the author turns that around and in the end lucy becomes the victim shows that even people who try to be good are capable of terrible things i like how the author doesn't make lucy out to be completely evil the things he has her do are believable","242":"i was really into this book until the ending which felt abrupt","243":"or maybe i just was impressed by the plotting character revelation lies we tell ourselves to justify explain our behaviorlucy husband matt lover griffinevent kidnapping one's children because the custody parent isn't taking good enough care sourcebook very interesting publisher","244":"it's been months since i read lies you wanted to hear and i am still thinking about this book i loved this book and still can't believe how good it was as a parent i was enraptured by the premise of lies you wanted to hear the idea of losing my daughter is unthinkable i was ready to completely side with lucy when i started the book what i found so incredible though was that the way thomson writes both lucy and matt made me understand and empathize with both of them i really couldn't say whose side i was on because i felt like both of them were right in what they did i think that's the mark of a great author to make readers picture themselves as the characters and have a hard time separating their own beliefs from the characters' thomson's characters felt so real i felt like i was reading about people i knew in real life lucy and matt could have been anyone neighbors church members fellow grocery store shoppers at some point during the novel they ceased being characters from a book and became real people to me their actions thoughts and emotions just jumped off the page and into my heart lucy and matt were both achingly human and flawed but that just made me love them more speaking of characters thomson provided a great amount of character growth i loved that lies you wanted to hear spans decades in time because everyone in the book did a lot of growing up throughout the story both physically and emotionally i keep going over the sequence of events that led to the abduction of the children i still can't say who was really at fault there was no clear cut 'bad guy' instead there was a series of irrevocable life altering decisions made by both parents so many seemingly small events snowballed into one huge decision and that made the book so enthralling i think that ultimately what was so entirely captivating about lies you wanted to hear was its plausibility and the thought that something like this could truly happen to anyone i really loved the slightly open ending for its realism it made the book feel even more authentic i still can't believe that lies you wanted to hear is a debut novel thomson writes like a seasoned author and all i can think was that he hit a home run right out of the box once i started this book there was no stopping until i found out how the story would end i ended up staying up late into the night with a sick toddler which is usually unthinkable and did not regret one second of lost sleep lies you wanted to hear is soaring and simply outstanding and i can't wait to read thomson's next novel i really hope there will be another one","245":"i would not recommend this book i found lucy one of the main characters so dislikable and some of the decisions she made so illogical that i had to put the book down gee your husband loves you too much poor baby get over yourself","246":"this was recommended by wagnall's library for fans of gone girl it did not disappoint i highly recemommend","247":" never have i been so captivated by a love triangle between a girl a classic bad guy and a classic good guy thomson imagined the pull between the heart and the head and realities of finding someone new while still grieving over the loss of a former love this novel expertly follows the psychology of how this love triangle plays out not in the present but many many years into the future how it impacts everyone who comes into contact with this threesome and how the ripple effects will be everlasting it was a psychological thriller that kept you wondering from the get go and while it is a work of fiction based very loosely on the imagining of a true event one has to wonder how likely is it that this could occur in reality perhaps it already has i'm eagerly awaiting thomson's next novel","248":"great book really glad i stumbled upon it","249":"couldn't put this one down","250":" 3 75 starslies you wanted to hear tells the story of matt lucy and their failed marriage eventually thanks to the skewed family court system and what he considers lucy's negligent parenting matt feels driven to desperate measures to ensure his children's safety lies you wanted to hear is told in alternating pov's making it explicitly clear what motivates each character i really appreciated this as matt and lucy's story progressed griffin is the man lucy had been dating when first we meet her griffin is the male version of lucy he's bad for her but she craves him like a drug he's thoughtless cruel and selfish maybe it's like calling to like i couldn't help but wonder about lucy when she still wants him back even after he deserted her like he did lucy came from money her parents were serial adulterers and amanda her mother also an alcoholic who occasionally mixes prescription drugs with alcohol lucy is selfish thoughtless weak and has been in therapy for years she's the last person you'd picture playing susie homemaker i never liked lucy but felt the tragedy and subsequent suffering brought out depths and strength of character that may never have developed otherwise matt was raised by his widowed mother with his uncle joe as the male figure in his life matt's a straight arrow he's faithful loyal and truly makes an effort to understand and be considerate on the downside he can be judgmental when matt meets lucy he falls hard and fast matt is so out of his depth what he sees as lucy's \"edge\" is nothing but selfishness you'd be hard pressed to find two less compatible people than matt and lucy lucy starts their future off with a lie and matt though he knows the truth deep inside chooses to believe because doing so gives him lucy one loves too much the other not enough and you can see the wreckage ahead eventually lucy's selfishness and weakness create a situation that brings everything to an ugly head lucy was undoubtedly cruel to matt and if matt's actions were completely altruistic it would be a cinch but after his second meeting with griffin i couldn't completely believe that there really is no black and white answer as a parent it's easy to eventually envision yourself on both sides of their heartbreaking situation lies you wanted to hear is all about choices neither matt nor lucy is blameless but who is more at fault can either claim the moral high ground who do you relate to the most in their shoes what would you have done intelligent and realistic mr thomson doesn't make it easy to take sides when it hits the fan reviewed by ivyd for manic readers","251":"i read this in one sitting i really liked the story it kept me glued i liked how the perspectives changed from both of the main characters in the story and how the ending was different from what i thought it would be the story made me keep changing my loyalties to the main characters which was interesting all in all a good read","252":"what a sad sad tale and so frustrating to read as characters self destruct and all in the name of love and a love they do not understand or grasp fully","253":"a very quick read though the story was rushed in parts and the dialogue was stilted i could empathize with lucy spoiler though lucy doesn't love matt everyone else thinks he's great so she ends up married to him she suffers from post pardem depression and ends up cheating on matt with an old flame as punishment for not loving him enough matt kidnaps their two young children justifying his actions by telling himself that lucy is an unfit mother lucy might be a flawed human being but she didn't deserve to have her children stolen from her","254":" wow tough subject matter this book tells the story of a man and a woman and eventually their children it then goes into the very real and i believe scary topic of child custody and kidnapping it was so very well written and entirely captivating the main female character lucy reminded me so much of myself it was eery at times the decisions she made often bad ones are ones i've made myself and the consequences were pretty much the same understandably i loved her because i understood her some may see her as a bad person i see her as human my only problem with this novel is it ended quite abruptly and i would have liked a little more closure with lucy and her children other than that it is a great read","255":"i like books with two or more narrators i think it give the story more deep in this case knowing matt and lisa point of views was perfect to know that there was not right or wrong but i'm incline to think that matt was wrong just regular people making choices based on their own experience like anybody else","256":"this was ok something made it not ring true and seemed dated to me it started quite well but then the meat of the story which would be a spoiler so i won't explain that part fell kindof flat and i just kept reading to see how it resolved which in itself was very pat and contrived the storyline and plot would have been interesting but it just didn't feel like it could would ever happen thsi way","257":"easy fast read and i enjoyed this book","258":"this was to me a book i could put down easily i found it to be depressing for the most part and i disliked most of the characters every now and then the emotion shone through the bitterness and i wish the story had more moments like that it's a tough topic to deal with and i had trouble discerning who was most guilty mother or father never did solve that one for myself i felt very sorry for the children but in the end they seemed to be happy in spite of their strange lives","259":"i loved this book it was given to me as a gift so i had no idea what it was about it was the only real book i had during a recent airplane trip so during that time when you can't use a kindle or an ipod i opened this book and never stopped reading until i finished it i loved the characters the style and the format","260":"enjoyed reading it","261":"this review has been hidden because it contains spoilers to view it click here the novel lies you wanted to hear was completely heart breaking yet extraordinary the characters were well developed and gave their own side of the story and relished in their true emotions albeit i must admit that this entire situation could have been avoided by lucy simply owning up to her instincts and not going through the dating process with matt moreover it was clearly evident lucy still harbored feelings for griffin maybe it was the desperation of trying to move on with her life and the novel lies you wanted to hear was completely heart breaking yet extraordinary the characters were well developed and gave their own side of the story and relished in their true emotions albeit i must admit that this entire situation could have been avoided by lucy simply owning up to her instincts and not going through the dating process with matt moreover it was clearly evident lucy still harbored feelings for griffin maybe it was the desperation of trying to move on with her life and be free of the shackles griffin had bonded her in or simply trying something new either way both characters based their foundations on lies matt constantly made himself believe the lies he told himself and lucy just omitted many things that were certainly important to mention to her future husband lucy knew there was no spark in their relationship just as towards the end of the novel it turns out to be the same thing with william she has a tendency to go with men just because shes what lonely desperate she doesn't love herself so i don't see how developing disastrous and hopeless relationships help at all is it because she uses them as a constant reminder that no matter the things she does she wont ever be capable of more although towards the end of the novel she did make herself an educated woman she suffered a long enduring pain by missing the presence of her dearest children i fully agree that matt's decision was justified but there were also other ways that could have led to a better compromise between the parents it's clearly evident that the the bitterness is still there in the ending this novel has definitely served its purpose in leaving me with so many thoughts and coming to a conclusion this was an amazing read and i'm grateful for finding this novel but my thoughts about these characters are innumerable i cant seem to pinpoint an exact conclusion i have about these characters more","262":"very impressive for the first book ever published by this author his style reminded me of both jodi picoult and gillian flynn many times during the story i did not want to put the book down","263":"easy quick read and i was interested in finishing it however i wasn't a fan of any of the characters","264":"loved this book could not stop reading it","265":"seems sad so abandoned after 4 chapters","266":"and i thought i wouldn't have it finished before book club ha i had a harder time putting it down convincing myself i could read more the next day i found myself talking my husband's ears off about lucy and matt and the end i can guess what is going on but i don't want to admit it though really i'm not 100% surprised much like the truth we don't want to hear yes","267":"ugh i hate open ended books i need closure","268":"i can't believe this was a first time writer it's fantastic i love that it makes you think about all the little lies you tell yourself or others and what could play out by lies you think shouldn't matter very thought provoking","269":"at first this seems like your typical relationship parenthood loss type story but ends up taking a twist into the dark psychological sub genre that's recently become particularly popular gone girl etc this is the debut novel of a 67 yr old man however that's not completely fair as the writing was a years long process it just wasn't til that age that this was published it's inspired by but does not closely follow a true story","270":"i finished this book in one day unable to put it down once i started reading by the time i'd reached the last page i was surprised to find that my sympathy for the two main characters was in equal proportion and that my somewhat narrow vision of right and wrong had changed looking forward to further books by this author this book was provided to me through a goodreads giveaway","271":"some of this i just couldn't buy otherwise i'd give it 5 stars it will remind you of someone you used to know everyone has had that friend who makes bad decisions","272":"an excellent read would make for an excellent book club group discussion many layers to this story about a disastrous relationship that leads to a doomed marriage with shattering results","273":"the story starts in an interesting and unique way not many authors address the issue of people entering relationships with unresolved issues from their past relationships it seems to be that in novels there is always this blank slate where two people meet and fall in love in this bubble if there are transgressions they seem to always happen later after the romance has fizzled a bit so i found this approach unique yet realistic when lucy enters her relationship with matt harboring unresolved feelings toward her ex boyfriend what an interesting read slow build up i hadn't read anything about the book so i thought via the prologue that things would have gone in a different way than they did i didn't really understand matt's actions that well they puzzled me it seemed like the author did more telling than showing which actually worked all right but i had hoped for more connection to the characters with more dialogue or more inner thoughts particularly with matt","274":" this book is much better than gone girl in my mind gone girl you can't empathize with the characters they do despicable things these characters make decisions not mistakes they make choices their choices define who they are and they have to live with them and if you can put yourself in their shoes the book makes you wonder if you'd make those same decisions or if you've made bad decisions in your life would you make them again especially in relationships sometimes we know someone may be wrong for us but you just keep going down that road like an addiction it's a very interesting look at what people do for love where people have blind spots in their personal lives and how decisions have consequences you can tell yourself a million times that you've made the right choice and you may be able to live with your choices but at what price to those around you and what price to yourself as well i think there are some good conversations to be had around what these characters do and why","275":"good book about a woman u0026amp two men who had an impact on her life one takes her kids away from her","276":"this book was fantastic this was the kind of book you stay up late reading because you just can't go to sleep until you've finished it hard to believe it was the author's first novel highly recommend","277":"compelling read i couldn't put this book down james whitfield thomson is a male author who touched a chord in me as many female authors do he established an in depth feel for both lucy and matt through alternating first person chapters i'm so glad i took a chance on it","278":"great character building and believable story line made the book a compelling read","279":"i'm not even sure where to begin it was a long and drawn out book told from the two main characters' point of view in alternating chapters neither character seemed to grow or evolve much the ending wasn't much of an ending i don't know if it's a cliffhanger meant to entice you to read the next installment or part of the manuscript was lost in the mail i saw this book at target in their recommended reads my local library had it available so i'm glad that i didn't pay for it","280":"without a doubt one of the most compelling books i have read this year lies you wanted to hear tells the story of a marriage each chapter narrated by either lucy or matt telling their story what happens when lucy and matt's marriage implodes and the lifetime consequences to themselves and their children will make you think this book echoes in your mind after it is finished a first novel i hope he writes and publishes more excellent books","281":" although i really really didn't like the character lucy something about this book didn't let me put me it down and i found myself wanting to finish it to know what happened lucy is a completely unlikeable character she has flaws but the way thinks of herself and her long time 'lover' just makes me believe she is the most selfish egotistical woman on the planet this is a short review but lies you wanted to hear is just one of those novels that deals with complicated relationships and makes you question your own a beautiful debut by author james thomson","282":"very gone girl i'd have given it 4 stars except the ending pissed me off","283":"excellent intriguing keeps you very interested","284":"horrible boring read the characters didn't grow on me could not finish","285":"very good read it grabbed you quickly and pulled you in so that you had to find out how it ends","286":" there is no distinct good guy bad guy in this book both characters make poor decisions and punish the other and themselves each person thinks he or she is behaving in the appropriate way and making the best decision possible normally alternating point of view novels irritate me i find alternating pov a cop out on the writer's behalf it's much easier to get inside the head of every character and talk to the reader about the characters motivations behavior desires insecurities etc than it is to pick a pov and then tell write well enough that the reader understands those same things about a particular character however in this instance it was perfect i really got the sense that each character was telling his or her version of events it really made the feeling that each character was right and wrong in their decisions and actions it made the reader really feel that there was no good or bad guy in my opinion it is an excellent author who can create two characters that the reader both loves and hates because you can identify with each one i loved the ending of this book it was perfect i don't want to give anything away i haven't read an ending as skillfully crafted as that in a long time too often i feel the endings are rushed and thrown together to tie up loose ends but i really felt the author put a lot of time and thought into how to finish the novel one thing i didn't like was i felt it was almost misogynistic lucy was portrayed very negatively especially in regard to her sexuality which i suppose was part of her character and to show the reader she was very opposite of straight laced matt but several times the author made reference to her looking like a hooker or her sexual indiscretions i'm not sure were always fair assessments or depictions not including the times she cheated or lied about cheating while in one instance he made reference to matt's relationships and friendships with other men being dependable i got the old fashioned impression that women were untrustworthy sexual beings unable to control their urges and honest hardworking men should be cautious that put me off a bit","287":"this is a story of love gone wrong lucy was in \"love\" with the wrong man griffin griffin is a man who only seemed able to take and was not giving anything back to lucy he came across to me as they typical bad boy that all the girls fall in love with even though he is not good for her i think every girl know a guy like this heck i know a few but some are smart enough not to let them get their hooks in them lucy unfortunately was not that lucky she chased after griffin and he led her down the wrong path many times yet she kept going back to him then lucy meets the \"good guy\" matt matt is what every girl is looking for the man who wants to love and protect his girl the man who would do anything in his power to make his woman happy this is the man lucy settles for she wants to love him she wants to support him as he supports her and she wants to feel that rush and excitement that she feels with griffin for matt unfortunately things do not necessarily happen as she plans lies you wanted to hear is a fast paced amazing read i didn't know what to expect as the story went on and was surprised at some of the twists and turns that happen the story is told in alternating points of view by lucy and matt i loved that this novel is a story that i stayed up late to finish and woke up the next morning still thinking about it it is now late afternoon and i am still thinking about it i wish i had read this with my book club as i can hear how our conversation would have gone in case you cannot tell i highly recommend this book to everyone mothers and fathers alike will be able to relate to some part of this story","288":" relationships built on lies betrayals and secrecy very seldom turn out well and so this proved in the marriage of matt and lucy going into a relationship with very different reasons matt and lucy are at a disadvantage from the get go the reader knows this but of course in the novel they do not tiny cracks widen and get deeper as the reader reads their story this is a grim at times depressing viewpoint of marriage it is however a truthful one for some and maybe a warning for others very slow to develop i suppose like real life the getting to know each other the discussions of past relationships etc but i almost gave up reading this a few times i kept on and i do applaud the not happily ever after ending sometimes things have just gotten so off course it is realistic to expect them to all correct themselves also i disliked both characters at different points so it was more the writing that kept me or the kind of morbid fascination one gets when watching a train wreck anyway definitely applaud this author who has published his first novel at the age of sixty seven we should all be so industrious arc from publisher","289":" this was a very interesting book you get to watch the courtship and implosion of a marriage from both sides and what happens when the husband father makes a huge decision that changes everyone's lives forever what i really appreciated about this author was that neither spouse came off as the bad one they were both equally flawed so you are able to not just take someone's side you just see the ramifications and wonder how it will all turn out fast easy read but has you thinking what would you do in the same situation as him her","290":"i have a lot to say about this book but not sure how to put it down in words i'll just say i can't wait for book club meeting i'll try to formulate some thoughts and come back later to write more","291":"love this book i also had the pleasure of meeting the author and his family and i must say this book does not disappoint definitely recommend","292":"told in alternating chapters this is the story of how matt and lucy met fell in love got married and started a family and then broke up but it's also about lies lies we tell each other and lies we tell ourselves little lies big lies huge whopping lies","293":" when i picked this one up i was in the mood for something light and easy to read this book wasn't exactly light but it was such a quick read despite its serious subject matter the author told the story with alternating viewpoints which was necessary for the story and for the reader in determining her own view on who was actually the bad guy matt and lucy meet on a blind date and soon begin a relationship though it's clear that matt has fallen a lot more deeply than lucy matt's the quintessential good guy a hard worker reliable dependable devoted lucy's scarred by her experiences with men who are trouble and a family who survives by learning to look the other way for anything unpleasant matt thinks he can save lucy but when they start adding a couple kids to the mix he begins to realize that her demons might take the whole family down unless he steps in and stops it the interesting thing about this story to me was that neither of these characters are blameless in the events that transpire they each offer meek defenses in their chapters that try to explain what prompted their own course of action but we know we're just getting their self serving take on it they're not terrible people really but both are flawed and the choices they make are pure proof of that i was a little disappointed with the ending though which knocked the story down to four stars for me it was a little unbelievable and the rest of the story seemed so rooted in real life","294":"the book was written very realistically i liked that i was disappointed that lucy didn't want justice for what happened once she was reconnected with the kids now adults i wish the ending had been different and spent more time on it","295":"three and a half stars a slow start but i had to finish part 3 as soon as i started it the ending left me hanging with wanting to know how things turned out for the children and matt into the future","296":"so this is probably more a 3 5 but i did really like it easy read with good characters and really love that this is his first novel that he wrote after he retired","297":"this was such an awesome book awesome idea the ending was a little soft but i'm okay with it","298":" lies you wanted to hear is the story of lucy and matt how they met how they fell in love and how they tell lies to protect the ones they love or do they this is james whitfield thomson's first novel which he published at the age of 67 and it is inspired by a case seen in the boston newspapers where a man had kidnapped his own daughters 20 years before james whitfield thomson explores in his novel the reasons that lead to this unthinkable act the book is written from both matt's and lucy's point which leaves the reader unsure as to what side to take","299":"i really enjoyed this it was well written and had a very interesting story line with strong characters and with the main two husband and wife who alternated narrating each chapter you really weren't sure by the end who was the worst between them the husband had clear reasons for his actions but the book asks the question how far is too far","300":" i can't believe this book was written by a 67 year old man and that it's his first work of fiction it's a harrowing grim novel u0026amp grabbed me right away he alternates chapters for the two characters like gone girl and you find yourself sympathizing with each as they both make horrific mistakes but unlike gone girl i didn't think these two were at all compatible you watch their marriage crumble and understand the motivations behind each of their decisions loved the scene where the children find out about their dad's life altering choice to take them away and how they want to protect him would love to read another by this author someday","301":"i was a but disappointed because jodi picoult raved over it i had expectations that it would be of her quality and unfortunately it was not i hope he improves i can see the potential i at no time felt that i didn't know that the next thing was going to happen it was enjoyable but not riveting","302":"lies you wanted to hear by james whitfield thomson is a fabulous page turner","303":" i loved this book it lands somewhere between a beach book and a serious novel it is most definitely book club worthy as there are many complex layers and heavy issues love marriage parenting lies we tell ourselves and lies we tell others the main characters are easy to relate to and their accounts are honest and imperfect i won't give it away but i loved the ending and the idea that forgiveness is a power within each of us whether we exercise it or not the author's story made the book even better somehow at 68 this is mr thomson's first novel i was fortunate to have a copy that had an interview with the author in the back i am always surprised when a male author can write in a female character and be so insightful i highly recommend the book it is a fast read but will leave you pondering after the last words have been read","304":"really disappointed i wanted to read this for a while and once i was in i just kept hoping it would get better characters were flat and to me uninteresting lots of mundane conversation that made me just skim to the 'good' parts there weren't many i just didn't connect with the characters or the plot at all i was expecting a much deeper relationship between the main characters","305":"this review has been hidden because it contains spoilers to view it click here reading the reviews for this one is interesting people seem to have all sorts of different opinions about who is right and who is wrong it's interesting because i don't think there's any question that what matt does is wrong it's horrible and a vast overreaction based on what has actually taken place a decision based on hurt and pain as much as the safety of his children and yet he is a good father i am much more a matt than i am a lucy i walk the straight and narrow and tend to be the

i am much more a matt than i am a lucy i walk the straight and narrow and tend to be the one who loves more so i related to him even though i saw the wrongness of his actions and my resentment burned right along with his at the end of the book i know that feeling well but lucy has been more than punished for her sins and now it's his turn i loved the ambiguity of the book and the ending life isn't neat and doesn't wrap up tidily with a bow at the end it was interesting how there was just enough evidence for matt to make the decision that he did and yet also enough to show that he was clearly in the wrong lucy doesn't come off much better her line at the end about the lies being ones he wanted to hear is an attempt to absolve herself of her responsibility to be honest and not trample on another person's feelings like that but nothing can remove her culpability in that situation and in fact i'd argue her knowing how much he wanted to believe her lies makes her actions all the more horrible more","306":"the lies you wanted to hear were the easiest ones to tell pg384lies you wanted to hear is a compelling story of love and betrayal of a marriage destroyed by the secrets we keep from one another and the lies we tell ourselves when matt meets lucy on a blind date he knows she is the 'one' she is beautiful bright and sexy everything a guy could want but lucy is wary matt a strait laced police officer is completely different from her on again off again lover griffin who she can't seem to let go of no matter who badly he treats her but griffin has gone and when lucy falls pregnant she allows matt to convince her that she can be what he needs that he is what she wants told from the alternating first person viewpoints of matt and lucy we witness the evolution of their relationship from their first date to marriage to parenthood and its eventual inevitable devolution the relationship is compromised before it even begins marred by secrets and dishonesty which only become more divisive as time passes the lies you wanted to hear explores the the ambiguity of guilt blame and fault and forces the reader to consider if right and wrong is always easy to determine the characterisation in lies you wanted to hear is superb lucy and matt are realistically complex and change through the novel i found it difficult to like lucy who is arrogant and self centered and i wasn't able to muster much sympathy for her despite a troubled family background or even the losses she suffers later in the novel matt is easier to like loyal loving and eager to please but he has his faults and eventually he loses the moral high ground that seemed his right thomson skilfully exposes the choices each character makes and the consequences for their marriage and their family an impressive debut i wouldn't hesitate to recommend lies you wanted to hear is provocative gritty and poignant a gripping family drama","307":"really enjoyed this book i'm very impressed that it is a first novel spoiler alert as said in a few of the reviews i read for this book none of the characters were very appealing and there was none that i particularly wanted to see either matt or lucy get what they wanted matt is too perfect and lucy is not as bad a mother as matt makes out as far as i can see however i enjoyed how the story developed as it's told over a span of 20 years or more i also liked the different perspectives of the characters portrayed in the chapters from their point if view ie matt's chapter then lucy and so on the ending was left open and the reader is unsure what will happen with matt adam in the future","308":"this book is fantastic there is the perfect amount if dialog to keep the plot moving yet still feel a connection to the characters excellent read","309":"i actually quite liked this story not for the writing as it was more of a beach book but the story was interesting and kept me reading to the end","310":"this review has been hidden because it contains spoilers to view it click here i raced through the first three quarters of this book however the last quarter fell flat for me all of this build up and then the resolution was too neatly tied together the kids didn't seem angry that their dad lied to them for 18 years kidnapped them and told them their mother was dead lucy just let it go after a few bitter words with the father i'm not sure how i would have ended it if i was the writer but it seemed too neatly packaged and unrealistic after all of the drama throughout i raced through the first three quarters of this book however the last quarter fell flat for me all of this build up and then the resolution was too neatly tied together the kids didn't seem angry that their dad lied to them for 18 years kidnapped them and told them their mother was dead lucy just let it go after a few bitter words with the father i'm not sure how i would have ended it if i was the writer but it seemed too neatly packaged and unrealistic after all of the drama throughout the novel with that being said it was a quick read and i enjoyed the first half more","311":"could not put it down character driven book with the two main characters voices","312":"these characters and their story filled me with rage and also made me cry this book is just solid writing with a roller coaster of a story line it's a dual time narrative so you truly get both sides of the story but i bet you can't decide who is in the right","313":" i really enjoyed this book i was drawn right in and just kept turning the pages to see what happened i thought the way the book was written in alternating voices between matt and lucy was probably one of the best things about the book it kept the story moving forward but you got to go inside the head of the person who was telling their side of the story without missing a beat loved the ending too i would highly recommend even though the subject matter might sound like it would be depressing it never was for me the characters drew me in and i was always wanting to know what happened next","314":"it is about the flaws in human character and how we view ourselves verses others interesting and a good read","315":"very well written for first novel enjoyed the various characters and liked how the chapters would go back and forth between lucy to matt providing a perspective from both main characters the ending left me wondering if a sequel is on the way","316":"very good different type of story terrible ending it is as if the author got tired and just decided to end it","317":"this is a novel about imperfect people trying to do the right thing but ultimately their character flaws cause them to act in ways that cause too much damage to every be repaired the book ends very ambiguously but it was an engrossing read","318":"wow i could not put this book down what a suspenseful drama the story being told in a two character perspective makes this book even more interesting matt and lucy are two well developed characters who you may side with or side against or even change your mind about at the end i really look forward to this author's next novel","319":"i couldn't put this book down i was drawn right from the beginning and just kept turning the pages to see what happened next thompson writes with such skill that he sweeps you right into his characters' lives the voices between matt and lucy kept the story moving forward and you got to go inside the head of the person who was telling their side of the story without missing a beat","320":"this is novel about a marriage gone wrong and the choices people make they might regret an impressive novel frim a debut author and one i wouldn't hesitate to recommend","321":"really enjoyed the book but thought the ending was a cop out it actually has a really suspenseful gone girl element","322":"i enjoyed this book some parts were slow but overall a good read","323":" what if the lies you told and the choices you made have come back to haunt you what if the losses are so much greater than you could ever have imagined lucy thornhill was an edgy young woman always looking for love in all the wrong places after the disappointment of a lover who could not commit finding matt drobyshev who was so reliable and responsible felt like a magical gift it would not be long however before they each realized that the relationship was built on a series of little white lies and some bigger ones therefore destined to fail when the life they lived together went hopelessly awry the bitterness between them mounted matt thought lucy was a bad mother to their two children sarah and nathan dangerous even so what he did next would change everything for all of them his need to control everything was as dangerous in my opinion as lucy's careless actions we follow the journey of lucy and matt in this story told in alternating narratives we come to understand each of them as the tale probes beneath their surfaces and behind the lies to the truths they have kept hidden but their own perspectives on events could also have drastically altered the picture making the reader question the truth of their take on things near the end in a final confrontation between lucy and matt she says to him the lies you wanted to hear were the easiest ones to tell lies you wanted to hear is a captivating poignant and sad tale that rings true revealing much about mismatched individuals struggling to find their way toward a love they had longed for but missing tragically in their efforts the denouement left me puzzled wondering what to think perhaps the author purposely left it for the reader's interpretation 4 5 stars","324":"i loved this first novel by james whitfield thomson and how he created sympathetic yet complex characters in both lucy and matt he tackles tough issues in this book and presents them from two points of view people have compared lies you wanted to hear to gone girl and i found myself doing the same i liked this book a lot better though and read it a lot quicker even though gone girl is shorter in length","325":"i loved this book maybe because some of the drama resembled my real life part of me didn't want the book to end because it was so good i want to know the rest of the story i thought the author did an excellent job with plot and characters a representation of real life real drama and a reality that many parents have lived giving us insight into their way of thinking why they did what they did the reasons they did what they did and you understood they were right but they were wrong you understood the pain of both matt and lucy the book was fast moving didn't get bogged down in unnecessary drivel or segue into other imperative nonsense i highly recommend this book and look forward to reading more by this first time author excellent excellent book","326":"i was pleasantly surprised that this book grabbed my attention so quickly i enjoyed the way the author told the story from both characters points of view the character development was done very well and the story progressed nicely i felt the ending was abrupt but that is because i was enjoying the book and wanted a bit more resolution this is an excellent story from a first time author i will read his work again","327":"one of the best books i've read in i don't know how long","328":"i do not give five stars regularly especially not to work of fiction but this was a page turner it kept me absorbed from page one there were a few times my stomach dropped while reading for fear of what was going to happen to the characters i don't want to say much here but will say i liked the ending too","329":"love this first time author and looking forward to more by him loved the alternating chapters from each characters perspective which lets you get to know each and how they are affected by what happens to each of them","330":" 3 5 stars lies you wanted to hear is the story of the relationship of matt boston cop and good guy and tumultuous lucy we get to see their relationship from the time they fall for each other until they split up this is really the story of how the decisions we make build on each other and if our decision is to lie how those lies can turn into something that we never expected the characters were fascinating to me at first i thought that lucy was the villain of the book and matt was the suffering hero but thomson challenged that idea over and over again throughout the entire book which i liked it definitely kept me on my toes i did wonder a little bit about the motivations of the characters in some sections why did they make the decisions that they made when they could probably figure out just how badly they were going to hurt the other person beforehand was it just to be cruel were they really not thinking it's really hard for me to believe that this is thomson's debut novel one of the most outstanding this to me about this book was how real everything felt you can picture the characters doing everything that they did in the book no matter how gritty or heartbreaking this book is an incredibly realistic look at how much we can hurt other people by not being upfront with each other this is an unflinching look at a dissolving relationship and i enjoyed it","331":" so many books are now told from different character's points of view that it no longer feels fresh however this style worked perfectly for this story the reader was almost looking into the minds of matt and lucy hearing how they processed different situations and rationalized their choices and behavior i was impressed with the author's handling of postpartum depression and some other decidedly female aspects of the story i'm ever impressed when i'm reading a woman's point of view and it sounds authentic coming from a male author this is a long book but it's very well written it kept me engaged and is an impressive debut 3 5","332":"tis was really good except for the ending it left me disappointed","333":"this book held a lot of promise for me but in the end it let me down we are led through the lives of lucy and matt their two children her parents and her ex lover this is a hard story to read for some because it makes you wonder what you would do in this exact position how would you handle things but the ending for me felt flat like the book was leading up to this huge confrontation but in the end nothing overall it was an okay book quick read","334":"lucy and matt have two young children lucy doesn't really love matt she is still in love with a former boyfriend griffin and she is a reckless mother matt decides to take matters into his own hands will lucy ever see her children again","335":"this review has been hidden because it contains

you feel if you had been neglectful and irresponsible towards your children before they disappeared this is a story about the various paths that life can lead us and the consequences that might come

meeting secretly with griffin to get away from life matt finds griffin in their house on a surprise return from his business trip and that leads to a separation that should have took place a while back while the separation between matt and lucy is semi friendly their trust for each other is minimal and each wishes the other was not a part of their lives what ties them together is their children and matt takes it upon himself to take matters into his own hands when he disappears with the children what follows is 16 years of waiting for lucy who never gives up hope of one day being reunited with her children we know that lucy was definitely not a great mother but the question of the book remains did lucy deserve what she got a page turner told in opposing points of view more","336":"finished it in a day an easy read easy to feel connected to the main characters compulsively readable","337":"liked it set in 1970s 80s liked that dynamics in marital relationship reminded me a bit of gone girl but not quite as extreme","338":"a fast and entertaining read that i'd give 3 1 2 stars but it was hard to connect to the characters and the ending was lacking","339":"a complex story once youre past the complexity you dont want to put the book down and no matter how i can try i don't fully understand the characters choices and the book leaves you hanging for more","340":"an easy read but still quite thought provoking i suppose if we all look closely at our shortcomings as parents we could begin to identify with lucy in the end both characters had significant flaws not sure if lucy got what she deserved but she did stop taking things for granted too bad it came at such a cost","341":"another quick read a compelling story that kept my interest","342":"great read could not put it down interesting story with believable characters the end left a little to be desired a bit anticlimactic leaves you wanting to know more","343":"loved it more than i expected to heartbreaking and tragic","344":" from the start didn't have any sympathy for lucy very unliikeable character in fact quite pathetic at times matt on the other hand somewhat unsure of him i can see how the bitterness can truly distort a parent's perception of his grandiose and her flaws i think lucy truly understood or appreciated parenting when it was taken away from her she was a terrible mother whose priority was not her children it was from the beginning of the story all about her needs and happiness i am although quite satisfied with how the story ended matt allows the children to decide what they want","345":"this story is told with intervening narrators i found this book to be engaging and you cared about the characters","346":" it is not often that i read a book and am conflicted as how to rate it in terms of writing style 67 year old first time novelists james thomas hooked me in the phrase he is getting is wells deserved he will have book club enthusiast fighting for hours over the characters lies you wanted to hear is told in alternating pov's making it explicitly clear what motivates each character the book is s a well paced and well styled three and a half stars four a book with a troubled relationship that will make you think","347":"super easy to read with interesting characters definitely recommend","348":"it is probably a 3 5 i loved most parts but some i wasn't sure about a fast easy read though","349":"this review has been hidden because it contains spoilers to view it click here i loved this book i liked the writing the story line and the tension for a male writer he had a great feel for a female mind a strong 3 5","350":"really enjoyed this story i agree with an earlier reviewer who said that you will wonder if you picked the right side in matt and lucy's arguments the text is written in a very cool way with distinct voices for each chapter","351":"wow this powerful read creeps into your mind and heart a compelling story that reels you into the lives of characters who seem real denial dominates this believable fiction unexamined family patterns overshadow everyday choices throughout and create understandable but unwelcome outcomes for all lies you wanted to hear reflects like a mirror the misplaced passions of imperfect people if you are a people watcher this book is a winner marjorie scovel nail","352":"enjoyable novel more than a bit sad to read as you realize that people actually do things like this every day and tell themselves what they need to in order to justify their actions","353":"a quick read about a relationship built on lies a boy meets girl and falls in love he knows she is the love of his life unfortunately she never feels that way about him both make terrible decisions and hurt each other but in the end the reader realizes that neither of them is a bad person","354":"a boring story about ordinary selfish unlikable people told in excruciating detail that i suppose is supposed to make it interesting the characters are flat and the drama is formulaic i'm only finishing it because the narrators voices are pleasant enough and i am hoping maybe the ending will be satisfying although i can't imagine how","355":"not sure what to say about this book the writing was average i did not enjoy the characters and the story was a tad cliche on the other hand i couldn't put i down","356":"i enjoyed this book because the character's had unexpected behaviors that made me want to find out what would happen next","357":"it was ok i think she did a good job making lucy a likable character who also had serious flaws the plot got very exciting towards the end but i thought the end of the book was abrupt on the hunt for a good book with a good ending","358":"read about half the book and scanned the rest the characters were pretty dissapointing","359":" i won this book as a firstread for matt it is love at first sight when he meets lucy on a blind date lucy however is still hung up on her ex boyfriend griffin even though he has never treated her well she remains torn between them and eventually loses her children as a result the story is alternately told from the points of view of lucy and matt i really enjoyed this story the way lucy lost her children came as a shock to me i enjoyed getting to hear the perspectives of both lucy and matt about the way things happened","360":" with this book james whitfield thomson became a first time published writer at the age of 67 and it's so good it makes me wonder why it took so long for the powers that be to catch on i can never resist a delayed success story so i knew lies you wanted to hear needed to be on my list i was fascinated by thomson's main character lucy in the opening scene she is alone in her house thinking about her children it's apparent that she doesn't expect them home anytime soon and that actually she hasn't seen them in many years what isn't clear is where they went and why she's writing them letters instead of cooking their dinner and tucking them into bed the story then flashes back to the late '70s when lucy was a freewheeling single girl a few years out of college dabbling in recreational drugs and working in the alumni office at harvard she is the quintessential free spirit largely uninterested in stable working men who would make good husbands and falling over and over for the typical bad boy it sounds like a cliche because it's so familiar--girl can't quit the rebel even when she has a good man on a string--but thomson gets so fully inside lucy's head that her choices make a kind of sense even as we're cringing at her recklessness that's the main appeal i found in this book thomson builds his characters so intricately they become real the first person perspective alternating between lucy and her husband feels positively claustrophobic by the end both characters are so convinced of their rightness so deeply mired in themselves they can't surface long enough to catch even a glimpse of the other's point of view i also loved that there is no villain here--although at the outset lucy herself admits she is the problem thomson shows how choices made over the course of a lifetime can twist and warp even the most righteous person and of course hanging over all of this drama is the big question where are lucy's children the suspense of that mystery makes for a fast and furious read be sure you have plenty of time when you pick this one up because once you start you won't want to stop until all has been revealed more book recommendations by me at www readingwithhippos com","361":"finally i can write a review on this great novel a page turner and one that has stayed with me long after i finished great writing james and can't wait for your next one","362":" lies you wanted to hear was an uncomfortable read like gut churning uncomfortable it starts out somewhat innocuous with matt and lucy's relationship growing with each chapter but you know where it's going still you hope it won't you really hope it won't for two reasons no one really wants to read about that and because it would be obvious i actually put this book down at about the 40% mark because thomson took the obvious route and it pissed me off i'd been enjoying the story up until that point it took some time for me to pick it back up again and once i did i finished it quickly lucy bugged the shit out of me from the beginning i doubted her feelings for matt which made it harder to believe she was telling the truth later on and honestly i don't know that she ever was it's hard because a good quarter of the book is lucy devastated over the loss of her children but how much of it was real we'll never know but the emotions playing out across these pages were deep and harsh without being over the top the acid dripping off matt's words whenever he spoke of lucy could have burned your skin and while it takes a while to get to the point of the book the inciting incident doesn't actually happen until about halfway through the build up to it was necessary we needed to see how matt and lucy each viewed their relationship how it would color their feelings and decisions in the second half of the story it's a common story that could happen to anyone and in some respects probably has in reading it you see how it's possible to blind yourself to how your actions affect the people around you copy provided by the publisher in exchange for an honest review","363":"contemporary fiction a good read it was recommended by a librarian the dad takes the kids and runs after a few incidents with the mom i like how the story kept switching to both their points of view in life did not like the ending though","364":"a compelling story... father kidnaps his kids to rescue them from their mother but did they really need rescuing however the characters were a bit flat and unreal not very complex the father's character in particular little is known about his other than his goodness and love of his children","365":"i wish i had quit reading this half way through and started something new","366":"i just finished this very powerful story of a family in turmoil it allowed the reader into these people's lives from inception to its shattered end it's to emotional for me to effectively express how this book twisted me up in so many ways i loved the way it went from the two main characters narrating the story over the years what i can state is that i feel this book can glean insight for people with delusions of thinking a marriage will work when clearly one party loves more than the other and the one less in love harbours feeling for another they should read this book because if things fall apart they should know not to dive off the deep end without thinking what the fallout would be for all involved including the innocent parties in this case the children i still can't believe this was a first time author who penned this and he was actually in his sixties exceptionally well written hope to read more books from this author","367":"i couldn't give this book 5 stars because of the ending i almost want to give it 3 1 2 stars i've read some reviews comparing this book to gone girl and i totally disagree the only similarity is that it's written from a he said she said pov if that makes it like gg then so are dozens of other books lies definitely pulls you in but i never quite liked either lucy or matt enough to care much i felt bad for their kids and think matt totally overreacted when he took the them granted lucy was a weak spineless selfish woman but she didn't deserve to lose her kids nor did the kids deserve to be lied to matt was a big ole drama queen that got old pretty quickly it was a good read pretty decently written and thorough but it felt incomplete at the end as if my copy were missing the last 20 pages","368":" the lies you wants to hear were the easiest ones to tell this quote makes me think not only about the book but my life how true is this is it really easier for people to lie and tell us what we want to hear or does it hurt worse in the long run this book was very hard for me it took me a while to get into but i kept wanting to know more as much as i wanted to hate lucy i couldn't help but hurt for her at times as a mom myself in the end i finished it in one sitting because i had to know how it ended but even the ending left me confused i need closure when i finish a book and felt i didn't have that but all in all i am glad i read this don't read lots of reviews just read the book it keeps you wanting to know more","369":"this was well written but it was definitely a tough read for me it's a bit like gone girl in that neither of the main characters is particularly likable","370":" whoa i couldn't put this book down the story was really captivating the two person narration really helps you get a sense of what each character is feeling and thinking as the story progresses it was also interesting to see how they each misinterpreted each other's actions at times and while some of the things they did to each other were terrible i could sort of understand how they got to where they did i think the description on the back of the book really sums it up well it's a story that \"explores the way good people talk themselves into doing seemingly unthinkable things \" there's no true bad guy just regular people who made some really bad choices","371":"this review has been hidden because it contains spoilers to view it click here i have a friend whose book likes are so similar to mine that it's frightening when she didn't enjoy this book i was afraid to read it having read it i'm so happy that i decided to read it for myself considering i'd agreed to read it for an honest review i must say i really enjoyed the story of a screw up who meets the perfect person and completely crumbles underneath the pressure spoilers here matt seemed perfect when lucy met him a little too perfect a little too exact opposite of g i have a friend whose book likes are so similar to mine that it's frightening when she didn't enjoy this book i was afraid to read it having read it i'm so happy that i decided to read it for myself considering i'd agreed to read it for an honest review i must say i really enjoyed the story of a screw up who meets the perfect person and completely crumbles underneath the pressure spoilers here matt seemed perfect when lucy met him a little too perfect a little too exact opposite of griffin the man she shouldn't love considering he's a complete louse but still does i don't think lucy was ready for a relationship when she met matt but she convinced herself that she was she let herself believe that she might be enough for him there's an old saying that a woman should find a man who loves her more than she loves him that rang true for matt he loved her a little too much i think his love made him blind to the faults that she presented right up front she drank a lot she smoked pot she was bit of a pistol he knew all of this before he fell in love with her and married her later he would use her faults and her way of being against her because matt had turned into the perfect person perfect husband perfect father and how dare lucy not rise to the occasion and be the female version of him when she falls prey to post partum depression he's there to pick up the pieces the problem isn't that lucy isn't perfect is that she didn't love him enough she didn't show him enough that she loved him and he knew she still pined for griffin so she never would be able to the split becomes nasty perfect matt can't stand the thought of lucy who he deems to be a terrible mother having custody of his children so he does what he thinks is the right thing and for the next eighteen years metes out his punishment for her under the guise of 'doing it for the children' frankly lucy seems like the average mother to me accidents happen and kids get hurt it does happen every day matt took every instance of regular occurrence and blew it up in his mind as evidence that lucy was a terrible mother he and his perfection got on my absolute nerves but then he told the children that their mother was dead and turned them against her that made him a pile of absolute crap inevitably the children discover the truth of course they aren't angry at perfect dad for keeping them away from their mother and lying about her death i find the reunion to be anticlimactic but when lucy finally lays eyes on matt again there are words that i want her to say but she doesn't say them i'm disappointed in her half acquiescence to him but as she walks away matt seems to have the rug pulled out from under him he feels that lucy is smug and he doesn't know what she has to be smug about didn't she get what she deserved this book has been called a stunning debut and i must agree truly enjoyed i was furnished a copy of this book from netgalley more","372":"another relationship book with complicated twists and turns it was entriguing to read about the different personalities and how they played a significant role in the flow of the book","373":"http maryward booktrib com reviews","374":"wonderfully written a must read for parents","375":"i enjoyed this book and was surprised to see how my opinions of the characters changed as the novel continued","376":"this is the kind of book you just can't put down the author lives in new hampshire and believe it or not this is his first published novel lucy thornhill the character around whom this novel revolves is a self absorbed woman who seems to love only herself this is all fine and good until she marries a good man and has two children what happens next is very surprising i recommend this one highly","377":"this book was a mind magnet for me i couldn't stop thinking about it and i didn't want to put it down the story is about a troubled relationship matt and lucy and as the story evolved i found i could identify with lucy in one chapter and be totally matt in another there were so many lies on both sides this would be such a good book club book as the discussion topics are plentiful i don't want to give the story away i highly recommend this book so please read it","378":"fast paced suspenseful family drama the story unfolds alternating between lucy and matt's viewpoints which gives the reader an interesting perspective on what happens","379":"5 very bright stars the lies we want to hear are read my full review on mina's bookshelf http minadecaro blogspot com 2013 1 lucy and matt's story is a dramatic spectacle of human suffering as introspective and realistic as ingmar bergman's cinematographic masterpiece scenes from a marriage 1973 as heart shuttering and iconic as avery corman's kramer vs kramer 1977 as tragically romantic as w somerset vaugham's the painted veil 1925 the human drama of unrequited love seem to be a bottomless well of inspiration and we can always expect a seasoned wordsmith to elicit a deep emotional and core shaking response in his readers james whitfield thomson a 68 year old author at his first novel did it with dispassionate acumen and fluid penmanship in lies you wanted to hear the author deftly 'disappears' in the folds of his family drama an ability many a novelist hardly masters throughout a life long career let alone at their debut letting his characters take turns and narrate their side of the story a story is never really finished according to thomson's mentor andre dubus the truth of a story is also never one sided with an expert and seamless use of alternate first person povs the author switches narrative planes between past and present between lucy's and matt's most intimate emotions and motivations with an incredible talent for modulating his voice in relation to each character's perspective gender and genesis an ill suited couple lucy and matt dobryshev walk to the altar with different expectations but with the same amount of delusion if the differences of background and personality can be easily bridged she is a shallow socialite offspring of a well to do family of pathological liars and serial adulterers he is your typical steady eddy a granitic boston cop amiable predictable and reliable lies and false love foster guilt and resentment when lucy's former lover reappears reeling her once again in the adrenaline spiking whirlwind of a turbulent and addictive relationship matt won't stand a chance he probably never did against the charming and sophisticated griffin what follows is the end of lucy's and matt's marriage agonizing for years in a pool of guilt boredom and post partum depression first and finally crushed under the weight of a brutal fight for the custody of their children no family court in massachussetts will ever take custodial rights away from lucy even in the light of her ineptitude as a mother but when her reckless behavior puts her children's safety in grave danger matt won't hesitate to do something unforgivable but in his opinion absolutely necessary hard to say whether his choice is the only possible way to save his children from a self destructive mother or a way to punish the only woman he will ever love for all the hurt caused by her lies i couldn't side with any of these characters in the face of their weakness and flawed humanity i could only surrender myself to a heartfelt compassion arc review copy graciously offered by the publisher via netgalley in return of an unbiased and honest opinion","380":"i liked this book all about love gone wrong broken families mistakes of the past","381":"i can't abide a book where i feel no emotional connection to the characters this was basically a bunch of people doing hurtful things making terrible choices and then whining about the consequences","382":" lies you wanted to hearbyjames whitfield thomsonessentially this book is about lucy griffin and matt and what their relationships did to them my thoughts after reading this book this book has affected me in rather strange ways at first i loved all of the characters but by the time i finished the book i strongly disliked them but let me just quickly share the basics lucy is privileged has a unique family and loves a man named griffin she meets him accidentally after college and remains connected to him for years and years she gets pregnant with him but he could care less so she has an abortion these are the times before roe vs wade griffin is the ultimate bad boy wealthy sexy attractive complex but in reality he is the creep your mother never wanted you to date he leaves lucy constantly only to reappear when she thinks she is over him friends set her up with matt policeman good guy he totally adores her without being adored in return they marry and have two children sarah and nathan lucy knows early on that this is not a marriage she will stay in forever slowly matt and lucy begin to mess up lucy fears motherhood griffin renters her life matt takes a new job starts traveling and their lives fall into total chaos and disarray matt believes that he has only one choice left to him to save his children from lucy so he takes that choice sigh what i loved about this book i loved the era the setting the dysfunction and at first i enjoyed lucy matt and griffin until they all became really really dark and totally vastly unlikeable well actually i despised griffin from the start but i wanted to give him a chance bad move on my part what i did not love about this book ok lucy and griffin with their weird sex drugs and rock and roll issues were truly annoying from the start perhaps not them as much as their relationship lucy had to be weirdly wired in order to want that kind of relationship on the other hand i didn't like her with matt either there was something odd about him he was too controlled and far too ready to lose that control what he did in his efforts to save sarah and nathan from lucy was nightmarish heartbreaking sad final thoughts i found this book to be a totally fascinating portrayal of a reasonably awful marriage this author's writing was addictive not that this should matter but that this book was written by a 67 year old man was amazing however i hated the ending totally hated it","383":" review originally posted on rather be reading blog what is it about those bad boys they are the hardest to get over aren't they when we meet lucy she is still in love with passionate and inconsiderate griffin who totally deserted her during a pretty crucial time in their relationship in an effort to get over him and dig herself out of this rut she finally listens to her best friend and goes on a blind date with a cop named matt matt is pretty much everything griffin isn't he's sweet he's caring he wants commitment slowly but surely this first date leads to marriage and two children while life feels safe and matt is the poster child for a great husband lucy is never truly satisfied it's like she has one foot out the door all the time and when griffin reemerges in her life an already rocky marriage crumbles into dust okay i know this doesn't sound like the happiest story it really isn't it's full of mistakes and regret and too many important concerns and emotions left unsaid between a husband and a wife thomson's detailed backstory for both characters down to their best friends and their parents is superb and the see sawing between matt and lucy's perspectives was uncanny i found myself totally swept up in their stories in their fight to find happiness for themselves and also for their children who were bearing the brunt of this off kilter union both matt and lucy made mistakes and it was so intriguing because sometimes these mistakes felt like the right thing to do could their problems have been solved in a more logical way of course but both of them felt so strongly one way or another that their dramatic actions really drove the pace of the story and had me finishing this book in one day i could not sleep without knowing how it all would end lies you wanted to hear spans many years and morphs into this unexpected psychological thriller in some ways what would be the repercussions of matt and lucy's actions would karma come into play at some point and would it permanently damage their bond with their children were their moves propelled by selfishness desperation or an extreme need to protect or all of the above the material is so discussion worthy and i felt like it was possible to root for either side at various points in the novel making it that much more of an enjoyable experience to gobble up i love when a book takes me by surprise and i was even more shocked to see this was thomson's debut novel it was so clear how much he cared for all of his characters and worked to tell a well rounded detail oriented story showcasing the grays of commitment and just how far we would go for happiness","384":"$$ yes i am wary of the use of changin it is a quality story that builds as it progresses it's powerful it could have been real the writing is impeccable i don't rehash the book or rewrite the blurb so if you enjoy a quality story that is strong clever and the type of story that reasonably immerses the reader then you will really enjoy this i would read another from this author in a flash it was on the expensive side but it was longer than the average which i prefer was it worth the $$ yes i am wary of the use of changing timelines but this was perfectly executed also very good use of the 'points of view' i never felt like i was reading over the same ground again just small glimpses that is a hard thing to achieve so well done in my opinion the goodreads rating is a surprise i am guessing the reviewers and everyone is entitled to their opinion who marked it low may have not liked the characters actions personally it was all done very well and unless you have extreme situations or behaviour there really is no story technically this book is brilliant and the content is pretty much how some people live if you are romance reader and romance is the only category you like this book is not for you there have been comments regarding the ending personally it was handled well and there is no other way i could imagine ending this it's one of the stronger books in my pile i will say to the author that there was two different amanda's in the story in summary brilliant writing and phenomenal skills from the author if you like this check out mara white's debut novel heights of desire i read hers then read sample after sample and this is the first book that i have finished since hers","385":"disappointing on several levels i enjoy reading about characters i actually like and i didn't the reactions of the characters to several major plot points were unrealistic think about the kids at the end of the book the smallest crack in the relationship was actually a large crevasse and hindered believability all the way through the rest of the book also not beautifully written as the publisher protests","386":"terrific story compelling characters and involving plot lines a thoroughly enjoyable read","387":" this story centers around two main characters lucy and matt lucy and matt fall in love and start a family problem is she never loved him as much as she did her old flame he is not good for her or anyone when matt starts traveling she once again connects with her past and continues to lie to matt one day everything collides and tears everyone apart then matt makes a decision that will change everything again i cheered him on and found no sympathy for lucy as the story unfolds the lie matt could be considered cruel this is mr tomsons debut novel and starting out at the age of 67 he does a fairly good job keeping readers interested in all the lives that each lie touches","388":"wowza okay like serendipity i just came across this novel on the shelves and picked it up just because of the title but after reading the summary and then checking out other people's reviews i knew i had to read it so i started and barely put it down before picking it up again it doesn't happen often even when one reads as much as one breathes that i am thinking of the book when i'm not reading it this book told in alternating points of view from matt and lucy how they met how they got together as a couple had kids got married etc but slowly and with precision you get to see the layers of these people you recognize the common attributes of relationships how sometimes they are unbalanced maybe one loving the other person more and how people have faults and make mistakes but despite having having your opinions let us judge judge judge you can see where these people come from and perhaps why they do what they do without spoiling the book as part of the lure is to wonder what the hell is going to happen next let's just say that it was a relationship gone sour and people were hurt and then possibly a parents worst nightmare comes to fruition and then you really want to know what's to become of it i loved this book was so grateful for happening to come across it as i am tired of people pushing books on other people or going after books because of all the bestseller hubbub i have a sneaking suspicion that this one will blow up yet it is just so good","389":"i went into this book not knowing what to expect and was pleasantly surprised at how much i enjoyed the characters and storyline","390":"james whitfield thomson is extraordinarily accomplished especially for a debut author lies you wanted to hear is instantly engrossing and kept me on my toes gradually but surely shifting my perceptions and loyalties it's a simple story on the surface but ends up as so much more i look forward to whatever thomson writes next","391":"took a long time about 300 pages to get to the main point of the story good characters but bad storytelling","392":"presents interesting scenarios and perspectives","393":"i actually loved it","394":"best book i have read in a while","395":"a voice remiscent of gone girl this was a great read great writing it's hard to believe this was a first novel mr thomson writes so expertly i never skimmed and absorbed every word excellent characterizations and moves between two pov with ease both voices unique i would not hesitate to recommend this book","396":" wow first disclaimer i won the book through a goodreads giveaway offered by the publisher i went into the book with few expectations but came away a solid fan of the book but not the characters lucy lucy lucy lucy i wanted to like her really i did by the end of the book i understood her a little and the edge was off but i can't say that i liked her perhaps i was meant to perhaps i was not matt was a little too good to be true in places but i enjoyed his voice in the early chapters his feelings for lucy his relationships with others there are tiny bits of foreshadowing that he's not 100% the good guy but the way the story takes you along you want to believe that he is that good a lie i wanted to hear perhaps as the critical events of the novel unfold a little bit too far into the page count imo the text challenges you on which of the lies you yourself believed i really enjoyed the book after i got over how irritating lucy was to my sensibilities it could have been a smidge shorter although ironically i would have liked a couple more short chapters at the end to better deal with some of the way things played out there's one line near the end of the book that was superpowerful and redeemed any minor flaws in the book not to give away any spoilers but it will involve a question someone is asked to ask themselves","397":"to me this was an insider's look into someone else's courtship marriage and problems mr thomson uses the shifting perspective between lucy u0026amp matt to paint a his vs her story just as in real life when i finished the novel i felt like if this had been a real situation the truth was probably somewhere in the middle of the two accounts and it was up to me to decide what really happened was lucy as terrible as matt thought there is no way matt could be as perfect a dad and husband lucy imagined...thoughts like this i was reading two books and picked this up and read the first chapter and immediately put the other two down and read this in two days i was engrossed i enjoyed hearing matt's pov especially in the third part being vague because as another reviewer put it if you find out what happens it'll put a damper on reading it for yourself but it was lucy who had me engrossed ti can't even say that i really liked lucy she is definitely someone who i would not be friends with in real life but for me she was so real because of griffin i think most people have had a \"griffin\" in their lives that person who we know treated us bad didn't like us like we loved them but we still get all worked up and excited for any bit of attention from them i certainly had that experience when i was younger... so while i didn't really like lucy i felt a connection with her because of knowing what it felt like to be strung along by someone i kept hoping she would wise up eventually about that relationship loved the whole story was a smidge disappointed at the end but after sleeping on it i think it was the best ending because the reader can decide how it went from there plus awesome sauce that the author had his first book published at 67 hoping for more from him soon","398":"an emotionally evocative book about yearning sorrow and mistakes a lovely read","399":"the back and forth in the story is what kept me intrigued thomson is an excellent storyteller in that respect however i was not invested in either character to a great degree","400":"i can't believe i read two books in a row that i really really liked hopefully my luck will continue loved this book read it very fast i needed to know what was going to happen the characters are multi layered and endearing despite many faults","401":" after reading the description i thought i would enjoy this book but i just couldn't get into it matt and lucy are boring and selfish characters and i have a hard time believing that their children could forgive them so easily once the truth of their situation was revealed i found myself skipping through paragraphs to get to the point there were a lot of unnecessary details that were not relevant to the rest of the story or characters do we really need 3 pages to describe dinner the only parts i actually enjoyed were the handful of lucy's journal entries overall a bland book with a terrible ending as if the author just put down his pen and walked away","402":"the story wasn't super amazing but something about it captured my interest enough to finish it in about a week which is pretty good for me it's an easy read too","403":"a first time published author at 67 awesome","404":" i never would have picked this up had i seen it in stores but after seeing estelle's review on it i knew i had to read it i've slowly teetered away from adult fiction in recent years but this sounded like just the book i would need to get me back into reading it i liked and disliked lucy and matt equally at different parts i loved that i didn't like one character more or less than the other and just when i thought i would hate another character they did something that was redeeming james whitfield thompson does an excellent job at character building i felt like i knew both main characters the children their friends personally while i was reading i could completely understand both of their reasoning for things and then on the opposite vein feel completely for the person they were doing it to it's so easy to like and so easy to hate the main characters it's a weird situation that i can't explain to anyone that hasn't read the book i don't think lies you wanted to hear is written in three books in alternating perspectives between lucy and matt the narrative and style reminded me a lot of gone girl and i enjoyed that fact because it really keeps you on your toes as it's written in alternating perspectives nearly ever chapter leaves you at a part where you want to rush through the next chapter to get back to that character but by the time you get to the end of that chapter you feel the same way it's a really refreshing style because the story never feels stagnant the story itself is remarkable it's the absolute perfect book for a group read because there are so many opinions and talking topics that can come out of it the story spans over thirty years and the alternating chapters really help to bring the story together the only reason why i am not giving this 5 complete stars is because i wanted a bit more for the ending and i would have liked another chapter from lucy's perspective i also was slightly disappointed because i had read a number of reviews that made it seem like there was a huge shock factor in the book but i didn't get that at all granted there were several times where i had \"wtf\" moments but everything made sense with the story and there wasn't a massive twist overall lies you wanted to hear is a fantastic debut novel from an author that i will definitely be watching out for highly recommend this one if you are looking for an adult read that will keep you on the edge of your seat and really make you think","405":"this book was better than i thought it would be i especially like how the ending was open to reader interpretation i also thought the characters stayed true through the end of the book","406":"thomson captured complex relationship of a married couple perfectly well written psycho thriller i wouldn't compare with gone girl though they are different kind of novels","407":"more of a 2 5","408":"the lies you wanted to hear were the easiest ones to tell love it another he said she said story that worked 4 5 stars if i could","409":" i was excited to read this book given the synopsis and that it was categorised as a mystery thriller i do love that genre oh so very much lies you wanted to hear is about relationships lies betrayal and secrecy lies betrayal and secrecy aren't great foundations to build a relationship on but matt and lucy do so without realising at first their relationship was always doomed to fail both matt and lucy enter into their relationship with very different reasons as i was reading it i just wanted to scream to them that they were completely wrong for each other the story is a very depressing way to look at marriage unfortunately though for some it's a very truthful viewpoint of marriage i liked how there wasn't a happily ever after ending i won't say how it ends don't want to spoil it does that make me a bad person i don't think so i just think that it was written realistically with all that had gone wrong in matt and lucy's marriage it wouldn't have made sense for them to gloss over the past and carry on regardless i didn't find the characters particularly likeable but this isn't a criticism they were well developed characters i just didn't agree with many of their actions it's good that the writer made me feel dislike for them it means he made them utterly real i enjoyed reading lies you wanted to hear it was easy to read particularly the third part","410":" this was a good read not great not bad but good although i've marked it as mom book which typically means the book is trite and lame and just overall sappy that is not the case with this book but it is all about a mother and father and their relationships with their children and it's a family saga so i decided to put it in that category i also just like having books in more than just the read category so you know there's that too i found myself able to relate to both lucy and matt at different points throughout this book although mainly lucy ever since i read we need to talk about kevin the idea of having kids has stressed me right out because i'm convinced i'll be incompetent as a mother or that my kids will hate me so lucy's fears hit home in a big way her draw towards griffin is also super relatable i've been in love the real kind once and ever since i've found myself convinced that no one will ever compare which is a truly depressing and heartbreaking thought to live with so i feel ya #grrl on the complete other hand i've also been the one who is hopelessly in love with someone who either a doesn't feel the same or b lies about how they feel or c breaks my heart multiple times in multiple ways or d all of the above usually all of the above the back and forth of their relationship was very human to me and i appreciated that i won't give away anything for once because i think it's necessary to discover how it all plays out on your own but i was very satisfied with this book and it's ending matt and lucy were both thrown through the paces and emerged on the other side being different people than i would have pegged them as at the beginning it was a great turning of the tables and was a pleasure to read","411":" wow an epic story spanning over the course of 20 years lies you wanted to hear is a powerful novel of love loss and betrayal to know that this is thomson's first novel is mind blowing his writing is poetic beautiful and descriptive he created vivid character portraits and detailed landscapes that transcend the story i'm not even sure if it's appropriate to love this story or to make it a favorite but that's what it is i can't say much more without giving away the central plot but this is a must read for anyone who loves to read loves a good story or has experienced love and lost beautiful beautiful novel","412":"a relationship forms u0026amp then falls apart told in alternating chapters from both sides both people make some bad choices u0026amp we discover the fallout that follows","413":"i did enjoy this one it put in mind of a friend from some years back who was active in acoa adult children of alcoholics practically a text book of the difficulty in developing trust in others and deep and lasting relationships haven't seen her in many years and have lost touch i hope she's doing well now she typically ended up in serial relationships with alcoholics but she was really working at growing past that","414":"drippy i only finished it because i've given up on too many books lately","415":"3 5 a simple story without a lot of depth but well paced and enjoyable to read","416":"i liked this book it was a quick fun read","417":"in the prologue you lean that lucy misses her children then you read the book to see what happened this page turner was a quick read at just under 400 pages","418":" this book is full of the drama of love and divorce i liked that every chapter shifted in point of view this is definitely an adult book and made for those that have experienced divorce and had to choose between personal happiness and what's good for the kids it looks a feeling of both parents are at fault not really placing blame on either which i enjoyed there are always two sides to a story and i liked that they was conveyed in this book it was very slow for some of the book i think a lot could have been left out and i wish that the characters would have been more developed but at the same time making the cardboard characters allowed for the reader to project themselves onto the character","419":"this review has been hidden because it contains spoilers to view it click here the beginning was slow and painful at times like get on with it already ending of this book was rushed and terrible how do you go from one decade to the next with no in between what happened to griffin the man that was the whole reason this marriage dissolved maybe i skipped it by accident bc i was so ready to finish the book","420":"a very slow read","421":"i found this a very engaging and well written book that i could not put down i loved the way he gave both sides of the story i highly recommend this as a great read","422":"i liked this book couldn't put it down","423":" my thoughtsloved itmatt and lucy fall head over heels in love well matt mostly lucy is just doing what she thinks she must and return that love as their story unfolds through alternating view points you get the feeling that this relationship isn't what it seems it is built on half truth and wish fulfillment fantasies matt is a cop and instantly falls for lucy after being set up on a blind date by jill lucy has just come off a relationship with griffin and is devastated by the breakup she isn't ready for matt and what he offers so when lucy doesn't admit this to matt their relationship is built on a house of cards and you can't look away as they begin to fall as you get each side of the story from these characters it made me wonder what i would have done in that situation the characters are very well drawn and the situations they are in can easily be imagined this is a fantastic pick for a book club since there are so many dilemmas that can be discussed and picked apart there are some real emotional rollercoasters here so be prepared as girffin reappears in lucy's life there are some heart rendering twists at times i really wondered what the heck lucy was thinking and how she could do this to matt","424":"not quite sure about this book i hated the mom and i thought it was a bit depressing however a lot of it is true about marriages and life","425":"still mulling this one over would love to talk with someone who reads it","426":"i could not put this book down i won't tell much about it~ only that it rattled me and will stay with me for a long time","427":"this was a good choice to read on a snowy day under the covers it started off strong and held my interest for the most part i felt that the story went on too long and as a result the believability of the characters suffered i would recommend the title as a good book club selection for discussion the story of the author is interesting which was what attracted me to the novel in that this is his debut novel at age 67","428":"i actually liked this book i sided with the father and i am not sure why all the time i still wonder about one of the lies who was the parent lying","429":"received a free copy from netgalley told in alternating points of view matt and lucy each explain their side of the story for matt it was love at first sight for lucy not so much although she does love him in a way she just can't seem to leave behind her past both forge ahead and build a relationship on lies and as a result it seems to be no surprise when the marriage not only fails but bombs kids are caught in the crossfire things become utterly disastrous and nasty and no one wins i found myself equally mad frustrated and annoyed with both matt and lucy why did you take her back after that why did you tell her what you did why did you lie to him i felt at a lose to stop the train wreck i knew i was around the corner i think readers can relate to matt and lucy we either know someone like matt or lucy have been in some of the same situations or even responded some of the same ways","430":"i could not put this book down","431":"good story expected a twist at the end that didn't come great characters","432":"i adored this book i wanted more great debut novel","433":"bottom line lying sucks","434":"loved this book there are always 2 sides and this book does a fabulous job exploring both while keeping the reader hooked","435":"this was a 5 star read loved the pace the mystery of where it was going the strong real characters i couldn't put it down","436":"this was built up into nothing it didn't even have an ending all this time i felt like i was forced to be invested in their relationship and then it's over and i got nothing","437":"quick read but a sad story and difficult for me to enjoy","438":"i really enjoyed this book but it seems that he author didn't really know how to end it","439":"it's kind of a depressing take on relationships and marriages but it is extremely well written but these sorts of things happen in real life it would be hard to face that it puts things in perspective in my life i really enjoyed it","440":"even good people make can make extraordinarily hurtful and mean spirited choices that irrevocably impact lives forever lies you wanted to hear is a powerful novel about choices terrible choices that seemingly good people make impossible to put down this is the book club read of the year","441":"this was the first book from this author i felt it was overly detailed about little things and then at the end it seemed to be quickly written and finished up i was left feeling frustrated the biggest issues and important character interactions sarah and her mother were glossed over and gave no detail whatsoever of their reunification not impressed by this writer and will not be reading any more of his books","442":"the entire time i was reading this book i thought i was reading 'we were liars' they have almost identical covers boy was i all kinds of confused","443":" i was lucky enough to randomly pick up this book a few weeks ago since finishing it i've been wondering why it isn't on the best selling charts the multiple narratives reminds me of gone girl and the different character perspectives is one of the best elements of the book some readers want the same surprise as gone girl but that is not how the books are similar remember gg before the plot twist it was engrossing and realistic that is how the similarities align the characters are troubled in such a relatable way that i found myself screenshot ing some of the lines the plot is in no way secondary but the characters way of handling the events and the writer's realism makes this a page turner some reviews don't appreciate the ending however this isn't a fairy tale i don't think the writer intended for you to feel all better about life when you're done likely one of the masterful assets of the book is the focus on this journey of matt and lucy and the complications of our choices the ending compels the reader to acknowledge the heartbreak of the situation i completely appreciate that the author didn't tie a pretty bow on the end i posted a recommendation on facebook after i finished it and so far three friends have bought read and re recommended it hoping this book gets the praise and publicity it deserves","444":"while the book kept my attention there were many points where i wanted to throttle lucy matt and griffin seriously all of them were so unlikeable throughout the book sure i'd feel a twinge of pity for lucy here and there but on a whole i was just ready to be done with her matt's whole idea that he was the perfect parent made me insane with anger and griffin was just such a loser ugh i was just ready for these people to all go away","445":"i loved this book the characters are captivating and the story line keeps you turning the pages until there aren't any left lies you wanted to hear is a book you won't forget and you will look forward to recommending it to your friends you will think about this book long after you read the last line thompson has crafted a beautifully written story about three people who's lives are turned upside down because of the people they lovethompson has produced","446":"this book started out with gone girl potential but fizzled out about halfway through","447":" lies you wanted to hear is a well paced well styled and engaging debut novel by james whitfield thomson a lot of discussion has taken place regarding the author who at age 67 has made quite an entrance onto the literary scene in lies thomson showcases the rocky relationship between matt and lucy from courtship through its eventual unraveling lucy is depicted as wholly selfish and troubled while matt's character is more nuanced the decisions that each of them make wound not only each other but their children as well for a lot of fathers reading this novel matt's sentiments on the family court system and his moral dilemmas on how to protect his children will hit a little to close to home and i don't doubt that for a few mothers who look back on their decision to settle for a 'nice' guy and wrestle with feelings of wanting more more excitement more fun more passion that lies will hit a little close to home as well this this is the dark version of bridges of madison county where temptations are not refused where adultery is discovered and where lives are ruined in a cautionary tale a good read 3 5 stars lies you wanted to hear","448":"the publisher has requested that i not post a full review too far in advance of the book's publication therefore i'll just mention a couple of important things 1 if you're planning to read this novel don't read any detailed reviews the only thing that kept me wanting to continue reading was the fact that i had no idea what was coming any hint of that ahead of time would have ruined it for me 2 parts 1 and 2 were well written but sort of ho hum domestic fiction for me it took me a while to read them however when i got to part 3 i read the last 130 pages all in one sitting because i had to find out what happened all in all a nice first outing for james whitfield thomson and a tip of the hat to him for having his first novel published at the age of 67","449":"james whitfield thomson's gripping psychological debut novel the lies you wanted to hear is one of complex and troubled characters where your loyalties for these two switch back and forth more than a tennis match set in the late 70s in boston matt a copy is set up by his colleague's wife on a blind date with her oldest friend from college lucy lucy who likes to live life on the edge from a well to do family obsessed with her former future lover and bad boy griffin in earlier days back story she gets pregnant and has an abortion as griffin is most definitely not the daddy type however afterwards he is nowhere to be found he tends to show up unannounced throughout the book at his convenience and pulls lucy once again back into his web of deceit lucy likes to smoke pot have sex drink and live on the wild side however she decides after griffin to settle for the nice well controlled good looking stable blue collar cop matt or so he appears matt is intrigued with lucy even though he does not like some of her nasty habits she feels she cannot live up to the perfect matt each is trying to fit into a mold and be what the other wants they marry and have two children however she gets bored depressed and being a typical mother is not in her dna after all her mom an alcoholic was not the best role model during their marriage matt gives up being a cop and is now an international courier and travels often she misses the thrill of griffin and the bad boy while her husband is away with the demands of motherhood when griffin appears once again in lucy's life the trouble begins leading to a nasty divorce with the children in the middle this is when the tables turn before this point readers will dislike lucy and root for the wonderful matt however when matt decides to play god and kidnap the children and begins lying to the children about their mom lucy gets her act together by the end of the book you sympathize with lucy and dislike matt she is left without her children and never gives up hope a story of loss and love and the power of redemption each character continues lying to the other with a web of deceit each playing a part--leaving your head spinning as to which character is most troubled in the end there is a price to pay for their mistakes an addictive frustrating at times and intense page turner for every parent who longs to protect their children i listened to the audiobook 7 15 14 narrated by nan mcnamara and andrew ingalls with an outstanding performance richly developed characters well written suspense family and relationship drama hooking you from beginning to end looking forward to reading more from thomson a master storyteller as he weaves a tale hard to put down would make an ideal choice for book clubs to discuss further each of these personalities lucy griffin matt and the children","450":"not the thriller like gone girl that it has the potential to be yet it squanders this space to really flesh out its emotional and moral aspects too nevertheless this novel is well and carefully measured in its nuance and our protagonists matt and lucy are believable and relatable enough to carry the story","451":"fast paced difficult to decide which characters you empathize with realistic but disappointing ending","452":" ok first novel tryi wanted to love this book because it sounded very interesting but i didn't like main the characters enough to care lucy smoked too much pot and drank too much and it didn't seem believable that matt would fall for her i liked matt until he stole the children also when the children found out about their mother neither of them was angry at their father about it also not believable however at least it was an easy read with no rambling boring pages and i stayed curious enough to want to see how it ended the ending was blurry though did he run away again don't know","453":" seriously you tell lies to not face the truth hide your emotions or not hurt someone else's feeling or even to get back at someone or protect the ones you love i wanted to scream at these characters the lies were overwhelming and crazy and down right scary if you don't tell the truth and pretend it will come out sooner or later one day you will use it against that person did they make the right decisions were apologies owed should they ever gotten married in the first place the ending was weird i wanted something more but was left wondering what why again this is so close to real life and sometimes there aren't answers","454":"worth more than 4 but not quite 5 incredibly well written","455":"when lucy meets matt on a blind date matt is instantly hooked he sees lucy as the fun sexy and wickedly smart girl of his dreams although she's still getting over an old lover lucy is won over by matt's sweet thoughtful nature but 20 years later alone in an empty house trying to imagine the lives of her two young children lucy comes to realize that the little lies you tell can create more damage than the truth you're hiding talk about a manipulative female great first novel kept me hooked on every word","456":" as soon as you meet matt and lucy you feel as if you've known them forever it's amazing one can so easily be in matt's head in one chapter then in lucy's in the next you're so eager to learn what each is going to do that you keep turning the pages as their actions take them toward irreversible damage to their marriage and their lives you inevitably choose the side of one or the other then you wonder if you were right you'll want your friends to read this book so you can discuss it with them","457":" i heard about this book during an npr interview reader's sympathy for each character was supposed to go back and forth between husband and wife as each told their side of the story that sounded so intriguing i found the beginning heavily slanted toward the husband you wonder why these two ever hooked up you wish the man would have walked away or the woman would have seen a shrink the wife was a nutcase beautiful superficial and neurotic it is only after the husband's rash decision about the children that any sympathy begins for the mother who does finally pull her life together by the time i finished the book i could say there were elements of each character that as a parent i could relate to and parts of each that were so dysfunctional i only hope i never get stuck dealing with anyone like this in real life in the end it was an even toss that part was well achieved which one i liked less sympathies got canceled out by the negative elements of their individual characters so i suppose the author succeeded in presenting a balanced story","458":"semi spoiler the most frustrating ending known to man i don't understand why the author all of a sudden wanted the reader to sympathize with the mother at the end but i never did sympathize with her obviously it was hard for her to deal with what matt did but at the same time i feel like she really wasn't fit to be a mother","459":"\"what causes a person to make bad choices and to remain on a path so disastrous it could destroy a family thomson's first novel raises these questions and explores the course of a failed marriage the story is bitter and painful but you'll want to stick with it for the surprising turn that makes you wonder who is most to blame \"nancy russell columbus metropolitan library columbus oh","460":"hard to believe he's a first time author inhaled this book could not put it down thought provoking and painful so well written","461":"excellent book very real characters the book was great but sad it was extremely well written","462":"lies you wanted to hear by james whitfield thomson is a real good page turner the two main characters are matt and lucy i liked matt but he might have gone a bit too far and i did not like lucy but at the end i felt sorry for her you will have to decide how you feel about them and let me know i liked the ending too gerard's review","463":"what a sad book i don't like reading this kind of book but it was written well","464":"i was engrossed in this story two strangers who are brought together on a blind date the woman full of mystery the young man so focused he falls in love and she still in love with someone else how they are brought together and then apart is how the story unfolds i truly enjoyed this book i am usually a hard sell but found myself engrossed emotions went from happy to anger to sadness i highly recommend this book","465":"i would have given this book 5 stars if not for the very quick abrupt open ending i was interested in the book from the beginning hooked by part 2 and couldn't stop reading part 3","466":"i was disappointed by this book i had expected more it was a simple story about people and lies lies to themselves that hurt others but the ending was predictable and i finished the book not because i wanted to but because i had hoped for something that would redeem it for me at the end","467":"not as crazy twisty as gone girl but close very good read","468":"i struggled to decide how to rate this book on the one hand it was a fast read a weekend and i did want to finish it usually the sign that i like a book on the other hand i found the characters increasingly unsympathetic perhaps that was the point 2 5 stars","469":"the premise was intriguing a father who believes his ex wife isn't stable enough to take care of their children but the story starts in the wrong place there are about 200 pages of back story that don't contribute a lot to the story the story lacks tension the characters are cliche and the ending was confusing other than an interesting idea this story fell flat","470":"i could not put this book down the fact that the author got me to actually like lucy says alot about the character development of this book very well written yes the topic is somewhat depressing but it was such a compelling read that i didn't mind i can't believe this is his first book","471":"4 5 starsthis will be a great addition to book group recommendations and one that would work well with a mixed gender group","472":"it's a great book when you seem to see the same lies in your own life","473":" this book took a hundred or so pages to really start getting into none of the characters are truly likeable but saying that what must be said is lucy did not deserve what happened to her i wasn't satisfied with the ending either i believe some pain u0026amp punishment should have been bestowed upon matt time is something you can never get back nor make up this is an adult novel dealing with grown up issues maybe too grown up for me because it's kind of depressing but i did read the book in less than a day so the writing did keep me turning the pages","474":"it was gripping a page turner i couldn't put it down well written the alternating narrators were essential to understanding their feelings and motives but oddly i didn't like either parent and i didn't like the end i needed a little more bc i didn't feel like matt could've made that choice","475":"i had no moral dilemma the father was wrong to steal his kids i thought his character as drawn would've raised more hell done more to ensure their safety before resorting to such a desperate act","476":"i did not really like this story at first it really drops you right into the middle of a girl's mess i found certain parts of this story sort of unbelievable would a police officer not realize that his girlfriend is seeing someone else matt seems to have a good self image would he not realize he is dating someone with a poor self image and lose interest i disbelieved that in real life griffin would return i found some other portions of the book to require suspension of disbelief as well but those are more spoilery so i'll leave them out of the review however if you can suspend your disbelief about these things and just read the story you will find a great tale about a couple of mixed up individuals i enjoyed reading it and near the end it picked up steam and i had a hard time putting it down i suspect that if i were divorced and shared custody with someone i may have a different understanding and appreciation for this book and story overall it's a good read and story","477":"enjoyed this book","478":"i just couldn't get into this book the writing is good but i didn't like lucy and it lacked any kind of suspense pretty predictable i like when a book keeps you guessing it's a sad story too if you care about matt and the kids i ended up skimming the last 100 pages","479":"holy crap this book was a ride i was totally engrossed and i feel immensely frustrated with what to me is clearly matt's descent into his own delusion i would have liked a further look into the story at the end though","480":"in the end i wasn't sure who had been hurt more her or me well i did read it for the title and the title alone i had no prior thoughts about what this would contain as a story except for lies i barely knew the genre before picking it up because as i said the title made the call as it turns out lies you wanted to hear is about a love gone wrong between lucy and matt and it deals with them meeting their relationship beginning to show its ugly side and the aftermath of a break up all in the time of about two decades even without expectations lies you wanted to hear disappointed in parts i'd like to start with saying the writing is good really good props for such great writing in a debut novel despite being bored a great deal throughout the book the writing sort of made up for it in those parts i has great flow even if a bit stiff at times as for the rest well many things could've been done better while the characters are layered and genuine there is little growth coming from either matt or lucy matt's a regular good guy working as a cop and well just your ordinary guy lucy on the other hand is comes from a rich upbringing is trying to work her ex boyfriend out of her system when meeting matt of the two lucy is definitely the harder to sympathize with or even care for matt on the other hand in the beginning is rather likable even if a bit dull the main problem when it comes to the characters are the lack of development in them the changes they go through are small and neither grow very much and it's a long book divided into three parts the first two are really slow and does little in development of them for the third part they grow some but not enough for me to be satisfied mostly this is because when realization dawns it's too quick and too simple for both characters for the plot i can't give a too detailed description because it'll spoil the crucial events but as i said the first part is painfully long and at first glance feels pointless i still think it could've been shortened a great deal but i guess i understand why it stayed so long even after editing there really isn't much i appreciated in the first part because it focused on lucy and her past with her ex griffin for me this part could've been done better because i never understood her real attraction to him or why she was so set on him it's far from bad but at the same time just not enough the second part wasn't great either both the first and second part passed slow with little conflict presented however the last part was much more interesting when everything ugly have been done and matt takes matter into his own hands also i swore to myself when i understood where lies you wanted to hear was heading that i wouldn't compare it to or even mention gone girl you see how this is failing because while gone girl is more thriller mystery there are so many parallells to be drawn between how matt and lucy are met by authorities and i enjoyed gone girl immensely more than this one mainly because the faster moving plot and deeper exploration of the human psyche is just like gone girl about love gone wrong with the former its more realistic yes but also much more boring this book would've been much better met by me had it been less focus on the first part and deeper on lucy and matt's thoughts in part three where things actually happens nevertheless i did find myself read this quickly and was invested in the story despite my issues after all it does present a somewhat realistic story i could understand why both matt and lucy reacted certain ways and some points hit very close to home for me personally how they were treated both by each other and others in whole i'd say this is a good debut and i'll be looking for the author's next work hoping that will sit better than this one for more reviews visit amandasays on booklikes and leafmarks","481":"this story was good not my normal kind of read normally i read romance with a lot of sex this had none but the story was well written it makes you think about the things we do that we think are right at the time but when we have plenty of time to think about it we're not so sure we made the right choices after all at first i agreed with what matt did but by the end not so much how ever i see why he did what he did i did not like how it ended not a cliffhanger just didn't like it","482":"this book never received the i can't put it down feeling parts were interesting and i wondered what it would eventually lead to as the title lies you wanted to hear drew me in the climax of the story and conclusion came together quickly and the story ended abruptly with many unanswered questions","483":"i really enjoyed this book i liked that it was told from the perspective of the two main characters each chapter alternating between lucy's voice and matt's the author was effective at developing characters that were either very like able or very hate able my only complaint is that i didn't want the book to end i was disappointed when it was over thomson definitely left me wanting more","484":"life's dilemma play the cards you're dealt or fold your cards take the money and run and then move on husband matt felt malevolent after bring cheated on to only feel like a scumbag at the end not sure i would read this type of book again i should have expected it really when i realized jodi picoult was the foreword author","485":"i enjoyed the way this book was written from alternating points of view i found myself sympathizing with both matt and lucy while hating them at the same time matt's decision was so extreme and it was interesting to see how he transformed and felt completely justified in doing what he did would have liked to have learned more about his past overall thought it was very well written just felt some things were pretty far fetched and the ending seemed rushed compared to the slow buildup of the novel","486":" synopsis matt loved lucy from the moment they met lucy convinced herself that she loved matt too but relationships and families can't be built on lies even the ones we want to hear high pointsi loved the structure the back and forth between lucy and matt really built a very lovely and complex point counter point it was perfect for setting up the dynamics of a very complicated relationship low points the supporting cast griffin amanda thorny jill they all felt flat one dimensional you'll love it if you like watching complex frustrating relationships play out the crux of lies you wanted to hear is the break down of a doomed relationship also moral ambiguity is a huge theme as well if you like trying to balance right and wrong you love this you'll hate it if you aren't into family drama once you have a child with someone you are chained to that person for life even if the marriage relationship doesn't work out some couple just cooperate better than others overall rating 3 5 starsreceived from netgalley for more reviews by the readist visit www thereadist com","487":" the story of a marriage between two remarkably dislikable people great character building and believable story line made the book a compelling read lucy is in love with unreliable griffin when she meets matt on a blind date matt is instantly head over heels for this sexy edgy woman he enfolds lucy in his care and she allows it less than bowled over by matt she sees that he is nevertheless a good catch the kind of man she should want so she goes along two kids later the relationship suffers from the usual strains until griffin shows up again and the marriage explodes the story alternates between matt's view and lucy's view while i started out rooting for the two of them i found matt's constant worrying and lucy's driftlessness as maddening as they did in spite of their flaws i found the story gripping and couldn't wait to see what the next bad decision was going to bring should they ever have married would it have killed lucy to show some will power could matt have loosened his grip a little bit what would have made this marriage work this is a story that you will consider long after you've read it","488":"found this sad and depressing","489":"wow there's not much i can say without giving away the story i could relate to both matt and lucy but could not like either of them this book was raw emotional frightening and i couldn't put it down if the author writes more novels i'll definitely be reading them","490":"well written but depressing","491":"kept me reading late into the night from the very beginning of the book i knew that things were going to happen and i had to keep turning pages to find out i was surprised and intrigued by the twists in the story the book alternates between lucy's and matt's point of view the reader gets to know what both main characters are thinking and why they act as they do lucy and matt both made poor decisions and t i really enjoyed reading this one what a fantastic debut novel lies you wanted to hear kept me reading late into the night from the very beginning of the book i knew that things were going to happen and i had to keep turning pages to find out i was surprised and intrigued by the twists in the story the book alternates between lucy's and matt's point of view the reader gets to know what both main characters are thinking and why they act as they do lucy and matt both made poor decisions and told lies but you could tell that they also loved each other and their family despite their failed marriage once i finished the book the story kept coming back to me and i found myself pondering what i would have done if i was matt or lucy...and i still don't know i would definitely recommend this book i received a copy of this book in exchange for an honest review","492":"this book gets better and better matt and lucy are in love from the beginning it is obvious that matt is more responsible than lucy and is willing to forgive her transgressions they have two children together and divorce when lucy screws up one too many times there are interesting twists that i don't want to ruin by explaining in this review it is rare that a book title can mean so many things a worthwhile read","493":"fast paced engaging he said she said novel of marital discord that leads to the husband kidnapping the couple's two young children i enjoyed the boston setting and the late '70s into the '90s time frame placing the story in the 20th century meant a parental kidnapping would be easier to pull off very readable but despite the inclusion of a reading group guide i can't decide if there is enough here to recommend this to book clubs","494":"this was generally well written and i enjoyed the first two sections however the big twist the third section the conclusion were wholly unrealistic and detracted from the rest of the book","495":"i read it in one sitting characters are awesome stayed up till 4 am to finish it totally worth it i will now pretend i got enough sleep","496":"i started this book on the same day as someone else's love story and i dropped it for the same reason people don't talk and act in this manner and the style of narration was just too grating for me to continue reading i also could not connect with lucy or matt they were both cardboard cut out caricatures and making them both sex obsessed really does nothing to give them any depth a very disappointing read i would definitely not recommend it","497":"a really good book about a topic that's hard to read a marriage falling apart and kids in the middle of it all if you're a fan of gillian flynn's gone girl i would recommend this as the pg 13 version not a psychological thriller like flynn's novel but you do ping pong back and forth with two unlovable characters that unravel as the story progresses highly engaging","498":"i read this in one night i just had to find out how it ended","499":" reading this book is like watching a train crash in slow motion you see the trouble coming from way down the track watch the wheels sliding off the rails think to yourself this is not going to be pretty and sure enough bad things happen although not completely what you initially expected the story is told from two perspectives in alternating chapters neither of the two main characters are particularly likeable but that's okay because you're here to see the train crash not chat with the passengers as they go hurtling by the other interesting thing is that the reader's feelings about the two main characters change over the course of the story it's hard to choose sides until the very end a nice piece of story telling and character development by debut novelist james whitfield thomson","500":"kind of sorry i spent so much time with this one i should have known that with jodi picoult plugging it on the front cover it wasn't really going to be my kind of book but andre dubus was plugging it on the back easy flow to the story but not really enough depth to satisfy","501":"i didn't find much redemption in either character self absorbed to the detriment of their children","502":"this novel was a page turner for sure the story was straightforward and intriguing and i liked that it was suspenseful but not a deep slogging read don't want to give away any of the story so i'll just say it's a boy meets girl and boy loves girl more than girl loves him back not a love story just a gripping view of life from both the female and male point of view","503":"this book wasn't what i expected but it was a great read","504":"stayed up late a real page turner excellent debut","505":" this book was exceptionally good a little pretentious at times but still an excellent story the book seems slanted on the side of the mother a whiny often down right obnoxious and supposed victim throughout she admits that she had failings but didn't deserve what happened to her i guess some people might call experimenting with drugs failings but exposing her children to the kind of behavior she exhibited was inexcusable although she came up with a few good ones it's always somebody else's fault hubby was just too much of a good guy i guess there's just so much niceness one can tolerate in a spouse the husband on the other hand was self righteous and not exactly innocent either but hardly in the same category as her normally when i can't stand any of the characters i find i don't like the book either this kept me interested all the way","506":" do you know the feeling when a book comes from the library that you reserved months ago and you have something like 2 weeks to read it and it can't be renewed i start to read the book with dread thinking that there's no way that i'll get through it within the allotted time but then some books surprise you this is a story about family relationships one told from the perspective of the husband and wife both flawed both yearning for love both making bad decisions based on this love it's a story of the love that parents have for their children is it really all for the children though or are these bad decisions that are made because each parent wants ultimately just to be happy themselves what does it mean to be happy these are all questions that are raised in this book that was an effortless read","507":"loved this book not sure at first but as the story unfolded and the characters became more real i really got into it told from 2 different points of view his and hers it's the story of a couple who drifted apart and what happened i highly recommend it","508":"definitely a page turner i enjoyed how the story and the main characters progressively grew more complex highly recommended also enjoyed the boston setting decade span and alternation of first person in the novel","509":"very good book keeps you interested till the very last page i would have given it a five but i wish it would have been a better ending","510":"this book had it's moments but was generally boring also lucy felt fake she came across as a guy's idea of the perfect girl sexy kinky beautiful but did not seem like a person herself it made it hard to care what she did or what happened to her","511":"this book reminded me of a less crazy version of gone girl i liked it a lot","512":"this review has been hidden because it contains spoilers to view it click here i'm still not sure whether i liked this book or not it was brilliantly written in the sense where my feelings for a character changed so dramatically from beginning to end that it's made it difficult to really know what i feel we meet lucy and learn that her kids are gone immediately i assumed that they had died and so i felt sad for her then we get to know her from the beginning who she was who she loved what she thought of herself and you start thinking that she has made some really ba i'm still not sure whether i liked this book or not it was brilliantly written in the sense where my feelings for a character changed so dramatically from beginning to end that it's made it difficult to really know what i feel we meet lucy and learn that her kids are gone immediately i assumed that they had died and so i felt sad for her then we get to know her from the beginning who she was who she loved what she thought of herself and you start thinking that she has made some really bad choices we meet matt and love his positive attitude cheery personality and deep emotional feelings for lucy but lucy doesn't love him as much and instead of ending it before it gets serious she strings him along hoping that eventually she'll feel something children and marriage happen but she suffers from postpartum depression and again you start feeling bad for lucy you start thinking she's not that bad but she smokes does drugs drinks in excess and goes back to her old boyfriend and cheats on matt you start hating lucy again how can she do this to matt why can't she see what she has matt finally realizes that lucy was never interested in the marriage and he takes off with the kids yeah you feel a little bad for lucy but really figure she deserved it but did she did matt really need to go to that extreme more","513":" this was a very good engaging book which makes me believe that my books that i've read this year are much better than the ones i read last year lucy is a rough edged girl who has an on and off again relationship with griffen who is a bit of a player but she gets set up on a blind date with the very stable but somewhat boring matt and tries to fall in love with him the book is told in alternating chapters and the story takes several unexpected twists and turns and ends up being a great plot and character driven novel","514":"starts out a bit slow but really gets going and you have finish watching the train wreck","515":"good story characters rang very true","516":"disclosure i won a free advanced copy from goodreads although i would have had no problem not finishing the book or writing an honest review if i didn't like it i could not put this book down great story and very believable characters i wasn't sure of the first few chapters i thought the matt character was a little one dimensional and stereotypical at first also having just read two books where the chapters alternate voice and point of view gone girl and a visit from the goon squad i was a little tired of that style choice but then it sort of all came together and i couldn't put it down i thought the plot was very compelling and i had empathy for both main characters call me sexist but i am also skeptical when a new male author tries to write a woman's point of view but i found lucy very believable like any good book it also made me think about parallels to my own life in the choices the characters made fortunately my life has not been quite as dramatic as the story here i thought it was very tight right through the final chapter interesting that this author did not become a 'writer' until in to his 60s i look forward to more novels from him recommended for a quick enjoyable read for those interested in a plot driven story","517":"i enjoyed this book made me keep turning the page to see what would happen next i like the author's writing style hope he writes another one","518":"i had a hard time putting this book down it is the story of the marriage between lucy and matt with the twists and turns leading down a path of pain every other chapter is told from the perspective of these two main characters it is the story about choices and consequences and the lies that stand in the way of happiness","519":"it took awhile to get into this book but once i did i couldn't put it down i wanted to see more development of the 3rd part though i appreciated that we needed the beginning sections to set the feel for the end but i would have rather seen a third of the book cover that and the 2nd section cover the years that have progressed and the 3rd section perhaps cover how to repair the relationship trying not to spoil","520":"hmm i thought it rather dull until the last 1 3 the characters were rather unlikable but when i think about what the author had to say about grief and hope i bumped up my rating to a 4","521":"kept me up until midnight love a book written by two different points of view","522":"this is a great novel about a love story gone wrong told from alternating viewpoints it is easy to get caught up in one character's story and wanting to skip ahead to read their next chapter while rooting for them only to change your mind by the time the next chapter comes around what i liked best about the book is that every minor character has a larger role in the story and all of their loose ends were tied up before the story ended","523":" i've read a lot of reviews that compare this book to gone girl and there are a lot of similarities for those of you trying to choose between the two pick gone girl there's something about that book that thomson's just can't top gillian flynn manages to create characters you love and hate thomson has just managed to create two characters i shrug about the premise of the novel is a good one matt and lucy meet but lucy is in love with griffin the man who made her get an abortion and then dumped her i'm not sure why the abortion addition to the story has been included if it's to make lucy out to be a bad mother that doesn't seem far if it's to make griffin seem like a jerk well it doesn't quite work that way either and starts the book out on a false note however lucy and matt's relationship rings true at the start he falls first she decides to try and love dependability they have a good life it's sweet until it's not to pull off the love story turned thriller genre you have to have characters the reader either loves or hates and thomson has gotten so distracted with sub plots that she never makes it there with her two main characters at times i want to feel for them but can't stand them quite enough at other times i want to hate them but can't quite strike a balance the story is fairly fast paced i made it through the whole thing in a matter of hours but it didn't cling to me like gone girl did it just sort of lays flat just like its characters there's nothing about it bad enough to make it a bad book but nothing about it that makes it great either","524":"i was completely blown away by this tale i know these characters and i cared i felt for with them i was engaged from the get go well done well done i am a now officially a fan of mr thomson","525":"3 1 2 stars i thought this was a very good debut novel it was written clearly the pace was good and the main characters were well honed","526":"not sure what i think of this book i liked it until the twist then i am not sure i liked it anymore i think the ending would have been more interesting had i read it in a book club and could discuss it with others","527":"this book is a real page turner and i read it in three sittings notwithstanding how quickly i wanted to find out what was going to happen next i couldn't help but

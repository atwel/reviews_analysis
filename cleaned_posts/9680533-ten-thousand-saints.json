am not a fan of this book it is like reading rent 20 years too late it is completely outdated and i'm not sure why someone would have written this book in 2011 it is about a bunch of teenage potheads who reform themselves into straight edge musicians some of whom become hare krishnas in the 1980s in vermont and in the lower east side in nyc for one thing i've never heard of any such thing as this straight edge movement and even if it was a big deal at the time i find it hard to believe that a random group of burnout teens could form a straight edge band in a few weeks and suddenly have enough of a following to go on a cross country tour and to have enough people at their shows to stage dive i mean what 5 people would show up to a concert of teenagers from vermont in a rec hall in florida there's also a lame treatment of homosexuality and aids that might have been insightful if written in 1985 again i'm completely confused why this is on the nytimes notable list for 2011 was it a really bad year for fiction or what","2":"enjoyed this great sense of time and place lower east side on the cusp of gentrification cbgb punk scene etc interesting characters too","3":"only read the first third may give it another try later on","4":"another rock 'n roll sort of book ten thousand saints is really a story about family and relationships and generation x kids whose baby boomer parents give them both too much and too little the main character 16 year old jude is a drugged out disaster whose life is changed when his best friend dies of an overdose the plot gets increasingly complicated but the reader can't help but care about the characters and the directions they are heading best enjoyed by those who remember the 80s or love nyc or ever danced in a mosh pit the original mosh pits but a pretty good story for anyone i really enjoyed it","5":"i enjoyed the book but found all the praise a bit inflated","6":"very well written the characters were developed and i was pretty caught up in their story 3 stars because i didn't like the ending it wasn't a bad ending just not the one i had hoped for","7":"well maybe 3 5 stars because it is very well written it was just difficult for me to connect as the experience of the characters was rather alien to my background frankly i think the author did a core dump of every problem a teen might wrestle with drugs sexual identity growing up dysfunctional parents aids pregnancy crime battles with authority the music scene i think the thing that disappointed me the most is i did not see a bright future for any of the characters regardless of how well meaning they were or became","8":"this book deals with drug overdosing teen pregnancy runaways bad decisions and getting clean which swings the pendulum to other extremes in some cases i wanted to really like this book the characters are likable enough but the drug culture and poor parenting in the book were tough to read movie came out in 2015 starring ethan hawke but i don't think i'll watch it","9":" i wanted to like it i tried to like it i just couldn't it didn't take long for me to realize that the author had no first hand experience with her subject matter and was relying on interviews and research that doesn't usually bother me there aren't a lot of people who are experienced with zombies for example but this was closer to home for me however setting all that aside the story didn't seem to go anywhere henderson threw everything she could at this story drug and alcohol abuse teen pregnancy parental abandonment homelessness aids hoping something would strike a nerve it all fell flat with me i should have cared about the characters but i couldn't i was more invested in some of the minor characters who hardly got any page time i got a chance to watch the trailer for the film adaptation and couldn't help feeling that if the character of jude looked and acted like that he would have been eaten alive","10":"a little hard to get into but well worth it teenage angst drug abuse but a good story with well drawn out characters","11":"3 5 stars to henderson's credit i had trouble putting this book down even when it started feeling a bit bloated and interesting settings themes were exposed as the characters sought redemption straight edge youth bumping up against hippie parents queers in an anti gay aids era paradoxically seeking shelter in the homophobic punk subcultures growing up with fetal alcohol syndrome but in the end i think it lacked depth in its characters and themes still captivating enough to get me to round up to 4 stars","12":"i suppose i am just too old for all the drug use and lack of self discipline not my kind of story","13":"fast read for me i found that i was rooting for the main character jude while most of the other characters were somewhat shallow while it is a quick read for a 400 page book the writing was somewhat muddled at times seems like the end was a little rushed given the amount of detail that henderson gave to other issues read if you like coming of age stories","14":"awesome book loved this","15":"i liked parts that delved into the period nyc setting during the straight edge punk aids epidemic years and the gentrification transformation of alphabet city st marks area and found the story sometimes gripping but overall it felt too unfocused incohesive","16":"a story delivered with beautiful prose each sentence deserves a second read","17":"another book i couldn't put down this summer really uniquely set against the backdrop of straight edge culture in vermont and new york city with flawed yet likeable characters","18":"tried way too hard","19":" perhaps it is fitting that my feelings about this straight edge fiction book are as mixed as my feelings about straight edge kids and culture i have been looking forward to reading ten thousand saints since i first picked it up on the shelf a few months back and became excited about a fictional story set in the late 1980s new york city hardcore scene that spawned iconic bands like judge gorilla biscuits youth of today and bold the vermont connection also intrigued me because i had heard much about the state music scene and youth culture not straight edge from a good friend of mine who lived in burlington during the early 1990s unfortunately i felt that my expectations were not fulfilled through much of the book i think my response may be in part due to the exceedingly high level of anticipation that i had prior to reading it but there were some central elements of the story that did not sit well with me much of what eleanor henderson does in this book is right i was surprised at how well ten thousand saints characterizes band life and the punk hardcore diy scene as in the book the shows are overwhelmingly male dominated and the hardcore kids emphasize friendship and brotherhood over girls and relationships at least in principle the tour episodes were pretty representative of a small band's experience on the road jude and his band the green mountain boys experience equal parts exhilaration adventure intra band tension and road weariness the portrayal of bands playing shows for just enough gas money to get them to the next destination the diy culture and the willingness of kids at shows to feed and house bands feels authentic the characterization of the straight edge movement is also very good many of the straight edge kids including the main characters jude and johnny are former users or children of alcoholic or drug abusing parents and lived through a trying experience that was somehow connected to an unclean lifestyle henderson goes on to chronicle a cult like adherence to being poison free that defines straight edge and often vegan kids while respectable and admirable in intent many straight edgers develop a sense of righteousness about themselves and a disdain for those who do not share the commitment to keeping their own bodies pure the character jude especially develops a staunch preachy ness that is comparable to that which you find among users who have found a form of redemption in god and religion henderson does a good job casting straight edge as a sort of millennial religious movement kids bear xs like christians bear crosses and even consider themselves \"nailed to the x\" just as jesus was crucified on a cross an x upended henderson does not make the comparison this implicitly but the religious like undertones are certainly implied she actually discusses the connection between some straight edge kids and hare krishna henderson observes the irony of someone jude who had been using drugs just a few weeks earlier judging people for their lack of restraint she also shows that while straight edge kids have a great respect for their bodies and the bodies and lives of animals if they are vegan they do not necessarily share that same respect for people that are not like them and can act out violently to impinge upon the free choice of others henderson also notes how quickly some straight edge kids digress despite the many positives my feelings about the book remain conflicted in part i think this is due to its accurateness i have heard the phrase \"pizza slut\" in reference to pizza hut and other equally annoying word substitutions enough times in my life that reading them repeatedly in the book grated on me a little yet it was a fair representation of teen speech in the late 1980s early 1990s today a more serious complaint centers on the story's premise substitute rich kids in california for the punk rockers in the book and you essentially have an episode of 90210 the rich cocaine nose private school stepdaughter of jude's deadbeat dad in new york city travels to vermont to meet her dad's biological son an extensive night of partying follows during which time the stepdaughter eliza has unprotected sex with jude's best friend teddy and become pregnant teddy dies before the night is through guilt and a sense of grief settle in and the formerly promiscuous eliza considers keeping the unborn baby enter jude and teddy's estranged straight edge brother johnny from new york city johnny convinces jude to be poison free and proposes that he father his dead brother's baby but johnny has a deeply kept secret of his own it felt a like a soap opera cast in an alternative scene and reduced my appreciation for henderson's carefully researched novel to some degree i also think that henderson may have tried to do a little too much in the text johnny's secret is that he prefers to bed with fellow straight edger rooster than with eliza since the story takes place in late 1980s the aids epidemic and fears about the disease are growing rooster has the bug and johnny is not sure if he has caught it the intimation that straight edge may be a front for sexually confused kids as much as it was a culture that gave kids a sense of purpose belonging and a means for venting aggression did not sit well with me at least not in this story i am sure there were plenty of gay straight edge kids who either did not come out or did not immediately recognize that they are gay however it seemed like there were two stories fighting for central billing in this book henderson's ten thousand saints finishes fairly strong with a resolution to the pregnancy aids and gay dilemma set admist a protest over the gentrification of tompkins square and the east village the gentrification issue adds another theme to the story nonetheless it is an interesting episode that takes place in one of the most iconic locations of the new york hardcore scene i e judge's new york crew the book closes years later with jude returning to cbgb's for one of the final shows before the closure of the club the brief characterization of jude's adult life and his reflection of his youth will undoubtedly ring familiar to many people entering mid life regardless of what scene they belonged to when they were younger","20":" wow i mean i knew i was going to like this book but i didn't realize just how much so those five stars are the same five stars i gave to say the amazing adventures of kavalier and clay not really the same five stars i gave to bridget jones' diary let's be clear on that from the start without getting too much into a plot summary i'll just say it focuses on teens involved in nyc's straight edge punk scene in the late 1980s and it's a beautiful poetic glimpse at that it's what rent couldn't be because it's a musical i thought it was going to break my heart and it kind of did but in a good way i adored the three main characters and just wanted so much for them to be okay i love it it's one of the most beautiful books i've ever read one of the ones i'll come back to again and again","21":"for whatever reason i realized weeks after i had finished it that i like this book more than i realized while i was reading it it's a little predictable and plot devices are a little convenient at times but it's lovely portrait of a scene not often written about teenage boy punks in an era that's rarely focused on late '80s early 90s","22":"this is a rich story about being young and stupid making 180 degree turns going to extremes and finding yourself in the end one of my favorite parts is how it chronicles the straight edge scene of the mid to late 80s primarily in nyc for anyone that spent time with kids like this henderson offers interesting insights into the scene and the psyche of this group i have to admit it was great to hear names of bands i hadn't thought of in years youth of today seven seconds bands i loved at the same time this book takes place this is worth the read","23":"i really liked the character development in this book but it needed a good editor it was not that the writing was bad but the book could easily have been about a third shorter and better for it","24":"this book had me guessing and hooked from the beginning it captures a moment and feeling and had the ability to make me understand sympathise with and get pissed at the kids and their parental figures some of which were 'kids' themselves i couldn't put it down and highly highly recommend it","25":" i had barely heard of straight edge before reading ten thousand saints which is set in the late '80s a sub genre of the punk movement straight edge kids rebelled in the opposite direction they swore off drugs cigarettes drinking and sometimes even meat and sex eleanor henderson uses a handful of teenagers to create a world divided between the lower east side of new york and a thinly veiled burlington vermont that is ground zero in the straight edge community as well as a portrait of the connection between parents and children the story begins with two sixteen year olds jude and teddy both are taking all sorts of drugs from pot to huffing turpentine it is new year's eve 1987 and they meet eliza who is jude's father's girlfriend's daughter who is up from new york they all go to a party and she hooks up with teddy in a bathroom his first time teddy will ingest cocaine and die before the night is over after huffing air conditioning coolant eliza is carrying his child she wants to keep the child and ends up enlisting johnny teddy's half brother to act as father and marry her johnny is a punk musician tattoo artist and local straight edge legend he is also gay and secretly has an affair with his bandmate who has aids now that the scene was exploding in new york everyone had started to look the same kids from westchester and connecticut loitering on the sidewalk in front of cb's sporting the band t shirts they'd brought the previous weekend looking for drunk kids to beat up so writes anderson about the scene around tompkins square park where squatters will eventually be forced out in police riot i knew nothing about this scene remembering walking down st mark's place and looking at punks as if they were zoo animals but she brings it to life and helps me understand the raw excitement of the time period jude goes from drug freak to straight edge much to the amusement of his father who is a pot dealer his mother back in vermont makes glass bongs in some ways though he he may have fetal alcohol syndrome he is adopted jude matures faster than his parents do the father les is a fun character the kind of father you might wish you had who gives you the best dope and is there when you need to go to the hospital but is emotionally retarded eliza's mother a british ballet dancer tries to find her daughter in hopes of getting her to give up the baby but the little family eludes her a few references are made to s e hinton's the outsiders and there is a sense that these kids are taking care of themselves in a parentless world as the boys in that book are they liked to conceive of their situation in terms they were familiar with punk bands musicals young adult novels jude and johnny were the greasers fleeing the socs and eliza was cherry valance the girl from the right side of the tracks they were the runaways betrayed by their parents only they'd stitched their way into and out of so many states it was hard to keep track of which one they were running from anderson's prose is butter going down easily it's so good that only after putting the book down for awhile does one realize this is just a very well written afterschool special with a lot more drugs structuring a book about a dead teen and his unborn child isn't exactly breaking ground but setting in the relatively unmined world of punk in the 1980s is i also appreciated the fear of girls that is exhibited by the boys in the novel or should i say men as jude's father doesn't fear women but he certainly doesn't understand them from jude's perspective girls were incubators they were ovens they were uteruses he could barely look at one without projecting a diagram of her reproductive organs over her clothes he hated the associations that girls now engendered in him he hated thinking about harriet's fallopian tubes he hated thinking about the insides of his birth mother a teenager herself a vagina was a thing he had squeezed bloodily out of before being given away even if you don't care for punk rock or drug abuse read for amazing paragraphs like this one at the texaco station on grammer streeet the only gas station in lintonburg open in the middle of the night two cars sat in the parking lot and one of them was a shit colored camaro with a black flag bumper sticker and a pizza hut dome on the roof","26":" jude and teddy are two boys coming of age in the late '80's jude is adopted by ex hippies that eventually divorce and teddy has a mother that has told him his father is dead teddy dies early on in the novel and the book looks at the fall out of his death on jude teddy's brother johnny and a girl that happens to be with him hours before he dies eliza the story follows jude to new york where he goes to live with his father who sells pot out of his apartment it is in this new life that jude becomes friends with johnny and learns things about himself that he never knew possible the first being sober isn't bad i think the narrative moves a little slowly there's something missing perhaps a better understanding of where these teens are coming from in their world view it felt disjointed","27":"i liked but didn't love this book it's a curious coming of age story with some interesting character twists some which worked some which didn't","28":" i did not expect to like this book as much ten thousand saints is about a boy named jude who loses his best friend teddy teddy dies due to an over dose i felt jude learned a lot from his best friends death readers saw how much teddy's death actually impacted him and i was glad the author used it as a way for jude to realize he needed to change his life around i also liked how the authors changed the settings so drastically it was interesting to see jude come from a small town to end up living as a city boy for the rest of his life i really did like most of this book but i was not happy with the character johnny i thought johnny was a nice guy and he turned out not to be and i was actually quite mad at that i honestly did not see this plot twist coming and as a result6 i did not like the end of the book i didn't like how i was lead to beli8eve johnny was a good person when in reality all he cared about was his dead brother's kid growing in some pregnant girl i found that this made me not want to read on since i knew johnny was just going to cause trouble which he tried and sadly i did not like the end of the book i felt that johnny changing really made me not like the book as much since he was one of my favourite character's before i found out what he really was like a text to self connection i can make is between jude and i there was a point in my life where i did not make the best decisions and this resulted in consequences and loses of people i dearly cared about jude was like this to at the beginning of the book since he lost teddy due to them choosing to due drugs i can also relate that jude and i both had an experience that helped us change our lives around jude had this moment when his best friend teddy died and i went through something like that i lost a friend due to bad choices and realized i needed to make a change in my life this was when i decided to change my li8fe round and actually make a better life for myself i got involved with music and now i sing and write songs all the time i found a passion i loved and this gave me the motivat6ion to make my life a better one which was the same for jude since he started a band and got passionate about it after he cut out the bad choices in his life we both turned our lives around and this wouldn't have happened if we didn't have those experiences that caused us to do so","29":" i really couldn't tell you what this book was about or why i kept reading i think i wanted to keep going in hopes of finding a plot there are a lot of tangled issues here so many that the book doesn't make a clear statement about any of them i know that this author is a educated creative writer but i think she loses many readers trying to be creative in place of a regular plot line what was the conflict the climax the falling action i have no idea this is thought provoking in snippets but not in depth it also left a lot unresolved for me","30":"almost put it down at the beginning because i was thinking i couldn't relate glad i didn't","31":"didn't break new ground but was suffused with truth and damaged beauty this story stuck with me","32":"great characters although with a young daughter a little terrifying the plot was attainable enough to really pull you through but was a fabulous discussion for my book club as well the best kind of books","33":" a good and quick way of describing ten thousand saints would be to call it a bohemian consort to jonathan franzen's freedom the berglunds franzen's vehicle for sifting and weighing distinct facets of contemporary american life are troubled and wacky like all of us but they have college degrees own a sweet house and on and off hold jobs that exceed the value of their pedigrees they are quintessentials made up word woven from the american myth strivers on a mad lurch upward their familial idiosyncrasies pushing and pulling the parents in eleanor henderson's novel by way of contrast are pot smokers dealers glass bong blowers or long departed two of the kids in the cast teddy and jude engage in youthful tomfoolery such as snorting industrial compounds and well stuff so inane that henderson's acknowledgements inform her son that he can do anything but don't ever do any of the stupid things in this book teddy dies not a spoiler but forecast in the book's opening sentence while they are inhaling something out of an air conditioner duct in the freezing vermont night before he did that though teddy had sex with jude's step sister eliza and impregnated her the loss of a beloved friend and brother spurs jude and teddy's senior sibling johnny to form a protective cloister around eliza and nurture her to delivery that's your story it moves from vermont to new york where johnny and eliza already live anyway and situates them in the straight edge movement clustering throughout alphabet city manhattan in the late 1980s a plan is cooked up whereby johnny claims paternity and marries eliza as a legal and tender way of keeping parents grandparents and state agencies from assuming their traditional roles in the lives of confused teen aged moms they form a band the green mountain boys after running afoul of some local toughs back in vermont a van tour is launched second rate venues played and junk food imbibed on the open american road sex spirits and narcotics are eschewed because that's the straight edge credo perhaps at the story's expense there is something monkish about the trio that makes them not very much fun to follow despite their admirable do it yourself musicianship and earnest efforts at hacking a unique path for themselves through the complex new world of maturity they take a shot at the open road another american myth the one that says somewhere in all that vastness there is a place better than where i'm at it was ten o'clock in the morning and it was summer and these were the best years of their lives and they were crossing george washington bridge the hudson a spangled blue ribbon laced through it on the boom box that served as car stereo was the new album by side by side with whom they had just performed behind jude were one thousand copies of their own seven inch record which had just been pressed in haworth new jersey and released on green mountain recordings the label delph had produced out of thin air here that myth is either false or a thing of the past the kids can't seem to escape their parents bouncing between them renewing entanglements yes they've made the big jump to the big town but les jude's pot smoking dad is there along with eliza's overweening mom di ten thousand saints is very nicely written by a woman with all the academic bona fides of today's top publishing recruit but readers may split on whether the talent might have been lavished on something other than a brief bohemian idyll in manhattan of some less than inspiring youths","34":"a really great coming of age tale and homage to new york city there are some non plausible twists but overall a sweet well developed story","35":"in the first few pages i felt i needed to send a few bratty kids and parents to their rooms with no pot for a few months as i progress through the book it is becoming very interesting getting to know eliza brings the book to a new level looking forward to finishing this book","36":"i loved this book i am an eighties girl and was born the same years as the main character i loved the writing and found that i was very connected to the characters i wanted them to make it i did not buy some of the story lines it seemed unreal to me that a long lost father could become so attached to his son and suddenly be willing to drop everything to be around and help him it made for a good story though i would highly recommend this book","37":"i have abandoned this book i didn't care about any of the characters none of their stories were interesting do not recommend","38":"good writing and character development though i found the plot slow in parts and hated the end","39":"i really enjoyed the characters and the way the story flowed nicely written i learned about clean and sober punk rock too","40":"don't really understand all they hype behind this book average wouldn't really recommend","41":"i'm not necessarily fond of coming of age stories but i really liked this one it's a long twisty tale in which all characters are deeply flawed but also extremely easy to like and the pervasive sadness is balanced with humor and ultimately hope i don't know if it is a realistic look at the straight edge punk scene in new york in the 80s but it's definitely an interesting setting and makes for a great story","42":"very well written and engaging story also very sad one of my favorite authors ann patchett was quoted on the book jacket in praise of ten thousand saints so i had to pick it up i'm glad i did","43":"clearly a book by someone with a narrow view of punks i didn't even really feel like she got the feel right meh","44":"eleanor henderson's ten thousand saints is the perfect example of how really excellent fiction is universal i was not at the outset interested in the straight edge music scene of the 1980s an odd off shoot of the punk music scene in fact i knew nothing about it yet the beautiful rendering of henderson's story pulled me into a world i did not know i cared about the novel is plain and simple a story of devotion to family to friendship to music to teenage bonds to love to survival the story opens with two 16 year old boys spending a birthday night doing drugs and only one boy jude survives until the next morning in some ways the novel is as much jude's coming of age story as it is a story of how he grapples with the grief of losing his best friend jude ends up leaving vermont for new york reacquainting himself with his father a pot dealer and his brother who is committed to the straight edge music scene jude falls for both and for eliza the girl his best friend impregnated the night he died this novel chronicles children carving a life for themselves amidst the rubble their parents provided for them it's just a lovely wonderful beautiful rendition of these kids and their relationships to each other their parents their music the writing in this book has been described as muscular i think about it as being terrifically right on the rhythm of the author's sentences the shape of her paragraphs mimic the cadence of the story she doesn't hold back in her description of her characters their setting their emotions or predicaments she brings all of this right to us and insists that we look at all of it as deeply as we can i'm so glad this book was recommended to me it deserves all the praise it is being met with and it's a first novel","45":" i chose this book because the nytime listed it as one of the top 5 books of 2011 when i started it i had my doubts a story about teenage boys who were druggies set in the 80's was not really in my zone of interest but i found myself quickly drawn in and actually finished the book in 3 days there were some superficial coincidences and solutions but the characters and their struggles seemed real to me there were so many conflicts the rejection felt by children who feel abandoned by a parent the clash of generations the struggle to forgive oneself for someone else's death the drama of facing a teenage pregnancy but i think henderson did a good job of showing how rebellious teenagers grow up as they begin see the gray shades among the good and evil characters they have cast in their lives jude's move from drugs to straight edge from hating his father to relying on his father from his alliance with johnny to their break the main conflict in all this is in jude's realizing that the labels he has affixed to these people and his relationships with them do not always stick but mainly i just wanted to keep reading to find out what was going to happen to them all and i am happy to find out that for the most part things turned out ok","46":"fiction with a anti drug anti drinking safe sex pro life message written for high school students","47":" obviously henderson is a strong writer she wrangles a large cast multiple plot complications and yet delivers gorgeous imagery as a punctuation to her narrative but it never feels like the images are coming directly from her rather they come from the characters however and this is a huge 'however' because this book wound up on most best of 2011 lists this is a messy book i could identify two entire subplots that added little to the overall surge of the story and only confused matters i'm an attentive reader yet i was frequently confused about which characters were currently onstage and what their backstory was many of the characters were mere names the author seems proud of her knowledge of male adolescent hygiene or lack of pages of this stuff and for a 'best of' book to sport usages like off of throughout the book is unforgivable upon finishing the book i was struck by the feeling that the author wanted to commemorate the existence of the punk downtown culture in ny in the 80's ok worthy goal but as a result many characters existed to serve the story and not the other way around we have all the usual suspects the potheads the punks the unwashed male teenagers the early victims of aids the pregnant teenage girl most of them musicians we never get the music at all although this is supposed to be a through line that supports the story add in adoptees missing parents birth mysteries that's a lot of weight to carry if the book had been shorter and tighter perhaps some of the main characters could have carried a more focused story i'm sure we'll see that better novel from henderson in the future","48":" i really got absorbed in this book as a teen of the 80's who grew up in a broken home with parents struggling with addiction i related to the characters and conflicts i thought the inclusion of the hardcore youth scene as well as how that lifestyle contrasted with their parents who came of age in the free love 60's was an interesting theme i also thought she paced the growth and change of the characters in a believable way i was greatly impressed in her ability to write in t he voice of a pubescent male teen i definitely recommend this to book anyone who lived on the wild side growing up as they will definitely see themselves in these pages","49":"reads like a ya book but a thoughtful introspective one","50":"narrated by steven kaplan11 hrs and 5 minspublisher's summaryadopted by a pair of diehard hippies restless marginal jude keffy horn spends much of his youth getting high with his best friend teddy in their bucolic and deeply numbing vermont town but when teddy dies of an overdose on the last day of 1987 jude's relationship with drugs and with his parents devolves to new extremes sent to live with his pot dealing father in new york city's east village jude stumbles upon straight edge an underground youth culture powered by the paradoxical aggression of hardcore punk and a righteous intolerance for drugs meat and sex with teddy's half brother johnny and their new friend eliza jude tries to honor teddy's memory through his militantly clean lifestyle but his addiction to straight edge has its own dangerous consequences while these teenagers battle to discover themselves their parents struggle with this new generation's radical reinterpretation of sex drugs and rock 'n' roll and their grown up awareness of nature and nurture brotherhood and loss moving back and forth between vermont and new york city ten thousand saints is an emphatically observed story of a frayed tangle of family members brought painfully together by a death then carried along in anticipation of a new and unexpected life with empathy and masterful skill eleanor henderson has conjured a rich portrait of the modern age and the struggles that unite and divide generations","51":" i received a free signed copy of this book at ala conference this summer in nola i completely forgot about it until i saw it on the ny times best books for 2011 list to be honest it was book that i really did not think i would really like but i decided to give it a try ten thousand saints is about three straight edged teens growing up in the late 80's jude's best friend teddy dies from an overdose on new year's eve he becomes depressed skips school and continues using his mother sends him to live with his pot dealing dad in nyc jude meets up with teddy's half brother johnny who is in a straight edged punk bed jude's step sister eliza is a spoiled rich girl who is hiding her own secrets once i started reading it i could not put it down i would give it 4  1\/2  stars","52":" the introduction of a great number of characters in the beginning of this book who didn't seem very different from each other slowed me down a little and then i got back to it and the plot completely absorbed me and i couldn't put it down there were moments in the writing when i felt that the author was being slightly tell heavy like telling me what the characters were rather than showing me who they were and this bothered me a little bit for a spell but then i got wrapped up in the story and i couldn't really put it down until i was done i was not entirely happy with the ending which transports us from 1987 forward to 2006 and the last show at cbgbs but anyway i'm not sure i could have fit this much vermont and nyc and straightedge into a novel so bravo it was an interesting ride","53":"this is a ferociously written book it captures the energy and spirit of hardcore and the straight edge ideal with piercing accuracy the narrative suffers at times from being a tad overwritten but ten thousand saints stands out as unique novel that brings punk fiction up to an incredibly high literary standard","54":"contemporary american fiction written in an accessible literary form almost always makes it on my to read list unless i deem myself pre emptively uninterested in the subject matter room ann patchett's new novel etc the subject matter of this book was not uninteresting just very much unknown i had only a vague sense of the straight edge movement when i was a teenager i don't think it made many inroads in conservative small town wisconsin and my experiences with the lower east side have only been in its current sanitized state so that aspect of the book i liked as a sociological portrait otherwise it's a good if unremarkable story of secrets and mistakes made between parents and children friends and lovers","55":"i thoroughly enjoyed eleanor henderson's debut novel in fact i devoured it in three days one of my favorite elements was the juxtaposition of city life and rural life the sizzling clash of two cultures our protagonist jude abandons his native vermont town to live with this father in the big apple i can't believe i just called it that as a native new yorker who spent many summers competing at horse shows mostly in vermont i found this special the switch in pace i would experience going from vermont to ny and back was something i felt again in henderson's novel my mother is reading this now and i when we talk about it i care so much for the characters still i talk about them like they are old friends that is a powerful novel it is insightful and intelligent the characters as real as fictional teenagers could be the music pulses off of the pages","56":"i really enjoyed this book characters were deeply flawed and in many ways not likeable however i found myself routing for them anyway beautifully written characters really well developed","57":" this book takes place during the late 80s in new york and vermont jude and his friend teddy are at a party where they meet eliza whose mother is dating jude's estranged father eliza hooks up with teddy and gives him cocaine teddy ends up dying of an overdose after this happens jude moves away from his mom to live with his dad in new york he finds out that eliza is pregnant with teddy's child johnny teddy's half brother learns that eliza is carrying his brother's dead son so he starts hanging out with eliza and jude and they become somewhat of a dysfunctional family johnny is in a popular straight edged punk band and gets jude into the music scene and they travel around playing shows and getting themselves into trouble i had a hard time getting into this book the characters didn't have many redeeming qualities and i couldn't relate to any of it not that that matters but i guess it just didn't grab my attention i was on the edge of giving up on this book but then i talked to some of my fellow book clubbers that read the book and they talked about the ending and then that piqued my interest so i finished it up i also realized that there was a movie based on this book that was just released this month the trailer actually makes it look like the movie would be better than the book so i am very curious to watch that the book wasn't horrible and someone else with different taste might actually enjoy it more than i did","58":"wow i loved this book from the first page to the last i was completely sucked in and couldn't wait to get back to these characters and their world touching on the straight edge hardcore scene in new york in the late 1980's this novel gave you a glimpse of what the kid's of the hippies may have grown up to be it also gave a glimpse of the beginnings of the aids and housing crisis's in new york under mayor koch family and forgiveness in its many forms rang true thoughout and made me long for the days when i was young and living in la during the late 80's when everything seemed so epic and your friends were your family anything was possible i think this is going to be a big hit 2 2 15i just read they made a movie and it was a big hit at sundance why am i not surprised http www imdb com title tt3397754","59":" i can't say that i enjoyed this book as much as i pushed myself to finish coming of age stories based in new york tend to be my favorite but this left so much to be desired there was no connection to the characters insufferable every single one of them i've been reading listening to many discussions on character likability lately not that the characters are 'nice' or 'good' necessarily but that readers develop an emotional attachment to characters or they see familiar qualities in themselves that being said not with this book","60":" this is the best contemporary novel i've read in years i dreaded reading it the new york times review was absurdly congratulatory which riled up the contrarian in me the subject matter is straight edge punk generally i hate books focused on music because the author tries to rely on feelings he or she has about music that don't translate on the page i only read the book because the review said it started in 1987 the first year of my yet to be published novel it turns out that the only day in 1987 is new year's eve the rest of the action takes place in 1988 after reading the novel via audiobook narration is ok nothing great i still don't care about straight edge punk i skimmed the wikipedia article and got bored but the novel is so incredibly well written that it doesn't matter what you think about the music the plot is convoluted and a bit melodramatic but it's written with an insistent energy that is truly remarkable henderson is flawless when describing scenes using only a few words to catch an image or a mood her dialog is pitch perfect and the dramatic arch feels like a novel too often someone who writes this well doesn't understand what a novel really is this is a masterpiece no wonder it took her nine years to write","61":"this was the rare book that i only read in bed i'd look at it in the morning consider putting in my bag for my trolley ride to work and then leave it why because it was heavy literally i enjoyed reading this but it was too long and i honestly couldn't tell you what it was really about jude and teddy smoke as much pot as they can and get high on weird things in burlington vt circa 1985 which is oddly named something else though it is obviously burlington then some bad shit happens and a new person enters their lives there's trouble with local drug dealers depression a move to nyc to hook up with a brother and lost father and the entry into the straightedge scene all of the prose was beautiful and lots of interesting individual moments and ideas were captured but going back to the basics of story writing in which a character is introduced goes through a change and learns to deal with that change this book lacked what actually happened to any of these people did they learn from their mistakes most of which were making too big of a deal of the small things that did happen to them what was the point","62":"the structure of the book is beautifully arranged and the plot keeps the reader interested but the writing itself never rises above the level of workmanlike a good story but not a great book","63":"i have no earthly idea what to say about this book it's been so long since i've read any adult fiction that i don't think i could accurately judge let's say that i enjoyed it even though i found it confusing","64":"http legalmamareviews blogspot com","65":"i found himself liking this book but not understanding why i liked it the characters were flawed but likable the plot was not particularly complex but one that i enjoyed watching unfold it was a coming of age story with flashes of 1980s new york the suffocation of small town living for some and the reality of kids raising themselves","66":"ny times top 10 of the year i don't get it it's intriguing and well written but not awe inspiring or particularly moving i didn't care about any of the characters 3 stars might be too much 2 5","67":"jude and teddy are childhood friends growing up in vermont in the late 1980s they do nearly everything together--cut school take drugs steal listen to and play hardcore music and dream of a real life away from what they know teddy's mother has just disappeared leaving him to fend for himself and turn to jude and his family for support on new year's eve teddy and jude meet up with eliza the daughter of jude's father's girlfriend and they take her to a party in search of fun and drugs although not necessarily in that order the party turns their lives upside down in more ways than one and after they put eliza back on a train to new york city teddy dies of an accidental drug overdose overcome with grief over the death of his best friend yet unable to express himself jude heads to new york and finds johnny teddy's straight edge half brother straight edge kids swear off drugs alcohol sex and often meat but follow the hardcore punk scene when they find out that eliza is pregnant with teddy's child from their encounter at the party the night he died johnny sees this as a chance to form a real family one that has escaped him for so long yet he must deal with the demons inside himself as well as jude's jealousy on so many different levels this is a book about finding yourself and realizing what makes a family about the hardcore music scene of the late 1980s and the changing demographics of new york city and about trying to avoid making the same mistakes your parents made i thought this book was pretty fantastic eleanor henderson created some truly memorable characters and gave each surprising depth which made me feel truly invested in what happened to them there were a few times i worried the book would veer into overly dramatic plot twists but each time henderson remained true to the characters and her story and i was grateful for that no one is infallible in this book much as in life and that is what made the story so appealing to me--although i couldn't necessarily identify with all of the characters and what they were going through i felt as if all of the characters were realistic particularly to the places and time in which the book took place i flew through this book and of course i'm sorry i finished it so quickly because i want more but i look forward to seeing what henderson comes up with next","68":"i wasn't stimulated by this book it was slow at some parts and i didn't feel connected to the protagonist maybe that was the author's intent","69":"interesting premise and glowing reviews led me to check this out i liked it more than some readers and less than others but it's been about 3 weeks since i finished it the details are already hazy and i haven't recommended it to anyone nor did i rush to my goodreads page to write a review","70":" when i saw a description involving the les in the 80s and hardcore punk well i knew i had to read this and i enjoyed this but i have a lot of thoughts and can't help but wonder if when you know a lot about something it makes reading a fictional story about that much harder to do i found myself questioning the time details the time line and the locations was venus records really on st marks in 1987 or was it on w 8th hardcore shows at abc no rio in 1987 i don't think so but in the end these details don't really matter and it's part of the fictional process in fact before i started to get hung up on the details i was excited that it was so accurate that abc no rio was mentioned and that this went beyond the generic surface of the time so that said this starts with two young boys in vermont partying celebrating and then one of them od's on this one last night jude meets his step sister and she ends up pregnant with his dead best friends child jude crashes hard and falls into a pit of drugs and despair and ends up going to nyc where he falls in with his friends brother who is straight edge jude gets swept up in the hardcore sxe scene they start a band he turns his life around and jude and johnny take eliza under their care in honor of teddy's child at times it's a bit cliche and yet it's also quite believable this is well researched and the setting of the late 80s in the lower east side is very real krishna consciousness cbgbs matinees tompkins square tent city squats drugs riots this book hits so close to home in many ways or at least overlaps on a time and place in my life that i can relate to that i have been writing a review in my head for days and could continue to to do so for some time which probably means that this book will stay under my skin and in my mind for quite some time my only real complaint is that at times it's hard to follow as the writing style with switch time place and person in one passage one minute it's direct and the next it's vague it will start out giving you the ending then fill in the story the constant changing pace can be odd but much like my jolt with details i could move through it the time period is very well researched but i suspect just that it's researched not lived which is fine but also what left me feeling slightly jarred at times i could critique this and that and ask for more here and there but in the end i enjoyed it 3 5 stars","71":" i figured out this book about 30 pages in so i wouldn't call it great it was a coming of age story but not the normal kid doesn't fit in but finds friends then it's all ok there is sex drugs and rock and roll to spare but very little substance very twisted plot though step sister sleeps with step brother's best friend and gets pregnant friend dies in a drug overdose girl marries the brother of her baby's daddy but falls for step brother girl goes to live with mom's boyfriend and then his ex wife mom of her step brother and on and on but there wasn't any excitement any plot really they travel start a band but don't really ever do anything after 400 pages that is beyond a bore","72":"jude and his best friend teddy do a bunch of drugs because they're restless and have fairly terrible parents until teddy dies of an overdose jude and everyone else in the book spend the next year trying to atone find meaning and connect it's an interesting premise the writing is good at times lyrical and jude's crooked path to adulthood if melodramatic is believable one star off for the irritating epilogue and for several loose ends that didn't contribute","73":" at this time of the year the beginning of a new year my mind is usually a mess creativity disappears behind some invisible depression that 20mg of celexa can do nothing for but this book did something for that it provided a wonderful escapism from work from other negative thoughts that usually impede any day from being a good day and i thank mrs henderson for that i don't think this book was a life changer for me but more of a mirror as to what the ole days were like while soia and supertouch graced the stage at the lost horizon on sunday afternoons it also made me think a lot about the students who sit in my classroom that could or do have parents as messed up as the parents in this book yikes i've had much more empathy these past few days who cares about csap some essay assignment for me or some math assignment life is much more important none of these kids had childhoods i never grew up that fast or maybe i have yet to grow up but i'm lucky thank you mom and dad i could go on and on but i don't know if this is the time or place the book involves three main characters caught in a web of aids teen pregnancy parental neglect experimentation and straight edge hardcore between nyc and vermont everyone's life is a mess they come together not because of fate or because of similar taste in music but because the death of a friend due to a day of huffing turpentine through victoria's secret panties then doing some coke and finally inhaling some freon shit and it's all downhill from there just read it put on a judge record enjoy it i don't know","74":"i read this because of it's portrayal of straight edge hardcore and the alternative scene in new york city on the lower east side in the 1980s on that level it was somewhat interesting the story wasn't the most exciting overall and the characters weren't that interesting but i enjoyed the book as an exercise in seeing how subculture is used as a setting for a novel","75":" i didn't feel this book set in the '80s in vermont and new york this story follows several main characters including jude eliza and johnny and their struggles during their coming of age during the era facing issues such as drugs sex and rock n' roll we see how the characters cope while the premise could have been interesting the story was too unfocused there was so much going on without enough emphasis on any one thing such as what does jude's potential fetal alcohol syndrome diagnosis really mean if the story is never going to follow up with it why even mention it i think this story could have been a lot better with the work of an editor parsing out the extra and helping to focus on less issues","76":"very good book about teenagers drugs straight edge no drugs alcohol cigarettes vegan homosexual death pregnancy adoption heavy metal bands nyc etc jude is named from the 2nd to last book of the bible behold the lord cometh with ten thousands of his saints to execute judgment upon all i learned lots about tattoos homeless etc excellent ending but a bit of a hard read due to the teen's problems and their parents' problems","77":"really enjoyed reading about punk st mark's place era nyc story and characters were interesting too","78":"i'm mystified as to why this was chosen as one of the top 10 books of 2011 by the nyt it's good but it wears out its welcome pretty quickly with its we're rebel kids and we're having a tough time growing up schtick this is above average coming of age material but it's not anything amazing i think it's kind of telling that i actually thought the characters of the parents of these kids were more interesting than the kids themselves just think of this as sort of the punk rock forrest gump aids tompkins square park riots cbgbs","79":"like this book brought back some memories as it takes place in the late 80's on the lower east side of nyc an area i hung out in for a while interesting characters u0026amp story just wish the ending was more defined","80":"i really enjoyed this novel it has so much humor and so much heart henderson is a wonderful writer and i'm already anxiously awaiting her second book","81":"hb the story of the perils of tainted youth and their drug use so far i probably will not like it","82":" maybe it's a stretch to put this book in the historical fiction category however it's set in the mid to late 1980's in new york city and based on how things have changed significantly since this time period i learned many things i did not already know such as how little known aids was in the early 80's or that there was a musical movement called straight edge where the participants did not do any drugs alcohol or even other more normal vices like eating meat and having sex with girls i did not know that this group of enthusiasts would get beaten up for wearing punk t shirts that later generations would wear ironically i learned something about a period of time i knew nothing about previously i enjoyed the writing but i didn't connect with the characters very much","83":"the characters are interesting and well developed this is a good exploration and comparison of maturity level decision making coming of age ish type traits between generations the kids grew up too fast lacked any significant parental role models and were thrust into adulthood and all the pitfalls the adults didn't have it together and kept their own sets of secrets lies and betrayals","84":"an enjoyable read if not a thrilling or particularly impressive one straight edge kids in '87 traveling between nyc and vermont probably made more interesting because of my familiarity with both those locales esp during that time frame i'd say she captured the time and culture well extra points for a good ending which is so hard to pull off","85":"the 80's straight edge scene is a backdrop to this story jude and teddy are best friends the friendship broken only by the unexpected and shattering death of teddy jude goes to pieces his relationship with his independently thinking mother absent but loving father and petulant sister g","86":" i was drawn to this book by the young characters' immersion in the straight edge movement i expected intense internalized and externalized drama between the clash of frantic desires and emotions that come with being an angst teenager and the strict daily moralities of asceticism and renunciation preached by straight edgers i mean how punk is that i thought the book was full of vitality and sensuality describing scenes and human interaction with such sensual textures but as the book progressed it seemed to lose these qualities i did not see why the characters bought into the straight edge scene i found the dialogue to grow stale and their moralizing seemed totally out of character","87":"this book was a roller coaster of emotions and problems problems that were created at the start of the book and only solved near the end of the book one problem stemmed off another one problem led to another problem but soon enough all the problems were solved and that's really the aspect of the book that i enjoyed the amount of problems racking up like a debt and slowly getting paid off or solved one at a time i thoroughly enjoyed the book it really showed me a type of life that i had no idea existed the whole straight edge scene was something that i had no idea about until i read this book it was very informative and showed me that not just a couple of lifestyles exist there are people that live on the edge a connection that i made between ten thousand saints and a book i read earlier in the year by the name of about a boy was the importance of a father figure jude and marcus both had a father figure that really wasn't there at a point but later on in the book their father figure either returned or they got a new father figure a father figure is important within the life of a young man to teach him the ropes of being a man and they both got one at a critical point in their lives","88":"note that this review will contain a few while not too heavy spoilers i had initially picked up the novel upon hearing that it would be made into a film of course on impulse i bought it without thoroughly reading the summary it's a bad habit of mine it's a movie well it's gotta be awesome i've lost a lot of money that way and while i couldn't say this was a life changing book it's stayed with me for quite some time now in all honesty i don't think this review'll be useful because i really liked the book for some reason i don't know why if you asked me to rate it on impulse i'd say four but after thinking three is better one thing i find interesting is the time that this book took place in in the 80s and i haven't read too many books of that time period also because of the theme maybe majority of the time i avoid books in the music scene because about half of it is about how music flows through me etc etc but this one stressed more on their lives which i liked another point the scene the straight edge scene it's a subculture of a subculture and that i think for lots of people is an interesting perspective to read from i doubt there are many other books written about that from what else i have read so far the punk rock scene was portrayed as wild and rabid and drug addled and etc but this isn't but the sequence of events were just what as a reader i think it's a given that we should have at least a taste of what's going to happen but for most part i was running blindly a lot of little pieces of it ended up useless like for example the revelation of jude's fas and all the stressing on his potentially alcoholic biological mother was just confusing i was actually expecting for every sub plot to end but a lot of it was left hanging the epilogue too i also thought that teddy's death was a tad slight unneeded characters well i don't actually find them that interesting nothing particularly special their relationship yeah it's a messed up family i especially liked johnny further into the story when i eventually found out he was gay gradually and gradually and gradually despite its very smooth flow i was just all oh oh wait oh woah then jude and eliza were average not the things each of them went through but each character individually so overall this is a book that whether you like it or not will really depend on you and your taste i recommend you try","89":"this was a great book don't do drugs new york in the 80s sounds terrible","90":"an awesome book that shows the hardship of living in a disfunctional family","91":"eleanor henderson's powerful and painfully beautiful bildungsroman ten thousand saints follows nine months in the life of adoptee druggie turned straight edge jude keffy horn the novel is set in late 1980s northern vermont and nyc while i can't speak to what it was like to be a teenager in nyc in 1987 i can speak to what it was like to be one in upstate ny across the lake from henderson's lintonburg burlington and henderson nailed it henderson covers a lot of ground in this novel addiction teen pregnancy adoption aids and yet her narrative never feels forced her characters are well drawn and complex each one loved and hated in turn basically her characters are flawed human and what this book is about is these characters the love they have and how they express or don't their gratitude for it it's a great book i hope you will read it","92":"i loved this book finished it last night and still thinking about it can't wait to see what she writes next","93":"i enjoyed this book it's set in the 1980s so all very familiar and well drawn it's a good story and the author has a wonderful way of trusting the reader to fill in gaps even to inhabit her characters' hearts and minds beautiful language","94":"original youthful well written details of the lower east side in the late 80s were fun but some characters were blurry and others felt like caricatures really terrible parenting all around","95":"this was a good coming of age story taking place in the late 80's in nyc my heart went out to the main characters struggling to find themselves amidst those crazy times i think i was more connected to them because i have a 19 yr old as a parent we watch our kids struggle and no matter how much we want to make everything all right for them some things they just have to figure out for themselves","96":"for those who enjoy reading about the underbelly of society and the ridiculous expectations people have of babies saving them and giving meaning to their empty lives this is a great book i'm not one of them","97":"3 5 stars a decent character driven coming of age book set in the 1980's and told from various points of view i just didn't really connect with any of the characters however it was very well written and kept me interested","98":"this story mostly focuses on three teenagers and their dysfunctional parents and their initiation into the hardcore straightedge scene in late '80s nyc and rural vermont i loved it up until the end i know the author wanted to avoid a neatly wrapped up happy ever after ending but the resolution was hollow and empty and a little implausible and sad ok maybe i'm just a sappy sentimentalist","99":"realistic fully developed characters populate this heartfelt coming of age story set in the late 80s yes i'm a sucker for a good nyc read not to mention one dealing with the complexities of sex drugs and rock and roll but this one is worth reading","100":"when i read the summary and found straight edge written my hopes plummeted into my bowels i like the sxe movement about as much as i like peta which is zil to none i find any movement that has such militant mind sets and no room for expansion of human growth to be cults which essentially sxe is the character of johnny did little to dispel my belief about the people that follow this movement set in vermont new york in the late 80's during the birth of aid's epidemic and nearing the death of the punk scene jude johnny and eliza come together after the death of teddy brother friend father each character equally lost trying to find themselves in different life altering situations i like the details about new york and the village i just had a hard time remembering the smaller characters whom affected the central characters the story jumps around too much and you are left trying to remember how this person affects the story point blank it's a dull read and the only sole character i liked was jude who had any redeeming qualities","101":"for a first work by the author i think it was ambitious and a good read but i do not think it is a great book it held my interest although i felt it went on too long having lived close to the lower east side in the 80's it was fun to relive a lot of familiar places interspersed in the book","102":"great book but i didn't like the ending can't explain why in great detail without giving too much away it seems that the author was just trying to be too cute at that very end and asking us to figure out something she should have found a way to tell us it's something arbitrary and since she tells us other things she should have told us this as well","103":" i was recently accused of reading only non fiction although the accuser was confused perhaps by the number of documentaries on my netflix list when i do read fiction it is most often from the mystery section most contemporary fiction focuses on dysfunctional families and individuals who make bad choices because of their messy upbringing blah so what unless the story is drawn out in a grand shakespearean style see parade's end these narratives are not compelling to me most of the protagonists of mysteries from agatha christie to philip marlowe have no families the detective is an individual who may have a gambling problem a drinking problem a \"woman\" problem or a hair trigger temper but who does not have a conflicted mother or a neglectful father or a bipolar brother at least not that the reader knows about ten thousand saints is another dysfunctional people story wrapped up in punk straight edge trivia a young adult novel for people old enough to have experienced the 1980s i myself don't remember video games being available on st marks but that might be a detail lost in the fog of past time or maybe that wasn't what i was looking for at the time the writing zips along but is also sloppy if two characters had skated the steps of the rec center \"but never been inside \" how could one of them two pages later remember performing in a play in that same building and which of these details if any matter if you like the dysfunctional fractured family thing and the coming of age thing and a story populated by old hippies young punks one jock and a couple yuppies appeals to your 80s nostalgia go for it i'll be downloading some 1930s noir to my kindle","104":"interesting characters and a very strong sense of time and place feels like a love letter to the straight edge scene in the late 80s","105":"this is by far one of my favorite books of all time i heard it will be released in theaters and i'm so excited to see hailee steinfeld and asa butterfield play the two leads","106":" the gritty pre guiliani manhattan of the mid eighties is the backdrop to this fierce coming of age novel as a troubled young boy from vermont finds himself in the burgeoning hard core music scene playing with traditional elements of the buildungsroman henderson explores family loyalty and sacrifice in a unique way bringing to life through her characters the sights and sounds of a city seeming to struggle to grow up as well eschewing easy cliches about the hard core and straight edge movements in favor of more propulsive character driven dramas henderson builds a portrait of a subculture and a city that has resonance far beyond its borders captivating","107":"well written and intriguing family drama a lot of coming of age components liked the story and characters","108":"this novel's long early sequence set in the east village of the late 1980s is fascinating and seemingly authentic but the story wanders into thickets of ancillary plots road trips and implausible melodrama and generally goes on way too long","109":"i liked this book because it was set in a place that is very different from the society that i live in and i could explore a different part of our world","110":"this book is different to what i usually read but i did love it i read this book because it is coming out as a film with my favourite actor playing one of the main roles so i decided to give it a go i liked the characters especially jude","111":"eleanor henderson's novel \"ten thousand saints\" starts with a condensed version of the one crazy night premise from which entire films are built it's a lazy new year's eve day of smoking huffing drinking and snorting for teddy and jude the inseparable teen aged besties are skateboarders with next to no social currency teddy's mom has skipped town and he's probably been lied to that his dad is dead jude was adopted and lives with his hippie mom who is a glassblower and his kind of bitchy barely younger sister his adoptive father ditched out years ago and lives in new york city where he is hot and heavy with a former ballerina who has a cocaine curious high school aged daughter eliza eliza is planning her first visit to the boys' small vermont town to meet the not quite step brother the trio ends up at a party where jude's mouth gets him in trouble with some older kids while he's getting bound and urine stained teddy is in the bathroom having his first go round with both coke and sex later that night he will take a few puffs off something poisonous following jude's lead and die meanwhile somewhere in eliza's lady parts sperm meets egg jude goes a little crazy first drowning himself in weed then pissing off a dealer and high tailing it for new york city finding teddy's older brother and adopting a straight edge lifestyle complete with a homemade x tattoo on his hand preggers eliza joins the threesome and develops a faux relationship with one of the boys this all turns into a portrait of nyc's straight edge scene the vegan no drugs no drinking no caffeine group that is making its way through this sub set of the rock 'n' roll scene while also touching on the topic of aids this book is ... okay ish it's a lot of back and forth from vermont to new york and back to vermont and then new york travel always seems so unnecessary in novels just something to do to characters to throw them into a new situation plus there are some weird turns jude learns he might have fetal alcohol syndrome though it doesn't play into anything the band goes on a half assed tour teddy's older brother takes up the issue of new york city's proposed curfew i don't know i'd watch this movie on a lazy saturday afternoon and it wouldn't result in self loathing over the wasted day but mostly it was just okay","112":" i was attracted to this book because of the backdrop of the hardcore straight edge scene something i was never officially a part of but with which i had very close affiliations i enjoyed this book the writing is good and i particularly appreciated the character development natural dialogue and what felt like an honest depiction of many types of human relationships the countless references to hardcore punk bands sometimes felt too forced and the generalization of kids in the scene was superficial sometimes i felt like i was reading the sxe answer to the official preppy handbook still and all i dug it","113":"a beautifully written book this is wonderful literature my quibble and this may be completely personal i wasn't overly attached to the characters also the ending was not satisfying for me but i won't elaborate for fear of giving something away the time period 1987 brought back a lot of memories and that element is finely drawn and well researched the storyline certainly kept me going as did the very effective writing","114":"i have a lot of thoughts as some one from the edges of straight edge culture as someone who recently fled burlington aka lintonburg vermont but really i am in love with this book i lived the subcultural bits loved reading her incredibly accurate descriptions of burlington and knowing the exact places she was talking about i was fascinated that she brought in krishnacore which always felt like an obscure off shoot of an already obscure subculture the characters were earn and complex and real to the kids i met if i hadn't spent the past 30 out of 48 hours working i would have finished it sooner and i know my work predominance suffered today because i was able you read this on my phone it was weird reading a book and knowing the cast already i think ethan hawke will capture the essence of les perfectly same with emile hirsch as johnny i just have a really important question for eleanor henderson why did you change the name of burlington but keep literally everything else the same i don't get it she kept the neighboring towns the state route numbers the name of the newspaper the location of the actual open to this day all ages music venue all of it just answer me eleanor","115":" while reading this book i rolled my eyes so many times they almost fell back into my head though i found the characters for the most of it unlikable is that a word i hope so and the plot and actions of these characters slightly pretentious it was an extremely compelling read all i could think about was reading this book and following their journey and that's probably why i read it even through the sections that felt like fillers in a matter of days the problem with coming of age fiction mostly lies with the pompousness of its lead characters and that was no exception in this book how they all thought they were so grown up yet were so consumed in their own naivety actually bothered me a lot view spoiler i liked johnny at first he was cool clean a guy you could get along with but he turned out to be the most overwhelmingly conceited character of the lot eliza shut up just stop you embody everything i detest in teenage girls my own peers spoilt thinks she's untouchable just plain ignorant jude was alright towards the end i guess at first i wanted to hit him over the head with his own bong initially the straight edge jude made me want to stab needles in my eyes but he was the only likable character in the end he was the only one you rooted for and god the incestuous behavior was way too fucked up jude having sex with his friend's wife while she's pregnant with her gay husband's dead brother's baby please i can't handle this also what was the ending can somebody please explain did eliza give up the baby in the end did jude and eliza keep the baby for themselves and this was a 18 year flashforward to them picking up their son from a gig i don't understand it didn't tie up nicely with the rest of the story view spoiler hide spoiler i adored the romance of the new york setting but would've preferred a bit less vermont towards the end and a bit more of the on the road type things i felt it delved too deeply into other subjects yet didn't quite capture the touring aspect it's well worth a read for the cinematic description and if stupidity doesn't affect you so much it was an excellently written novel hide spoiler","116":"started out better than the end i am glad i read it but it was long in parts good details and characters kept me engaged","117":"ten thousand saints is an amazing coming of age story based in the 1980's can't wait for the film","118":"i enjoyed the read but felt like the end was abrupt and somewhat confusing for me","119":"this book showed up on a number of best of lists for 2011 but apparently it wasn't for me i was bored the story was fine the writing was ok maybe if i was older and could remember the straight edge movement then the author's research could be better appreciated but as far as 'coming of age' stories go i think there are better ones out there","120":" approached this one with a little skepticism about its milieu and its characters how would i like a book where one of the three characters i meet in the beginning dies so young would henderson be able to give me my own nyc in the 80's without too much sensationalism started it knocked it off in two days even with hours of work running interference i liked the kids even though i got impatient with them sometimes enjoyed their journey the biggest surprise for me in the book though was the parents what do you know spoiler alert even messed up careless stoner parents whose relationships were too casual to be sustained can step up to be good enough a real pleasure nicely written takes its characters with just the right mix of seriousness and humor","121":"full of rich descriptions of 1980s new york city this book zeroes in sometimes brilliantly on a group of american teens before briefly powerfully zooming out ultimately it was that trick that swept me off my feet","122":"i am surprised to find out that this book ended up better than i anticipated because a the beginning was slow and b the writing style was tedious the ending made my rating a four instead of a three as originally planned the characters were memorable and the story was well told read this book i'm glad i did","123":"this is one of those books that i've read that i will probably forget i didn't really retain anything profound from this novel it kind of just flew over my head i didn't find anything particularly appealing or life changing i'm not saying that a novel should have any of those factors but it's almost like the book was transparent i could easily predict the end and the pathway of each of the characters nevertheless henderson does a great job of establishing atmosphere throughout the novel not just in terms of imagery but building emotion as well when jude enters new york the author really transports the reader there even more so when jude comes onto the straight edge scene personally visiting new york in real life can be a overwhelming experience you get a sense of the concrete jungle lifestyle and how busy and productive the whole city is i thought that that was the thing that stood out the most in the entire novel","124":"a decent read but subject too dark for light reading","125":"althought this is a well written novel it was not a favorite of mine perhaps it hit too close to home having grown up in new york and seeing how young people get into drugs and the tragic outcomes that result","126":"i might have liked it better if the author had passion for her characters she seemed meh on them so i did too meh","127":"tten thousand saints the edgy debut novel by eleanor henderson portrays the dark and painful journey of jude keffy horn through his troubled teen years jude and his best friend teddy mcnicholas are misfits who live in lintonberg \"the biggest city in vermont \" jude is the red headed hyperactive teenager with attention deficit disorder who is \"good looking enough\" and teddy is dark enough to be passed off as jewish arab mexican or greek who has a \"delicate frame\" and wears duct taped air jordans tit's the late 80s and both the parents and the children in this story are deeply flawed jude's mother harriet is an aging hippie who makes bongs and pipes to pay the bills and teddy's mother queen bee is an overweight drunken mess who has been known to disappear now and then jude's father lester was a master pot grower before leaving for nyc when jude was nine teddy's father is dead he thinks eliza is the troubled young girl who propels the story forward t jude and teddy shuffle through their days scavenging for drug money jude probes a finger into the coin return slots of pay phones and vending machines and hits up his mom harriet or his sister prudence it's mostly jude who wants drugs teddy just wants a bus ticket out but ultimately they both want to leave lintonberg teddy wants to join his brother johnny who left home at 16 for nyc and is now tattooing full time and playing in a straight edge band \"straight edge kids don't fornicate \" one character says \"don't smoke don't drink don't breathe but the music's pretty wicked \"tthe turning point of the narrative takes place on new year's eve when lester's girlfriend's daughter eliza arrives from the city to spend time with jude after a night of partying with jude and eliza teddy dies of an overdose when jude recovers from the ordeal he escapes to nyc where he meets up with teddy's brother johnny in an effort to leave his past behind and escape the guilt he feels over teddy's death he embraces the straight edge culture and hooks up once again with eliza who may be carrying teddy's child he struggles to find meaning to sort it all out and to do the right thing thenderson delves deeply into the nyc 80s scene and creates a vividly detailed snapshot of that time period that is a painful but compelling read she nails the straight edge subculture down to every last piece of hardcore music as well as the alienation and rudderlessness of a generation while at the same time paying tribute to the people who lived through it and enlightening those of us who were on the fringes tin lesser hands this cast of misfits and flawed characters would be lost at sea there would seem to be no points on the horizon to fix one's eyes in order to bring the boat home safely and yet under henderson's masterful skill they do survive and meet the next day this is a riveting read and i highly recommend it","128":"i struggled with this book i'd say it was my least enjoyable read of 2014 in fact there's very little i liked about it the main reason for this is probably due to my having limited knowledge of new york in the 80s or at any other time or punk culture or straight edge which i'd never heard of so much of it was lost on me to begin with but i got to the end of the book albeit by skim reading much of it as others have said there is an awful lot going on it is as though the author had a list of 'things that went on in 80s new york' and decided that all of them had to go into this story it led to a confusing plot that went in many directions all at once and i lost what the main gist of the story was there were too many characters to follow sadly i didn't find myself liking or caring about any of them i also got bored with the narration which often came in large chunks that didn't really add much to the story hence the skim reading i didn't really realise what the main theme of the book was before i started reading i felt the blurb on the cover was misleading or i doubt i would have read it but it did give me an insight into a time period that i was unaware of before so it isn't all negative","129":"one of my favorite books of the year","130":"insightful hardcore and truthful writing if you can handle the thoughts of teenage boys growing up in the time of cbgbs aids and astor place's heyday of the 80s you will revel in eleanor henderson's portrayal of suicide pregnancy and hare krisna straight edge defiance i listened to this book on audible and i would highly recommend it the only thing i didn't care for in this story was the title which seems strangely wilted and weak compared to the rest of the writing","131":"i liked this book and recognized pieces of my own teenage friends in the hardcore punk and straight edge characters though i was a teenager in the '90s not the late '80s still it could have used some editing after roaring through the first two thirds of the book the story started to drag a bit by page 325 i just wanted to get to the end","132":"this book made franzen look warm u0026amp fuzzy at first bloomed into more than was expected startling u0026amp beautiful sometimes challenging reminiscent of angels in america u0026amp rent but with that straight edge that's unexpected","133":"ok but hard to relate to","134":"definitely a story i had to read this before going to college as summer reading and i read it on the drive over so obviously not the best framing for the book in that context it was annoyingly preachy but beyond that the story was just inconsistent in pace the beginning is slow and the ending is jittery and fast it's sad though if that's what you're looking for","135":"i thought this was just an ok book there were just some things i couldnt find believable or relate to","136":"was definitely interesting but by the end i was wondering what was the point it ended abruptly","137":"ok starts off pretty good but storyline starts to drag a bit","138":"a beautiful book","139":" i had trouble believing the author was there at the places during the time this book took place in 1987 and 1988 some of it felt awkward and forced especially at the beginning i also thought some of the drug use in particular the huffing of freon was gratuitous and something that could have been more effectively written but in the end i found other reasons to love this book at times the the writing is stupendously beautiful and her grasp of human nature especially the teenage mind natural it also didn't hurt that i feel a certain degree of nostalgia for the era the ending left me nearly breathless and i wanted more than anything to hear her name very moving 1 2 2012","140":"extended family saga went on and on interesting though","141":"it was a little hard for me to keep the two teenaged boy characters straight in the beginning but eventually i figured out whose family was whose once that was sorted out i found the book quite engaging and well written i'm not sure there was any one particular character with whom i could relate but they all seemed believable for fiction i would recommend this book to others","142":"although i learned a lot about the straight edge punk movement in the 80s i found the characters and parts of the story very tedious","143":"i loved this book i stayed up far too late finishing it i just could not put it down every sentence seemed necessary the writing is beautiful but never gets in the way of the story you feel for every character it was such a satisfying story and it blows goon squad out of the water in my opinion highly highly recommended","144":"well i must say this book took some getting used to first i thought i dove into a depressive text about teenage crises and deeply saddening dramas i however emerged realizing this book was filled with depths about religion social stigmas identity and individuals true quest to find themselves all while coming of age during a time where social stigmas where at an all time high it was tough to get through only because of my own personal preference of having authors answer for me right away what's this all about but definitely took deep twists that was worth the wait very well written and touches the core of some of the challenges in the fabric of our country","145":"really enjoyed this have always had mixed thoughts about the straight edge movement i thought the passages about hardcore as a whole were just great kind of disappointed henderson has beaten me to it looking for more good stuff from this author read some on kindle finished on long drive to fl panhandle","146":" i was expecting something closer to the taqwacores and freaks and revelations but ten thousand saints doesn't focus as much on the straight edge scene as it does on jude's search for love and the competition for who will carry on teddy's memory why the author chose to rename burlington is unknown because it's pretty clear that lintonburg is the stand in seriously when you mention the ferry to plattsburg you're not exactly hiding the locale still this look at the grittier side the one the university students don't see could be in any small medium size new england city getting high is the escape until jude's birthday aka new year's eve when teddy does just a little too much and dies during the freezing night he dies having left a little piece of himself behind in the form of eliza's baby thus setting the rest of the book in motion our introduction to the straight edge life no drugs no meat no sex krishna etc isn't as in depth as it could have been and while we catch glimpses of jude and johnny's dedication there's no sense of struggle as they try to fit their lives in to this world the music is likewise less defined although cbgb's gets name dropped a lot along with other mid 80s icons like thompkins square park and st mark's place the epilogue set during the last few nights of cbgb's existence in 2006 follows the current trend of wrapping up enough of the plot to satisfy readers when the real ending several pages before would allow us to imagine our own endings it's a trend i'd love to see stopped arc provided by publisher","147":"good book easy quick read the author is good at leading the reader into the next chapter i gave it three starts because it just didn't jump out at me as fantastic","148":"beautifully written set in vt and nyc in the 1980's against the backdrop of the straight edge punk community interesting read","149":" a friend recommended this book to me i am not sure that i will be recommending it to anyone i will keep it in my mind in case i come across someone who might be interested i would rather they read the goon squad that book was similar but better written i do like the ideas and some of the storyline i loved les and the relationship he has with the daughter of his girlfriend i think he came across as a real person not just a character in a novel i appreciate the look into nyc and the years of lost youth and aids becoming a huge fear in our country all in all a lot of issues were brought up in one book i wish it was a little more defined the thing is when you are a troubled teenager life is not defined maybe i liked it better than i thought hard to review","150":"read this in about 3 days i had no idea this straight edge world existed and it was just short of information overload and kept me interested the whole way through","151":"this book was a little rough but overall i enjoyed it it was not what i was expecting i expected more time in nyc but i enjoyed the look into the 1980s i really liked the character development i didn't really like or relate to any of the characters and i think that that was my biggest issue with the book i liked the background information on thompkins square park straight edged philosophy and punk but i couldn't get into the characters' heads","152":"after my time in ny but this book captured places and an energy that made me remember the '80s ah youth","153":"great story the writer writes about punk rock in a believable way the characters were strong and flawed 31 2 stars","154":"i picked this book because of a recommendation on the cover from the writer ann patchett she wrote that it was the best thing i've read in a long time i agree the author captured the characters really well and made the unbelievable believable","155":"yeah i wasn't really convinced by eleanor henderson's too long debut novel set in new york city and southern vermont in the early 1980s and starring a bunch of teenagers who at various points lose their virginity smoke a lot of weed huff freon have a baby get abandoned by their parents die live in alphabet city squats get aids get tattoos get in fights and for a big chunk of the book play in a straight edge band and espouse the whole don't drink smoke fuck also here eat meat lifestyle sounds promising right and the nytbr gave it great front page review but really the whole thing the tone the dialogue the characters and their actions seemed dangerously close to a ya book like i kinda expected johnny and ponyboy to stroll onto the scene at any moment also i didn't buy several key relationships which provide the motivation for much of the narrative and so obviously i didn't believe much of the narrative also the settings felt forced especially in the evill basically it felt like henderson did a lot research about the era but no way did she live it 2 5 stars","156":"i picked this up because it took place in nyc in the 80's so i thought it would be quite nostalgic it was although the scene it focused on was not mine the premise is different and was well executed a quick enjoyable despite sad subject matter events read","157":" henderson manages to take a scene and make it universal by populating it with real people whose virtues and foibles become recognizable as our own this is not simply a story of the straight edge movement and resistance to gentrification on new york's lower east side and the desert land of late '80s exurbia but a tale of generations loss and redemption culture junkies will thrive on the thick description which carries the reader into empathy for these characters and compassion for ourselves i highly recommend this for your consideration","158":"i read on twitter that henderson really hates comparisons the result in constructions like x writes like y but with a unique voice but there were times while reading this excellent first novel that i had to flip to the cover page to make sure i wasn't reading jennifer egan","159":"this is the first novel i've read that captures the spirit of the straight edge movement the book is about more than the music or the scene and the characters' motivations and convictions aggressive as they might be are just a part of the whole a very strong first novel","160":" was it just me or did this book make you want to do drugs ok i'm mostly kidding about that but prior to the main characters going straight edge in this book i felt like the begining pages were just one big drug lust i felt like i was on drugs reading it it was kind of neat anyways i liked this one i think i put it as a to read because a book blogger put it on his list of books he predicted would make the 2012 tob the back drop to the story in the ny punk scene in the 1980s the characters are a bunch of high school kids with a lotttta problems but i found to be super interesting and easy to get a long with they were f uped but i was rooting for them just the same henderson's writing was pretty amazing a breath of fresh air after reading so many seriously poorly written books this year that i was losing all hope for literary humanity read it enjoy it just say no to drugs","161":"character studies of sad teenagers looking for meaning through their musical and social adventures difficult to like any of them but instead the reader sympathizes with them for their poor decisions in their lives contains a simple plot with a focus on the motivations and behaviors of the teens as they search for their identity through their coming of age adventures","162":"this one was a winner for me my only real compliant was that there was too much going on in terms of problems issues with the characters made it feel a bit like a soap opera at times however the writing is serviceable and i loved the novels exploration of the straight edge scene and what drives it very enjoyable","163":"absolutely my favorite book of 2011 2012 i would never have thought i could be even the least bit still interested in what i thought might be just teen angst being so many years beyond that however from page 1 i was so much caring for jude and teddy and eventually the whole mob truly an amazing feat by ms henderson this is an authentic experience trust me","164":"interesting perspective on the straightedge hardcore scene found a lot to be disappointed by having known a lot of these people firsthand back in the day but also got a good smirk out of the implication that many of these kids were terrified homosexuals which was likely the case the movie was terrible though don't waste your time","165":" takes place in the 1980s travelling back and forth between small town vermont and new york city jude and teddy druggy losers with family baggage are killing time when jude's dad sends his girlfriend's daughter eliza to hang out with jude for new year's eve te story begins teddy and eliza sleep together he later od's she later discovers she is pregnant in the ensuing months jude quits everything cold turkey drugs alcohol smoking girls and becomes part of a straight edge rock band eliza marries teddy's estranged older brother to ensure that she controls the baby's destiny it's a coming of age story for all the characters teens and their parents","166":"great read though i was in middle school in the late 80's i remember the start of the straight edge movement","167":"didn't get the connection from title to story listened to cd in my car maybe i missed something","168":"i usually give up on a book if i don't like it or doesn't interest me in the first 50 pages unfortunately this was one of those books i just didn't connect with the characters and did not care what happened had to let this one go","169":" loved it for me it was one of those books i didn't want to end because i'd come to like the characters so much and didn't quite want to let them go it all takes place in the late 80s and the main character's my age so it was a great big flashback to high school for me even though i lived elsewhere and didn't have quite the exposure to the drugs and chaos these folks did there was so much to relate to and of course the music really took me back to wearing out my seven seconds vinyl beyond its exploration of the straight edge scene this book really addresses so much more big themes around identity related to parents from both sides and some i won't go into for spoilers i loved how much care she devoted to developing each of the characters and sharing the story from all points of view","170":"michelle wildgen executive editor tin house magazine eleanor henderson's ten thousand saints explored the straight edge music scene through a crew of misfit teenagers and their families it's beautifully written amazingly rich and confident for a debut and direct but tender with its ragtag bunch of characters","171":" this novel gets a 4 from me it's very very good work for a first novel and i found myself drawn into the lives of the characters even though i am not particularly interested in the history of the punk hardcore music scene henderson develops her characters carefully and in great detail but she never forgets the powers of humor and compassion i thought of dana spiotta's stone arabia as i read saints i thought of jennifer egan's a visit from the goon squad saints relies more on sheer knowledge of character than either of those books in my opinion and it approaches colum mccann's let the great world spin when it comes to emotional power and pure humanity this is a book i've already recommended to others congrats to henderson for work well done","172":"long drawn out coming of age novel i didn't like the characters so maybe that is why this book left me flat","173":"this debut novel from ithaca college professor eleanor henderson which she wrote over an 8 year period is lyrical moving and brings 1980s new york city back to life in a seemingly authentic way it's about 75 pages too long though and the last third of the book doesn't quite live up to the earlier sections still definitely worth a read","174":"this book was recommended to me by the woman who worked in the bookshop where i was guiltily fondling a copy of just kids by patti smith she encouraged me to buy it and this title as a companion it goes more in depth into the scene she related but slightly less poetic than smith's version i thought the plot was good character development great dialogue ok i think i appreciate it more now a month after i finished it than i did while i was reading it","175":"i never connected with the parents or the kids in this coming of age novel the only reason i continued with it is because it was about the east village in the 1980s and it was fun to think about my old stomping ground if you can't relate to that then don't bother oh and i still don't get the title and pretty much this book sucked","176":" this book sucked me in and held me until the end the characters were well drawn and although not especially likable they were human and i cared about them i had never heard of straight edge before and i found descriptions of the musicians and their fans fascinating albeit baffling but most enjoyable was the picture painted of nyc in the late 80s i haven't been back to the city since the early 80s but i felt like i was right there for some reason this book reminded me of the emperor's children if you liked that one i think you'd like this","177":"wafting between nyc and lintonburg burlington vt in the 80s ten thousand saints is a coming of age story in the age of sex drugs and rock n roll dealing with some heavy topics like addiction loss aids teen pregnancy and adoption all of the characters are deep and complex loved and hated and ultimately human flawed with some recognizable truth you can latch onto what i loved is that even though they're lost and broken they're all trying to find themselves by creating their own idea of family the only thing that drove me nuts was using the last two pages to fast forward 18 years and the desire to wrap it all up with a neat bow at the end that's the only thing that felt forced and unnatural all in all though it's a nice debut by author eleanor henderson i look forward to more from her","178":" all of the hype about this book is true it's wonderfully evocative of the 1980s and a piercing examination of the flaws of both the early gen x youth culture and the hippie culture that spawned it i only wish i could have enjoyed it more i think it's because i'm in a frustrating place workwise 2 5 wks out from e day and needed something either darker or soapier but this was a little too true to life in a boring sense i admired henderson's ability to capture details from people to scenes to the gradations between ages classes sexualities genders but i just couldn't get into it in the place i am right now don't let my negative headspace dissuade you from taking this book on it's a rewarding read even if it didn't grab me the way i wanted it to","179":"this stunning debut novel unfolds around jude johnny eliza and the always present teddy they are members of the generation my generation born between hippies and yuppies always searching for an identity other than x not for the faint of heart these kids are seriously screwed up into drugs sex and violence the 6 months of the novel feel more like a multi century epic given these circumstances i am amazed that henderson has crafted something so beautiful and often gentle there are no real good guys or bad guys no carefully crafted heroes or victims there are just people broken and hopeful angry and funny determined and resigned i knew nothing about the straight edge movement and very little about the punk scene or turmoil in tomkins park so i found that information interesting and necessary as the background to these characters' lives really a remarkable book","180":"other reviewers of this novel suggested the character development and detailed plot too much for one book i agree that the author packs it all in adoption fetal alcohol syndrome hiv aids teen pregnancy drugs there is not one intricacy that she leaves out when developing the story or creating her characters her after school special undercurrent didn't bother me i actually quite enjoyed it i thought each character was believable and naturally flawed the pace of the story moved along and made sense to the scope of the plot the setting of the book was somewhat new to me as well it was an easy read but interesting","181":"loved everything about it","182":"very convincing and observant coming of age novel set in the '80s straight edge hardcore scene of nyc","183":"loved this it reminded me of a visit from the goon squad in that it was a little raw a little sentimental but in an even feminine way not sugary the setting timewise was a few years pre relevant to my own life but remarkably technicolor","184":"the book was a sad but good read sometimes the plot tries to be too many things at once but i got caught up in the story and enjoyed it not for anyone looking for an uplifting book","185":"it helped that i was in ny while reading this so it felt as if i was actually walking beside jude johnny and eliza and throwing down with the rest of the green mountain boys this booked touched base with everything going on in the late 70s early 80s and i was quite sad that the book has come to an end","186":"this review has been hidden because it contains spoilers to view it click here not bad but there was something missing for me the author could have developed some of the issues she brought up more for instance the fetal alcohol syndrome or the aids hiv epidemic also there was so much narrative leading up to the point of jude finding teddy's father and the proposed adoption that when teddy's father decides to drop the adoption issue it doesn't seem plausible nor does the sudden divorce and the fact that rooster and johnny then decide to quietly disappear the book not bad but there was something missing for me the author could have developed some of the issues she brought up more for instance the fetal alcohol syndrome or the aids hiv epidemic also there was so much narrative leading up to the point of jude finding teddy's father and the proposed adoption that when teddy's father decides to drop the adoption issue it doesn't seem plausible nor does the sudden divorce and the fact that rooster and johnny then decide to quietly disappear the book needed some more meat at the end to round itself out and loose ends definitely needed to be tied up more","187":" compelling characters yes interesting cultural setting definitely well written prose yes enough plot to keep it interesting sure what's missing a thematic thread to link all of the events and elements together there were just a few too many different ideas floating around that it was hard to focus on one for any amount of time let alone for ms henderson to follow through fully with them i really enjoyed reading this book it was a wonderful surprise i just wish i could have emerged from the end of the book knowing what is was attempting to say","188":" perhaps i came in expecting too much getting named a nyt top 10 book of the year will do that but this felt like a passable novel that had a marketable hook the sxe nyhc scene of the 1980s which felt entirely put upon when henderson writes about music she can't help but sound like an interloper a sociologist whose facile reading of what things meant dudes who don't drink have sex are either gay scared is unnecessarily reductionist similar to what many of previously said here this book is at least 80 100 pages too long and dips its toes into numerous subplots that go nowhere","189":"i think i will be gushing about this book for quite some time it's definitely my new one size fits all book recommendation i basically can't conceptualize who out there wouldn't love it it's a coming of age story many times over set against the backdrop the late 1980's hardcore punk straightedge scene in a long gone new york and it just has so much heart and is so meticulously constructed and tells such doozy of a story after i finished it i went back and reread the new york times book review review in which stacey d'erasmo says this the ambition of \"ten thousand saints \" eleanor henderson's debut novel about a group of unambitious lost souls is beautiful in nearly 400 pages henderson does not hold back once she writes the hell out of every moment every scene every perspective every fleeting impression every impulse and desire and bit of emotional detritus she is never ironic or underwhelmed her preferred mode is fierce devoted and elegiac yup pretty much sums it up","190":" i appreciated the writing i appreciated the depiction of an accidental overdose committed by a teenager who had no idea of the consequences of his fun i appreciated learning a few things about the punks turned straight edge but who were really trying on personalities as teens do i really appreciated the full throated characterizations of every person in the book other than that i remain confused by the cover the typography used on the cover and flyleaves and the conclusion of the story which seemed so quick and mightily convenient when compared to the truths unfolded in the rest of the text","191":" until i picked up eleanor henderson's ten thousand saints i had never heard the term \"straight edge \" much less anything about a movement of it at first i thought the world henderson created was 100% fiction i could not have been more wrong this is understandable as i was born at the tail end of all the action and to add salt to the wound i grew up in the pacific northwest the grunge scene ruled my town no other movement had a chance until the new millennium new york city was a cool destination a gritty glowing place of fast paced professionals filling sidewalks and subway cars it was the antithesis of and my fantasy escape from the laidback west coast lifestyle radiating north from california now living in ithaca as an older and possibly wiser individual i can't help but feel that the draw and appeal of the new york city written in this book is henderson's reconstruction of my own naive fantasy since devouring her book i haven't finished a book that quickly since the last harry potter release i feel as if i had been right there alongside jude her main protagonist only i'm occupying the movement's outer fringes and not living inside it though the characters are fictional henderson draws from a very real historic period of american history she spent the better half of a decade researching straight edge and new york city in the mid 1980's before drawing from her college experiences in burlington vt to stage as a secondary location and place for basing the early actions of her teenage protagonists her narrative is vivid absorbing and - at the best of times - delightfully detailed and honest much to my delight henderson claims the novel developed when she was living in nyc as she sat on the subway commuting from one job to the next ten thousand saints centers on the lives of two teens teddy and jude they try to rebel against their parents but since their parents are mostly ill quipped to raise teenagers their rebellion swings to the extreme smoking pot huffing skateboarding around town stealing merchandise but everything changes as plot insists in a matter of hours on new years' eve while jude's stepsister eliza is visiting the boys make the smallest of decisions which result in the largest of possible outcomes jude is forced to leave his mother's home and live with his pot dealing father in new york city while his mother worries and cleans up the mess he left behind eliza attempts to refocus on school but eventually decides to share her secret with the only three men who will care jude teddy's older brother johnny and her stepfather all of the teenagers in this novel feign maturity and henderson teaches them a sore lesson but this isn't your average depiction of a group of teenagers being forced to grow up too fast never slowing down the pace of the novel moves as quickly along as the hardcore and punk music jude and his new straight edge friend's play they dive into the scene moshing at straight edge shows pledging purity and tattooing thick black x's on the back of their hands it's easy for the reader to see that in a measly 10 years these kids will have forgotten the lyrics to all those straight edge songs abandoned their purity vows and hidden their tattoos under long shirt sleeves henderson wants us to know it too it's how she narrates the story omniscient and observing but rarely critiquing she has her opinions but she does not live in the straight edge world equipping the reader with multiple perspectives - from jude to his glass bong blowing mother harriet from eliza to johnny and his straight edge savior rooster - henderson creates a rich world for her characters to inhabit the characters are relatable their motivations and emotions are rationalized only reader and author see the picture clearly the characters see a dim opaque reflection left to haphazard guesses for one another concerning the way things were and are and will be last week at buffalo street books henderson spoke about her experience writing the novel to a small group of fans though she cites her husband as the primary resource for material on the psyche of a teenage straight edge male henderson spent much of her time on research before testing her writing out in her graduate program's writing group the first draft henderson said was mostly abandoned after receiving numerous rejections from literary agents one agent her current was cited as particularly influential his advice incited henderson to start anew and rework the novel using just the tiniest of morsels from the aborted draft she wanted to portray the movement as a specific short lived period history that was very contextually based although the novel began by following a single perspective - my guess is jude's though henderson never names the male youth - it became necessary for several perspectives to maintain a distance and reflect an honesty only realized through silent observation for henderson straight edge is a movement in new york city in the mid 1980s within a core group of hardcore and punk music fans though the novel dips into some of the political and social movements surfacing in and around st mark's at the time - aids homelessness gentrification among others - these moments serve to contextualize the action rather than suggest a political stance as an associate professor in ithaca college's writing department it is clear henderson has plenty to teach students on writing historical fiction and is well equipped to do so her first novel has been praised by critics at the new york times as well as hand sold by indie bookstores across the country her next project another piece of historical fiction set in the 1930's in the south i hope is similarly honest engrossing and above all well written eleanor henderson","192":"the movie was a piece of garbage so i didn't expect much from the book but i had to give it a chance so glad i did annoying that the movie was such a nostalgia trip when henderson writes her characters in such a non nostalgic manner it even surprised me by making me cry on the second to last page because i just really didn't want to let these interesting not wholly likable characters go","193":" i found this book really engaging it's always kind of exciting to read fiction about a subculture you were albeit very distantly associated with as a teen but perhaps for that same reason it's likely for such a story to feel lacking in the end after reading this book you'd think there were never any punk girls in existence it was a red flag when the female character says towards the beginning that she prefers hanging out with boys but i just kept waiting for anyone in the story to realize what profoundly sexist assholes they were all being to no avail it kind of blew my mind that the story got wrapped up so happily for the main dude without that ever being addressed the homophobia got absolved a little too breezily as well unfortunately hard to really get with a protagonist after all that i just kept waiting for him to possess some sort of self awareness but no frustrating","194":" i wanted to read this book i was so excited to get a copy i was hoping this book would be a sort of companion to hilary thayer hamann's anthropology of an american girl a wonderful debut novel about a teen set in 1980's ny last year it was one of my favorites of 2010 and i felt it was true gem i did not feel the same about eleanor henderson's ponderous tome of drug use among parents and teens and straight edge hard core culture it just didn't resonate with me as truthful believable or meaningful there are several main players in the novel but jude an adopted child possibly afflicted with fetal alcohol syndrome named after the beatles song or possibly st jude depending on which parent he asks seems to be the character most of the action revolves around in the story the novel opens with the unfortunate adventures of jude and teddy ending with teddy's death brought on by cocaine and huffing chemicals from jude's home air conditioning unit in vermont the year is 1987 this is pretty much where the author obviously a talented writer and extensive researcher lost me the book has an almost overwhelming array of characters ranging from jude's dysfunctional family to eliza the last girl teddy was with and teddy's half brother johnny in between there are many connections between these three teens eliza is jude's dad les's girlfriend's daughter in nyc johnny also resides in nyc living in an alphabet city apartment he squats there as an amateur but popular tattoo artist who embraces the straight edge life style a hard core rock punk movement that promotes self denial and clean living including celibacy veganism vegetarianism no smoking drinking and attending the local hare krishna temple there are more characters but just about each and everyone is majorly dysfunctional using or dealing marijuana heavily wasting their lives misguiding their children if they are parents or doing things to themselves they know are dangerous stupid or morally wrong and or hypocritical the book needed a bit more editing perhaps i see the enthusiasm in the author for her subject particularly the straight edge scene which she obviously researched heavily maybe she was involved herself but about 100 pages half way through the book veers off into nothing but straight edge world i didn't want to know that much about this stuff and quite frankly it isn't that interesting it was too much i want to know about the characters particularly eliza with whom she would tantalizingly tease the reader with a glimpse here and there looking into eliza's thoughts and then quickly backing away and disconnecting from that part of the story i don't want to spoil the plot for anyone by telling you why this would be so fascinating but i just thought this would have best served the main movers of the plot teddy jude johnny and eliza not the straight edge story she also managed to touch briefly on topics like fetal alcohol syndrome the growing acceptance of homosexuals in nyc hiv aids and methamphetamine and cocaine use all part of the burgeoning culture of the 1980's but while the book comes to a roaring close the last third of the book previous to the crashing end is draggy and slow mired down in the details of life in a straight edge band full of youngsters who should be home in high school this isn't a terrible book i liked the writing and it will appeal to some folks who can possibly relate to some of the activities of the characters but for me the story itself just left me cold i grew up in this era on li outside of nyc i knew people kids and adults alike that used drugs mainly pot and cocaine i knew people who were criminals but in this novel the line between criminal and user blurs all the adults are pretty reprehensible no one is responsible and none of the kids have any ambition at all no one gets called on their horrible behavior either ever they all seem to get away with it there seemed to be no redemption for anyone and i'm not going to comment on the final pages of the book as i do not want this review to be a spoiler for anyone who may be reading the book and enjoying it but i found the end pretty unsatisfying as well","195":"not my favorite too many characters and not an easy to follow plot hard to really get into","196":"dark sad and evocative i appreciated it because it offers compelling immersion in place and time late 1980s poor desperate vermont and late 1980s angry and chaotic new york a portrait of seeking teenagers and hapless adults","197":"i liked this quite a lot even though i don't have much interest in punk rock and straight edge the characters are interesting and the writing is very good the story opens on new year's eve 1987 and takes place in 1988 in vermont and nyc and centers on the lives of three teenagers and their parents","198":"excellent novel about nyc straight edge music cbgb's and tomkpkins square captures the punk experience pretty well it was also good on the conflicting relationships between adults and their children and the interaction between teenagers recommended","199":"a troubling story of teenaged stoners stuck in a small town with parents who are tuned out of their lives it's gritty and depressing and overly lengthy but it does make some interesting points about the meaning of family and the value of relationships","200":"well i was a bit disappointed in this book i think the characters could have been fleshed out better especially johnny and rooster do people deal with their children like teddy's mom did if so humanity is doomed would not read this one again","201":"this was an excellent read heartfelt and rife with beautiful details it had energy and a well crafted story with very nice pacing throughout my only complaint is that the dialogue relating to the big twist in the story was pretty tired still highly recommended","202":"didn't want this to end","203":" i really enjoyed this book ten thousand saints opens in a sleepy vermont town where teenage jude keffy horn spends most of his time getting high and drifting listlessly around town armed with his best friend teddy jude's afternoons are filled with smoking joints and huffing everything from turpentine to sharpies but when teddy ods judes depression becomes unbearable leading to isolation robbery and violence concerned for the safety of her son jude mother packs him off to stay with his estrange pot smoking hippie father in nyc it is in nyc that jude becomes friends with teddy's brother johnny johnny quickly becomes a mentor to jude steering him away from drugs and introducing him to the straight edge punk scene which aside from the absence of drugs is in many ways just as violent if not more so than the group he left in vermont what i found interesting was henderson's ability to show how angst and insecurities are human traits and not just a teenage trait jude struggle to find out who he is and where he belongs through drugs through johnny or through his parents is painful at times as you realize that the pendulum needs to swing to the farthest edges on both sides before finding a comfortable spot in the middle jude's journey is a long convoluted one filled with hippies parents tatoo artists hare krishnas and at times can seem a little long winded but in the end you find yourself rooting for jude's survival and happiness","204":"the book is very well written technically it's put together beautifully and she really drops you in the scenes but for me it fell a little emotionally flat all in all i enjoyed the prose but i didn't feel punched in the gut","205":"this book was hard to read not hard to understand just hard to read as it follows a troubled teen and the troubled people in his life lots of drugs and some abuse and a dark look into a life that is so far from my own i like how it delves into the gritty new york that used to exist","206":"this book is passable just a contrived story line involves a lot of suspension of disbelief and ultimately doesn't go anywhere i agree with another reviewer who said that henderson threw everything at this book it shows and the storyline suffers disappointing","207":"this book surprised started out slow a tough read to begin but quickly got better with each page chapter dealing with the counter culture drugs and music the story squarely is centered on the meaning of love and friendship and the different ways these are reflected in the lives of the characters on them as people and on them as friends a very good read enjoyed it","208":"this book gave me whiplash the plot fanned out and i ended up getting sucked in despite the dry beginning the plot goes back and forth and the spirals out of control i was grinding my teeth by the ending because there are so many loose ends that fail to be tied off additionally i don't understand why so many spoilers were printed on the jacket of the book","209":"this review has been hidden because it contains spoilers to view it click here it's not that i didn't enjoy this book it's that i expected to enjoy it more i expected to enjoy the writing more to enjoy the plot more but i felt like the plot and the narrative voice i think were somewhat weak i kind of think it might have been better in first person even though you get other perspectives which could be done in first person like with multiple narrators or even certain chapters in third and the main or jude related chapters in first you're primarily in jude's an it's not that i didn't enjoy this book it's that i expected to enjoy it more i expected to enjoy the writing more to enjoy the plot more but i felt like the plot and the narrative voice i think were somewhat weak i kind of think it might have been better in first person even though you get other perspectives which could be done in first person like with multiple narrators or even certain chapters in third and the main or jude related chapters in first you're primarily in jude's and for some reason the writing often sounds like it's jude in first person i'm not like hating on the book i enjoyed it mostly though i got a little annoyed at and sick of the whole straight edge thing i did believe in jude's conversion but not in the conversions of other characters some of which do slip up which helped make it believable but they still seem overly earnest about it considering who they were immediately before which might just be me i thought it read at times a little like ya which is disingenuous for me to say since i haven't read ya since middle school a little bit name droppy a little bit trying to hard to be authentic and i thought sometimes failing a little too sweet at times there were some great parts but i would not read this again i almost didn't finish it i read another book when i was about a third of the way through this one and i wouldn't have recommended it as highly as it was recommended to me it was on year end lists well reviewed and i just didn't find things to grab onto and love or feel like every moment was writ ten like hell as the blurb on the front declares i just felt something missing the dialogue was good the characters were interesting and mostly well drawn the descriptions were mostly good but sometimes especially descriptions of feeling which tie in with the characterization cloying and juvenile i just don't think she made the best use of the third person i never got a perspective that gave me an understanding i didn't get from other pieces of the narrative and it stretches believability in some places i believe that a kid like jude would have gone straight edge easily and quickly for instance but delph and kram it's never quite clear what eliza's commitment is outside of her pregnancy but if she was really committed to it and only slips up because she is actually just lonely and stressed out i have a hard time believing it and believing that it would happen so fast with so little self reflection or reflexivity teenagers have shown more self reflection reflexivity in other books and i remember when we went straight edge in middle or high school we wee not serious about it and it was the 90s not the 80s and we probably wouldn't have done drugs anyway with a few exceptions i would think these teenagers some of whom are eighteen would be a little less sure and eager though i can also see why they like the rules and the feeling of brotherhood given that most of their parents are somewhat absent or something has happened to them like jude with teddy and supposedly kids actually like structure i don't know i'm conflicted it wasn't a bad book but it wasn't for me and i feel pretty certain that i'm at least in its target audience more","210":"four people go on a spiritual journey of growth together and one of them is dead ten thousand saints deals with the year after jude's best friend teddy o d 's how it affects his life his drug habits and the others that are part of teddy's life much of the book paints a vivid scene of late 1980's new york city mostly about running away to ultimately realize you can't run away from yourself at first the escape of choice being drugs and then changing as the characters have to interrconnect and react","211":"literary fiction i only read the first 64 pages of this book i liked what i read but now a few other books have ended up in my home and i am just more excited to read them the timing just isn't right for me u0026amp this book","212":"revision doleful and elegiac but far too cluttered and drenched in flop sweat pre millennial nostalgia tinged with the pain of the present gazes back at the new york straight edge scene but also recognizes its queer borderline gynophobic underside too much gets lost in the narrative detritus but it's still sharp and affective","213":" this is very well written for a debut novel and i heard they're making it into a movie so good on ya for that it's not schmaltzy not every plot point was beaten over your head and there is good energy and pacing in the writing there are a lot of themes in this and they all just muddy together the ambiguity in the epilogue seemed unnecessary it also felt that this was written based on stories the author heard and research it didn't feel like the author lived this it just felt a little inauthentic or detached to me some of the punk references were really crowbarred in there i would recommend this for people who like to read the book before the movie and those who really enjoyed coming of age novels if you were are a part of this scene i would recommend skipping","214":"the night jude's friend teddy dies from an overdose teddy impregnated eliza jude at sixteen begins a journey from drugs to straight edge no drugs no sex no meat","215":"another book that substitutes back story and meaningless realistic dialogue for character development and drama so it's sort of a perfect representation of the contemporary american novel","216":"i liked it it made me think of growing up in a small nowhere town and the stuff that we did to entertain ourselves it was not on this scale but you could see the parallels something about the similarities unsettled me for that reason i didn't love it","217":"this book got a good review in the ny times it's a complex story about some teenagers in the late 80s trying to survive in a punk rock drug environment there's a gradual awakening for these kids and for the hippie and ny attitude parents","218":" it was hard to like this book the main theme was the search for identity as well as the nature of family it was an abrupt beginning to find out right off that one of the main characters would die that night certainly got me turning pages until he did indeed die from there the main character devoted his time and maybe even his whole life to doing honor to his lost friend there were so many non traditional traits and events wrapped into this story adopted children seeking birth parents parents parenting poorly fetal alcohol syndrome as a diagnosis excuse and challenge to overcome drugs as a lifestyle and economy teen pregnancy homophobia i thought at first that i could do without the 18 years later coda but i'm now coming around to recognizing the reasons the author might have had for including it maybe try this one the setting is vermont and nyc in the 80's","219":"this went nowhere couldn't finish it","220":"meh i just didn't connect to any of these characters they didn't seem real a lot of the book felt contrived","221":" it's a decent coming of age novel set in the late 80s having as a backdrop the hardcore punk scene at the time specifically the straight edge movement straight edge rockers didn't smoke drink or do drugs and tried to abstain from sex as well when we first meet jude and his best friend teddy they are anything but straight edge snorting smoking and huffing everything in sight but when teddy dies i'm not giving anything away you find out on the first page that he's doomed jude slowly begins to re evaluate his priorities jude and his hometown buddies resemble the aimless losers in a raymond carver story the older generation of free living parents recalls the bewildered aging hippies from ann beattie's stories along the way we are offered both squalid and upscale nyc scenes krishna consciousness same sex romance teen pregnancy a marriage of convenience and rampant aids i can't say this is the best book of its type i've ever read i guess i never connected with any of the characters","222":"i had pretty high hopes for this one and it just didn't quite meet my expectations it isn't a bad book but it was difficult for me to relate to any of the characters none of them were particularly likeable in fact teddy u0026amp jude kind of reminded me of a couple of characters i briefly met when i tried to read jk rowling's the casual vacancy","223":"inteesting book maybe a bit too narrow ion its focus themes of adoption and adolescent growth were interesting","224":"i didn't hate it but i didn't like it either probably wouldn't recommend it to my friends","225":"i definitely liked it just feeling conflicted as to whether i really liked it i grew frustrated with the characters at points the descriptions of jude the central character didn't always feel of a piece but there were also a lot of really beautiful evocative passages the subject matter was interesting to me i'd recommend it as a read to just about anyone","226":"hmmm so i hated the first 100 pages and then sort of got sucked in when the characters finally started to develop basically this is another one of those dysfunctional coming of age books i think what made me like this book was the opportunity to live vicariously in a time place the gritty 80s punk scene in new york that i have always wished i'd been a part of","227":"the book description sounded so promising and then i began to read it overall it was blah i forced myself to finish it and there were moments when it was easier to read however these moments were few and far i did not relate to any of the characters in any way and found them annoying there was so much potential for the story and it just failed like a deflated balloon i got to the point when i was reading this when i did not care what happened to the characters and just wanted the book to end","228":" i watched the movie a couple of months ago and to my surprise and excitement found it in a bookstore a couple of days later the straight edge and hare krishna culture that the book explored was so interesting after loving the movie my expectations were really high maybe that's why i had some problems with it i expected too much to get my criticism out of the way ten thousand saints moved at a really slow pace that made me desperately want to skip over some parts but i didn't to be fair henderson writes beautiful note worthy descriptions but she writes too many of them that i felt they interrupted the story line too much of a good thing as they say won't be good for long maybe this was a personal problem i had being an easily distracted person but i did feel drawn in and out of the story to a degree but as you can see i gave the book a three star rating so let's talk about the positives normally i don't like stories told from more than one point of view but the shifts were done so naturally i feel like they were necessary too every character had needed input eleanor henderson gave each character a distinctive voice and i never got confused as to who was talking i'm also a big fan of first person close even though the descriptions became somewhat intrusive they were brilliant descriptions so i'll give her credit for that lastly the plot tackled important issues like teen pregnancy drugs and dysfunctional families the coming of age theme was fabricated into the plot so tightly and it fit so well the characters became so close to me it was hard to say goodbye all in all i recommend ten thousand saints to anyone who liked the perks of being a wallflower or the outsiders","229":" the kids in this book have been raised by wolves wolves who smoke pot wolves who turn on tune out and the drop out hippies who never got over it but decided to bring kids into the picture they leave behind children who are emotionally not able to cope with the 21st century they have grown up with poverty drugs poor sexual boundaries and then are cast adrift into a complicated and problematic world the book revolves around the lives of four characters jude teddy eliza and johnny jude's father left when he was nine after telling the young boy that he was adopted nice parting shot later someone tell shim that he has the physical signs of fetal alcohol syndrome that the 16 year old who gave him up for adophe left him with his mother who makes glass bongs for a living she has some very lax rules about drug use in the house as you might imagine jude's friend teddy has a mother who is a drunk and a drug addict and leaves town on the day we meet him which is also the day he dies jude and teddy are best friends both fifteen and doing every reckless drug they can get hold of-- marijuana cocaine mushrooms alcohol petroleum distillate turpentine and freon which is the one that kills teddy but not before eliza the daughter of jude's father's girlfriend comes for a visit to their vermont town on that new year's eve and makes love with teddy in the bathroom of a party house just hours before he dies and gets pregnant which rocks the world of jude and teddy's brother johnny the book is about the dysfunctional way these three teenagers deal with teddy's death and eliza's pregnancy against the dysfunctional way that their parents deal with them and with their lives in general well written and recommended","230":"a story of drugs sex aids punk rock straight edge culture new york city in the '80s and above all love i'm always shocked that more people haven't read this one it's a fantastic novel i practically devoured it","231":"i definitely recommend this one great book for a vacation for me totally engrossing coming of age story about children of parents who never quite grew out of the 60's to assume the responsibillities of parenting characters were described in such a way that i could empathize with their need to lose themselves in drugs or a pregnancy and then into the world of straight edge","232":"depressing beyond explanation the author throws everything wrong with the free love generation to the straight edge movement of the late '80s along with drugs teenage pregnancy reformation of the east village by the city of new york the openness of west village new money old money drug money and everything in between it was exhausting to read but i kept reading waiting for it to get good it didn't","233":"when reading the back of books i don't typically go for coming of age stories good thing i did not read the back before starting this one it's a classic coming of age story and very enjoyable the characters are captivating full of life and full of heart and full of flaws and in their flaws they demonstrate we do the best we can with the tools that we have","234":" i really enjoyed this novel i must admit however that this is in large part because both the time and setting speak to me it is set in the biggest city in vermont a fictionalized burlington in 1987 and 1988 i was a freshman at the university of vermont that year living in burlington it's clear the author did her homework except perhaps for the minor glitch at the outset with having a university football game on new year's eve i suppose it could happen but i doubt it have you been in burlington in december january i also worry about jude surviving a whole night outside in this weather anyway that's nit picky and i'll stop now it's fiction right teensy spoiler this is the story of two families both fairly messed up it is also about how families are made jude the hero of the story is a heart breaking kid as he navigates his way from teenage drug use and abuse to a straight edge punk rock life with his dead friend's brother and the future mother of his dead friend's baby i felt nothing but compassion and concern for him i struggled with the lack of a strong parent figure in the novel however every single parent in this book fails in some huge way and many had no redeeming qualities at all this may have contributed to my sympathy for the kids in the book but it also seemed just the hardest bit to believe the novel's biggest weakness though for me is the sketchiness with which teddy's character is depicted he disappears off the page after the opening chapter and while the story centers around this loss i never felt like i had a full enough sense of why the hole he left was so big however the book is terrific on so many levels read it","235":"i liked this book a lot but the ending kind of trailed off it seemed like the author wasn't quite sure what to do with the ending should the pregnant main character give the baby to the re emerged biological father of the baby's dead father should she give it up for adoption should she try to raise it with her close friend it just ultimately seemed like a cop out","236":" i've wanted to read this book for a while and when i finally got around to it it didn't meet my standards i guess you could say it was much different to what i imagined it but much better that what i imagined it the book was hard to get into i found myself lost during a lot of the story it really dose take your full concentration however if you stick to it you will be surprising how addictive it is i spent hours on this book unable to put it down the ending was a bit iffy but i do love a good unexpected slightly annoying ending to a great book if you love heavy contemporary this is perfect","237":"i had to abandon over half way through an uncommon act for me tedious kitchen sink conglomeration of everything that can happen to young kids happens","238":"it's a light story about an 80s subculture parenthood and youth it qualifies as a well written first book","239":" this book was an unexpected surprise from david for christmas i think he selected it for me because it is reminiscent of my son's high school straight edge tattoo fascination days the novel begins with the fatal drug overdose of a high school boy teddy on new year's eve teddy and his best friend jude ended up at a party with eliza who gives teddy cocaine and becomes pregnant with teddy's child before his body is found the next morning the novel seemed a bit preachy in places certainly these character lives were messed up but hare krishna to the rescue did not seem the most obvious solution the book takes on drugs homosexuality aids parenting adoption tattooing and the hard core music scene i stayed interested to the end although the last chapter two pages seemed a forced conclusion the book has received much praise new york times book review - top 10 books of 2011 new york times - 100 notable books of 2011 new yorker - a year's reading selection o magazine - top 5 fiction amazon - top 10 debut fiction and it was a great christmas present","240":"after reading the ecstatic review of this book in the ny times book review i braced myself for disappointment but it turned out to be very good it is totally engrossing and the writing does feel very vivid and energetic as the review described though i didn't find it quite as earth shattering as that reviewer did","241":" we are reading this book as a first year reading initiative selection and i am really looking forward to discussing the themes in ten thousand saints with my students even though they are more than 20 years younger than these main characters anyone who has seen the musical rent can figure out what the lower east side of nyc must have been like for teen runaways in the mid 1980's but the overarching themes of friendships family and finding out who you really are as a person surely resonated with me","242":" ten thousand saints starts with new years eve in 1987 jude and teddy are teenagers celebrating the coming new year with some others but unfortunately after a night of partying and drug taking one of them doesn't live to see 1988 this is a story of a group of teenagers struggling to come to terms with the death of a friend set in the 80's ten thousand saints explores the life of a group of teenagers during that time rebelling against their parents taking drugs partying and later getting involved in the straight edge movement as the book deals with the death of a teenager and the after effects this isn't a light read by any means in fact it is quite heavy and personally i did have to take a break from it as sometimes it was a bit overwhelming and overpowering for me eleanor henderson has to be applauded for her detail that she puts into this novel i felt as though everything was explored there were no loose ends for me and she has clearly done her research as the book seemed very true to life this novel wasn't for me but if you want a dark gritty novel that captures a time of sex drugs punk and a different side of life then ten thousand saints might be a novel to try","243":"starts off slow but definitely worth hanging in there it took about 100 pages before i was really hooked henderson manages to get into the minds of each character in this book at first i thought the constant shifting of perspective sometimes within the same paragraph was distracting but she juggles everyone quite well beautifully written interesting book about growing up ny and vt in the late 80s love drugs and hard core music","244":"a lovely intensely observed thoughtful novel however it made me want to just take its lost and wounded protagonists home and make them eat a nice bowl of soup and put them to bed early","245":"midway through this book i wondered if i truly wanted to finish it not generally a good sign it was long and winding and even though the plot didn't necessarily keep me hooked there was enough interest in the characters to keep me reading the characters were interesting as well as being people i felt like i hadn't read about before","246":" this novel was interesting to read compared to the ones given in studies in literature for its a novel that's based on events that possibly occurred during that time period i like the character jude for changing his life for the better compared to many others who would continue to do drugs if one of their friends had passed thought i liked johnny at the beginning he reminded me of joffery from game f thrones though he is not as cruel he masked himself as a good person but then the mask is removed revealing the selfish jerk that johnny really is i have no words for the character eliza she was just an idiot teenage girl she should have gotten an abortion the moment she found out she was pregnant with teddy's child some events were interesting such as the fight in the park but others just seemed to drag on it was like a roller coaster there were some high points and some low points within the novel overall i did generally like the book and would recommend it to others that are interested in straight edge consequences of drugs and mending family bonds","247":" it's been quite some years since i've cried at the end of a novel but ten thousand saints hit me hard a really affecting coming of age tale and a great precis to the straight edge movement in nyc in the late 80s sure they've thrown everything in here foetal alcohol syndrome aids unwanted pregnancies adoption drugs ods etc but it all hangs together so well with such such well drawn and loveable if not likeable characters it's not often that i use the term unputdownable but this novel really was highly recommended","248":" i started out not really liking this book i wasn't even sure if i would finish it and a book has to be really bad for me not to finish it it was dark depressing and of a subject matter besides myself also being a teenager in the 80's that i didn't know much about or was interested in well thank goodness i stuck with it my earliest impressions were wrong yes it is a dark depressing and gritty novel it is also full of hope beauty and light despite our dismaying disfunctional messed up childhoods or perhaps because of them we humans are capable of great things a great book","249":"worth reading for the sentimental references to punk rock culture","250":"not sure how i came across this but really enjoyed it captured a place and a mood quite well great writing and good characterization i've found myself wanting her to write an alternate book where teddy lives","251":" there was almost too much to like about this novel too many points of connection for me the narrative set almost entirely in the 1980s ricochets from vermont to the east village to nj and back again from glass blowing pot dealing middle aged hippies to straight edged kids in a mosh pit at an all ages hard core matinee at cbs my brand of nostalgia is on uncanny display here st mark's place trash and vaudeville the tompkins square park riot of '88 they are precious and important not gratuitous which is how i expect to find them in fiction who is this author how come our paths haven't crossed by now how does she unroll such gorgeous sentences with nary a wasted moment henderson even earns the right to do stupid things with plot elements like when she has the krishna tattoo artist straight edge kid swiftly and conveniently dig up his dead half bro's long estranged dad i even loved the cornball ending fast fowarded to 2006 last week of cbgbs bad brains concert mosh pit into which the now 40 year old straight edge kid flings himself wish i'd written such a beautiful indulgence myself","252":"very readable big cast of characters but sometimes the plot seemed absurd","253":"i liked this book although the characters weren't like me and it's bleak it's well written and in some ways it reminded me of the outsiders if the outsiders had been set in the late 80's and the characters had been into drugs straight edge and punk basically though it's about getting high growing up and friends and family","254":"nothing more than a well told love story not much new interesting or original","255":" i really liked this book for a couple of reasons first i knew nothing of the straight edge scene i knew about skinhead and punk but this subculture passed me by second i liked this capturing of a particular time the late 80s i was a teenager then a long way from vermont and nyc but this scene around tompkins square and at cbgbs when nyc was still dangerous before the homeless people were deported was happening while i was living in palmerston north sneaking into my first gigs this was why my friend from long island told me i wasn't to go there manhattan would eat me alive the other thing i liked was the pov the narrator was omniscient dancing around in multiple characters' heads henderson did a very convincing adolescent boy in some ways although i admired this book and loved the world it showed me a glimpse of i didn't feel particularly close to any of the characters maybe because there were so many of them and they were all so flawed i was slightly repelled by the teenage boys and their violence but maybe i felt squeamish because it was too near to the truth","256":" i wish this book were longer it's the type of epic recent history that could be about 200 more pages and give us more detail about characters their history and the history of the place i don't know maybe there are people out there who don't like that people who think it distracts from the story but i like my novels like textbooks and i find that the story distracts from the world of characters and places that the author creates so i would've liked more about the tompkins square riot the aids epidemic and the gentrification of the lower east side most disappointing was the last chapter which jumped 20 years into the future but did so for just 3 pages as if she just wanted us to know that the character ended up ok but the book made me care about the time the characters and the subculture it made me want to learn more about it the book also made me add another author to my list of read everything they write","257":"could this be the best book i'very read all year i think it is","258":"this really grew on me quite good","259":"stunning heartbreaking","260":"this book wants to be an epic wants to be rent but falls short the writing is nothing spectacular the themes of parenthood couplehood procreation and possessiveness about the above persist but not in a compelling literary way interesting but not compelling also the title is never explained","261":"perhaps my favorite book that i read last year the characters were fully realized and acted in a believable manner just enough insight into the hardcore music scene in nyc in the 80's to give it some flavor also caught the gentrification of the lower east side in a non judgmental way i was sad when it was over i thought this was a lot better than visit from the goon squad which was getting all the press at about the same time that this book came out","262":"wow the sort of book that will really make you thnk a coming of age story set in the 80s among the punk straight edge scene comic tragic and moving in places at times the book escalates into completely unexpected areas i feel like the story takes you on a real journey i couldn't stop thinking about it when i finished it not recommended for those who like sickly sweet romances but i really enjoyed it","263":"depressing but filled with a fascinating cast of characters plus i thought the ending was a perfect fit to the story","264":"i really enjoyed this book there was a lot going on at once u0026amp at the beginning i found it difficult to follow but in the end i didn't mind","265":"teenage pregnancy straight edge culture aids paranoia in the 80's what could of and should have been completely cliche somehow worked and was magical sprinkled with a bit of fight club or in my opinion the anti fight club and american history x fantastic only 4 stars though because the ending felt just a little rushed or maybe it was because i didn't want the story to end and there was an epilogue that wasn't horrible but i don't like epilogues so there for immediate minus of a star","266":"i was determined to make it through this book it seemed as though the characters were one dimensional and they kept doing the same things over and over i didn't feel engaged and didn't like the way the book ended","267":"just could not bring myself to care about any of the characters","268":"very similar to a home at the end of the world by michael cunningham but not nearly as good the characters were mostly unlikable shallow and not particularly bright the book was well written and had i not already read cunningham's book i probably would have enjoyed this one more this book was overall pretty disappointing","269":"every family in this book is fractured the kids abandoned by their narcissistic parents to fend for themselves drugs booze screaming music tattoos anything to dull the pain i was intrigued at first by this alien world but the novelty wore thin too much self destruction as the kids wander the country in a punk band crashing on strangers' couches the story begins to feel as aimless as the tour in the end there won't be any reunion","270":" it's 1987 and new york's lower east side and alphabet city lettered avenues on the lower east side are places for the homeless vagrants the impoverished hippies some immigrants who have held out through the next generation and some younger folks who call themselves `straight edge straight edge refers to teenagers who like hard rock and punk but live a straight and clean lifestyle no meat no sex no booze and no drugs many shave their heads and are into tattoos that's what ten thousand saints by eleanor henderson is about a group of straight edge teens and their parents trying to understand themselves and one another as they venture through life a lot of it in alphabet city in manhattan the book opens up in vermont in a city that sounds a lot like burlington two teenagers who live there jude and teddy are way into drugs they smoke weed huff drink do mushrooms and basically try to stay high as often and for as long as they can they also hate school and cut out as often as they can get away with it jude has been adopted by parents who are now divorced both semi hippies his mother blows glass for making bongs and his father who lives in new york sells weed for a living since his parents' divorce jude's father les has been living in manhattan and has been seeing a self absorbed ballerina named di di has a daughter named eliza who plans to visit vermont and wants to meet jude eliza is a rich girl who has been kicked out of several boarding schools for drugs and truancy teddy's mother is an alcoholic who splits town on new year's eve the day of teddy's sixteenth birthday and the day that this book opens teddy has no idea who his father is he has an older brother named johnny who lives in new york and is into the straight edge lifestyle jude and teddy feel like outcasts in vermont they hang out with each other but basically don't have other friends they like to hang out at a record store and play music together they're teased a lot and just don't fit in eliza arrives in vermont and parties with teddy sharing cocaine with him after he's already huffed freon and gasoline smoked weed and drank they also have sex the next morning eliza is on her way back to manhattan and teddy is dead by od jude is in the hospital with hypothermia and getting detoxed from all the substances he's used it was a close call for jude but he makes it when jude gets out of the hospital he decides to go live with his father in new york in new york eliza jude and johnny become like a family of three this is intensified when eliza finds out that she is pregnant with teddy's baby from their one night together because teddy is dead johnny really wants eliza to have this baby to honor teddy's memory eliza is into this idea as well she is also into johnny who does not appear to be into girls eliza and jude embrace the straight edge lifestyle which is portrayed as a hair's width from a cult it embraces hare krishna and many hindu concepts johnny is called mr clean because of his devotion to straight edge and his fanatic adherence to its principles it becomes ironic then when he says he is the father of eliza's child in their minds the parents are more likely to let them keep the baby if the father is alive they form a band together and jude becomes a natural born leader of the group they travel back to vermont several times during the novel and recruit others for the band and for the straight edge lifestyle the band travels up and down the coast and is even interviewed by different zines for their lyrics and overall music eliza runs away with johnny so that she can have the baby her mother wants her to have an abortion but she won't hear of this the parents are portrayed as distant absent or stoned there is not one parent who is really present and attuned to their child's life ironically at one point in jude's childhood his doctor thinks he may have fetal alcohol syndrome because of his dyslexia facial structure and hyperactivity with add despite this possible diagnosis jude emerges as a real hero in the novel a good guy with empathy and strong emotions he may not have the best judgment but he turns himself into a leader who is respected it is interesting to imagine the tompkins square park of their day filled with the homeless empty crack vials condoms and violence now the same park is filled with nannies and babies and surrounded by million dollar condos the book is careful to stay true to the new york of the late 1980's and the gen x'ers who are looking for a place to fit in and make their mark ms henderson is not judgmental about straight edge but this reader felt that it became another sort of addiction for many of its followers the book was fascinating at times it was repetitive and went off on some rabbit trails it could have been about fifty pages shorter and been stronger for that editing however even with the length it stands at now 383 pages it is a fascinating book i've never read a book that caught the gen x'ers so vividly and so perspicaciously this accomplished novel does not read like a debut novel which it is ms henderson is a writer with a rare talent","271":"i quite enjoyed this read subject manner feels a little all over the place but not in a bad way in a really interesting way actually","272":"was this really a best seller it was just jam packed with issues none of which seem to be dealt with in any meaningful way and really bad choices quite a disappointing read","273":"the story reminded me of 'the outsiders' and 'that was then this is now' so while i appreciated the author's writing overall it just made me want to re read s e hinton's books i didn't find anything particularly fresh or revelatory","274":" i'll go after any novel with punks in it behavior that still persists even after so many disappointments non punks and even some ex punks never get it right sigh while our young protagonist sports a devil lock and misfits shirt before transforming into a judgmental straight edge hardcore kid this book really isn't about punk rock or even the homophobic intolerant straight edge scene the author depicts i liked the doth protest too much edge to this depiction it is a novel about the personae the costumes we don in order to hide our real feelings failures regrets wrongdoings and fear identity plays a large role in how characters not only perceive the world but act in it as children parents friends lovers and even enemies the second half of the book is where these theme gel making the slog through the first worth it the author was either had short lived involvement in the east coast scene or did serious research and or interviews with those who were the backdrop of new york city in 1987 88 provides a stark frame of activist struggle for the personal struggles of the characters i would have liked to have some more variation in punks and activists as her focus makes it seem like only hard core straight edge kids had a scene","275":" i should admit right up front that i tend not to read hot new fiction until a few years after its published partly because i already have plenty of stacks of unread books in my house and partly because i feel like that gives it time to cool down and i'll have more data ie friends' opinions to draw upon before decided to commit to reading it however this debut was an exception mainly because so many people were telling me that the late '80s iteration of the straight edge hardcore subculture that i was a part of plays a huge role in the plot now i know that's a pretty weak reason to pick up a book but what can i say curiosity got the better of me i was deeply into that scene from 1987 91 and though i experienced mainly down in d c rip safari club i drove up to shows at the anthrax and the ritz and knew plenty of people who were bands started record labels did 'zines etc and 25 years later i remain one of the few from that time who's still straight edge what i found was not untypical of a first novel a somewhat haphazard awkwardly paced and plotted story that crams in way too much and feels like it needs another few drafts to reach a finished polished state don't get me wrong there's plenty of good writing and good storytelling but it's side by side ha ha inside joke to my straight edge brethren with bad writing soap opera plot developments clunky transitions and even a feel good coda the book starts extremely strongly under some high school bleachers in burlington vermont for some reason recast as lintonburg why bother where we meet jude and teddy two teenage misfits whose main ambition in life is getting chemically stimulated a visit from jude's not quite stepsister from manhattan with the unfortunately transparent last name urbanski i mean come on is the catalyst for tragedy and change as teddy dies and jude moves to new york it it jude's journey that leads us through the book as he gets to know his father who has been largely absent from his life he also falls in with teddy's older brother who is a fixture of the burgeoning new york city hardcore scene with his straight edge band army of one note those who would like to read more about this subculture should check out all ages a book of interviews that includes a number of people from that scene or the anthology sober living for revolution unfortunately the two more academic ethnographies of the subculture are kind of weak and if you want to hear a sampling of the music start with the new york city hardcore compilation from 1988 and go from there anyway the straight edge stuff is relevant to the story because jude's parents are both aging hippies who in different ways make their living from the pot trade and his stepsister is a stereotypically spoiled rich manhattan brat with access to lots of drugs and in the straight edge scene he finds a path to a more meaningful life in the wake of the death of his best friend this is a bit overdone does it really have to be both parents who make a living off weed can't it be a little more nuanced than that but more or less works the reason the book didn't work for me is that the author also brings in all kinds of other stuff such a teen pregnancy and resulting soap opera antics aids fetal alcohol syndrome an attempted portrait of the late '80s pre gentrified lower east side including the characters direct involvement with the real life tompkins square riot and most of all a large subplot involving concealed homosexuality the homosexuality angle had the potential to be interesting within the context of the characters involved but the author oddly muddies the waters by suggesting multiple times that the straight edge subculture was some form of mask for latent homosexuality it's just too much stuff too many themes and the author only has partial control over it there are characters who have some great moments here and there for example jude's mother's ineffectualness as a parent but they're too few and far between and some characters whose voices are too muted i ultimately feel like it all would have worked better as a series of separate or linked short stories with maybe one novella devoted to jude","276":"i've been on a bit of a jag reading stories of the lives of boys i quite like it this one was sweet and perhaps a touch y a but i liked it nonetheless give it a try if you too would like to read another story about a boy","277":" this story about a group of doper friends i'm forced to use the term friends loosely who seem to be driven only by the next bag of weed fumble through their teen years to what used to be in an earlier age adulthood here the term doesn't seem to apply as it might to earlier ages in which coming of age meant you know putting away childish things for adult reasons jude who is henderson's main character forsakes dope and other chemical entertainments for membership in a group called straight edge in another era the children of james dean or marlon brando would have taken up tobacco and booze and fast cars and motorcycles as their way of pushing off against their parents and any other authority figures who might've irritated the fragilely developed personalities of teen hood but these kids are the progeny of indulgent parents some dopers themselves so where else to go but straight an interesting premise really along the way and i won't delve into henderson's overstuffed cast jude gains a slowly fructifying case of the hots for eliza maven of cocaine who turns up pregnant she's adamant about hanging onto johnny you see who must've knocked her up but she finally tires of her jones for johnny and opts assumedly in any port in a storm fashion for jude there i've ruined the story for you haven't i what has me so acerbic about this book disappointment more than anything else there is i suppose a form of coming of age for both jude and eliza but it's more a case of growing fatigued by the dope and sex and rock scene one has to assume that biology kicks in for them here not hard decisions made from maturing emotions and intellect there's no real growing up odyssey as henderson has spelled it out for the reader just a final scene in which the couple exit stage left with babe in arms somewhat anxious to flee new york's ugliness first novels these days whether lauded to max as this one is destined to be or quietly simmering as the author gathers an audience seem to be an apprenticeship that in the long lost days of the publishing industry was spent in the counsel of agent and editor and perhaps writing group i'm not implying henderson has no talent to the contrary she has a way with words although sometimes her tautly carved phrases seem to be working too hard at their job my problem here is the same as with many young writers with talent they have the writerly chops but their views of life are as if through a keyhole i e with the myopia of teen age and lack of a life experience that would allow them to see and write their microcosmic stories and characters within the grander scheme of things as a result the characters here seem such doofuses that the author has to occasionally come to their rescue with a bit of explanatory narrative hopefully the second novel will show the maturity henderson's talent deserves","278":" this book started out a bit slow for me the characters of teddy and jude were interchangeable in my mind for the first few chapters but i realized later that was kind of the point once i got going with this book though i couldn't put it down the pacing is great and even though it's a long book it moves quickly the different settings go a long way to flesh out the characters johnny and les are defined by their residency on the lower east side in manhattan whereas eliza's mother di is straight upper east side jude tries to throw off his provincial upbringing in lintonburg vermont but comes to grudgingly appreciate his small town home and his kooky mother who makes her living blowing glass into bongs and pipes my one complaint about characters is with eliza she didn't really seem like a round character to me she's mostly described through the lens of her pregnancy and seems to just sit around with her sunglasses on most of the time there's a lot going on in this book from drug overdoses to teenage pregnancy to the straight edge scene in new york in the late 80s but all of the sub plots ultimately involve a search for family whether in the form of estranged parents runaway teenagers or the created family of a countercultural group there's a lot of sadness in this book and while the book doesn't end with a tidy happy resolution for the whole cast of characters it seems as though they've all ended in a place that they can live with","279":"liked all the characters although i found johnny and rooster's relationship the most interesting i missed teddy throughout the whole book so jude johnny and eliza's motivations and actions felt real to me loved the setting and think it really captured the straight edge scene","280":"if you're looking for a fun and super soapy slightly cheesy read about teenagers and new york city in the '80s and the straight edge scene and hardcore music and people named after beatles songs this is the book for you also make this into a movie before mae whitman amber on parenthood gets too old to play eliza thanks","281":"this book stayed with me long after reading which i did in 2 days characters are so real and very heartbreaking especially interesting if you are into nyc history loved this book","282":"i only bought this because i wanted to buy something from bookperks and this was written by an ithaca college professor it kept me on my toes i couldn't put it down three kids in their mid teens in the mid 80's this book touched on sooo many things from that era i was teary eyed at the end","283":" this is one of the best books i've read in years i would compare the amount of pleasure that i got from this book to the joy i got from reading oscar wao or the savage detectives it's a great book about hardcore kids in the late 80's henderson was able to really capture the way teenage boys make decisions through a haze of confusion and inchoate misdirected rage the confusion that runs through the emotional lives is really stirring and relatable henderson did a great job of reminding me of what it was like to be in the hardcore scene back in the day she also through a light on some of the bullshit ideas i had back then i can't recommend this book enough","284":"the writing is excellent i only gave it three stars because of how i experienced the novel i had a hard time getting attached to the main characters and preferred the minor ones i think if you grew up on the east coast during the 80s the novel would really resonate but alas i was a teenager in the midwest during the 1990s","285":"this is a meandering coming of age story i liked but didn't love it ten thousand saints is part dysfunctional family tale and part look back at growing up in the 1980s the book certainly has its strengths but ultimately it has too few emotionally resonating moments to pull it all together we know what these characters do but see too little of their emotional lives","286":"this book was a teen novel about a group of kids who found themselves out of place they had a series of events that bound them together for a lifetime and this novel follows their stories they dealt with drugs and an overdose that killed the best friend brother and lover of the kids in the book the topics covered were the straightedge movement in the punk scene during the 80's teenage pregnancy and the importance of family during adolescence this book was not the type of book i usually read in fact i am really not fond of teen fiction it was very angsty which i found unprofessional and could not relate to the character descriptions left little to the imagination when envisioning the book the plot was over dramatic and like a soap opera and diction was too youthful to take the subject matter seriously but a younger reader into this type of writing would love it","287":" the writing was actually pretty decent in this novel and the quality alone deserves more than two stars but i'm still not sure what the take away point of this book was it covered such a wide variety of topics punk rock straight edge lifestyles drugs teenage pregnancy hiv aids the gay community parenting etc that i couldn't really get a grasp for what the author was getting at rather than just nonchalantly telling a story i would go out of my way to recommend this book but i also wouldn't deter people from reading it","288":"this didn't ring true to me at all skip this and read the chapter on minor threat in our band could be your life instead","289":" i had a hard time getting into this it focuses on some teens in the '80s and their involvement first in drugs then in the straight edge movement lots of hands off permissive parenting extreme swearing to go along with the kids which is what i remember from being a teenager although i didn't participate in the swearing since i grew up in a small town with nothing to do i get where the kids are coming from it goes between a small town in vermont and nyc but i don't empathize or even relate too extreme for me why did i stick with it i kept hoping it would become something i could relate to as the kids learned and matured oh well","290":"i learnt about this book on ny times' best of the year list a couple of years back and was intrigued because of the straight edge theme when i finally started reading i wasn't all that convinced in the beginning because this felt like just another book about messed up outcast teenagers then i got more and more into the story and somewhere in the middle it became a five star book instead of a four star book yes it's a story about messed up outcast teenagers but it's also about growing up too fast cowardice running away and guilt most of all guilt while it's never explicitly stated all the characters feel guilty about something guilty for abandoning their family guilty for leading their friend astray guilty for lying guilty for the bad decisions they make it's also a great story about how something that is intended to be good and do good can be used for opposite purposes how easy it is for the characters to hide behind the straight edge idealism but still do things that go against it in the name of the ideal i didn't particularly find any of the characters more likable than the others it was more about liking the flaws of all of them sure there are cliches and a bit of everything but it works well in this story i can't fully explain why i liked the story so much it's the combination of expected and unexpected plot twists the subtle ways things are brought up the way it manages to describe the hardcore music scene the way it starts as a sad and bleak book and grows into being a story with hope","291":"i didn't know how much i didn't know about 'straight edge' as a matter of fact i didn't know straight edge existed as a separate entity within the punk rock world now after three hundred beautifully written pages i know since i still revere ella fitzgerald above all others and i prefer to read with bach in the background one might say that ten thousand saints was new information and where did i derive this new information from reading fiction very well written fiction i might add in this coming of age novel eleanor henderson introduced me with great compassion and wit to a new musical genre and a bunch of adults whom i thought were tediously awful but the kids the kids were all right pretty great in fact to me this was ever so much better than the goon squad but not nearly as much as patti smith's just kids but still i liked it a lot keep writing ms henderson","292":"hmmmmmmm didn't care for this book were it not for my inability to abandon a book mid read i would have ditched it couldn't relate to many of the characters a glimpse into the straight edge culture was however somewhat interesting","293":"thoroughly enjoyed this novel which tells a tale of how choices we make affect the lives of others for a lifetime u0026amp the resilience of the human spirit to cope and adjust","294":"hard to explain good but bad if that makes sense glad i didn't give up on it as a bad job","295":"had to struggle to get through this would recommend this for someone in their 30s 40s as they could related more to the time period experiences i wasn't all that interested in any of the characters","296":"not for me didn't find the characters sympathetic at all so many poor choices so little learning","297":"this story has everything about life in the 80's sex drugs rock u0026amp roll punk rock cbgb's and omfug teenage angst teenage pregnancy adoption marriage and divorces and step parents and adoptive parents an overdose a birth road trips the village the suburbs homosexuality and homophobia the aids crisis grief fear hope discovery and disappointment and i loved it the middle almost lost me it dragged for a bit but isn't that how life really is the last third of it brought me right back brilliantly captured the time period and the ebb and flow of many different relationships","298":"i was never able to connect with and hence like most of the characters in this novel","299":"maybe this book was meant to appeal to a different audience but i couldn't relate it was interesting enough to keep me reading thru to the end i won this book in a giveaway","300":"this is book is full of grit it's a hard read with all the drug use amongst teenagers but it was a fascinating journey into the punk era in east village earning it a spot on the nyt best books of 2011 list i can't say i enjoyed reading this book the writing did have some fine moments that made it worth the disturbing storyline","301":" i really did enjoy listening to this on books on tape but there were times when i wish i could have skimmed over a few pages it only i'd had a book with pages in my hands i think mostly this story is about identity and family who makes us what we are drug crazed teens meet with tragedy and then many repercussions an interesting look also at straight edge lifestyle which i didn't know much about and now wonder how realistic this book is this book has plenty of flaws and annoyances but overall i looked forward to driving my car so i could see what happens next pretty well written so i gave it 4 stars","302":"beautiful prose definitely worth the read","303":"this book was kind of outside my comfort zone it was alittle different than what i was used to overall it was a good story","304":"i was so excited to read this book based on all the rave reviews and i was less than impressed following the path of first four one dies almost immediately and then three teenagers as they navigate the 80s world of punk straight edge unplanned pregnancy drugs and aids the author never made me care about these characters and their poor decisions maybe this story will show better as a movie","305":"this book grew on me as i went but i never connected that much with any of the characters the drugs sex scene seemed almost cliche at times but probably was a good portrait of the era nonetheless","306":" i needed a quick read to transition me from my first dickens novel onto the stacks i have next to my bed and this was the first yes it moved quickly but besides jude i hated everyone else in this book i thought les jude's adoptive father was so completely implausible that it really destroyed the entire narrative for me i get it he likes to get high but he names his bongs jude's mother was equally as annoying yes they are vermont hippies but they go way beyond the cliche jude and then maybe ravi were the only two authentic characters in the book for me it's too bad because henderson did do a good job of making them very real but unfortunately the over the top over written other characters ruined this experience for me","307":" this was well written but ultimately i had a problem with the book it seemed the author backed off from showing the scenes of transformation that comprise the book we see that jude has adopted the straight edge lifestyle but we don't see the months when this happens we just see him after the fact we see johnny and rooster in crisis we're very invested in them and then they just disappear and there are other dropped threads like jude's fas which don't ever amount to anything most frustratingly though the author withholds information from us in the epilogue refusing to divulge who one of the characters is walking down the street something that matters very much to the narrative and something we care about there's a strong hint the locket that it could be eliza enough that we feel we should be told if it isn't but then we aren't told that's not the good kind of ambiguity it almost feels like cowardice and ultimately although it was enjoyable i'm just not sure what it all added up to what this book was really about forgettable","308":"eh just okay as others have noted it's similar to many other coming of age novels","309":"i thought it was well written but the plot went nowhere too many characters with stories half told for a such a short time frame it was to have taken place in did very little to explain the aids epidemic of the 80's which is a story in itself we should all become more aware of","310":"about two thirds of the way through the book i chanced to check out the author's picture wow kinda preppy looking her appearance didn't really fit very well with the punk rock 80's new york theme of the book i got over it about the book the characters are all so so flawed parents and offspring alike a major theme is the breakdown of the family unit parents are mostly absent and not just figuratively when they are present they are almost as fucked up as the kids the absent parent and or fucked up parent may be the reason someone like jude is drawn to the straight edge culture that offers a sense of belonging and inclusion and purpose his participation in the drug culture seemed to revolve around teddy and once he was gone jude was in desperate need for a raft to hold on to teddy's unborn baby and the cultish inclusion of the straight edge culture provide that raft i have the feeling this will be a well read and much reviewed book ala visit from the goon squad so i'm a little hesitant to go into a lot of explanation that will just end up repeating what everyone else is posting","311":"realistic gritty and sad worth the read but i need to be in a good mood to begin with when reading this type of book not a feel good kind of story but an important one","312":" this book was such a terrific read henderson captured adolescence like no author i've read in a very long time there was a certain depth and truth to all of the characters she wrote they felt vibrant and alive this novel is unlike other ya novels that seem to lack a certain amount of passion i found myself relating to every one of these characters because they were so real each of these characters had changed drastically by the end of the book the alternating perspectives made it hard to really hate or love any of them because as soon as i developed an opinion i would see that they were only human people make mistakes an important lesson taken from this novel one of my new favourites","313":"this was my favorite book of 2011 i knew so many teenage boys like the protagonist in this book yet i have never come across one in literature the relationships that the characters develop to one another and their own inner conflicts were extraordinary","314":"wow this was really different i had no clue about this punk subculture straight edge i really kind of felt for these characters and through the writer could understand their feelings and just sense of being youthful and lost superb for her debut novel i didn't get though the supposed timeline there's no way all of that transpired in a matter of like 4 5 months","315":"this was pretty good and engaging and i read it quickly in the good sense but i have to agree with a reviewer below that the author just sort of puts a giant elipses over a lot of major events so you're seeing just the aftermath it feels a little too easy and speaking of the eighties i'm weirdly reminded of that sitcom perfect strangers where the camera would leave them like stranded on a windmill or something and the very next scene would be them sitting in their apartment saying wow that was close and you'd get this crazy rescue story through exposition believe me that's the only way in which i'm comparing this book to a cheesy sitcom but it really reminded me of that too bad becuase i'd have loved to see those missing scenes","316":"it was an interesting read it is hard to believe how some people live lots of different story lines going on throughout the book so it was never boring","317":"adopted by a pair of small town vermont hippies 15 year old jude and his best friend teddy spend most of their free time getting high but everything changes when teddy dies of an overdose this story is basically about kids and the parents who mess them up and i found it to be compelling","318":" when i first started reading ten thousand saints i almost put it down because the very beginning seems a bit overwritten i'm glad i stuck with it the language calms and i was charmed by jude great characterizations throughout and i loved the final chapter and the way it wrapped everything up this would be a great companion novel to read alongside beige cecil castellucci and the disenchantments nina lacour ten thousand saints isn't ya although the main characters are ya but the novels share some things in common and it's always interesting to note similar plot devices and how they work in one but not the other","319":" recommended by ann patchett one of my favorite authors how could you go wrong eleanor henderson has mixed a well imagined coming of age story with turbulent historical events to deliver an insider view of the straight edge movement in the punk rock era i'm a sucker for any story that includes nyc as a full character rather than just a setting or backdrop enjoyed the author's cast the hippie parents made me wonder about the parenting styles of some of my contemporaries yes much humor here but also pathos not sure why but the ending left me wanting","320":"interesting enough but i didn't really get emotionally involved with any of the characters i finished it so i could be finished not because i cared how it ended","321":"i struggled with this book because it had teenagers making questionable decisions and taking scary actions since i have girls that will be teenagers soon i sometimes found myself not wanting to read further because i did not want to know what was going to happen to the teens in the book in the end i thought this book was a interesting view of parenting early relationships and being a teen","322":"a bit too tidy in the end but loved the '80s nyc setting","323":" wow what an amazing journey this novel takes you on the settings are rendered so precisely evoking all the senses that i think i would recognize these places if i saw them but it's the characters and their relationships that really matter and these are explored in deeply human and surprising ways the writing is clear and crisp and the questions the novel raises what does it mean to be a parent a friend a family how to be true to yourself how to forgive our mistakes make ten thousands saints a deeply satisfying read","324":"couldn't make it through this one somewhere in the middle i just got bored picked up something else and never picked this one up again i'm not sorry","325":"a beautiful homage to the scuzzy days of new york and the confusion of adolescence this is another great music novel to slot in alongside a visit from the goon squad stone arabia and a few others that have been published lately","326":" this book got rave reviews one of five in the new york times best for 2011 it was a good read i went through it in a matter of days spoiler alert the following discusses plot and character at the very beginning you learn that one of two boys teddy is going to die within the day basically a good kid with a bad one the bad one having him doing drugs including glue and freon type things to get high and the kid dies but not before he has his first sex with a girl eliza who is high on cocaine and basically gives sex out and does it to be nice to teddy on the first day they meet which is at a drunken party then the whole book is about the bad guy jude coming to be a good guy the girl becoming mature having the baby and teddy's in the closet brother who agrees to marry eliza as part of a sense of obligation to teddy the brother johnny is just played as a jerk not a whole lot good to say about him jude is kind of presented as someone we are supposed to like but repeatedly is another jerk he basically killed teddy even when he starts getting more sympathetic he steals weed from a dealer leaving bad repercussions all the way around then he takes a baseball bat to the person who harmed his mothers art glass bongs as a result this is the good guy eliza is more sympathetic but hard to believe she turns around so completely when she gets pregnant with teddy's child so i liked it but would not recommend it to others and did not really identify with anybody in the book instead i felt manipulated into semi liking people i would never like","327":"this review has been hidden because it contains spoilers to view it click here finally finished this book i had started it but then put it down to read something else and finally picked it back up to get through it there's a lot going on in this book death teenage pregnancy new york city in the 80s homelessness drugs the list goes on and on with that said i found the book okay it was great but it was good there were moments that seemed to drag and i was angry that teddy od'd within the first 50 pages making the book really not about him and jude like i thought finally finished this book i had started it but then put it down to read something else and finally picked it back up to get through it there's a lot going on in this book death teenage pregnancy new york city in the 80s homelessness drugs the list goes on and on with that said i found the book okay it was great but it was good there were moments that seemed to drag and i was angry that teddy od'd within the first 50 pages making the book really not about him and jude like i thought it was would about all in all i found the book slow at times but still fun to read because the new york backdrop of the book more","328":" this book has a lot of normal themes friendship betrayal family issues coming of age etc but uses late 1980s vermont and new york as the setting so you also get junkies wastoids the straight edge scene gays hare krishnas and hardcore teddy and jude are best friends 15 living in a smallish town getting high together and getting in mild trouble jude is adopted and teddy's dad is dead according to his mom one eventful new year's eve teddy dies of an overdose setting off a series of events which send jude to new york to live with his dad reconnect with teddy's older brother and his stepsister of sorts maybe nothing revolutionary happens but i appreciate that everything doesn't work out as one would expect","329":" another book that depicts a modern version of family not the traditional american nuclear variety but one based on love friendship and support the idea of family is woven throughout the book as a backdrop of kids from the wrong side of the tracks making a whole lot of bad choices this book took me back to my high school daze and while i wasn't as straight edge or screwed up as this riff raff i definintely had a few moments in the most pit that were like scenes described i love that lintonburg was an anagram for burlington and tomkins square park was so captured in that scary late 80s way jude was the perfect center for this story tender yet gravely flawed","330":"beautiful ambitious unforgettable book","331":"the first few pages really had me thinking that i wouldn't be able to get into this book wrong it's takes turns at times that i couldn't put it down the book is set in both vermont and new york city in the late 1980's and focuses on the life of teenager jude keffey horn and the loner cast of characters surronding him jude's best friend teddy dies not a spoiler so don't start jude is left to make sense of his life without his primary partner in crime i loved this book and would suggest to anyone wanting to read something grittier it gives a glimpse of the beginnings of the aids and housing crisis in new york under mayor koch as tell as the nyc punk music scene and drug usage","332":"kind of sad","333":"i will miss these characters i stayed up late reading and worrying for them like the mother of sons that i am waiting up for my boy out too late i feared i wouldn't be able to take this book because of how it starts but i loved it and am happy with the ending","334":"truly beautiful book i've been noticing lately how some authors have the gift of writing compassionately without judgement about their characters and their characters behavior ten thousand saints is a great example of that eleanor henderson has drawn her characters so accurately and with such sensitivity that you really come to love and care about them and their fate i didn't want this book to end i actually started to slow down near the end to prolong my reading experience im excited to see what else this author can show us as this is her first novel and she's only 26 or something when did i get so old","335":"all over a good book sometimes frustrating covers a lot of ground","336":"mediocre read i thought it would be more interesting if i was a teenager","337":" well any novel tangentially related to the early hardcore scene in new york is a 'must read' hi john i was interested enough in the characters to stick it out to find out what happens to them but i felt that overall the book was uneven between the first part of the story very intense i was totally engaged and everything else kind of felt like an endless trail of breadcrumbs to connect the dots of the narrative and reading it once was enough novel topic though pretty quick read good enough to take out of the library if you're looking for something different","338":" eleanor henderson in her debut novel ten thousand saints has created a novel in which no one character is a saint this novel reminded me in many ways of the movie american beauty in that every character is flawed in some unique way jude and teddy the two boys who are the main catalysts for the story are teenagers heavily into marajuana and being in an alternative world teddy takes a hit of coke from the mysterious eliza from new york and dies mere hours after having sex with eliza from a drug overdose jude numb from the experience of his friends death and life in general overwhelms his adopted mother clouded with doubt and remorse from jude's own adoption jude is sent to live with les his pot smoking father who has issues with his own past affairs eventually jude meets up with teddy's older straight edge brother johnny and is attracted to the lifestyle as jude moves closer towards embracing a straight edge lifestyle eliza returns to announce that she is pregnant with teddy's child this revelation sends all the characters on a dizzying carnival ride of band play weddings hiv and teenage pregnancy that doesn't abate until the final word of the final page what i liked about this book was that it doesn't just appeal to teens or adults but there's a certain universality in the story i could see this story appealing to the twenty thirty something crowd who grew up on harry potter who have maybe become a little more cynical in the years since it is very well written but like other reviewers i felt like thirty or so pages could've been shaved off the book but its' nothing that kills the story the characters in this story are no saints they are often quite hard to empathize with because they are so dark and gray to varying degrees which for a novel would rarely work because the audience typically wants a hero to root for and no one exactly leaps from the shadows to wear the superman cape but in this particular novel that approach worked and actually added to the raw authenticity ten thousand saints has","339":"i absolutely loved this book","340":"i knew nothing about the straightedge scene made popular by clean punk bands in 1980's nyc this is the background of ten thousand saints a coming of age book that doesn't hone its focus enough for the reader to truly delve into the soul of any one character the scenes are alive and well written but the novel never finds a singular voice and the ending seems more of the after thought that makes writing a satisfying epilogue so tricky","341":"this was a pretty easy read but henderson did a great job making you feel what it was like to grow up in the 80s this is a coming of age story for a few teenagers struggling to fit in in a new world of aids and drugs great transitions from rural vermont to nyc and back this was definitely a pleasure to read and i recommend it","342":"i can't believe i'm about to say this and mean it with a negative connotation but this book read kind of like a degrassi episode albeit with a bit more depth it's got all the makings of go there moments one group of teenagers can have thrown at them drugs sex teenage pregnancy aids jocks vs punks high school fights runaways dead friends overdoses dealing with being adopted there were so many issues that none of them had the chance to get fleshed out too much it is a book about a group of teenagers so i can forgive some of their selfishness and general unlikability but it was hard to empathize when just as someone was on the precipice of redeeming themselves they'd beat someone with a baseball bat or spew some homophobic garbage i did find it engaging throughout and it had some lovely moments hence the three stars but i think this really could have benefitted from focusing on any one of the individual characters and their journey rather than cramming it all in to one 300 page book","343":"stick with this book it gets better the first 80 pages or so are depressing and demotivating but the pacing picks up a coming of age story with a good collection of damaged teens and equally damaged parents","344":"this book probably deserved more than 3 stars but i read it during a particularly busy time and it took me forever to get through it coming of age story that combines teen pregnancy hippy culture skinheads and cults","345":"i may be partial to this coming of age epic because of that fact that it's backdrop is the 1980's straightedge hardcore movement but i honestly think this is the best ya novel i have ever read first it holds nothing back it does not pander to censorship and it isn't afraid to tell it like it is henderson knows that teens are aware of drugs sex homosexuality and diseases like fas and aids she isn't attempting to hide anything from the reader however if there are themes in the book that the reader may be unfamiliar with she does a beautiful job of explaining these things through her story her writing style is unique and descriptive her poetic voice will not leave you feeling bored or unemotional the story is an epic journey and it is about the coming of age of not only it's main character 15 year old jude heffy korn but of almost every other character jude finds through the death of his best friend teddy from over dosing and his search for his father straight edge no drugs sex or alcohol this is a movement that was popularized in the 80's and which still exists today although this transformation in jude's life seems like a good example for many teens henderson never allows herself to come off as didactic or preachy jude battles with straight edge and it's negative associations as well as the negative associations of the drug life that jude and his friends had previously lead henderson is also extremely accurate in her portrayal of nyc in the 80's the hardcore punk scene at that time and the straight edge movement she did her research and anyone who knows anything about these subject will appreciate that back to the story it is long and it has a lot of stages elements and changes this may be off putting for some readers but it is the reason i feel that it is of epic nature characters like the pregnant eliza the homosexual hardcore punker johhny and jude's parents all go through changes that are realistic beautiful beautiful and often times unexpected overall i would recommend this book to almost anyone but especially to high school aged students it's a heavy tale about growing up and making your own important decisions also it can't hurt to expose our young ones to some straight edge influence","346":"this book grew on me it's a very vivid picture of a group of kids growing up in vermont and new york in the eighties the writing is so gripping that although the first sentence of the book tells you that one of the main characters is about to die i still felt shocked when it happened","347":"a nyt 10 best books of 2011 i went into this expecting something dry and overly literary and was pleasantly surprised a bit hard to get into at first but worth the effort coming of age story of jude in late 80s new york and the straight edge punk movement 4 4 5 stars","348":"this book was really interesting to me since it covered a time and scene that was important to me at one time the punk scene in the 80s albeit in the book in ny not dc still i recognized many of the places in nyc having been there at the time and the bands i give it a 3 5 mostly because there were places where the writing felt like too much still a wonderful portrait of a time and place when a lot of different elements came together the aids epidemic straight edge gentrification in the city","349":"loved it and can 100% see it being made into a movie not that i care about the movie per se just that it seems to have all the right components to make it work on the big screen","350":"meh i find it hard to enjoy a book when i don't like the characters and i really didn't like any of these i totally understand the neglectful parenting of the time period though","351":" i really didn't like this book i literally had to force myself on and kept putting it down to read magazines or anything else i could get my hands on i think the characters were what put me off i wasn't sympathetic to any of them which is odd as the book was set in the 80's and that's my generation my dislike most definitely didn't have to do with the author's writing style or the structure of the story it seems rude to give a bad review somehow like i need to tell the author it's not you it's me lol","352":"this book really delved into the straight edge culture of the late 80s which i found interesting but somehow i just didn't really care about any of the characters i don't know why","353":" i'm the only person i know who said in all honesty i want to be a junkie when i grow up i spent a ridiculous amount of time as a teenager trying to figure out how to get high so it's probably safe to say that i never really understood the straight edge kids but i liked the music all punk and hardcore really not just the straight edge my apologies to my dad who suffered through many a mix tape at full volume at 7 am on the way to school but i was born too late in too small a town and i never got to see the grittier new york of yesteryear so this novel made me nostalgic for a past i don't have which is kind of a feat there are other themes in the book that resonated less with me the changing definition of family the absentee parent some other stuff i can't talk about without spoiling the story all of which run along pretty predictable story arcs none of the twists are particularly surprising but they're a comforting flavor of predictable all in all i enjoyed the book but i can't see re reading it","354":"the writing is gorgeous but i just wasn't that interested in the trials of tormented sweaty teenage boys in 1988 new york and vermont this book gave me flashbacks to the outsiders all those super pretty doomed young guys all those rumbles and beat downs i wonder if coppola has grabbed the movie rights yet","355":" \"ten thousand saints\" is a coming of age story that's close enough to \"a visit from the goon squad\" but not as amazingly brilliant and a tiny bit like \"freedom\" but luckily devoid of franzen's annoying self importance if you grew up in the 80's somewhere on the east coast of the us you will be able to relate to this book especially if your growing up involved drugs teenage pregnancies overdosing aids rock bands or straight edge movement if your adolescence was more conservative you can read this novel to learn all about what you missed out on in the end it doesn't matter what you did as a teenager it's just a phase of our lives when we think everything is so bloody important but eventually we get over it just like did the characters from 'ten thousand saints' and just like did the whole city new york got over the 80's the punk rock the needles and crack vials the book's strength comes from its portrait of the straight edge movement which on the surface seemed really different from anything that teenagers did but in reality it has the same extreme and obsessive quality to it that everything else that teenagers so often abandon themselves to it's just another way to rebel against your parents because let's remember that we're talking about the generation who had hippies for parents reading about sixteen year old teddy's death and its effect on lives of three teenagers is sure to cure your from any nostalgia you might've had about your high school times because being a teenager is a dirty and emotional affair the writing in \"ten thousand saints\" is very cinematographic when it comes to describe the scene but occasionally fails to create the atmosphere so the new york we see is more of a youtube video than a truly detailed picture yet if the subject interests you i'd certainly recommend it it is not a bad effort for a debut and it seems that henderson might have more talent than it shows here so look out for her in the future","356":"yet another book i thought i would like more than i did","357":" reading this book was a strange twisted trip down memory lane the author set her novel in the late 80's hardcore straight edge scene and it was a bit unsettling to delve into a world of which i was a part shortly after from the fights to the the krishna temples zines and shows the author managed to closely capture the attitudes within the scene with only a smidge of cliche i got so caught up in the setting that i didn't pay close attention to the actual plot at first but jude's journey and those of friends was so familiar that i couldn't help it","358":"good book learned about straight edge kids super weird and has a little bit of the history of punk music in ny but not enough if you ask me","359":" the premise was good coming of age new york in the eighties straight edge hardcore punks with tattoos but i wasn't convinced it didn't know what it wanted to be no real insight into the scene or the era and henderson's depiction of drugs was prissy and the dialogue was strained the whole thing could've used some serious editing it wasn't awful or anything but by the end of it all i felt very little which is not ideal as the cover is classy and new york times seems to have been wetting itself about it","360":"i have never giving any written work lower than three stars but this book i don't really have anything to say about it maybe i missed something but there wasn't much of a story line it was more like a biography of teenage boy","361":"good plot interesting to think of the harcore boys in the late 80's and where they end up love a good book with a great soundtrack","362":" i couldn't wait to write this review because i was so impressed with this book by the time i finished the first two chapters this is the kind of book i'm going to be thinking about for a long time the kind of book i was looking forward to reading and stayed up late in the night this is realist fiction at its best i loved these characters and their heartbreakingly stupid decisions i loved how they kept doing all the wrong things and through sheer grace also doing all the right things it was well written engaging original and it taught me about the seedy underbelly of new york in the 1980's alphabet city and thompkins square i lived in new york in the 80's but i never ventured to those places too scary by far for me i also loved learning all about the straight edge rock scene this book did all the right things it's going to be the kind of book people will be talking about for a long time i can't say enough to recommend it just stop reading this and go read it","363":"it's hard to explain why this story of dropped out kids of dropped out parents is as good as it is i was drawn in to the story of jude johnny and eliza and came to care about them very much ultimately the book is about adoption and finding oneself in a world where no one has an intact family accordingly the central characters have a lot to overcome and how they succeed or fail in making up for their familial losses not to mention their self inflicted wounds is very much at the heart of the story","364":"engaging but i'm a little surprised the nyt picked it as one of the top five books of the year maybe it was a slow year for fiction the book was a little rambling a lot improbable and the ending didn't really hold together for me i'd probably give it 3 1 2 stars","365":" this book was engrossing and interesting to pair with sarah schulman's the gentrification of the mind since both center around the east village losaida in the 1980s but i guess i'm frustrated that in both of these books there's not a single reference to the public housing communities that are scattered throughout alphabet city and condensed along the eastern side of avenue d it's more egregious in schulman's since her book focuses explicitly on gentrification in physical space and in discourse and marginalized now lost radical queer communities it's something that most people wouldn't notice but the invisibility of public housing communities in popular and academic literature about the time period is very disheartening aside from that it's an enjoyable and sometimes very moving novel about youth culture during a really turbulent time in nyc's history a time that i think is difficult to write about without relegating it to colorful background or cheapening it in eleanor henderson's writing the neighborhood felt like its own character and it felt respectfully written","366":"really it was ok it made me want to listen to the complete discography of minor threat on the way to work one day last week i have to stop reading these nyt book review front pagers because they're always just ok and nothing more","367":" straight edge punk rock drugs sobriety teen pregnancy hare krishna adoption fetal alcohol syndrome overdosing aids pot homelessness riots mosh pits mushrooms gay straight marrying jeezum crow say it all really fast and if doing so doesn't seem like too much for a story then you'll probably like this if it seems like a bit much then you might want to put it back on the shelf or read it in small doses it's good but there's a lot going on and with so many different threads some of the characters get a little lost in the shuffle along the way the first 1 3 of the book i read in one sitting the remaining 2 3 i took a week to finish i think i overdosed on the whole jeezum crow utterance no more no more","368":"great characters and a cool glimpse into a subculture","369":"amazing story about a straight edge pregnancy and a great mid 1980s portrait of nyc","370":"awesome read fun angsty coming of age set against the weirdo subgenre of straight edge punk great characters here","371":" we read this book for a faculty book club that i've involved in and the author actually visited our college campus to read a selection from it i truly enjoyed her talk and her discussion of her inspiration for the story the book was really a step outside my comfort zone which in the end i found to be a good thing however i never would have finished it were it not for the book club it was a frustrating read the kids in the book are into all kinds of stuff they should not be into i found myself wanting to shake them and scream please make good choices but they weren't and sure enough it blew up in their faces it gets 3 stars because i did like her style of writing i e it was engaging and i did find myself caring about what happened to the characters halfway through but i'm not sure i'd recommend this to anyone the author herself said that she probably wouldn't let her now infant son read it until he was at least 16 and probably not until he was 18","372":"anyone who lived even for a short period of time in or around the east village st marks tompkins et al in the 1980s will be especially taken with this insightful novel of wayward lives","373":"this book moved me in a way that few others in the past five years have i cannot recommend it enough","374":"more interested in the setting than the storyline","375":"great book mostly set in nyc in the early punk music days also is set in vermont hippie days it is a good book about friendships families the mistakes we make and growing up","376":" picked this off a list of 'best reads of 2011' i liked the story and the way it was written but it lacked a certain something i think apart from jude and johnny the rest of the characters were ciphers especially eliza and prudence whom i thought could have better parts of the story i'd have like to have had some counterpoint with eliza and rooster for example to show how conflicted mr clean was i was also slightly annoyed with some of the ideas that floated into the story then floated out again jude's fas could have been explored a little more perhaps or how prudence becomes jude like in her waywardness as jude moved in the other direction on the other hand the way that addictive personalities swap being addicted to drugs alcohol with being addicted to non addiction came over really well along with the 'straight edge' ethos perhaps being used to mask some deeper insecurities the ending of the book was tied up in a logical manner and i'd have gladly read a few chapters that filled in jude's path from angry teenager to contented father but the symbols of literally the end of an era were well described and illustrated the changes from no go area to gentrification very well","377":"the story of jude and teddy while 15 year old teddy dies in the first few pages he drives the actions of jude his best friend eliza pregnant by teddy and johnny his half brother these teenagers are bound together by teddy they are filled with angst over teddy and also over who they are the parents are also an interesting study the last chapter leaves you guessing and wondering and wanting to know what happened to everyone","378":"i was actually fairly disappointed in this book while there were sections that were beautifully written i was disappointed in how often the author spent so much time leading the reader to an emotional moment only to immediately fast forward the book several weeks denying the reader any emotional payoff considering this book is probably 100 pages too long there is a lot of lead up to a lot of nothing unfortunately while i did enjoy the theme of family and how destructive the concept can be on an individual it was just too heavy handed for me for a much better look at the straight edge movement and those who adopted the lifestyle i would recommend nothing feels good","379":" though i started this book with great anticipation i quickly found myself questioning whether or not i was enjoying henderson's writing style i also wasn't too pleased with the very shallow treatment given to the friendship between the two boys nor with the death which was in my opinion glossed over in favor of the resulting outcome i eventually settled into it and came to terms with the fact that henderson was trying to somehow write a book more about the punk hardcore culture and its rendition of the human condition than simply a novel of tragedy conflict and resolution unfortunately although i did leave the book with some lingering binary conflict i feel like she fell short of a truly wide ranging emotionally disturbing novel about american subculture and instead fell too much to one side of the line she was trying to walk overall i enjoyed the book and would recommend it as a light summer read but will most likely not reread it myself","380":"engrossing story about some wayward teens in new york city interesting view into a world i had no experience in a little too long at times but good","381":"a very well written novel exploring the cultural of the 80s from burlington vt to n yc male friendship family structure drugs music and pregnancy form the nucleus of this extremely fast paced work maybe the music tour goes on too long but it is certainly a memorable journey back to the 80s","382":"the second sentence of ten thousand saints gives you a pretty good idea of what the rest of the novel is going to be like beneath the stadium seats of the football field on the last morning of 1987 and the last morning of teddy's life the two boys jude and teddy lay side by side a pair of snow angels bundled in thrift store parkas i mean as soon as i read that i thought oh it's that kind of book i wasn't preemptively judging my opinion of it because i wasn't sure yet if it would be a good truth and bright water or bad a home at the end of the world example of that kind of book only recognizing that it belonged in the category i do think ten thousand saints kind of falls apart at the end and not in the good way and there is something fundamentally ridiculous about the male characters and their commitments i mean i dare you not to think of that one part in scott pilgrim any time straight edge comes up which is a lot and something sort of weird about singing songs about how totally sober you are these kids would be so much happier if they were three years younger and into grunge you know so there is that stuff yes also considering the sheer amount of stuff packed into the book it's worth noting that the whole action of the story takes place over 9 months it feels grander in scope most novels would stretch these stories out over years i think but then again henderson is writing about teenagers and teenagers want everything right now don't they i was never very good at being a teenager but i am pretty impatient myself and i probably was the same at 16 they make stupid decisions and they make a lot of them very quickly one after another they feel things very deeply the book is fueled by teddy's death teddy being one half of an intense drug addled too worried about being gay to be entirely straight teenage friendship try not to roll your eyes every time the teenage male misogyny comes through because you might strain something and there is something so american isn't there about joining in a subculture that says drugs sex alcohol absolutely not violence is a okay though go punch someone it's like they are saying to each other anything is better than admitting women are people too the history of patriarchy right there henderson by the way should have done more with the women and girls in her book particularly prudence i don't think a slightly wider focus a slightly loose grasp would have hurt it at all actually the counterpoint and the inverted journeys would have been really interesting here i am complaining but really i appreciated and enjoyed ten thousand saints very much henderson maintains enough distance from the characters that you mostly don't want to kill them and her prose is lovely most of the time and it's elegiac without being sentimental which is hard to do","383":" file this book under i can't believe i wasted five days of my reading life on this book and be forewarned this review can be titled tell us what you really think chris after a streak of four star books some of which may end up in my \"best of\" pile for 2011 i selected a dud i picked this up last week after seeing it on the new york times's \"best of 2011\" list it was one of the top five fiction books of the year sadly that wasn't the case with me a first time novelist henderson brings us into the 1980s where two sixteen year old boys with no real parents or direction in life attend a new year's eve party and one dies of a drug overdose i'm not giving anything away it's on the jacket this leads to a series of life events that takes the main character jude his sister's name is prudence from vermont to new york city and back and forth throughout the book henderson creates this world of \"straight edged\" young people vegans no drugs punk rock and hippie dippie out of touch parents her writing is very good and i oddly enough found this a compelling and quick read yet i couldn't care for any of the main characters i wondered why certain things happened and she kept introducing outsiders into the intimate circle letting them in for a minute then having them exit fairly quickly while there was one main story there were several stories off of that which in the end were resolved but i found distracting i grew up in vermont in the 1970s and 1980s as is portrayed in this book and while i know there is the general perception that everyone ate brown rice let their children run around naked and everyone was free to be you and me i felt her some of her illustrations were based more on stereotypes instead of reality certainly there were are people like that and i'm not sure if she grew up here her main city is based on burlington and although all names were changed she definitely has a familiarity with the city but it saddened me that she chose to go the route of pot smoking orgy going parents who let their children do what they want of course i need to let this go but it sort of raised my ire i almost never finish books i'm not enjoying but i kept with this hoping for some sort of glimmer of light or at least a reward for finishing this terribly depressing and dark read never happened","384":"i thought this book was a great story with great characters that you care about and are conflicted about with touching family roots heritage themes and it's set largely in 1980s manhattan what's not to like","385":" review for author exposure http www authorexposure com 2011 08 new year's eve 1987 in rural mundane lintonburg vermont appears an unlikely setting for the synergistic events which tragically unfold in henderson's debut novel best friends teddy and jude have no desire to be part of the in crowd and on jude's 16th birthday they unceremoniously celebrate its beginnings in their usual manner searching for cheap accessible substances to get high eliza nyc uptown girl hooks up with jude and teddy hoping to meet her self absorbed mother's beau's estranged family--jude his sister prudence and his mother harriet both boys are attracted to eliza who immediately sets her sights on teddy not formally invited to the lintonburg a list party of the year they clandestinely wander along the edges of crowded rooms in search of drinks separating from each other eliza and teddy slip away behind a locked door where eliza's cocaine stash further ignites teddy's sexual fantasy overwhelmed by guilt for leaving jude alone while he experiences his first cocaine high and sexual initiation teddy quickly refocuses and searches for jude though suspicious of their prolonged absence jude is relieved when he finally sees eliza board her bus ostensibly enroute to a planned skiing trip unaware that cocaine and freon are a deadly mix teddy's freon trip ends not only a bizarre evening but also his life and guilt ridden jude drifts into daily drug induced oblivion in an effort to save jude from self destruction his aging hippie father agrees to take him to his east village loft optimistic that his adopted son will respond to nyc's vibrancy and mend his body and spirit jude undergoes a 360 degree turnaround from dropout druggie to hardcore punk he becomes a straight edge musician under johnny's teddy's half brother tutelage making harried road trips with his band meanwhile eliza's unexpected pregnancy leads to a dubious marriage to johnny who ambivalently desires to raise teddy's child the tragedy of teddy's death casts a painful lingering specter upon the three families whose personal lives ceaselessly connect until their disparate judgment day liberates them from a relentless bondage the fortuitous exorcism from the haunting circumstances of teddy's death finally provides release allowing jude eliza and johnny to feel free to live their own lives quite a bit to chew and digest in ten thousand saints a vividly accurate depiction of the east village's hardcore punk and straight edge scene laced with drugs the hare krishna movement the public emergence and denial of the aids epidemic openly gay relationships the tompkins' square park riot in alphabet city and homeless people fighting the proposed gentrification of their minute spaces for those of us who missed or were oblivious to this counterculture in the late 1980s ten thousand saints is a unique eye opening revelation i was rather surprised how quickly i moved from page to page and how much i remembered and how much i didn't in addition to the obviously well researched facts eleanor henderson's ambitious debut clearly presents memorable characters with decisive accuracy and authentic sentiment without a doubt this is an author to watch ...hey dad said my name isn't from that hippie song he said it's from the saint... ...i guess it's both but really we gave you the name because of what it means... ...when they brought you to me ten days old i couldn't believe you were finally mine i was so grateful you were like a little bundle that had just fallen from the heavens and i thought jude in hebrew it means 'praise ' or 'thanks'... 372","386":"it felt researched to me although i wanted to love it","387":" after the first 100 pages i nearly gave up so much of this pretty much young adult novel seemed inauthentic to me so much of the language sounded like me trying to explain drug culture to a group of teenagers rather than someone who's actually experienced these drugs would also why keep most of the vt towns and landmarks unchanged but disguise burlington and church st by the middle i did start to care for these characters and wanted to see where they ended up the closing chapter was done too hastily and tied up in too perfect a bow this was more like 2 5 stars for me","388":" i thought this book had a beauty to it in it's darkness and it's light at times it get's a tad bogged down and i was disappointed with the ending too hasty for me i felt i to was taken on a road trip along with the young ones trying to find their way and a better way though i did feel a distant observer flawed struggling human beings young and old looking for a better life or in denial of their life handled with great empathy addictions we see the destruction they can cause and what people think are positive addictions which of course can be just as destructive the eighties a time of great change sadness and joy as a parent of two young adults in their 20's i have seen many a young one struggle with similar issues to the characters in this book and many make it to the light but sadly not all overall i could not put this book down","389":"3 5 probably an interesting story about some extraordinarily dysfunctional people","390":"i abandoned this at 50 pages i wasn't enjoy the tone of the story and could not relate to the characters or the content if you like stories about young kids drug addict parents no prospects who spend their day wandering aimlessly and taking drugs then you might like this book","391":"not what i expected it's nice to read a book with a happy ending so many of today's books would have ended with everyone miserable or dead it's nice to see these kids grow up and live life","392":" superb writing style disturbing story teenagers overdosing dying on a cold vermont new year back to the land hippie parents doing too much dope smoking too much weed in search of a center that holds and their children as a flower child myself i kept reacting with omg is this what my generation did to its children lost without roots unfeeling willing to cut themselves just to feel something man of man the harikrishnas were the saviors in this so intense story they grew up these kids in henderson's ten thousand saints and made some kind of peace with life but what a long strange trip and a lot of it on the straight edge of being","393":"this review has been hidden because it contains spoilers to view it click here streets of new york city and the drug scene in the 80's story of eliza jude and johnny","394":"reads like a patchett novel slightly morose slightly drawn out and even tempered","395":" chosen by my on line book club \"ten thousand saints\" by eleanor henderson is about abandonment adoption fetal alcohol syndrome abortion bullying hiv and homosexuality the focus is on young teen jude whose hippy parents smoke and sell marijuana jude's father shares his pot with jude but advises jude to never get high before he takes his sats because of teddy jude's best friend who died from a combo of drugs jude joins a group of straight edge teens in new york city led by teddy's brother mr clean teddy's brother at first appears to be a saint helping hundreds of kids say no to drugs alcohol and sex but mr clean hides a terrible secret from his friends and followers it was satisfying to see jude mature and become perhaps the wisest character in the book","396":" i'll admit i probably largely enjoyed this book because of the gritty new york setting anything reasonably well written that's set in alphabet city in the 1980s is going to capture my attention also an evocative though shallow description of early straight edge culture and a provocative exploration of what ties individuals together and the bonds that last and those that don't ultimately a bit unfulfilling however some how lacking the ability to fully draw you into the characters and their lives still it prompted reflection on my part and was an engrossing read so definitely worth reading as far as i'm concerned","397":"i'm clearly in the publishing industry inner loop yep reading a book that is expected to be published in 2011 my copy had sections such as rave internal reviews that are placeholders for outside reviews and the back cover lists all the publicity activities the publisher is doing rather than summarizing the book yep i'm a mover and shaker actual truth i'm signed up for an awesome book club courtesy of my brother and sister in law so why am i focusing on the pre publication status of the book it's about teenagers doing so many horrible things that it turned me into a nervous wreck thinking about how to keep abby from getting into similar trouble in 15 years that said it is really well written and the author introduces the characters so well that you dread finding out what disasters are heading their way","398":"it must be a generational thing but i couldn't sustain interest in any of the characters in this novel what an aimless lot what unexamined lives even the author seemed bored with them by the time she finished with them","399":"book club for may","400":"amazing novel words can't do it justice but i loved it","401":"before i read ten thousand saints i had no idea that such a thing as straight edge punk existed and for that alone it's earned its two stars but alas i can't give it anything higher than that because halfway into the novel i was bored out of my mind i didn't care about what happened to the characters it became a chore to finish which was a shame since it had a promising premise","402":"i'm not sure how i feel about this book as a whole but the ending was very unsatisfying","403":" my study of multiple character pov stories and pure impulsive curiosity led me to eleanor henderson's ten thousand saints and i'm very glad it did it's the story of a handful of teenagers wandering through a shaky time in their lives careening off their various tracks and into each other this makes it sound like a story that would meander in its telling one of those coming of age tomes that becomes too enamored of its self reflection to stay on track but it's not for more go to http annotationnation wordpress com","404":"a total bummer well written and interesting as an historical fiction piece but full of unredeemable and or depressing characters i did not enjoy this also the depictions of vermont seemed to come from someone who spent a very small amount of time there and didn't quite get it to an actual vermonter this was grating like listening to a brit do a bad american accent","405":"i did not find the characters credible or the plot jude one of the main characters is given fetal alcohol syndrome for no apparent reason that's just dumped in his father is a dope dealer but we're supposed to believe that he's a good father at least a loving one i found this novel hard to get through","406":"it was sad but good","407":"i loved this book and not just for the pitch perfect way it captured the bygone era of of the hardcore scene and the grit of the lower east side of new york in the early 80s it's a book with a lot of heart and well drawn characters awkwardly and painfully coming of age a great read and great writing","408":" i read this book solely because part of the plot hinged on hardcore straight edge punks u0026amp i was like whaaaaat i wanted to see exactly how that took shape u0026amp how the author handled it u0026amp i must say well done she did a really nice job of capturing my preconceptions of the atmosphere of the lower east side squatter scene before new york started getting crazy gentrified i will also say that this is another novel i picked up in order to give myself a break from reading nothing but books about babies pregnancy birth etc u0026amp wouldn't you fucking know it one of the very few prominent female characters in the book gets pregnant u0026amp a huge chunk of the plot is all about her pregnancy u0026amp who is going to step up to be a father figure to the kid once it is born because it's actual father dies like the night of conception let's see if i can remember the plot teenage boy lives with hippie parents in vermont he's kind of a rapscallion all into skateboarding u0026amp huffing u0026amp stuff he u0026amp his bff go to a party one night accompanied by the hippie kid's father's girlfriend's foxy teenage daughter teenage daughter does cocke with the friend u0026amp they bone in the bathroom hippie kid u0026amp friend proceed to pass out in the snow friend dies hippie kid kind of goes bananas u0026amp finds solace in the straight edge scene to which he is introduced by dead friend's extremely hardcore older brother teenage daughter is knocked up u0026amp they tell the parental figures that hardcore older brother is the dad there's all this stuff with protests in tompkins square park u0026amp going on tour i don't know once the characters are established things get a little plotless i guess everyone is just kind of waiting around for teenage daughter to give birth as a pregnant lady myself i can vouch for the fact that this process is kind of a huge snore i liked it i guess i mean seriously probably just because i am a sucker for stuff about underground punk scenes that seem like they were written by someone who actually knows anything about it like at one point the punks all collaborate on a zine together i was like whoa zines it's hard for me to imagine someone like i don't know my partner's mom or my therapist or someone reading this book u0026amp being really into it though i just don't know who the audience is","409":"if you were part of generation x can hum at least one song by the misfits know the straight edge rules understand that a couple with a son named jude might also have a daughter named prudence then this book is a must read","410":"this review has been hidden because it contains spoilers to view it click here one day i hope someone will write something about

ambiguity about it there were times when i f one day i hope someone will write something about the late 20th century east village and not end it with and then the addiction center was replaced by a

was refreshing and the rest of the book which is nicely written has a similar pleasant ambiguity about it there were times when i feared a too pat resolution to one situation or another was looming and then it dissolved into the unresolved mush that makes up most people's actual lives more","411":" wonderful i was enthralled by henderson's insightful juxtaposition of the 1960s counterculture and the 1980s straight edge scene she provides a realistic portrayal of those who have pursued the ideals of both and ultimately fallen short and she doesn't shy away from themes concerning generational shifts in youth culture particularly strong i think is her consideration of the straight edge music scene as a response to or form of rebellion against flower child parents i liked everything about this debut novel","412":" i enjoyed this book start to finish enjoyed in the way it made me consider the characters their relationships and the setting i really loved the new york parts because i lived in nyc in the late 80s and had a fascination with the lower east side and alphabet city i still think about my visits there so much so it was really interesting to read a book set in that very time and place i really warmed up to jude as the story went on and found something to like in every character not necessarily something to love but definitely i found them all compelling and with redeeming qualities really found the last several chapters to form a satisfying ending","413":"this book confounded me i liked it i hated it i had to put it down i couldn't put it down similar in style to patti smith's just kids which of course had the sexiness of celebrity attached to it ten thousand saints explored a sub culture that cuts open the music drug and violence scene like a vein that bleeds black it's ugly it scares every parent and then leaves them with a sense of relief if they and their kid made it through there were moments during reading when i had the urge to cringe when i wanted to put sunglasses on and somehow experience the story shielded","414":"really good excellent characters she nailed northeast coming of age in the 80s ugh","415":"at times this book rated 3 5 for some intriguing wrting but not overall it was rated one of the 10 best books by the new york times so i was excited to start 1980's punk rock sex drugs and rock u0026amp roll scene in vermont and new york okaaay coming of age story with really messy characters frayed tangle of family memebers multiple mothers fathers half sisters and brothers lots of fighting and gay life in the punk scene and after all that i really disliked how it ended","416":"covers a little written subject the straight edge movement slow at parts i would have enjoyed this book more if i were more familiar with music or drug culture","417":" pretty good coming of age book and henderson did a good job of expressing all the various emotions that go with all the struggles add in the culture of the 1980s and it makes a good read it's henderson's debut novel so i think it was a little over peppered with every thought and idea she's had over the years the narrator's voice matured after the first few chapters thankfully because while reading those first few chapters i quickly tired of the description of what i assume is henderson's high school town a la burlington vt and sophomoric names for places but settle all this down and i think her next novel will be even better i think the cover artwork could have been better","418":"a hiatus to downtown manhattan of the 80's a reminder of the passion and craziness we felt as teens great character descriptions the writing flows easily until the last few chapters why the jumping around the sudden shift in narration why the seemingly abrupt end","419":" i took this on a small vacation to a lake so i was forced to read it and got 3 4 of the way through the book had great potential but sorely lacked exploring the emotional beats of the story there are some big things that happen but they are casually treated which takes away the punch the only believable character for me was les the pot slinging parent who believes snfu and had a gun under the sink not sure how straight edge folks and hare krishna devotees fit either they are a cult and don't really encourage free thinkers","420":"ambitious explores a great deal of social issues bittersweet spot on eighties pop culture details and sibling banter excellent historical and geographical detailing initially the detailed accounts of recreational drug use made me reluctant to read on i am so glad i persevered i was rewarded with an in depth touching story definitely a new york city education definitely a life lesson a reminder that our decisions carry consequence but also that there is also a new day hopeful refreshing","421":"i thought this to be an interesting novel on parenting or how not to be a parent while the teenage characters do quite well in forging their own futures it remains difficult for them because they lack support the adult characters i found to be selfish and immature while they are wholly realistic it paints a grim future for parenting that said i really appreciated the character of jude who matures greatly during the novel and was glad toi find him well at the very end overall this is a fine novel of friendship","422":" i have massive respect for eleanor henderson who seemingly made up a world to submerge myself into every character seemed to come alive in their respectable rearing and the small town grit is something i know that big city history that riot induced violence the love afraid to flourish i know it all it is one of the most interesting well written novels i have ever read i guess in the end i didn't need loads of resolve thrown at me to know these characters ended up ok i just liked the cold hard truth that eleanor served i liked the reality that there is not always a fairy tale ending life just happens i liked the way she also tied everything together plucking moments of fictionary past and tendrils of history and feelings of present to introduce a story worth reading expand that third eye a little and read this","423":"80s teenagers hormones drugs nyc and vt death life redemption friendship kinship loss betrayal and love somehow all are woven into a cohesive narrative as gripping and pure nest as the air we breath not for all novel lovers but give it a try you may be surprised at how quickly you are pulled into this seemingly distant world","424":"meh i was surprised it was a top 5 pick by the nytimes but really a book about young teens dealing with drugs sex in the early 80s nyc eh i preferred let the great world spin","425":" for most of its length i thought this was a four star book but the ending began to feel busy and yet somehow unsatisfying like the author was frantically trying to provide closure and none of her attempts felt satisfying this is a well written debut work of literary fiction in which exciting things deaths break ups epiphanies fistfights actually happen which makes it a rare and colorful bird the action takes place in vermont and the east village in the late 1980s the parents of the teenagers are aging hippies and the teens are turning away from drugs and exploring the hardcore straight edge scene there is also a subplot having to do with the aids epidemic but unfortunately the author doesn't do as much with that theme the plot structure is a bit shambling but one character's pregnancy puts an implicit deadline on whatever realizations the teens are going to have overall i enjoyed this as a tour of the east village in the 1980s","426":"i mean i finished it","427":"this is probably good literature in its way about our times but i could not relate left me well it left me","428":"outstanding descriptions that put you in place thin storyline parents were more interesting than kids","429":" i devoured this book over three days why the way it traveled back to nyc of the late 80s when i first moved to the city was wonderful it really brought back the sights smells and people of the city especially the straight edge scene something that i've never read about in such an honest and vivid way i kept watching videos of the bands mentioned to bring the words to life still i was disappointed at how many improbable turns the story took and how many issues it tackled and how many characters it introduced in an unwieldy way so much happens to these characters it's absurd and by the end it was exhausting but most disappointing is how little we get to know about the real johnny especially as the story progresses to me his life is the most fascinating and the one i wanted to know more about he is such a central figure in most of the book but by the last chapters he has almost completely disappeared as if the author didn't know what to do with him it's a shame it actually made me angry and sad that i got through the whole book and this fascinating man's life is left unexplored in such a dismissive way","430":"great story a look into alphabet city in the 80's that adds to what i saw in rent","431":"still not entirely sure how i feel about this book","432":"this book by uva alum eleanor henderson was selected for a uva club book club event the book has some ambiguity which i think will enliven our event i think some of the characters were under explored specifically eliza","433":"the book as a whole was ok the ending was a disappointment","434":"an enjoyable story of the lives of young people in the 1980's in ny and vermont","435":"i saw this recommended someplace of course i can't remember where now i requested it from our local library and upon reading the jacket copy put it at the bottom of the stack of books i'd brought home i thought it would be the least engaging of the three books i planned to read much to my surprise once i started reading it i could not put it down before i started the book i thought the action took place in a milieu and among people i couldn't relate to but eleanor henderson makes her characters if not likeable at least relatable there are parents here who come from different ends of the socioeconomic spectrum but who all want the same thing the best sest of options for their children there are kids from the same set of places who all want the same thing a chance at love at life at freedom and choice while their choices and actions might not be mine henderson was able to make me see beyond the plot and into the watch out tedious undergraduate lit paper theme coming up deeper universality of the human experience from rural vermont to 1987's new york city hardcore scene every detail and bit of dialogue rings true i can't wait to see what eleanor henderson does next","436":"reading the first few pages i found myself squirming at the prospect of 300 more pages of another coming of age story this time about a brooding teenage protagonist that gets high on cleaning products and tailpipes and his journey to \"find himself\" after the loss of his friend another unlikeable loser named teddy but after the first couple chapters of your standard young adult fiction fare forced urine drinking and adolescent coke snorting the story fortunately took a turn for the better this after introducing a pair of unconventional but well intentioned and awesome hippie parents a 'vee' gan tattoo artist with a predilection for activities catholics would call unsavory and an unexpected bun in the oven however the most interesting aspect was the author's choice of the 80s straight edge punk movement as the backdrop for the book though any setting could've been used in its place with straight edge it tried to set itself apart as being a way to express one's individuality in a productive manner but ultimately it was just another outlet with the same excess and indulgent qualities that teenagers tend to embrace to feel accepted the way in which the movement is described probably reflecting henderson's own first hand experiences gives the story a fascinating and believable world for the characters to cause havoc in despite the ambitious length and delicate line that comes with writing about teenage angst without sounding too cliched and trite henderson is able to make the read interesting enough to see how it will play out","437":"great book henderson has a gift for creating the kind of characters that stick with you that you're reluctant to say goodbye to when you finish the last page her sentences are vivid and fun to read and she really breathes life into the milieu of late 1980s vermont and nyc i look forward to reading more novels by this author","438":"this book was interesting enough to keep me reading but overall it left me a little disappointed once i finished it she did a good job writing about the history of new york punk rock and the straight edge movement which i found interesting","439":"the av club review called this book unsentimental and i wasn't sure how that was going to work for me the answer is well unsentimental means that the book is devoid of moralistic scolding but also that it does not romanticize this is refreshing and rare in a book about a subculture y scene","440":" a punk rock feel good story another debut novel by an mfa ten thousand saints is tolerable by the solid focus on characters the story is solid well constructed with no plot holes errors inconsistencies and so on mostly because she keeps the main cast relatively small dispenses with extra people cleanly and only hints at very light foreshadowing the little things seem to work out pretty well for our main characters and the big things despite their protests end up working out in a logical way too no real surprises no real problems which ultimately makes the book rather average the biggest thing that stood out to me was that it was clear that the author became very interested in a subject that related to some of her personal history and then spent time exploring and researching it it stands out more because you get the impression that she did not actually live through any of these experiences herself so it's part awe part incorporating research but mostly it reads like an outsider writing about a subject i'll elaborate without using a spoiler early in the story jude is playing his nes she talks about super mario bros as if mario were in a real world falling off a cliff finding his secret coins and the musical sound they make these are all true but no one who grew up playing video games would ever describe the game as such similarly at one point she says that jude drops his game control and then later his game controller no it's just a controller the same comes up later for punk someone who lived through the punk movement not myself would probably find the book quite humorous similarly this book is essentially written for someone who has the same background as the author apparently has an outsider interested in a glimpse inside there's nothing wrong with that of course and the story is enjoyable but since her group of characters are ultimately good guys there's little gravity in the situation or rather you can tell what the gravity is within the first few chapters and it pans out as such and it's resolved nine months later maybe we needed more teddy in the story as in the actual person not just talking about him three or more characters end up caring very deeply about the guy yet know nothing about him and since we don't know anything about him either the emotions invested in him miss the mark maybe more of a summer reading book or someone who's looking for a book that deals with subjects that are off the beaten path will enjoy the book a great deal as i said above there's nothing wrong with the book it's solid but there's not a lot that makes me excited about the book either","441":"this is another book that has good writing but i'm just not personally crazy about the subject matter henderson depicts the late 80s teenage life sex drugs and rock and roll could it happen just read patty smith's memoir to know it could","442":"maybe because it was set in the 80s maybe because a friend of mine was into the hardcore straight edge scene or maybe because it was just well written but i really liked this one","443":"ok whipping up a glass wine for this review here the gist of it is i liked the book it was entertaining and nowhere did i stop to check how many pages were left except for y'know control issues who doesn't love a bildungsroman martin eden the cather in the rye vernon god little anyone but as other reviewers wrote before me this is an incredibly packed book it doesn't do justice to most of its characters and definitely not to the protagonists jude wonders why should he care for this person why is he doing this he doesn't know the thing is neither do i there is not one metamorphosis for jude but two he changes his quirks abruptly and it definitely cannot be all attributed to the inciting incident it leaves you wondering why you should care for what is clearly just a character not a person coming to life before you what the book does however very effectively is deliver you into a different state of mind by touching upon so many points and leaving you dizzy it delivers the message it's all fucked up and it's kind of ok","444":"amazing brilliant heartbreaking thrilling captured the moment the era the scene so well","445":"nice piece of contemporary fictiontoo much drug use for my likingauthor was best when allowing the characters to interact rather than detailing characters' thoughts on events","446":" when ny mag put this book in both the highbrow and brilliant section of their approval matrix i decided this book had already received so much acclaim and i was hooked by the first few paragraphs on amazon's look inside i barreled through this book at a brisk pace stopping only for menial things like work meetings and looking up when i crossed the street a lot of ten thousand saints reminded me of a visit from the goon squad partially because of the punk rock themes but also for the styles the gentle flow of the narrative and the beautifully constructed sentences a few things bothered me structurally during the book but overall i began to truly feel for the characters and hope and wish for them to succeed the last bit truly reminded me of goon squad though sadly who is to say who wrote which book first","447":"i really liked this book it makes me sad that it had so many negative reviews but everyone has different opinions i loved how busy the book was but at the same time it wasn't ever confusing it was almost like a movie with all the different characters stories everything tied in together though and all of the characters emotions were shared equally it was a really good read","448":" possessing little more than a pedestrian's knowledge of the straight edge scene in 1980's nyc it is hard to say how genuine henderson's portrayal was to what really happened in and around thompkins square but that really doesn't matter the story is really about the universal fear and despair of being left adrift the story doesn't dwell it isn't stuck in a muck of dour depression but is an impressive view into a way of life that is so simple to fall into but so hard to escape it becomes easy to see why so many straight edge kids cling tightly to a way of life wavering between piety and self destruction because it offers a sense of purpose belonging and structure at a time in their lives when it is so urgently needed henderson's ability to write both from the female and male perspectives convincingly is inspiring and helped sell a very earnest story that could have easily derailed into a pandering mess","449":"started off strong devolved into a dull narrative about flat characters","450":"i really liked it and i really wanna see the movie that's being shot i think a lot of things will change starting from asa's hair but i can wait and see","451":" i've been trying all day to think of the best way to express my feelings about ten thousand saints by eleanor henderson who would have thought that a novel about mixed up teenagers trying to score the next high would be so absolutely inspiring i was intrigued i was curious and because i really don't like foul language i nearly stopped reading the book after the first few pages but i was genuinely shocked by how much i loved this novel i loved this novel it's almost 1988 jude is sixteen years old and spends most of his time with his best friend teddy trying to score their next high until teddy dies of an overdose as jude slips deeper into depression his parents act to save him and the father he hasn't seen for years invites him to live with him in new york city once in new york jude hooks up with teddy's older brother who is part of the straight edge movement while his hippie parents are baffled drugs they understand this new clean life style they do not and worried jude rides the next high new york city in the late 80's is raw dark and seedy even those who are straight edge and don't drink smoke or do drugs live a life filled with violence and grime while i grew up in the eighties and was only a few years younger than jude and his friends this is a world and culture i never saw and don't understand yet henderson writes with a beauty and passion that opens this world to the reader the characters are rich and so deeply troubled the teenage angst is at times painful and yet i hoped with a parent's hope that jude and eliza and his other friends would survive and eventually thrive henderson writes with wit and a brilliant clarity as jude and his friends rebel against authority they are still children and ultimately and subconsciously crave the love support and strength that parents and other adults can give them with permissive and often absent parents the kids search for security in new age religion music and each other i love this paragraph when jude first moves in with his dad who mentions in passing the c work curfew great said jude but when he thought about it his brain stretching the word softening it was his dad's shit this good it seemed a shiny fragment of adult vocabulary somehow alluring he'd never had a curfew before delph and kram did when is it ten thousand saints is a coming of age novel it's mind opening it's dark and crass and filled with images of vile things yet it is also honest and the characters make choices and suffer the consequences it is wise and eye opening and simply brilliant","452":" a gentle exploration on the darkest tendencies of adolescent behavior in her first novel eleanor henderson piles on topics from teenage pregnancy fetal alcohol syndrome drug overdoses parental abandonment aids vegetarianism counter culture transition from hippies to punks and the influences of hinduism on the origin of straight edge while at times the issues overwhelm the narrative and some mistakes made by characters seem designed for an after school special sermon henderson's empathy curbs her moralism and the shifting perspectives prevent anyone from being too easily glorified or demonized the ending feels a little forced and some characters seem abandoned for ease rather than a significant purpose but the genuine feeling of a specific turbulent time bot teenage development and nyc history made up for any shortcomings","453":"very enjoyable although a bit messy too many plot points phases of the book","454":"if freedom by jonathan franzen and get in the van had a lovechild it would look a lot like this novel","455":"i was drawn to this book because of it's setting in burlington vt where my son kevin attended uvm for one year","456":"very well written strong characters decent plot","457":"rare in that it started out too painful to read and ended up completely engrossing with many more likable characters than i expected","458":"this one was ok but not as good as i hoped it would be it just seemed that many of the characters and the relationships between them were not as developed as i would have expected","459":"3 5 totally enjoyable but not especially special god and what was that dumb epilogue","460":"worst book i've read in a long time lots of swear words and inappropriate language plots had such great reviews i stuck with it hoping it would get better no such luck","461":" you've been punked there are few halos in view in this ensemble coming of age tale sixteen year old jude keffy horn named for the saint of lost causes and maybe a beatles song is a lost soul of a teenager he lives a fairly meaningless existence in lintonberg vermont by which we mean burlington filled with drugs and rock and roll if no sex yet he is prone to angry outbursts and has trouble concentrating in school his bff is teddy the product of an alcoholic erratic mother and a possibly dead father parents are absent in abundance in lintonberg busy dealing pot in new york city jude's father lester only rarely gets in touch teddy has no recollection of his father at all his mom says he died but teddy is not so sure teddy's half brother johnny living now in new york city has a career criminal for a father thankfully pops is safely tucked away behind bars teddy and jude spend much of their time in chemically induced altered states teddy suffers a shock when his substance and responsibility challenged mother abandons him things take a further turn in lintonberg when jude's father sends his girlfriend's far too worldly fifteen year old daughter eliza to visit she accompanies the two friends to a boisterous party substances are abused a step too far teddy winds up a ted sicle jude winds up depressed and eliza winds up preggers jude heads south with his sad song and tries to make it better eleanor henderson in ten thousand saints offers us a trip down memory lane to the 1980s well maybe it's more of an alley henderson is trying to capture the feel of the straight edge subculture that grew out of the punk rock movement and entailed abstinence from drugs alcohol sex and meat in an interview with publisher's weekly henderson said i couldn't have written this book without my husband aaron growing up he spent a lot of time on st mark's place in new york where his mother lived for 25 years and it was there that he first encountered the straight edge hardcore scene in the late 1980s his stories about that period and that place always appealed to me and i knew that i wanted to capture them to perform some kind of ethnography it was the paradox of the subculture that fascinated me the most--teenage boys playing angry music and swearing off drugs http www publishersweekly com pw by well of course it is particularly tough to be straight in a bent world the aids crisis is blossoming into full flower and fear is in the air as is rage there is street violence police abuse and all the fun things one associates with manhattan's pre gentrified east village and lower east side along with a dose of krishna konsciousness violence takes place back in vermont as well lest one think this is being portrayed as a new punk city thing henderson casts a passing glance at the gentrification pressure that was well underway by the 1987 setting and there is never any doubt that the time period is the 80's to pepper a story with references to a place or time adds flavor but when the entire shaker is upended it makes the meal unpalatable if there was a band that was at all punkish in the 1980s it is probably mentioned here yes yes yes we get it aside from beating us about the head with time references henderson offers characters that are very flawed a few scars or an irregular sense of right and wrong can allow one to relate to and engage with characters but it helps if they are likeable in ten thousand saints not so much the adults do not come off too well a criminal doing time a criminal doing business a psycho mom and the occasional sane parent is it any wonder the kids are far from all right for so many of the young characters bad choice follows bad choice perhaps that is too dark a shade with which to paint the entire cast there are some endearing moments in which characters jump into real mode for a while wrestle with tough moral questions johnny teddy's half brother a tattoo artist rocker seemed the most developed and sympathetic he confronts real choices about his preferences tries to be the adult in a world of children even though he is a teenager himself takes on responsibility and goes above and beyond to try to make right as many things as possible i found some of the choices presented in the final wrap up very very questionable but i will not spoil that here while the tiny straight edge movement may hold interest for henderson whose cognizance of it is second hand it strikes me as just another form of extremism borne along by the youthful exuberance of its participants henderson's writing shows considerable promise when the characters come alive it is vibrant and a bit of literary ambition pokes through from time to time there is a scene in which a homeless naked pregnant woman is seen running down a street clearly offering metaphorical support for one of henderson's characters jude is badly scarred physically by a bad drug induced choice he makes nice symbolism for the damage we all inflict on ourselves by our own questionable choices when jude leaves vermont for nyc the house he leaves had been left half done by his father lester when he had left it is a jumble of things incomplete a kitchen lacking drawers rooms with pipes and insulation but no dropped ceiling a nice image for a person who is incomplete as he sets off to find and maybe construct himself but the whole just does not pull together for me the characters are not nearly likable enough and failing likability not engaging enough if you don't care for or relate all that much to the characters in a story it is tough to care much for the story how that manifested for me was that i found myself resisting returning to the book it took much longer to read than its length merited i would certainly look at henderson's next big work but while ten thousand saints has some intriguing elements it was not quite heavenly enough i expect henderson's future work to be a bit closer to beatitude p s stretchingthe title comes from a quote from the book of jude behold the lord cometh with ten thousands of his saints to execute judgment upon all according to many sources the \"saints\" in the introductory quote could just as easily be angels which summons to mind angels in america the 1991 play about aids as aids figures in the book it might be what the author had in mind or they could be the dead redeemed and coming back with jc to exact some judgment on the unworthy maybe in this context she might be referring to the unpleasant view of some that the aids epidemic was a judgment by god on godless homosexuals and i suppose haitians","462":"kind of like in family ties in which michael j fox played a kid whose sitcom stupid conservatism was a reaction to his parents' sitcom stupid hippiedom and liberalism ten thousand saints is a multi generational saga set in the late 1980s primarily in rural vermont and in east village manhattan only here some of the hippies' offspring turn away from drugs to hardcore straightedge punk clean living hard rocking one is tempted to glibly describe henderson's story and the perambulations of an enormous cast of characters as dickensian if only for the sprawl and grit but that's too glib mainly because of the intense sensitivity and interior life she gives virtually every character i was drawn to both jude and johnny a bit puzzled by eliza both repelled and forgiving of hapless self centered les meaning i cared about these folks who are trying to make a life on the waves of a turbulent cultural tsunami that includes not only sex drugs and rock n roll and their bedfellow aids but a broader array of types of possible love which do not come with operating manuals a very moving read though i felt a bit deflated by the coda","463":"this book was rather slow for me it was a coming of age story about challenges of adult hood and family dynamics didn't love it since i found it a bit boring","464":"not totally satisfied iwth the ending but her writing on 1980s nyc is beatiful and tragic itd make a great movie #js","465":"not a bad book learned about straight edge kids really weird and a little about the early punk scene in ny but not enough if you ask me","466":"i didn't mind this but it felt overly long and there were a few too many tangents","467":"it was better than a lot of what i've read lately not amazing misfit teenagers in the late 80s","468":"i loved this book great story set in vermont and nyc in the late 80's against the backdrop of the straight edge punk scene with characters i totally fell in love with beautifully written to boot i will definitely be picking up whatever eleanor henderson writes next and i'm really excited to learn that this will be turned into a movie","469":"a very interesting look at teens in the 80's drugs the punk straight edge movement i was very aware of the punk scene but somehow knew nothing about the straight edge stuff the aids crisis nyc before the clean up and the remainders of the hippie culture in vermont a bit long and draggy in parts especially for a book that falls into the ya realm i did not really like any of the characters which meant i didn't really care too much about what happened to them","470":"i am surprised this book has such poor reviews i thought it was well written and i easily related to the characters plot line possibly the bad reviews are because of not being able to relate due to much of the book revolving around the punk hardcore scene","471":"book club for september a little dubious but here goes","472":"jeezum crow i loved this book i actually clapped a couple times while reading it i wasn't impressed by the opening at all a couple of downwardly mobile druggies meet up with an uptown lolita and go to a party where the night ends in violence and accidental death like early brett easton ellis directed by whit stillman i almost set it aside after the first couple chapters i didn't think the characters would engage me i'm glad i stuck with it because once we meet the dead kid's brother my interest started to flicker and henderson is quickly revealed to be a less jaded and more sympathetic storyteller than she seems at first i was repeatedly won over by characters that i thought i would be unable to relate to that's a special kind of magic my only serious complaint is that much of the novel deals with the early straight edge scene and although henderson acknowledges that violence was commonplace to those kids she does so with a boys will be boys wink that's not how i remember it i remember a bunch of hotheaded assholes even more prone to violence than the neo nazis that they otherwise resembled not the starved for affection bodhisattvas that make up the lost boy tribe here but hey it's a story i'll buy it with some misgiving anyway those things seem minor in the context of a novel that literally made the world disappear as i was reading it hugely recommended i would compare this to both the art of fielding and a home at the end of the world but i liked it more than either of those and i liked ahateotw a lot","473":"i wanted to like this more than i actually did so i think i've convinced myself it was pretty good the story follows jude through the straight edge scene of 80s nyc after the death of his best friend teddy from a drug overdose his half brother johnny and his kinda love interest eliza make up the other main characters and of course teddy's ghost looms over much of the story a lot of what happened felt random let's talk about drug addictions teen pregnancy violence aids sure the story of jude's life ties it all together but it never congeals into a meaningful whole jude himself is supposed to have had an epiphany about how all these things are shaping his life and how he needs to get control over events rather than letting them define him but i certainly didn't feel like he ever really matured he spends almost the entire novel being alternately depressed moody angry or undeservedly righteous yeah ok he's a teenager but still i'm pretty sure neither i nor any of my friends were ever that unbearable at that age it's not a bad story no but it wasn't exceptional either i don't have the urge to re read it which for me is the main factor in whether it's good or not","474":"oh i dunno it was okay after 350 pages i found myself still not caring very much about the story or the characters my favorite was lester i bought it when i read the stellar review in the nyt perhaps i suffer from expectations unmet","475":"i liked this book although i had a hard time getting into it initially perhaps because i was juggling a couple other books at the time the whole teenage drug and sex beginnings coupled with the death of teddy from an overdose almost made me give up on the story i just wasn't ready to deal with the seemingly hopeless situation but i'm glad i stuck with it because it was well worth the effort i will definitely be looking for more of eleanor henderson's books","476":"at times both hard to read and hard to put down as a secondary plot line a wonderfully portrait of a ny les that was lost by the time i got there","477":"loved the writing and the twin settings of small town vermont and hardcore nyc but found most of the characters insufferable and unlikeable","478":" this was supposed to be one of the best books of 2011 it was on at least 1 best of list maybe more but i found it really hard to get through mainly because i didn't like any of the characters not one there was no redeeming quality to any of them and i couldn't relate to one single person so the book was a slog for me which probably explains why it took me 2 weeks to read 300 pages which i can usually do in about 3 days if i like the book it was relatively well written but the author would be wise to include at least 1 sympathetic character in her books in the future although i certainly won't be seeking her next work out","479":"yup this is one that drew me in as in read it every chance i got and finished in a couple of days love these kinds of books it's just a good read good characters very new york very 1980's all you forty somethings who were either at cbgb's or wish you had been that'd be me you'll like this book","480":"i kind of enjoyed reading this but don't have much to say in retrospect","481":"i will say this the book kept me interested and i liked the characters but it seemed to have this odd middle part about straight edge that i just didn't get why was it there good story though certainly hope my kids don't do any of the stuff these characters did though","482":"held my attention from beginning to end almost a 5 star sadly i've known some characters that messed up so it read fairly believable for me","483":" this novel tries too hard to be very hip with the dank side of city life in the 1980s especially in its first half but as the novel progresses you begin to invest in the characters more and more especially some that you might have written off in the opening chapters the 1980s setting also becomes much more of an organic part of the story instead of feeling like historical window dressing it's a very hard book to put down at times but i only wish the first half of the novel had been as involving and compelling as its second half","484":" back in the 1980s if the content of american fiction is any indicator every us high school kid was fucked up on drugs the product of a broken home possibly adopted and tormented by jocks and bullies henderson's 16 year old jude green is no exception and it's a good starting premise for a highly readable novel about nervous young love hard core music with hard core abstinence thrown in for good measure cool and pre gentrified lower manhattan and the fictional staples of homo sexuality mortality and fumbling around in the search for one's true self","485":"ten thousand saints reminds me of books i liked to read in high school about fucked up families it was fun to visit the genre again i would recommend it it's a fun quick read oh and also she mentions haworth nj which is really bizarre since people who live 5 miles away from our town have never even heard of it","486":"a great read unique characters interesting plot line with a variety of twists henderson's writing style keeps the reader interested in the main character as well as the few minor characters on the periphery definitely worth picking up","487":"brought me back to the late 80's and early 90's great characters nicely put together","488":" i've never been into punk rock i find straight edge rather annoying or at least the se kids i've met at college in short eleanor henderon's novel is not one i would normally pick up yet after the recommendation of a friend i found myself dropped into a lower east side and se scene i could barely recognize from the one i know today henderson's account of se is as detailed and fascinating as an ethnography from the t shirts her protagonists wear to their syntax incoherent teenage ramblings are mixed with henderson's flowing spot on prose henderson has illuminated even the very corners of the movement without boring the reader sometimes henderson's attempt to catalogue all of the movement means her characters can be a bit extreme like she's checking off various types of se vegans closeted gays zine scribers vigilantes etc but we're still invested in the bizarre love triangle of jude former stoner turned se band frontman after his friend teddy ods eliza prep school dropout with a coke problem and pregnant with teddy's child and johnny seemingly se posterboy and teddy's brother although the tension between the three kept me from being able to put the book down i never found eliza and jude's romance believable it's the details not the overarching themes that henderson gets best the aids epidemic and gentrification of the lower east side are touched at in a way to not have them invade the story but still give them significance the crazy supporting cast of characters that make up the punk band such as kram who gets his nickname from accidentally tattooing his name on backwards and jude's family i had a softspot for the screwup drug dealing dad les are as likable as they are problematic there's clearly a lot going on in ten thousand saints genius title by the way and although henderson manages to keep it all under control and write it well her protagonists are a little weak and maybe this is why they're so easily absorbed the se scene yet i finished the book feeling like i had learned a lot but wasn't fully satisfied as a reader","489":"this was my first year at college book because the author is one of the professors at my school and since i had to read it i didn't want to that's usually how it works i did finally get around to reading it and i loved the chemistry between the characters and all the troubles life through at them i really enjoyed the underground music scene that was a crucial element in the novel and she captured not only the timer period well but also the music scene and teenage life","490":"3 5 stars the setting new york city u0026amp vermont late 1980s was vivid and reminded me of tell the wolves i'm home but i didn't think it was quite as excellent as that book","491":" i'd do 3 5 stars if i could i was really attracted to this book as the time period it covers parallels my first years in new york just out of college the author wasn't actually in new york at this time and she's too young to have experienced it firsthand anyway which was evident to me new york especially the east village didn't quite ring true the days of graffiti covered subway cars were gone that aside it's a very good story built around the straight edge movement of the time hardcore punks who eschewed drugs alcohol sex etc i never met anyone who lived this life but no doubt it existed the story effectively goes back and forth between nyc and vermont and the protagonist is an interesting complex person i'll keep my eyes open for another book by the author that's perhaps a bit more personal","492":"a really sad book about straight edge kids in late 80s new york and vermont","493":" jude is an adopted child who bears the psychic wound i suppose of all children who don't really know where they come from he and his friend teddy are typical small town vermont kids smoking pot huffing glue etc jude's parents are hippies divorced from each other who don't seem to have much of a clue about their son jude becomes part of the straight edge punk movement hanging out in the east village and then touring around with a band the book started out with a bang but to me started to wind down around 3 4 of the way through i think the author needed a better editor although her writing is quite nice she really does go on and on with the descriptions of things like les' beat up van not a bad coming of age story as far as that goes but to me just okay","494":"i really enjoyed this book the characters were very well developed the story idea was original and extremely well written i reserve 5 stars for books that blow my socks off and that i predict will stand the test of time and if it were possible i would give this one 4 5 stars it was excellent and i highly recommend it","495":"i come shy of awarding it 5 stars not because it doesn't deserve it in every way this book is impressive and dizzying whether it's the steely eyed prose or the dutiful man hours of research that clearly got pulled off or the sensuousness of the descriptions of everything from heroin zombies to straight edge culture to burn scars to a pot grow op or the shockingly well rendered teens and adults hell even the descriptions of music which is one of the trickiest things to pull off in print i think the one thing this book falls short on is scope it mines so deep into its central bundle of characters and settings that it makes me wonder where henderson can go with some really fucking out there stuff so i say 4 stars pending judgment this is a gorgeous two inch thick porterhouse of a novel that you should read if you've ever been young in new york smoked weed gotten in a fight spent time in vt in a hoodie all of these things or just need a place to sensorily deprive yourself and give full reign to your mind's eye for a few days","496":"treasure your children and parent them","497":"most compelling is the novel's focus on three teens who in the late 1980's as children of hippie parents get involved with a straight post punk scene the writing is very immediate and the initial situation that brings them together is vivid and moving but disappointingly the character development is not portrayed well enough to sustain interest in the lengthy action that follows or to make the ending an emotionally felt one","498":" i hate quitting books i was once told by a friend that you have to take 100 pages subtract your age and that is what you have to read before quitting a book in my case the page should have been around 73 and i actually pushed myself to read to 150 i felt nothing from this book i was so incredibly bored and couldn't follow the writing very well it just seemed to go in circles i was actually going to finish it but a woman on my plane encouraged me to quit the book if i didn't like it why read something that is not feeling your heart with something whether it be joy happiness sadness movement of any sort really plus i wanted to finish it out of respect for a woman who wanted to write i just couldn't finish it i was so bored i hope someone finds something in this book worth loving i unfortunately did not","499":"i didn't love this coming of age story about the hardcore punk scene it was interesting enough but i didn't particularly care about what happened to any of the characters","500":"it's like the outsiders for straight edge","501":"i enjoyed this book i think it's a really good read and would recommend it to people that need something a little differnt","502":"finished in one day beautifully written tragic tale that completely engrossed me","503":"definitely has the first novel rough feeling but some beautiful writing and an evocative picture of its time and subculture 80s straightedge","504":"quick engrossing read with an overall likable cast of characters after i finished the book i read the reading group questions one asked which was the best parent i find myself going to harriet and wonder am i wrong","505":" i never would have picked this book up on my own it was chosen for a book club that i had just joined but as i sat down to read the book it really sucked me in with it's beautifully written text and totally flawed but wonderfully carved out characters the three teens in the novel johnny jude and eliza are drawn together by the death of jude's friend and johnny's little brother teddy these three are messed up in many ways and are looking for many things their parents are all just as messed up but henderson has certainly given me to believe that they are all trying and need to be forgiven for their shortcomings when it comes down to it the mothers of jude and eliza know that it is all about somehow saving the kids the book takes place in new york and a small town in vermont in the late 80's and centers around the hard core music and straight edge scene of the day these places play a big role in the book and lend a gritty sad and hopeless edge to the book despite the heartbreaking events that take place i never came away feeling depressed after reading this book to her great credit henderson helps the reader hover just above this and envelops us into each character and makes us feel the passion of each setting it is amazing how these teens survive and how they find redemption and themselves in different ways the book really made me think about free will and survival in tough circumstances again the writing is at times breathtaking and for this and the brilliant way the author has tied up the novel to a satisfying ending i give ten thousand saints 4 stars","506":"i really loved this book without any real attachment to the characters which is unusual for me i just sort of loved the honesty of bad decisions and trying to do you best that seemed very prevalent in the book both with the adolescents and the adults","507":"seemed a little jumbled and i really didn't get invested into the characters","508":"i enjoyed this book very much i enjoyed learning about the straight edge punk rock culture i will always be a metal head classic rock girl i could totally relate to the hippy parents lol and of course we can all relate to the teenage growing pains and fucked up families all in all i thought it was a pretty cool story","509":" read this for book club thought it was pretentious dreck the author was so focused on throwing out all these lifetime movie type events pregnancy aids death drugs rock 'n roll and hairy tattooed backs that the characters were completely lost in the tumult i didn't connect to a single character their actions were incongruous to the events surrounding them and even the adults came off as ignorant i thought the writing was dry and oftentimes inappropriately gross this woman can make drinking a yoo hoo sound like a zombie apocalypse plus i thought the epilogue was a shameful way to fast forward 30 years without having to explain any changes or growth in the characters plus i have finally found a cultural movement straight edge that is collectively more annoying than satanism rampant catholicism and alcoholism combined seriously at least drug users and alcoholics can blame their respective vices for being assholes what do these people have as an excuse besides immaturity and a desire to conform and i know that part of my resentment stems from not choosing the book myself however this is a book that i might have picked out myself from the half price bookstore dollar bin so it makes it even more disappointing","510":"very good book interesting characters and the plot moves well being someone who was a part of this movement for a significant amount of time i find it somewhat sad the author really draws attention to the negative behaviors of some of the straight edge community yes this type of behavior did does exist on the flip side there are other groups of youth adults who engage in this type of pack behavior without offering any other contribution straight edge and the hard core scene offers refuge to a wide variety of youth the music often a binding factor among various factions within the scene promotes unity and offers a way to release the pent up frustration all too common during adolescence henderson mentions posi kids or going posi a few times within the novel but offers no deeper explanation of what posi core is to leave out one of the larger groups within the straight edge community and repeatedly paint various youth crews bands etc as militant and thuggish militias is irresponsible in my opinion yes everyone's experience or lack there of with straight edge is going to be different but i think you have to shed just as much light on the positive aspects of a subculture that saves more lives than it ruins","511":" this book is better than the two stars i'm giving but not better than three the story about teenagers in vermont starts out strong then gets strange as the story moves to nyc and finally sloppy as resolution comes to the multiplying cast of characters it begins with a stand by me vibe as two boys bond over their misfit outsider status at fourteen they are pot heads victims of poverty and horrible parenting a half sister shows up tragedy strikes and the story shifts to new york and the straight edge hardcore scene of the 1980s the city is a cacophony of characters and issues aids adoption homelessness teenage pregnancy that ultimately resolves with a love story and a happy if somewhat ambiguous ending the author eleanor henderson takes a nice jacket photo and has a fine ear for dialogue which never reads false even as it moves from teenage stoner to straight edge rocker but the book would've been helped from a strict editor who might've cut the story down to a more workable plot fewer characters and less cliches","512":" i couldn't wait to get my hands on this novel and i'm so glad that i did henderson's debut novel is impossible to put down jude and his best friend teddy experiment with drugs during the late 1980's in a small vermont town however after teddy dies of a drug overdose jude's pot dealing father asks him to move to new york ironically while living with his father jude finds the straight edge scene a scene where the music is hardcore but the lifestyle is anti drug strictly vegan and mostly celibate still vermont manages to catch up with jude despite his new found life in the big city when jude discovers a secret about his friend eliza it sets both jude eliza and teddy's brother johnny on a completely new path set against subcultures straight edge skinheads hippies and major social issues aids safe sex drugs jude struggles to find his place in the world and find a true familial connection from the main protagonists to the support characters henderson's portrayals of youth and their parents is timeless and full of depth here parents learn from their children as much as the children learn from their parents from shared mistakes to revelations the bond between parents and their children is a driving force in this novel one that grounds it in the reality of both the binding threads and conflicts that unite and separate generations once you begin this novel you'll find it impossible to put down if you're thinking of foregoing it after the first chapter press on once you meet the host of characters you can't help but be drawn in henderson's world enthralled by all of it's light and dark this has earned a rightful spot on my bookshelf as a favorite","513":"so well written story of where teens were in the mid 1980s not just in new york music and lifestyle scene but with generation gap of revolution between parents who grew up in the '60s and hard edges of '80s reagan era knowledge of american history isn't required but having that in my background helped keep the whole story in focus very worthwhile reading","514":" this book is both frustrating and satisfying there is some awful parenting going on throughout much of the book but still the characters are endearing in their ineptness and affection for one another favorite line in one scene a character contemplates giving up her unborn child for adoption she asked an her adopted friend another main character if he thought her baby would grow up to hate her and he said no she won't hate you she's just going to miss you that line has stuck with me since finishing it","515":"as somebody who lives for the musical 'rent' this ticks many boxes new york 1980s aids undercurrent gentrification of alphabet city drug use and abuse it's a shame that i didn't engage with this more from the outset as it was quite often difficult for me to really get to grips and to be honest to really want to read it then i woke up super early one morning and ploughed my way through the second half of it in about 2 hours and it was a different experience all together with two and a half weeks to go until i return to work and the boyfriend starting his new job and no longer having as much time to entertain my indolent self i need to commit to reading much much more","516":"http wordnerdy blogspot com 2011 05","517":"parts of it were lovely and the author does a good job of recreating the east village in the koch years but i couldn't get into the protagonist and so my interest flagged at times took me awhile to finish","518":"ny in the 70's so familiar these characters are profoundly flawed and wholly believable and sympathetic made me long for cbgbs and the punk scene that i missed in high school","519":"weird weird book set in the late 80s adopted stoner kid turns straight edge after his best friend dies but not before he the bff knocks up his father's girlfriend's daughter dead kids half brother marries pregnant sixteen year old but he's uh straight edge wink wink adoption abandonment poor parenting drugs ex hippies straight edge hardcore punks jocks hare krishnas aids better read it i'm sure i missed plenty","520":"quite awful felt very researched and didn't ring true for me at all the writer throws so many topics and problems at the characters and none of them seem probable or get resolved in any sort of satisfactory way at least i didn't spend too much time on it","521":"this is a modern coming of age story reminiscent of the catcher in the rye however there is a cast of characters rather than a solo focus like holden jude is from fictional lintonburg vermont he and his best friend teddy are stoners and social outcasts at school their life is changed forever on new year's eve when the daughter of the girlfriend of jude's estranged father decides to spend it with them rather than in her native nyc i enjoyed the book but felt it could have benefited from additional editing","522":"nope a non starter there's a book that i haven't read yet that probably does this better or maybe i did read it or maybe it was a comic book","523":"upon leslie's recommendation this was really kind of a masterpiece a disturbing and scary masterpiece that i would never recommend to anyone with children because it's terrifying to imagine some of the things that these kids do but a masterpiece nonetheless you really feel like you're in their straight edge teen pregnancy life or death world","524":"this book had so much potential but it feels like a draft that really needs to be filled out more you really have no idea how the characters transformed so dramatically","525":"this review has been hidden because it contains spoilers to view it click here um this was a quick read i guess i'll give it that i suppose it's a much better book if you are really into straight edge or hardcore or think that the les in the 1980s is the pinnacle of music and culture and are determined to read anything set there then but i found pretty much all the characters incredibly irritating the teenage characters in particular are not immature in a relatable or interesting way they just have a frustrating and truly remarkable lack of insight and i feel like um this was a quick read i guess i'll give it that i suppose it's a much better book if you are really into straight edge or hardcore or think that the les in the 1980s is the pinnacle of music and culture and are determined to read anything set there then but i found pretty much all the characters incredibly irritating the teenage characters in particular are not immature in a relatable or interesting way they just have a frustrating and truly remarkable lack of insight and i feel like the author thinks they are all so sweet and innocent and lovable and creative and omg they're going to raise their dead friend's baby how romantic when really i mostly just wanted to give all of them a good smack across the face the writing is pretty good i just wish the subject had been less completely eye roll worthy more","526":"really beautiful writing syntax vocabulary character development etc one note tone bleak and dismal i did not cheer for one character except the one that dies on page one","527":" the characters really make this book remarkable the author certainly does a good job of capturing the spirit of the straight edge scene in the alphabet city of the 80's but what really made this book worthwhile for me was the relationship between jude and eliza while it is far from perfect it really is the glue that holds this novel together and kept me turning the pages read this book if you want to spend some time inhabiting a grittier new york cliche i know through the minds of carefully drawn realistic members of a unique subculture","528":"calling this novel a coming of age story sells it short the boyish characters are entrenched in the straight edge movement of the punk era and in their extremism come to many realities and comparisons about their own lives their families and what constitutes a sense of belonging","529":"as a top ten new york times book review book for 2011 i expected a whole lot more i just could not get into the drug addicted messed up kids with completely dysfunctional families this was not entertaining at all to me after several chapters i skimmed the rest and it didn't look like i missed much","530":"dark haunting and thought provoking it is beautifully written and really looks at the drug culture of the 1980s youth that is influenced by their parents of the 1960s","531":"this novel is very similar to a lot of such novels i've read in the past few years and have mostly stopped enjoying but this one won me over more than most because of henderson's commitment to and affection for her characters five pages in i was like oh no but then i found myself easily reading all the way through without much irritation","532":"for most of this book i thoroughly disliked almost all of the characters there were many moments i thought about quitting but i'm glad i stuck it out because i found the ending portion of the book redeeming and hopeful","533":" the story was compelling albeit far too convenient at times henderson has chops but the substantive grit of the material felt glossed over i don't think she expressed enough the power of the music which shows how hard it is to write something you didn't live through in my view she could have just as easily been writing about boy band fans for the emotive depth she brought to the topic of punk jude and johnny and rooster were great characters as was ravi but the others felt like caricatures of archetypes experienced as often as sweet tea in southern lit the writing was flawless and i remained engaged with the text i would recommend the book to others interested in the time period or the subject of punk nostalgia i personally would have liked more naked lunch and less mfa gloss","534":"i really loved this book i thought that it was well written believable and very engaging the characters were easy to connect to but weren't too predictable the ending was also done very well it wasn't exactly what i expected but wasn't too different that i was upset by the change","535":"in the end i found the story a little unsatisfying although i did enjoy the book up until the very end maybe i was expecting some big flashy finish one of the most interesting aspects of the book was its look at life in the 1980s","536":"i really really loved this book there was something very eager about the writing i like how she just kind of went for it with the depiction of the straight edge subculture but right as she might have verged on trite something wonderful was said or done by a character read it in a day and would highly recommend it to anyone who loves an anti coming of age story","537":"meh too much from the 1980s adolescence couldn't engage very deeply with the angsty ness","538":"this book examines the straight edge movement of the 80s something i had never heard of i could relate to some of the people in the book but there were too many odd groupings and pairings to really get involved in any one set","539":" hard core straight edge kids in nyc and vermont in 1987 88 gets into the scene pretty well anyone interested in coming of age or in punk rock might like i was somewhat annoyed by how the parents were all so negligent in it which sometimes seemed too convenient for letting the young protagonists sort of just drift from one place to another but i do know so many in straight edge came into it as a result of drug and alcohol abuse in their families so i am unsure if my reservations are unfounded or not but overall an enjoyable read about a particular time and scene","540":"well written well paced and thoroughly entertaining some of you will remember some of these punk straight edge bands from back in the day but even if you don't the book would lose nothing the serious misadventures of a bunch of well intentioned teenagers will remind you of your own serious misadventures as a well intentioned teenager","541":"this book was well written but it just didnt grab me and draw me into it i felt like we were just taking a cursory tour through the lives of the characters rather than stopping to get to know them i wouldn't recommend to my goodreads friends out there","542":"i read this because it was on a list of the best fiction of 2011 either ny times or slate i can't remember i thought it was great smart real heartbreaking funny it takes place in the late '80s and so i'm not quite up with all the cultural references except in passing aids straight edge manhattan when it was still scary a great read though","543":"the east village in the 80s wow times have changed","544":" before reading this is the first novel of a talented woman who i became friends with when we were both knee high running down a dirt road in florida chasing our bigger brothers i am terrifically proud of her and can't wait for my copy to arrive in the mail after reading so with a full disclaimer that i know and love the author here's what i thought i have to admit a book about punk rockers nyc drugs and straight edge which was a totally new concept to me is not really in my realm of experiences i am a mostly happy mostly square midwestern mama who loves her flowerbeds and her dogs and sneaks whole grain flour into her brownies on occasion there are flower seeds not bongs in my mini greenhouse the start of the book was hard for me to engage with amid all of the details of drugs and fights and bad behavior but the characters and their conflicts and their parents and their regrets and their hopes drew me in i was captivated by the unique settings and lifestyles the characters were imperfect and flawed and real and the situations did not resolve themselves any more neatly than they do in real life i usually dislike books with ambiguous endings but in this case i actually appreciated it i liked being able to project where the whirling characters would land as life spun ahead of them as another reviewer commented this is not a book that will fit everyone but i am glad that my connection to the author slipped me past my reservations about the subject matter sarah","545":"i really struggled to find word to describe this book the underlying theme of straight edge and punk 80s scene was intriguing the topic itself left me depressed and it was quite a lot to absorb from one book i could however not stop reading it and could not help really getting into jude's character","546":"my review for slj http blog schoollibraryjournal com","547":"bookseller katsmall town vermont burlington is the setting for this coming of age novel teddy jude eliza and johnny are the children of the 1960's their parents are pot growers bong makers or gone they are finding their way through the hardcore punk drugs vs straight edge scene and identity issues of birth adoption sexual orientation and aids as we follow along we are treated to a glimpse of an era","548":" this is a very silly coming of age novel that concerns itself with vermont bred straight edge hardcore kids the lower east side in the late 1980s and a million afterschool special ish plotlines the characters are oddly unconvincing the tone schoolmarm pedantic and the style dull and dry at best there are dozen of grand and glorious books about punk rockers and artists and the ugly magical fearless and fragile state of being young in lower manhattan before whole foods plopped down on houston and bowery i mean you could do worse than start with patti smith and jennifer egan and richard price and the epilogue to luc sante's lowlife and see where they take you the critics loved this book maybe there is a larger number of literary establishment types that looks back fondly on their gorilla biscuits 7 s than i thought i can't figure it","549":"gritty coming of age in the 1980s set in vermont and new york city characters include a strangely related group of kids and their odd assortment of parents engaging and wonderfully written with a keen eye on the drug scene adolescence and what happens when you mix it all up","550":"by the end of the first paragraph i realized i was dealing with two main characters i really didn't have much in common with two 16 year old boys from vermont outcasts always searching for their next high i wasn't sure if i would enjoy tis one but as the story unfolded and more characters were introduced i realized this was a coming of age story unlike any other i have read definitely worth reading","551":"i really enjoyed this book it was interesting to read about a place and situation i'm not familiar with especialy since i'm close to the same age as the characters in the book reading about people's drug problems doesn't always sound like fun to me but i enjoyed how henderson showed the change in a person's list from drugs to their kind of religion it's kind of a dark book so i wouldn't read it if you're wanting something warm and fuzzy but i would recommend it to someone","552":"more ya than i realized really nostalgic about nyc in the 80s and brought back a lot of memories i can't be the only one that wished we found out more what happened to the characters and that she tried to cover too much in one short ish novel i'd still recommend it","553":"i selected this from the new york times's best of 2011 list what a disappointment do people pay to get on that list henderson tells the story of a group of teenagers and their parents who are lost on drugs drinks tattoos and sex the story is one big stereotype with no authenticity or credibility i didn't even think that much of the writing which most of the other reviews thought was strong the descriptions the dialogue the characters boring","554":" in ten thousand saints eleanor henderson has written the quintessential novel of new york city's east village in the late 1980s she truly has breathed life into the east village's recent storied past and has transformed that neighborhood into a character as vividly realized as her novel's people she has rendered for the reader a most memorable fictional walking tour through east village allowing oneself to become attuned almost immediately to its distinctive sights and sounds while some have compared it favorably with jonathan lethem's fortress of solitude henderson's novel is a far more compelling far more engrossing and far more successful depiction of the east village than i have seen from lethem's fictional portrayals of brooklyn hers is a novel replete with flawed quite captivating characters but these are ones who will linger long in your memory thanks to her elegant prose so rich in its sincerity and compelling descriptions of its characters especially the adolescents who are this novel's main protagonists ten thousand saints is a superb blend of personal odyssey and coming of age perhaps our generation's catcher in the rye the wayward adopted son of two hippie parents jude keffry horn seems destined to follow in his father's footsteps as a juvenile pot smoking junkie in a rural vermont town dominated by his fellow lawless troubled teens when his best friend teddy succumbs to a drug overdose jude embarks on a personal odyssey back to the city of his birth where he will find salvation via punk music the east village's skinhead culture and his friendships with teddy's brother johnny and eliza the sophisticated daughter of di a former ballerina and his father les's long time girlfriend yet it is an odyssey fraught with peril that begins tragically with teddy's death and yet ends most promisingly in an unexpected pregnancy and birth in ten thousand saints henderson has not only written a mesmerizing literary debut but also one that definitely ranks among this year's best american novels reposted from my 2011 amazon review","555":"wow this book was horrible i thought it was one of those i wound up finishing just to get it over with skimmed i hated all the characters and had no interest in the subculture oh well","556":" a really interesting look at the straight edge punk scene and nyc in the late '80s via some fascinating well developed characters who come together through interesting twists of fate having lived in the east village several decades after the story took place the glimpse at this earlier time in nyc was particularly interesting to me i was also particularly struck with some of the decisions characters made things that seemed like a no brainer to me were forcibly rejected by characters and their rejections came with explanations and reasons that made me understand where they were coming from a good perspective into how different people approach situations different ways great read","557":"i first picked up ten thousand saints because i thought it was cool that it was written by an ithaca college writing professor that is cool but the book is even cooler the novel addresses drugs sex pregnancy aids love loss grief death and family set against and embedded in the 1980s straight edge scene in new york city when fifteen year old teddy mcnicholas dies of a drug overdose in a small town in vermont at the end of 1987 teenage rebel jude keffy horn tedd'ys brother johnny and new acquaintance eliza come together in the city to struggle with holding on and moving forward johnny introduces jude to the hardcore straight edge culture and jude's initiation into the vegan celibate drug free world is a sharp contrast to his previous life and the people in it meanwhile all three characters' lives are changed when eliza discovers that she is pregnant jude johnny eliza teddy les rooster i was absolutely fascinated by every character in this novel from the protagonists down to those who only had minor roles in a few scenes each one had a strong voice and motivations and the interactions between the characters were honest and powerful i was especially drawn to johnny the tattoo artist and musician who served as jude's guide into the scene with simultaneously coping with his own losses and secrets i was somewhat worried that eliza would be playing the role of manic pixie dream girl when she first showed up brash and beautiful from the big city ready to change the lives of our heroes but over the course of the novel i really warmed to her she had the vulnerability you would expect of someone her age in her situation but an independence and strong willed personality that let her hold her own against parents love interests and her own fears there are no heroes and no villains except for maybe death and the beginning of the aids epidemic in this story each character's flaws are on full display but at their hearts they believe they are doing the best they can henderson's voice is as strong in her setting as it is in her characters i know very little about the 80s punk hardcore or straight edge scenes in new york city however i imagine that the atmosphere of the time was full of the same intensity that electrifies this novel every page is bursting with description and emotion so much that sometimes i felt like i didn't know where to look or what to think occasionally this was overwhelming even more occasionally it seemed unnecessary but for the most part i was engrossed by this portrayal of a subculture rife with passionate ideals and equally passionate characters i was fascinated by the politics and the religion the sexual and sometimes homoerotic undertones of the culture and the way that the people in it connect and break apart all of this is relayed with vivid and intense description the novel's \"weak\" point is in the plot itself which is sometimes meandering sometimes jagged and mostly unresolved at the same time i put \"weak\" in quotation marks because this lack of a single focus or closed ending is fitting with the tone of the book and the characters in it the novel captures a moment in time and the characters go on beyond it profoundly changed by their experiences but not stagnated within them a more focused conclusion would artificially end their stories when the realism of the novel dictates that they should go on overall ten thousand saints is a novel full of authentic characters and rich in its description of an intense emotional era also posted at thebestpossibletime","558":"this book took me a little while to get into the young teenage boys who are best friends living in a small town with a lifestyle totally foreign to my own experience didn't connect with me at first but as the story went along i became engaged with their lives their struggles with parents and the lack thereof their immaturity in some areas of their lives and greater maturity than the adults in their lives at other times i recommend the book for those who enjoy characters who change and grow in not altogether predictable ways","559":"i didn't choose this book rather it was handed to me after i spent the better part of an hour peeking at the title at first i thought the book was 'a thousand splendid suns' but once it was handed to me i could see it was anything but after reading the description i was leery of it and tend to stay away from books like this but i was glad i didn't it was a read that in places almost left chills down my spine like some of the other reviewers i would love to see henderson write another book as i think she has even more talent than what was portrayed in this book her descriptions were impeccable this is a book i would like to reread a few years from now just to see if i could get more from it overall a good read but not for everybody as it discusses some topics that some people would rather stay away from the author discusses serious issues such as addiction and teen pregnancy","560":"a book about high school age and just past high school age kids struggling with drugs death music and making connections to others and figuring out what those connections mean and what they require of you it's just a huge bonus that it's set in the late 80s the decade not the age with cameos by tompkins square park and cbgbs i liked it very much","561":"really enjoyed this book at got sucked in by the well written characters interesting history of the straight edge movement and early 90s lower east ny history","562":" ten thousand saints is an interesting book to say the least but it didn't really do much for me and i'm still not sure how that happened i was really immersed in the stories i felt like i was really experiencing the concerts the fights even the quiet moments between characters but at the same time it was in a very outside looking in manner i didn't feel like i was in the characters' shoes but rather standing beside them as things happened the lack of connection with protagonists may have been why when i put this book down i felt no different than when i'd first picked it up but then again with the almost absurd amount of issues and obstacles covered in 400 pages you would think i would have connected with something the only real lessons i can think of that i took away from this book was don't do drugs and don't get pregnant which are kind of a given unless you're eliza one of the main ideas in ten thousand saints is that teenagers can become more dependent on their friends for guidance and support when they don't have a good relationship with their parents this is reflected in my life because i have had a friend that sought advice and comfort from me as opposed to her parents because she didn't feel like she could talk to her parents about anything the problem with teens depending on teens as shown in ten thousand saints is that it can become overwhelming for the person providing guidance as they themselves don't have enough life experience or maturity to really provide a solution they know about as much as their friend this is shown in the novel as jude's solution to teddy's troubles is either get drunk get high or do both he too struggles with the absence of a father so it's hard for him to truly help teddy personally if i feel like i can't help my friend i employ the same tactic of trying to forget the problem rather than fix it not through drugs and alcohol because unlike jude i recognize that those aren't really a solution but rather another problem all together but rather just changing the subject overall i see the position jude is in even if i don't experience it quite to the extent he does so i'm less judgemental of his seemingly poor efforts to help teddy through his emotional turmoil i'm not condoning substance abuse as a cure for problems drugs are still bad i'm just saying that i see what jude's intentions were as i've made the same type of efforts in my past","563":"there is something about this book that really touches me emotionally this is my second read of it and i love it just as much as the first time none of the characters are wholly likeable but i feel totally invested in their stories and care what happens to them the only thing i don't like is the ending lots of loose ends","564":"i really should have given this book four stars i think i am not being that honest with my rating the third of ten thousand saints was just depressing a drugged kid who's drugged friend dies and he doesn't want to stop drugs so dude i mean jude teddy died and you still want that pot forget about it was the thought i had but i soldiered on i was really glad i did because my feelings went from a mediocre one star to a blazing five proof 1 i actually cared about eliza's kid 2 jude was so attaching 3 johnny divorced with eliza god i hate johnny 4 jude goes straight edge 5 eliza and her mom make up five points so five stars it is for me","565":"this book was amazing i really enjoyed it and the only people who don't like it are the people who can't see the real meaning of it or can't comprehend it because it seriously is my favorite book ever","566":"i had heard good things about this book but wasn't sure i'd be interested in the coming of age story of straight edge teens in the late 1980s new york city boy was i wrong henderson has such compassion for her characters jude the drug using boy in love with a girl who slept with his best friend teddy eliza the lost rich girl with a secret johnny teddy's straight edge musician brother hiding from himself that you feel like you know these people and care deeply about what happens to them even teddy who only exists for 72 pages yet whose presence influences all of the main characters is so vivid i felt i knew him well the minor characters are well drawn too i particularly liked jude's estranged father who left his family behind years ago and although he faithfully sent support checks checked out of his son and daughter's emotional life henderson has created this world that i had no idea about the straight edge world of young people living in poverty on the lower east side of new york city in the late 1980s it was a much different world there than it is today they live with the homeless violence and drug dealers in tompkins park and with the fear and ignorance spawned by the aids epidemic there is one scene a fight scene that echoes s e hinton's classic book the outsiders and i loved her homage to that story about teens also on the outside of mainstream society one of the characters even mentions the book later in the story this book will appeal to all of us who grew up loving the outsiders part of the story takes place in vermont and henderson creates that world with as much care i felt like i was dropped into this story these worlds that i knew little about great fiction can open up your mind and heart to characters and new ideas and ten thousand saints is great fiction it is one of the best books i have read this year and i can't wait for more from eleanor henderson i read this book in two sittings i just couldn't put it down these characters manage to crawl inside your heart and when they make bad decisions and mess things up you just want to hug them and tell them it will be alright","567":"this book was kind of blah for me not particularly memorable the story and characters were compelling enough that i kept reading but i didn't have any trouble putting it down the end was a little confusing and didn't feel like it fit with the rest of the book","568":"there's a lot going on here aids drugs abortion divorce punk rock teenage relationships homosexuality nyc straight edge religion wealth poverty maybe an element or two could have been taken out","569":"i was disappointed in this book it had so much potential set in the late 80's it is about a group of teenagers in vermont new york who are bound by the death of a friend and his unborn child i found it confusing to follow and the focus on straight edge was too much for my taste","570":"it was entertaining but had me wondering about the timeline a bit the amount of events crammed together between conception and birth seemed a bit dizzying life death gay straight drugs aids whew like not love","571":" in 1987 when this book opens i was graduating from college and embarking on my grown up life so the whole straight edge scene which is one of the many themes of the novel is completely foreign to me in fact i googled it because i didn't know if the writer was making it up or what it's real the other themes drugs aids teenaged pregnancy tattoos homosexuality dysfunctional families preppies vs outcasts veganism abstinence etc are more familiar and are tossed together willy nilly in this well written but overly long and rather aimless coming of age story i found the detachment of the characters from the events unfolding around them to be a bit irritating but then again everything always works out for them with the exception of teddy of course so why should they bother with any deep emotions what this is is the story of some teenagers who take a year off from school to half assedly form a band join a cult do a little travelling and oh yeah have a baby and then settle right back into the status quo aided by amazingly sanguine adults who always show up with wads of cash and a place to crash at just the right moment everyone gets their happily ever after in spite of the disney esque motif of the basically harmless and unharmed tribe of lost boys and girl having a little harmless adventure i liked most of the characters and was satisfied if not overwhelmed or surprised by how the story played out","572":"i may be repeating myself here but i loved this novel it captures a crazy time in nyc and the lives of lost teens and their parents it shows a rough world that is also somehow more innocent than today less corrupt but seriously dangerous and fraught with real struggle a beautiful novel","573":"eleanor henderson puts together a well tuned story of love loss and struggle minus the love teen friendships under the oppressive thumb of drugs divorce and depression take the routes of both happy and sad with the exception of the epilogue the story is brutally honest and unafraid to scratch the surface of some seriously haunting issues","574":"not as good as some of its reviews too much going on with the characters but not enough development of them good read of the whole 80s ny 'straight edge' music scene though","575":" it took me a really long time to get into this book i almost shut it for good several times but a sense of book club obligation always got the best of me initially the shifting points of view were troublesome it wasn't always easy to distinguish between the voices and thus it was hard to track of various details who did what to who when etc eventually however i sank into a rhythm with the writing and started to actually give a shit about the story i'm not entirely sure that the book's postscript is plausible but it's sweet and after such a sad sad book about lost people i decided to give it a pass","576":"amazing novel so much more than i expected even after reading so many good reviews the first chapter is the best depiction of the inner and outer lives of teenagers that i have ever read","577":"very good may be too gritty for some lots of drugs sex poverty completely sucked me in","578":"this book started out strong but didn't end up being nearly as compelling as i had hoped i'm not sure if the characters were just too unlikable or what but i didn't dig this book","579":"i can only say ok this kept coming up as a recommended read based on my other books i thought it was promising but for me it never quite gelled despite the really promising material a novel that deals with middle class ennui drugs aids sobriety and the 80s should not be as difficult to penetrate as this potential but i didn't find it engaging at all","580":"although i don't know much about the 1980s rock scene i felt the book does a great job of describing the setting it's a decent read about coming of age and generation gaps but i didn't think there was anything spectacular about the novel that set it apart in my mind it certainly kept me glued to the pages and i would recommend it to those who enjoy contemporary fiction however it's one of those books that simply doesn't stand out to me","581":"moving back and forth between vermont and new york city ten thousand saints is an emphatically observed story of a frayed tangle of family members brought painfully together by a death then carried along in anticipation of a new and unexpected life","582":"don't bother hippie burnouts and punk rock kids the author tries to make a deep connection and i'll give her credit for her style it's the only reason i kept reading but the characters all seem so forced trying to be deep and philosophical but instead reading as some boring coming of age story","583":"i knew nothing about straight edge so found that aspect fascinating i felt the story sagged a bit about a third of the way in but found its groove again around the halfway point looking forward to what they do with the upcoming film adaptation","584":"this book moves at a frickin' clip maybe it's moving so fast because there's so much to cram in 1980s east coast vermont and nyc aids teenage pregnancy divorce death drug abuse the homeless straight edge movement cbgbs hardcore punk friendship adoption do you get my drift i enjoyed the idea behind the story which i feel like is based around family dysfunctional at times but family nonetheless i read a review that compared it to a franzen novel and i think that's spot on not as good but the concept is the same the intertwining of family and their friends an element of money an element of hippies grown up and rampant offspring if you are of a certain age and have lived in nyc a lot of the references ring true and will make you nostalgic i imagine the same will hold true for people who have spent time in vermont there's a lot to discuss with this book and one thing is for sure you will not be bored while reading it","585":"a coming of age novel that doesn't pull many punches ten thousand saints opens with jude and teddy getting high under the bleachers of their vermont high school in 1987 dreaming of escape when teddy's half step sister eliza arrives for new years eve from distant thrilling nyc events are set in motion that will change all of their lives forever as an unfortunate cocktail of drugs at a party means that teddy doesn't live to see '88 not a spoiler - this is given away pretty early on the repercussions of teddy's death are far reaching and in eliza's case perhaps a little bit contrived jude moves to new york to find teddy's half brother and gets involved in the straight edge scene rejecting the drugs that killed his best friend the drink he had never been that into and the sex he wasn't having anyway meanwhile we see teddy and jude's parents half parents and broken families - each with their own baggage left over from their 70s hippy history - make clumsy attempts to steer their children to safety without any real idea of what that might be see the full review here","586":"henderson is a gifted writer really good urban history of a recent time unfortunately i did not like the characters at all so i am not rating very fairly","587":"i thoroughly enjoyed this book a really interesting portrait of a scene i didn't really know about the straight edge scene in 1980s nyc but also some great characters here i look forward to reading more from her","588":"great fictional account of the straight edge movement in nyc as well as the aids epidemic and some other stuff too writing as smooth as soft serve why am i always comparing books to food and it rhymes","589":"loved it could not put it down the characters the setting must read cannot believe this is a first novel","590":" i read stacey d'erasmo's review of ten thousand saints in the new york times and i knew i wanted to read this book coming of age tale that takes place partly in new york's late 1980's east village music scene yes please i will read pretty much any novel that is set in new york and even if i don't love it i usually enjoy the portions that take place in this fair city i like knowing where things are and being able to visualize the city blocks the people the scenes if novels were ever set in my hometown i might feel a similar connection or if i ever read anything set at vanderbilt university or chicago but they aren't and i haven't so new york is where my reads tend to take place if i have a bunch of novels lying around and one of them is based in new york city that's the one i'll put at the top of the heap every time ten thousand saints is beautiful and intense and imperfect it does suffer from some unfortunate editorial mistakes some parts go on and on to the detriment of the lovely descriptions of characters time and place but i thought it was a vividly wonderful wild ride i particularly liked the ending which was a little messy and a little sentimental like life like family like teenager ness","591":"i stayed up late reading this and didn't want it to end masterful storytelling and compelling characters plus an interesting setting 1987 in nyc and vermont it all came together bit by bit but i would have been happy if it had gone on longer some of the characters were so interesting but we only got to know a little bit about them","592":"i absolutely loved this book henderson's debut novel is spectacularly written and the characters are insanely real it's as if she wrote the novel sitting in the tour van or the basement of jude's mom's house while hanging out with these kids as someone who spent their teenage years going to shows and drawing x's on her hands i really related to the kids in this book while the bulk of the novel follows a group of straight edge teenagers it never comes off as remotely preachy it's not about being straight edge it's about getting to know yourself and while i felt a connection to many of the characters the one i felt i knew most was new york city the city really comes alive as it's own entity and even though i'll never experience life in alphabet city during the 80's nor do i want to i feel almost as if i did ten thousand saints is worth picking up for the prose alone but following jude eliza and johnny as they try to keep their lives and themselves in one piece is what really made me love this book","593":"wanted to love this book it is after all about vermont and the les and the birth of hardcore but ended up just really liking it the main thing is the characters wandering in various degrees of lost ness through a plot that involves a dead boy's accidental child a pot selling absent father a straight edge though closeted gay band leader who offers to be a father to his brother's yet to be born son and other assorted minor characters the male characters get much more attention than the female ones and the central girl eliza pregnant with the dead boy's kid is a bit of a cipher but jude who carries the story and johnny are extremely well drawn","594":" this is a gorgeous book the characters are vivid alive you can feel them breathe and relate to their thoughts their emotions their behaviors the mark of a literate erudite author with a soul shone through as i the reader could identify with the motivations of even those characters behaving badly the prose is polished and gloriously wrought sentences that stun you with their construction the way they build to a thought or insight you were not expecting this is a real story not an exercise in meta fictive technique beautifully done wonderfully entertaining wrenchingly moving a lovely lovely book i cannot wait for the author's next work","595":"i thought this book was extraordinary a literary novel that told a compelling story without trying to reinvent the genre with characters that kept me up at night the details of the straight edge movement and the glimpses of an angry dangerous new york that i've never known were a fantastic backdrop","596":"definitely not a book i would have picked up on my own if it weren't for book club but certainly an eye opening glimpse into a counter culture that i knew next to nothing about before picking up this book i liked that the plot line was unpredictable and kept me guessing","597":" despite the critical praise heaped on this debut novel i found it tedious the opening chapter introduces us to 15 year old teddy and his best friend jude who pass the time in their rural vermont town huffing chemicals and dreaming of joining teddy's older brother johnny a tattoo artist and a member of a hard core punk band in new york city teddy dies under heartbreaking circumstances and the balance of the book unfolds over the year as jude johnny and eliza a girl pregnant with teddy's child after she relieved teddy of his virginity just hours before his death form a bond in teddy's memory henderson brings to life ny's east village in the mid 1980s the age of aids hare krishna walkman and the unreliable $600 cordless phone but this novel about rudderless kids without role models is slow painful and ultimately unsatisfying","598":"i would describe the book as an excellent exploration of parenting and dealing with random accidents and poor decisions the rampant drug use and the possible horrifying results made me too uncomfortable to recommend the book more highly it was well done and all but wasn't what i normally look for i guess i want something more escapist","599":"it took me a while to get into this one but once it grabbed me it had me","600":" wow i never would have thought of myself as the audience for tenthousand saints this is a novel about leftover hippies yuppie invasions pot sellers zines militant punks aids vermont and new york city in the 1980's but this vigorous imaginative debut novel by eleanor henderson is packed with authenticity and mature storytelling ten thousand saints is the story of jude keffy horn he was raised by adoptive divorced hippy parents in a small city in vermont on the last day of 1987 jude's best friend and partner in getting high music and skipping school teddy dies of an overdose he had spent the previous night doing numerous drugs and having sex with jude's sort of stepsister eliza jude and teddy were just shy of their sixteenth birthdays when this happened sixteen was the magical number that meant quitting school and committing completely to getting wasted as often and for as long as possible lifestyle teddy's death is a bit of a wake call for jude's mother and he is sent to live with his pot farmer father in nyc surprisingly choosing to surround jude with endless pot and place him in a city where anything is within arm's reach does the trick jude careens from one extreme to another but instead of an excess of waste and drugs he becomes involved in the straight edge punk scene a combo of hare krishna and hindu principles with a dab of cultish ness mixed in and embraces the total abstinence of drugs sex and meat jude's parents would rather he be on a continual high than reject their choices with these new addictions but no matter jude creates his own family there is eliza a scared prep school dropout who may be pregnant with teddy's child and teddy's militantly straight edge brother johnny a tattoo artist and musician jude's new life is centered on three things honoring teddy's memory music and trying to outrun his parents mistakes the most prominent manifestation of teddy is eliza's pregnancy all three jude eliza and johnny go to great lengths to try and make sure eliza can have the baby music forming a band is a big point of passion in the novel and it is the story's entree into much of the pop culture history of the 1980's this is the kind of panoramic novel that is usual to see centered on revolutions and multigenerational sagas about settling the american west it's much rarer to see this big vision brought to a relatively small time period and cast but henderson does just that she shines a light on this grimy world and the violence of growing up in it for this generation this is unsentimental strong storytelling reading ten thousands saints is an engrossing experience the characters the dialog and the settings are so wholly believable incarnations the 1980's that it is like going through a time machine there are a few moments when the editor could have used a stronger hand but that is a very minor observation nothing that interferes with your enjoyment with the book eleanor henderson is to be applauded for writing such a vivid accomplished first novel","601":"what a premise two lost boys wandering the lower east side of the 1980s looking for something to hold on to the result however is a colossal snooze bereft of lyrical rhythm and sans emotion that sounds as if it were scribed by someone who wasn't there true and who gleaned the information from a national geographic article on straight edge also true this is a rambling not riffing splurge that begs for lester bangs but instead is mired in a detached wasp i ness penned by someone who spent too much time in school","602":"amazing and ambitious first novel one of the best books i've read this past year a little depressing at times but i couldn't put it down","603":"beautifully written but it takes forever to get going and none of the characters are that relatable","604":"interesting and original makes you realize how long ago the 80s were","605":"great book great characters great story for those of you who feel like aging punk rockers such as myself you'll find lots to relate to and become wistful for the 80s and 90s punk scene i also appreciate the incorporate of the straight edge scene the toll of hiv and the tension between lots of us queers in the punk scene and the sometime homophobia among the punks","606":"i didn't like this very much all of the characters seemed awful and stupid and kept making predictable mistakes i wasn't sure who if anyone i was supposed to like or care about and why i guess it's a slice of new york in the 80s but that wasn't enough to make it interesting to me","607":"best friends jude and teddy spend their teenage days getting high in their small town in vermont when teddy dies of an overdose jude is sent to live with his estranged hippy father in nyc and soon falls in with a group of straight edge hare krishnas a great portrait of late 1980s lower east side new york city","608":"i really thought i would like this book more than i did being a young adult in the 1980's i thought i would really relate to situations and cultural references but because i was not a punk rock or straight edger i did not even know what straight edge was and because the idea of new york was so foreign to me i did not relate at all the book was fairly well written but had a lot going on","609":"ten thousand saints starts out like it could have been written by a fourteen year old girl the tragic death of a teenage boy is somehow mitigated when the pregnancy resulting from a drug addled one night hookup means that his memory will live on forever our young heroine eliza cheerfully goes on using cocaine for half a pregnancy but heaven help anyone who suggests she might not make the best parent after all the dead boy's best friend and half brother can take care of her and how could three teenage dropouts not create a perfect life for themselves so yes i'm a bit of a crank and this kept me from finishing the novel for a few months what brought me back was the author's vivid and engaging portrayal of the new york straight edge music scene of the early '80s a depiction of an era that serves oddly enough as a stateside middle class echo of the london upper crust in the line of beauty fortunately the characters are eventually revealed as much more complex than they initially appear and the novel's plot moves quickly from simplistically ridiculous to a much more interesting tangle of lives when the story ends it feels a tad too abrupt and unresolved but i think i prefer this to a neatly resolved narrative arc","610":"a thoughtful sentimental book about coming of age in the 80's and the straight edge punk movement so many 80's nyc references made the story familiar","611":"this book is about so many things chiefly it's a coming of age novel but it's also about small town ennui and drugs the beginning of the aids crisis among gay men in new york city adoption and makeshift families gentrification and the straight edge hardcore punk rock scene the last of those is something i don't really have a huge interest in so it's to henderson's credit that i was mostly riveted by this story","612":"a fairly easy read and i liked seeing how the characters grow and change but there wasn't nearly enough depth of feeling or psychology given the weighty situations the characters were dealing with","613":"average read the author tries to attack many different cultural issues and falls short on most i did enjoy the ending though","614":"pretty good","615":"glad i picked it up and started not the usual book i read i usually am more of historical fiction but this book was very good good character development and great plot","616":"this book reminded me a lot of some people i knew in high school i guess attending high school during the late 80's in the ny nj area had a lot to do with it my favorite thing about the story was how all these characters were woven together and how the author made you feel the intamacy of each of those relationships","617":" sometimes i just can't articulate why a book doesn't do it for me 'ten thousand saints' unfortunately is just such a book perhaps the problem was due to too many characters being introduced in the beginning so that i was not able to readily discern who was whose friend whose mother belonged to which child and whose father was whose new boyfriend information overload which in all probability says more about the dysfunctionality of my brain than the lack of clarity in the text sometimes i wonder why with goods in general you can get your money back if dissatisfied but with books that don't deliver you can't oh well there's always a spot on a st vinnies bookshelf","618":"considering the review i read in the times i expected more i think when writing about juveniles it's hard not to be juvenile at least sometimes and i hated the ending spoiler alert ravi should have adopted the baby and the vagueness about whether eliza was his wife or not was annoying why should we be left guessing what is the point of that","619":"after fits and starts i finally put the time into reading this novel one of ny times 10 best of 2011 and i am so glad i did it is a coming of age novel set in the late 1980's in new york and vermont with the permissive aging hippie parents and rampant drugs sex and rock and roll i found it harder to relate to the teenagers in the novel than to just be a bystander and read as their lives unfolded","620":"it was pretty good for her first novel it was very well written the ending became a bit cheesey but i did enjoy it","621":"a lot of thoughtful coming of age experiences in this novel that make you think about parent child love growing up very well written","622":"an unflinching and generous coming of age story moving and elegiac","623":" i realized as i started this book that i've been reading a lot of fiction set in the 1980s lately this is completely coincidental to my recent scholarly interest in the 80s as a sociologically relevant historical period i can't tell if it's just me getting older or time moving us further and further from that decade but either way i'm intrigued by how much the politics economics and culture of the 80s continues to reverberate today i think the 1980s time period was actually my favorite part of this story we get a glimpse of what life was like in nyc as the yuppies took over gentrifying and cleaning up the city pushing out undesirables we also see the generation gap between the free loving hippie parents and their straight edge 80s children i liked reading about the straight edge punk scene and the hare krishna religion henderson does a nice job of highlighting the contrasts between the 60s and 80s and some of the consequences of those divisions","624":"a novel about new jersey hardcore krishna kids this came across as totally authentic","625":"there's a lot of late eighties teenage shenanigans starting off this novel a charged up kind of punk erudition the urbane in your face stride of an anarchist the tone and mood fit the era well and the particular crowd that the reader is thrust into is intransigent forceful rough a sizzling clash of cultures between the hippies and what we now know as gen x ers ensues as well as between hardcore and straight edge drug and sex free punk a clash that is eventually sanded smoother as an understanding is reached between both countercultures and hypocrisies are penetrated my only complaint is that it is too lengthy and repetitive at intervals the hardcore punk rock music venues and the physical violence between some of these musicians got a little tedious the author could have been pared it down 100 pages or so and still brandished a powerful story definitely recommended to the gen x crowd for its authenticity and story there's a mocking quality that you have to accept and lots of drugs this is an author to watch a classy debut","626":"while it's not horribly written the story line is too difficult to follow at times and jumps around way too much i can appreciate where the author was trying to go with this but i simply couldn't get into it","627":" maybe 3 1 2 stars this book is a coming of age story set in the 80's against the straight edge punk movement drugs teen pregnancy aids adoption and just normal teen angst parts of it i really liked parts of it i didn't quite get why they were included parts of the narrative seemed to be rushed or missing other reviewers didn't like the ambiguous ending but i loved that part i like it when an author doesn't cross every single 't' for me but allows me to draw my own conclusions overall not a great book but not bad i think this author might improve with subsequent efforts","628":"meh that is pretty much what i thought about this book i hated the characters i found them immature and boring the worst part is that half way through the book i found myself wanting to know what happens to them i am not sure how that happened but it did so i kept on reading plus i hate to leave a book unfinished i wouldn't really recommend this book to anyone the fact that it had such rave critics reviews baffles me","629":"hmmm did not love this book but didn't hate it either kept reading to find out where it would all end interesting but not sure i'd recommend it necessarily either","630":"at first i didn't think i would like this book at all and almost put it down then finally somehting happens that changed the books dynamics and kept me reading by the end i almost wished i had given up on it i found the characters hard to like and a little too cliche","631":"timeless story complete with love triangle about one boy's search for love and understanding it is the details that henderson hits out of the park whether writing about the aids epidemic during the early 80s or the nuances of the competition for who will carry on teddy's memory a writing c plot but in the end i was invested in the story and the characters","632":"i'd bought this as an audiobook due to the fact that i'd enjoyed it so much on its release a couple of years ago the novel follows the fortunes of jude a vermont teenager who we meet at the start along with his best friend teddy on his 16th birthday on the last night of 1987 the boys fit the 'stoner' mould of teen but tragedy strikes and teddy dies the loss eventually leads jude to move to nyc to avoid trouble at home while seeking out teddy's brother johnny and his absent father's on off girlfriend's daughter eliza who had visited on the night of teddy's death complicated or so it seems and i suppose it is what drew me to the book in the first place were its links to the 1980s lower east side alphabet city story some of whose real history is dealt with toward the end of the novel but also the depiction of the straightedge hardcore music scene of the time which was based around venues like cbgb's and whose members often had links to the hare krishna movement i listened to a few of these bands as a teenager and was fascinated to learn more about their lives through the novel how on earth would eleanor henderson have the inside info on this movement you might ask apparently her husband grew up in the precise location at the time of the novel and source material came from him the novel itself is well written and encompasses many serious issues teenage pregnancy drugs aids and even gentrification but does so without being artificial or preachy this is a book i was sold on before i'd read much more than the blurb but it's one that i feel many would enjoy even without the specific subject interest i have worth checking out","633":"my favourite book in a long time just something honest sweet but not so innocent about it highly recommend","634":" 4 5ten thousand saints is the story of three different families and how their lives eventually combine set on the punk rock scene in the 1980s the story proved to be pretty interesting and well entertaining the story took me some time to get into and the ending is nothing grand but i enjoyed this book and would recommend it for sure the book taught me a lot about life in new york during this era how the different subcultures work and how people lived i was able to dive into a book i knew nothing about which evolved around a topic i knew nothing about and i came out of it educated and pleased","635":" what did this book want to be who knows henderson throws everything at this book adoption teen pregnancy aids absent parents drugs jock bullies damaged lower classes damaged upper classes fas oding straight edge movement homosexuality etc but the kitchen sink after almost 400 pages u0026amp all the hard issues henderson tackles the book left me with not much to think about why because henderson didn't focus on any one thing she just keeps throwing out more problems u0026amp improbable situations the characters are cartoony u0026amp not well developed henderson made a backdrop nyc vermont 1980's which could have been really intersting however henderson fumbles here as well i feel she fundamentally doesn't understand her characters or how to weave an in depth tale i just finished an excellent coming of age book ask the dust u0026amp this is the unlucky follower maybe it was just bad timing","636":" i greatly enjoyed the novel ten thousand saints by eleanor henderson however the story ended up becoming something completely different from what i had intentionally expected while reading the summary i thought that this book would center more around drugs and perhaps jude's struggle in becoming straight edge however i found that the story ended up becoming much more than that i did not expect the story to have a touch of romance within it i also loved how many different themes that was within it it incorporated romance drug use death depression sickness and teenage pregnancy the main conflict of the story ends up centering around teddy and eliza's unborn baby which i did enjoy the reason why i liked the other themes is because it helped keep the story light and didn't delve too much into the drug use and the straight edge band scene i also enjoyed how many layers jude's personality had one minute he's a hard core druggie and the next he's a vegan who abstains from sex and alcohol the story didn't have much drama which lead to some moments where it was a bit boring to read but all in all i thought this book was good","637":" maybe i would have liked this more if it weren't a subject that is close to my heart and that i felt such a strong connection to but because of said feeling i couldn't identify with the characters as much because despite their being involved in some of the same stuff hardcore music straight edge etc they were very different people from me and how i would have acted in those situations not that i need to see my self in every character or whatever but i don't know something about the book rubbed me the wrong way it was decent and i don't feel like it was a waste of time i'd probably recommend it to others of my friends to see what they thought as well","638":" the way i see it henderson kept on slinging vital societal issues that a some child would probably face well society in the us and the ph are minutely growing similar but still different but one weak point of this book is that although it was a four hundred pager it tackled too much henderson wanted to include quite a hand full of issues in this coming of age novel that she forgot to keep her focus on one main objective but all in all i liked it i liked how it was realistic in a sense that it reflected the stories of abused teens online in the sense that it delved outside the boarders of happy endings i just hope i could get more from this still y henderson haha","639":"the epigraph is from the book of jude behold the lord cometh with ten thousand of his saints to execute judgement upon all at first i was so put off with the characters in this book horrible parents acting horribly drugged teenagers making bad decisions but managing the best they can with drugs violence and heavy metal music but something became so endearing to me about each and every main character even with so many apparent flaws and bad behavior how did the author do that the main themes in this book for me were the basic need to belong be accepted and be loved and to persevere no matter what the circumstances in the final pages jude realizes he is jealous of everyone who knew how they wanted to be loved his journey was pretty remarkable some books rate better than others when you know you'll be thinking about it for days afterwards this is one of those books for me","640":"i thought it was going to be a different type of book more a book of events that i could relate to since it was billed as a book about kids in high school in the late 1980s but it was about a group of lost souls and their journey to be found great character development and i enjoyed it but i wouldn't recommend you run out and buy it","641":" it was in the early stages of this novel when 'bongs' were being mentioned regularly and i had to admit i didn't know what a bong was that i began to suspect i may be unqualified to read it books involving drugs often leave me confused but in this case it was more fighting off boredom there were interesting bits small moments of drama and a bit of humour the militant vegetarians attacking the barbecue with 'piss filled water guns' was excellent but in between i found it tedious i detected a determination to portray the characters' issues with drugs in a way that wasn't judgemental or disapproving but i still found it hard to sympathise with any of them mostly i just wanted them to get over themselves","642":"i have been reading tons and this one is oddly my favorite so far strange story like nothing i have read but still in that dysfunctional family theme that i love","643":"in the first few pages of this book i was afraid that i wouldn't be able to get into it but shortly thereafter i had the exact opposite problem i couldn't put it down set in vermont and new york city in the late 1980's ten thousand saints focuses on the life of teenager jude keffey horn and the cast of characters around him jude's best friend teddy dies this is not a spoiler as the author lets you know it's coming on the first page and jude has to make sense of his life without its primary witness he becomes involved in nyc's early straight edge scene using the brotherhood and the strict moral code to help him forge an identity when he is otherwise adrift the characters in this book are so vivid that i found myself thinking about them as if they were friends of mine and the tragic elements of their lives are always redeemed by a sweet desire to do the right thing even though they often fail henderson's writing is magnificent she always picks the perfect metaphor which is almost unnerving highly recommend","644":" the promise of ten thousand saints was huge to me a period piece that dealt with straight edge a culture i've been curious about for ages though not enough to actually try it the set up is perfect two kids getting high on anything that holds still long enough and one ends up dead jude has to make sense of his life after his friend dies and he gets involved with straight edge as a result it's a morality tale without getting too moral and a way to show how someone who once fed his addictions with substance abuse switches that same personality to a life where he eschews everything he once did had the book stuck to this story it could have been brilliant however it involves several messy subplots with hippie parents coming to grips with things and a teen pregnancy that complicates things even further and makes the story less about jude and more about everything but jude and his story gets lost in the muddle","645":" i wanted to like it more than i did i enjoyed how recognizable the 1980s lower east side and east village were and found the generational differences between the kids and the adults poignant and authentic i got invested in one or two characters and midway through i started to think about the parallels between this book and the musical rent which i know deeply and love unconditionally it was fun to map the connections and i did like the music scenes in the book very much and the contrasts between vermont and nyc so why do i still have reservations how to talk about it without dropping spoilers i can say this i had a hard time remembering that the characters were 16 or 18 year olds and a critical piece of information about one of the 16 year olds weirdly stopped being integral to the character's actions the first quarter of the book felt so nihilistic and painful that it was hard to recover from it and i couldn't decide if the exploration of late 80s sexual identities worked consistently or not so i'm a flip flopper about it i do think that there's a great movie in this book though and i hope it gets filmed with some tough and passionate teens in the starring roles","646":" reading this book was like skipping a stone it travels far but not deep henderson has a seemingly effortless writing style that makes it easy to get lost in space and time i would read her work again simply to see how she evolves because there was a lot of promise in this book but it introduced so many concepts that simply went nowhere and that's disappointing it's about the 80s straight edge punk scene but it's not about music it's about family dysfunction but it doesn't examine the family it's a coming of age novel but we don't delve into jude beyond the surface it's about fas and drug abuse and spirituality and the fear of aids and closeted homosexuality but not in a way that we can understand the full consequences of any of these subjects on characters editorially i would have loved for the eliza storyline to not exist weak and unnecessary and for jude and johnny to connect on all the points above with no hesitation and no fear just as we were left to imagine it must have been","647":"i enjoyed this book but maybe i just wasn't as interested in the straight edge punk scene of the early 80s as i thought i might be worthwhile for the great assortment of characters","648":"i wanted to like this book and i did however i think it might have benefited from a bit more editing on the setting side as another reviewer remarked it seems like every punk band from the late 80s early 90s and every store on st marks les was mentioned as background which for a while was great i enjoyed the walk down memory lane places not bands but the commotion at the end went on too long i had had enough at that point also there were just a couple too many coincidences in this book it was a tad unbelievable but the story was entertaining and it did bring me right back to summer in nyc in the early 90s no mention of the awful woman who used to work the door downstairs at the pyramid now that i appreciate she gets no love from me","649":" for me this book read chapter by chapter like episodes of a television series that purposely leaves you hanging at the end of each episode so you tune in for the next one it wasn't an bad thing perhaps i would call this a sxe page turner overall i liked the book i was very entertained by it but it was difficult for me to suspend disbelief at many points in reading it i thought it was clear that henderson was never personally involved in the scene she wrote about her characters seemed to reflect a very literal interpretation of it in any event the novel had a quite creative premise and did surprise me a little at the end so that was good i would

family of flawed characters carry this story yet on a fundamentally human level they are somehow lovable or identifiable living with the greatest of strength and frailty in any given moment stay with this one despite the slow plodding pace an intimacy develops and you live with the characters as they slowly unravel","2":" i can definitely understand why this was published it was quite a page turner held my interest while on vacation to the point where i wanted to read more than i wanted to go to a pub in ireland and some of the passages in it truly took my breath away notably the conversation where ed u0026amp eileen told connell about ed's diagnosis and ed's final letter to connell but all three of the principals in this book were problematic for me eileen she's a career nurse with a graduate degree for pete's sake and didn't recognize her husband's behavior as classic obvious dementia for something like a year and then even after he gets the alzheimer's diagnosis and is alarmingly incapacitated she leaves him home alone for long stretches of time every day surely someone who's spent 25 years in the medical profession would be aware of home health services medic alert bracelets senior day programs and so on that are available in large metropolitan areas like new york i tried using her old fashioned repressed irish catholic marriage to explain her denial of ed's reality but it just didn't jibe with the smart self reliant eileen that the author presented us with in the first half of eileen's life eileen's near desertion of her professional senses from the onset of ed's symptoms made the rest of the story pretty painful to read ed's character was really underdeveloped the details given about his professional life didn't support the pronouncements assumptions made about him by eileen connell and the narrator if ed was such a beloved teacher the anecdotes and examples weren't there to show it in fact the only evidence i read of ed's interaction with his students was the disastrous lecture that connell witnessed and if i'd been a tuition paying student in that class dr leary would have received a scathing evaluation at the least if not a call for his resignation and the same goes for the his devotion to connell articulated so eloquently and touchingly in his letter at the end it would have been so much more effective if there had been any evidence of a relationship ed as far as is exposed on the printed page consisted of some borderline and other outright abusive interactions the driving lesson the take your son to work day the screaming and the headphone silent treatment yikes and finally connell sheesh the shift in the last third of the book from eileen to connell seems to attempt weirdly to make this a coming of age story and frankly connell as a college student is one selfish little guy gad who picks up chicks on the flight home for his father's death his transformation to devoted teacher and husband and prospective father in the epilogue was just incredible showing his arrival without evidence of how he got there made the transformation unbelievable i wonder if all my problems with this narrative were actually written but edited out of an already pretty long novel if that's the case and i imagine that's not unusual in first novels i hope matthew thomas writes another book that gives him an opportunity to improve i mean chabon's mysteries of pittsburgh was kind of a turkey but look at his subsequent work","3":"this book is beautifully written thomas takes on a great deal as his hard working upwardly mobile main character eileen tumulty wants more than life in an apartment in queens read this book","4":"not all aspects of the novel are entirely satisfactory but the characterisation is strong and interaction of the characters in this irish american family is handled very well by the author the plot is linear and predictable and overall the text could have been condensed nonetheless a thoroughly enjoyable read and i award 4 stars","5":" i received this book for free through goodreads first reads matthew thomas' historical - yet contemporary american novel we are not ourselves is a captivating moving story of eileen leary nee tumulty's life from the age of nine 1951 up until the year 2011 it describes the fictional life of a woman who had a difficult childhood but harbored dreams of a wonderful future however we read of her disappointing marriage to her husband ed and the struggles of remaining in work whilst raising her only son connell the tale takes a heartrending turn when ed's midlife crisis spirals into early onset alzheimer's - something that is difficult for the family to come to terms with initially readers may be put off by the sheer length of the volume yet thomas' writing style is a joy to read his coherent sentences slide so nicely over the tongue that some may get the urge to read passages out loud there is an intelligent air about the novel on the whole emphasized by the use of quotes from well known sources as titles of different parts of the book the main title for instance is taken from a quote from king lear this also stresses the theme of alzheimer's disease and eileen's dissatisfaction with the way in which her life has turned out there is no thrilling plot line within this novel with twists or miracles but that does not matter the fact that everything unfolds gradually makes it all the more realistic it reveals the truth about life no one has the complete control to dream up their ideal house their ideal children their ideal lifestyle and live it too whilst it is evident that choice influences the direction people's lives take life as well as death has a will of it's own incurable illness happen there is no denying that it is how we carry on that is important as the book spans six decades there is also a slight essence of historical insight into the changing society and culture in new york connell shows an easy acceptance of the increasing amount of spanish and asian families populating the area however for eileen these changes are more upsetting - although i would not go as far as to say that she is racist overall we are not ourselves is a powerfully emotional yet enjoyable novel something perfect to dip in and out of whenever you have the time","6":"while some parts of this book moved so slowly that i could not believe i had only covered 50 pages it seemed like 200 i really loved it","7":" this read like two books the first about eileen's early years up to when her child was born and then it turned into different book entirely the second half was significantly better the first part was a standard immigrant novel with eileen's parents as the immigrants and i felt as though i'd read it before the issues created by her childhood were screamingly obvious and to me artificially exaggerated albeit well written but then the book changed as eileen and ed began to age and connell to grow up the seminal crisis of the book emerges no spoilers here and eileen becomes more nuanced and real i loved the second half and spent two hours in the middle of the day yesterday sitting at my kitchen counter because i absolutely had to finish it before i did anything else the second half of this book was truly wonderful my rating of 4 is a 3 for the first half and a 5 for the second","8":"found the story very predictable depressing","9":" lovely writing that needs some serious editingi hate to rate a new author's debut novel so low especially considering what an eloquent and compelling writer he obviously is but are you kidding me never have i partake in so much extraneous and i'm afraid fairly useless information in final draft by not doing her job the editor really did a disservice to this new author i know the editing was sloppy because i counted at least half a dozen typos and fact errors a good quarter of the minutiae could have been dumped and you would have been left with an excellent piece of literature fully developed characters and more time to let the reader feel the emotions the author was obviously trying to invoke but wading through all of the excess verbiage made it impossible to really feel the story it's a good first draft","10":"would have given 5 stars but i thought the author could have dug deeper with connell he was maybe the most interesting character and i felt a few of the major things that occurred were written and then forgotten about otherwise moving and powerful","11":"this book was a very hard book to get into but i'm glad i did it took until about halfway through to get rolling then the family dynamics and hardships tugged at my heartstrings it is a true reminder to let people know through words and action that we love them and that really is what life is about","12":"i really enjoyed reading this book the characters are so real ordinary and yet engaging the book reminded me at times of a johnny cheever story strong story tellers to me are priceless mathews transported me a time and place that i have only read i was born abroad always intrigued by stories about america i now need to find another great story to read","13":"packed with insightful and revealing moments i almost put it down because the alzheimers was so hard to take i am glad i didn't there are no easy answers here but a lot of questions i was willing to engage","14":"this was a book that i really battled with at first it was hard to get into the writing but the story sucked me in once it did though it was depressing and i wanted to stop however i kept reading because i wanted to believe that things would get better for the family maybe that's the power of this book","15":"because i don't like to read too much about a book before i read the book i thought this was just another family saga it is to an extent but it took a turn that i probably would have known about if i'd read too much of the publicity blurbs and i like the turn that it took it is mostly about a couple and to a lesser extent their son people basically good people making mistakes sometimes just out of pride it is about loneliness and relationships living up to expectations acceptance taking care it spun out a simple tale that is too easy to relate to ordinary life that isn't as we dream it will be most of the writing is quite good some of it is beautiful and some of the characters had interesting ways of looking at life \"there were places she now saw that contained more happiness than ordinary places did unless you knew that such places existed you might be content to stay where you were \"\"the little sedimentary deposits of his need had piled at her feet until they blocked her view of him \"\"you are not in this life to count up victories and defeats you are in it to love and be loved you are loved with your head down you will be loved whether you finish or not \"\"empathy he hadn't always had it it was a muscle you had to develop and then keep conditioned \"but then again i felt it was overwritten in some places although not too often while i liked the characters and empathized with them i didn't quite take them into my heart as much as i expected yes i cared about them but the story didn't turn me into a quivering mass of jelly in the end at 600 pages in my advance reader's copy it was a little longer than it needed to be but not as much as the page count would make you think for those who like reading about ordinary families just trying to get through life and get a little enjoyment out of it this is an entertaining and thoughtful story i was given an advance reader's copy of this book and the quotes may have changed in the published edition","16":"while this was an incredibly long novel with many ebbs and flows the characters kept me engaged and wanting to continue reading there is not one story line or plot but a story that spans more than half a decade it starts as an irish immigrant story then evolves into the story of a marriage birth of a child building of careers ambitions gained and lost and the effects and aftermath of a devastating disease lots to keep you reading and thinking parts were slow so slow that i was glad i was listening and not holding up a hard cover book it was a novel that evoked all sorts of emotions in me and one that i will remember","17":"if you're looking for the fiction of 2014 this is it matthew thomas writes family stories as good as wally lamb an amazing debut novel","18":"a great exploration of what a family means and what someone's illness does to that family i really liked the main character of eileen tumulty and her husband edmund was sympathetic very well written","19":"this review has been hidden because it contains spoilers to view it click here it took me a while not because i didn't enjoy it but because it's been a busy few weeks and i finally had a vacation to read i never loved the main character but i did really feel connected to ed he reminded me of walter white from breaking bad i never was sure how much eileen loved him until he got sick and then i realized she loved him the most she could i couldn't stand her coldness to her son i loved the book the years and years of their meeting and their course of life i saw how it took me a while not because i didn't enjoy it but because it's been a busy few weeks and i finally had a vacation to read i never loved the main character but i did really feel connected to ed he reminded me of walter white from breaking bad i never was sure how much eileen loved him until he got sick and then i realized she loved him the most she could i couldn't stand her coldness to her son i loved the book the years and years of their meeting and their course of life i saw how much eileen needed to do well for herself almost like that was her job vs being a nurse she was so consumed with material items and even after ed was sick it still mattered so much i guess the hardest part and the best part of the book is how it captures alzheimer's how sad scary and draining it will be on those surrounded by it i would suggest this book and get past page 150 it's worth it more","20":"couldn't finish too long and slow","21":"620 pages makes a hefty read and i personally found it excessive for what this book offers the story line a family dealing with alzheimer's is right up my street but the slow pace and detail spread over three generations made it a bit of a slog","22":"i have mixed feelings the book was good in some ways the topic of a family struggling with an illness is not something you see written too often i find at times the book dragged after reading the book i feel i do not really know the mother even though much of the book was narrated through her","23":"it was good in the sense that it was eye opening but i found myself having a hard time concentrating it was a little boring","24":"i would have given it 4 stars except for the fact that it was at times too slow too wordy and i had to wade through it but it was a very worthwhile read with a meaningful message","25":"compelling yet low key story of a woman beginning in childhood and ending when she is a widow in her 60s the early chapters reminded me of a tree grows in brooklyn the later chapters are celebrated for their portrait of a marriage as one partner declines in health i found i wanted to know what happened without ever being in love with the book","26":"beautiful story true to life kept me interested for the entire book details places reflective of my own life","27":"accurate portrayal of most everyone and everything there was just so much space between the characters parents children i understand that space husband and wife not so much nevertheless i read the whole thing glad it was on a kindle my particular point of identification with the irish redhead main character was in her lot as principal caregiver for a loved one with alzheimer's disease thomas tracked the spiral of descent very faithfully good book","28":"authentic and moving dramatization of alzheimer's and its effect on a family","29":"i guess i understand why people didn't like it nothing truly exciting happens to propel it along but life can be like that this is a book about the quiet courage it takes to live life sometimes it is about putting one foot in front of the other and moving forward this book was beautifully written and while not action packed was a page turner nonetheless for me anyway although i do understand this is not everyone's cup of tea","30":"excellent writing and family story related to the setting and the nursing career look forward to future novels by this author","31":"i guess this book is what you'd call a family saga it starts by relating eileen's early years and the formative influences on her namely poverty and alcoholic parents eileen wants to escape from that world and pushes herself to be the best she can be so she can upgrade to bigger and better eileen sees money and the external trappings of wealth big house fancy cars as signs of success even when those things are all paid for on credit through eileen we get to know her husband ed and hear his story and then that of their son connell what didn't work for me about this book was the unrelenting minutiae of daily life the author included it just went on and on for 620 pages the book needed significant editing additionally the three stories eileen ed connell didn't mesh together well and it felt like three separate books crammed together it particularly felt this way with the early parts of the book with eileen and then the later storyline with what happens with ed the book had its moving moments but it was so bogged down in the minutiae and the characters were so wooden i just didn't really care i'll be very reluctant to pick up anything by this author again","32":"unbelievably poignant and real haven't read anything this powerful in a long long time","33":" 3 5 stars i was up and down with we are not ourselves which begins with a very strong first 100 pages sketching life of eileen tumulty leary from childhood to home ownership this section covers about 30 years very well and it makes what i think is the novel's central point eileen's idea of a happy life is one of constantly ascending status and success and her failure for much of the book to appreciate what she has is a very american flaw after eileen and her family move out of the queens home they've known for years there is a turning point which i won't spoil it comes with about 250 pages to go and i wondered if the book would go in a more sentimental direction after that but it didn't eileen at this point is clear eyed and purposeful not always sympathetic a little bit racist and sometimes slow to recognize her own needs her indomitability in the face of adversity including the dullness of her own son winds up making her a memorable character also cheers to matthew thomas for not glossing over things like the financial strain that serious illness can put on a family we are not ourselves is the real thing","34":"advertised as an epic novel it was epic in length and i feel would have benefited from some skillful editing i started out engaged with the characters but lost interest midway through the novel i shouldn't compare novels but this one definitely didn't pull me in like 'a tree grows in brooklyn' a book that i adored and had somewhat similar themes","35":"whew be prepared to set aside a substantial chunk of time to tackle this 620 page tome despite the major time investment and moments of pure heartbreak i was moved by thomas' novel which in sum is an epic human and real story spanning a 50 year period the story chronicles the life of eileen tumulty as she navigates a childhood in queens new york with alcoholic irish immigrant parents falls in love with the idea of a life with ed leary and then marries him we are not ourselves is the story of their marriage the good times and the very bad times it is also the story of connell leary eileen and ed's son who grows up and becomes an adult before the reader's very eyes we are not ourselves is written so well the story is well told and feels extremely realistic the characters are fully developed and remind you of people you might meet along the way in your own life i found the first 150 pages or so to be a bit slow but i was fully engaged in the story and kept reading i most enjoyed when connell reached adolescence and the author began alternating perspectives between him and his mother this provided much more depth and interest for me this book is heartbreakingly real in its portrayal of a vicious disease alzheimer's but ultimately uplifting in that it reinforces the power and importance of family dedication and love","36":" i think this is a low 4 for me i need to bring it out of the 3 star bin because of how much i liked the writing but i did struggle through it at times very empathetic look into a family dealing with a very heartbreaking disease but i liked that it spanned the years and gave you insight into their life but then threw in these surprise revelations every now and then eileen was a great complex interesting three dimensional character connell was understandable but the worst ed remained kind of a mystery to me the whole time but maybe that was the point not an easy book or subject but i'm glad to have read it","37":"this was a good story although a little sad","38":"one of the most moving books i've read in years","39":"very long","40":"should be called we are not edited an enjoyable enough read moving at times but so much fat could have been cut still a very good not great first novel","41":"reading about alzheimer's disease evokes all sorts of negative feelings but matthew thomas makes it as painless as possible well done first novel","42":"'disappointing' would probably sum up my review of this book allow me to say that i do not understand the fuss over this particular novel yes it is utterly honest real and has plenty of raw emotion in it however the author fails to make this an engaging story not through the characters nor through the plot i believe he might have got too caught up in how close to his heart and his real life these characters are to let the story flow in a more relatable way although the actual story of these characters could be potentially heart breaking and tremendously emotional for the reader the narrative appallingly failed to make me feel anything at all but a intense desire to finally finish it and move on to the next book in my list this is merely an ok book","43":"beautiful quiet very moving portrait of family life and illness i read this for a book club and i'm so glad it was recommended to me it had a bit of a slow start but keep going it's well worth the long read","44":"this is a debut novel that i'm still thinking about a bitter sweet story of how the determination to reach the american dream can blind to what is truly important","45":"we are not ourselves starts off as a rather conventional story that of eileen leary her childhood and transition into the adult life growing up as an irish american in new york in all its glorious banality eileen's story grows into a rather stunning sprawling family drama it's a testament to matthew thomas' skills as a novelist the way this book takes hold of the reader slowly but then determinedly until the devastating end a sincere and beautiful work of literature","46":"i received a free advance review copy of this book from simon u0026amp schuster through netgalley in exchange for an honest review i found this story unbalanced the first half of the book was sluggish in pace and the content was not quite as intriguing as promised while the second half was far more interesting and picked up the pace in moving the story forward in truth i wouldn't say the story even started until the second half of the book i also found the length of the book to hinder rather than redeem the quality of the story for there were too many unnecessary sections that lost my interest and ultimately contributed in creating an overall dry impression of the novel for example although i understand the importance of the author having revealed eileen leary's upbringing and early years with such exquisite detail in order to spotlight long standing familial patterns and neighbourhood history this could have been accomplished to much the same effect in far fewer words furthermore the story was told rather than emotionally conveyed the only truly moving aspect of the narrative was the struggle experienced by mr leary and even this challenge lacked the emotional depth it deserved ultimately the characters said things and did things rather than felt things and this is why they remained characters and never grew into people for me","47":"we are not ourselves is a beautifully written and profoundly moving book that tells the story of a family from the perspectives of those in it principally those of a mother and son as their husband father is gradually lost to them it is also a compelling examination of urban america during the last half of the 20th century because it feels so real and true i found the book to be a difficult read it's also slow in spots but more than worth staying with","48":"i did not finish this book because it is way too long and i quit caring interesting at first but then it became tedious and annoying","49":"i was not a fan of this book i really wanted to love it i really did but i just couldn't get emotionally interested in the characters whom i though were all one diminutional and so so selfish it's a book where a lot goes on but nothing happens it drags on from snippet to snippet unraveling this families dealings with a horrible disease over years and years it's supposed to be a great novel of love an loss and family but i found it slowly paced with unlikeable characters who cared for nothing but themselves there was an unbelievable quality about eileen and ed's relationship from the start we were supposed to believe that they had this deep love for one another but i just didn't feel it even as he got sick and she did show a martyr's composure in her care for him i still never believed in them as a couple and therefor never really had the feeling of investment in their story what did give this book a sad and scary redeeming 2 stars in my review is that the study of alzheimer's is quite realistic it's the most scary disease to me and this book did nothing to discourage that fear it's an awful disease","50":"the problem with this book is to me that i do like thomas' writing style it's easy to read without being simplistic but i just didn't like the book the thing is this entire book is misery there's alcoholism death bullying miscarriage illness but that wouldn't be so bad in itself this book follows the life of eileen tumulty and her family and miserable things simply do happen in life the real problem to me was that i felt nothing for eileen the moment she starts growing up nothing seems more important to her than appearances she's materialistic racist even though she refuses to see herself as such and constantly worrying about what other people think of her to the point that it deprives her and the people around her of happiness the entire part between eileen's childhood and ed's illness which is sadly a big part of the book did nothing but make me realize what i do not want from life so why did i force myself through i suppose because of the many positive reviews it got and after ploughing through at least half of the book it got better or rather things got worse but at least connell the son became less frustrating and the book started focusing on something the way a severe illness changes lives both directly and people's outlook on it this if nothing else made the book interesting my main problem with the book is simply that it's too long it's not badly written it shows how experiences shape people and lives but it didn't make me like eileen nor her husband to read about her petty grievances and their relationship or to know that even if their relationship wasn't going well at least they still had a sex life i just didn't care and that makes reading 600 pages feel like trying to walk against the stream of a deep river tiring slow and caring more about the finish line than anything else","51":" this book is the story of an irish woman growing up in the middle to late 20th century the reader follows eileen tumulty through her childhood and her determination to get away from her parents her mother is an alcoholic and to have a big house in a nice neighborhood the first part of the book follows eileen through her childhood until she meets ed leary ironic that ed is irish and she had sworn she would never marry someone irish the second half of the book is about her marriage to ed and their son eonnell the point of view switches back and forth in this period between eileen and connell i didn't find connell very interesting and i skipped large portions of his story ed has problems and it's pretty obvious what's going on with him i will bet you can guess his problem long before eileen does the end also focused on connell and i would rather have focused the ending on eileen the ending wasn't satisfying or as interesting as the rest of the book if you like growing up and family stories you will like this book the writing is well done and the characters are well developed","52":"longest audiobook ever because it includes every mundane detail about one family's life i kept waiting for something really great to happen and nope","53":" how can we are not ourselves be a debut novel if you had the opportunity to hear matthew thomas explain it it would make sense ten years yes ten years of hard work tweaking and self editing before he even tried to sell his manuscript ten years thomas' diligence paid off in a bidding war for his novel and with glowing early reviews from professionals and readers alike it was enlightening to hear matthew thomas speak at r j julia's in madison ct this past monday evening it also makes my thoughts on we are not ourselves harder to express not only did i really like we are not ourselves but i liked matthew also these two things combined make we want to get this right but unlike matthew i don't have ten years simply stated we are not ourselves is an impelling saga of a multigenerational irish family and their life in new york would this description alone make you want to read this we are not ourselves has beautiful language a well constructed plot is atmospheric and has characters with great depth what makes this one stand out in a crowd of good books and worth your time to commit its 600 pages for this reader it was the feelings it evoked it is like watching ordinary people with ordinary dreams and passions a window to their soul or self eileen tumulty daughter wife mother is at the center and the driving force of much of the novel the author's thoughts on naming her were quite interesting but i leave you to your own conclusions we meet eileen as a young girl and it is here like most of us that her self is formed she is the daughter of an alcoholic mother and a father who is like the mayor of the local pub early on eileen becomes fixed in her caretaker role these things should make eileen a strong woman with the power to be whatever she wishes yet somehow she becomes a shadow of what circumstance choices leading to her own undoing she wants she yearns she strives and the quest is always just a bit beyond her reach she is a sad rendering of a smart woman and it is hard for me to like her ed leary her husband became my focus a man who is content to just be a college professor who truly believes motivating and teaching his students is far more important than position or money a man with a brilliant mind that is slowly falling apart clues are given the thought of alzheimer's is there but it is kick in the gut when it is confirmed connell the offspring their son the relationship between connell and his parents bears close attention the father son affinity is powerful and doubly sad in consideration of ed's disease watching this sensitive boy dropped in the middle of this nest was painful in the end i haven't disclosed much we are not ourselves is a book that needs to be digested in its own way by each reader i do feel it is worth your time read a few reviews consider the subject matter enjoy","54":"thank you netgalley for the opportunity to read this book i spent so much time with this book well over a month maybe 2 that now that i'm finished i don't really know what to do i can't really seem to put into words how exactly i feel about it either i felt like i was in the story a silent presence just watching everything unfold i loved it highly recommend","55":"this was not the promised epic saga it did include more than one generation of the family but the story did not build on the generations still alice provided a more emotional look at early onset alzheimer's for all the worry about money there always seemed to be enough which isn't how real life usually goes","56":"4 5 stars the press calls this a family saga i would refer to it as an epic family saga redundant perhaps but it deserves redundancy luckily i did not realize how long the novel is because i doubt i would have read it don't be intimidated by the 600 pages as i would have been it reads easily and smoothly there wasn't a moment that i was distracted bored or tired also the press states that it's destined to be a classic with which i whole heartedly concur matthew thomas captures the struggles of the american dream of a second generation immigrant family in the nyc area the protagonist eileen tumulty is born to irish immigrant parents as eileen grows she becomes determined to have a better life than the one she was born into she becomes frustrated with her station in life and the limits put on her from society and economics but she sees there's more out there than what she has as a child with this inner drive she fights for a solid education and seeks a husband that will further her in her dream she finds ed leary a neuroscientist who is not only brilliant but also a true gentleman eileen is off and running to complete her dream as in life her dreams are derailed by well life thomas writes so well that i am amazed he is a young man and not a middle aged woman as a reader you feel eileen's frustrations struggles and dreams you understand her husband ed her son connell and all the other characters major or minor thomas gets into the nitty gritty of humanity no character in the novel is glorified or sainted thomas writes beautifully and cleanly after reading the novel i was motivated to research thomas in the novel ed leary has health issues that leave his family in turmoil as i read i felt there was an authenticity that could not be without personal knowledge thomas's father did indeed suffer from the same affliction as ed leary thomas admits that he used personal experiences in his novel he also wanted to portray the fragilities of humans as they deal with suffering this includes family friends work colleagues and the public thomas elucidates the human condition he also makes the reader aware of yet another area of our health care system that is remiss this is pure literature of the 20th century i highly recommend it plan to spend some time with this novel as it is engaging and deeply moving you will see yourself your neighbors and your community in this tome","57":"this was a very long read one flaw of ebooks can't tell by picking it up how long unless you pay attention to the description which i never do so perhaps that is my flaw of the 648 some odd pages about 100 were interesting but not a 100 in a row if the author's intent was to write a very long story about someone's life over 40 some years to prove that life is pretty boring with excitement sprinkled in every now and then then he did a fine job soooo wordy at times a bit of a struggle and i found myself skipping paragraphs and not missing anything didn't like the main character at all which also didn't help with getting through the novel i got a sense of what was happening to one of the characters and thought i would become somewhat emotional once the truth came out but alas i did not glad i didn't read anythinng about this book prior to reading as i think i would have been really disappointed with all the hype swirling around it during its release","58":"awesome book covers a whole life and marriage and even more its complete","59":"this is not the type of book i usually read and it was hard to rate perhaps a 3 sometimes a 5 i've given it a 4 but i'm still not sure that's where it rightly sits character driven with just one single major plot twist the book is long and at times slow but beautifully written the author builds up complex layered portraits of his main protagonists the ambitious striving eileen her quirky husband ed and their sensitive child connell even the minor characters are layered giving them a depth that you wouldn't usually expect eileen is not particularly likable she has a hard childhood and develops coping mechanisms that define her adult life eileen wants it all she wants it all so badly that disappointment is the inevitable outcome born in another time or even if born in her own time but as a male her drive and intelligence could perhaps have resulted in a career that could have delivered her all the status and material possessions the prestige that she considers absolute precursors to happiness instead she has to marry someone who can deliver the life she wants she marries ed a quirky college professor who shows promise but in the end disappoints he does not have the drive she hopes he's happy teaching seemingly content the key to this book perhaps made clear in the title is that no one is quite as they seem nothing is black and white motivations aren't always clear as in life your perception shifts with the benefit of hindsight and maturity at times i didn't like the characters but by the end of the book i saw them in a new light and found respect and felt compassion for all of them ed's letter to his son connell was just heart wrenching and beautiful not an easy book and i understand while many bail out in the early stages but it is a worthwhile read one that will make you think delivers some profound truths and moves you in ways you don't expect","60":"a brutally honest examination of the dreadful toll long term illness takes on the fabric of a family wonderfully wrought with excellent depth of character and really good attention to detail i am intimately familiar with both queens and westchester and so i could clearly see the places and faces described so well by thomas excellent novel well worth reading though it's a bit slow at the beginning","61":"if i had liked the characters more i would have liked the book more completely character driven they are very real but not so nice","62":"a bit depressing made me reflect on my own marriage and how much compromise a marriage is","63":" a rich and beautiful novel reading this book took me back to a time in my life when i had what feels like in retrospect unlimited time for reading those days when i would dive into long multi layered books and stay with them for hours and sometimes days on end we are not ourselves is the kind of book that makes you want to do that simply joyously read and read and read without allowing anything to cause your eyes to stray from the pages the story is full and evocative generous in details character development and plot i was caught up in eileen's plight as well as connell's desire to make it all go away by attempting to ignore it having personal experience seeing a loved one struggle with alzheimer's i felt that ed's illness was accurately though heartbreakingly portrayed this novel is well worth the reader's time highly recommended","64":"this novel was not at all what i expected in fact i almost returned it to the library without cracking it open because of the blurbs on the cover instead of just another novel of a social climbing family harboring a dark secret we get a highly detailed picture of a wife and son dealing with the diminishing capacities of the father about the first hundred pages of the book set the scene we are given enough background to understand why eileen is so focused on moving up in life and creating an idyllic stable home it also explains her seeming lack of warmth for both her son and husband after about page 100 the reader starts to see signs of ed's the father disease manifesting it was so apparent to me what was wrong that i became annoyed at eileen a highly trained nurse for not seeing it and initially considered it a flaw in the book but concluded that the author was trying to show that we often ignore and dismiss what we really don't want to see i have read reviews that condemned eileen as materialistic and shallow however i viewed her as strong resilient with varying layers to her personality while she does dream of a nice house and better things she also is proud of her husband and his love of teaching she accepts his refusals of advancement in his career with an equanimity that most spouses could not achieve as they watched their brilliant partner remain a community college teacher rather than accepting more prestigious positions that would have enabled him to better pursue the research that he also loved in addition her devotion to her husband becomes apparent as his abilities diminish she could have left him she could have put him in a home sooner but instead she remained by his side and in his bed long after most of us would have given him over to the healthcare system on the other hand ed only becomes a fully fleshed character after the disease grabs hold of him we watch him frantically try to hold on to his life as his minds slips away the depictions of ed's descent into dementia is incredibly moving it's been a long time since a book made me sob as much as this one did although that might be partially due to watching both myself and my parents enter into the last legs of our lives connell is treated in much the same way at the start of the novel he is often just referred to as the boy but as his father becomes less of the man he was we start to see connell becoming a real person with both good and bad sides as with most of us connell has good intentions but they are often derailed by the reality of dealing with a father that is increasingly child like unpredictable and contentious if you are looking for a book with loveable characters or evident heroes this one may not be for you eileen is a hero but she is like odysseus full of flaws and arrogance that sometimes blind us to her her core of love","65":"see summary for book plot sometimes when reading you can feel like you are a friend of the characters this one i felt like a bystander i give this 4 stars not because the story is so extraordinary but rather a common theme written with such detail that the ending had deep impact on me inot a light beach read but i do recommend it also an extra star for highlighting the other ny baseball team let's go mets","66":" strangest thing while this book is well put together grammatically correct moves with a purpose there were a few spots where the prose was a bit excessive i just didn't love the characters at all i think that's what it comes down to for me i didn't like them we have eileen who has an interesting background of parents from ireland making their way in the states the trials and tribulations of being irish american come through greatly in the beginning of the book she has ambitions goals a purpose then she meets ed a propertied and definite genius she thinks she's found a mate that will share her ambitions in the world boy was she wrong i guess maybe ed seems to love been an academia he has no ambitions of becoming a dean or securing a higher position than professor at a community college he feels like he's helping kids who deserve an excellent education or so he says so they marry they manage to save a tremendous amount of money money to buy a half million dollar home in the 80's in new york and live quite comfortably even though eileen has a hard time staying at any one hospital as a nurse and ed never dreams of being more than what he is they have a son whom they indulge and raise to think he can do anything almost fitting of a kid growing up in the time period he's in he really becomes an entitled shit who is very very hard to like at all ed comes down with early onset alzheimers it's sad to watch the deterioration but the author is so very detached from the disease or comes off that way at least that you find yourself struggling to find empathy eileen does some seriously stupid things considering she's supposed to be this top shelf nurse and leaves her ailing husband alone all the time and complains that the government won't help her until she's destitute welcome to america really my step father passed from alzheimers so reading this book and how haphazardly the entire thing was handled is maybe what rubbed me the wrong way eileen comes off all to often as a bitch who's only nice to her husband in bed ed comes off as self absorbed and very high thinking of himself and his son with no concern to anything else connell is just not likable in any way shape or form at all even in the end at all he's actually the worst character in the entire book sergei i liked sergei everyone else not so much i have to say i'm disappointed in the last few books i've read they've been from the goodreads best reads of 2014 lists and i haven't really liked any of them makes me wonder what makes them a recommended best read i have a few more on my list and i'm a bit gun shy if i'm being honest i may have to reconsider my to be read list a little more carefully","67":"sometimes you read a book that seems like a doorway into true lives into truth itself this is such a book it is a powerfully deep rich painful quiet novel with characters who are absolutely real and complex and whom i will never forget the events unfold slowly patiently it was difficult and even frightening to read at times it was rewarding to read at all times i wept at the end something i haven't done in a long long time","68":"deeply moving story about a woman's life and how she endures very hard to read some of this as it touches too close to the sickness of a beloved aunt a story of courage strength and perseverance","69":"we are not ourselves is the story of a family eileen the mother was born in 1941 to irish immigrant parents who worked hard their entire lives and drank or gambled away everything they ever had eileen learned from a young age that she had to work and work hard if she was ever going to get anywhere in life eileen marries ed who from a female reader's perspective seems nearly perfect he's athletic handsome and smart it's only after ed and eileen marry that eileen realizes that ed doesn't have quite the same goals as she does she is furious when ed refuses to take promotions and job offers that would bring in a larger income he says that money isn't what matters after coming to terms that they will probably never have children eileen finds herself pregnant and gives birth to a son connell eileen proves herself to be the product of her own upbringing and finds hugging her child awkward she does love connell and the way she shows her love is pushing him to be the best to achieve the heights she wasn't able to ed has no problem showing his unconditional love for his child he tells him to dream big to do what makes him happy when connell is still quite young tragedy strikes ed is changing he's short tempered and forgetful and just as eileen is about to divorce him she realizes that something serious is going on that this is a debut novel is astonishing the writing the depth of the characters everything about this book is superb there isn't a lot of action there are no plot twists or excitement it's a book that could be about any family and that's what makes it so readable and so heartbreaking","70":"we are not ourselves succeeds in an authentic shaping of the ny reality it captures well the striving immigrant ethic the 2nd generation struggles in a new immigrant neighborhood the struggles of alzheimer's and family complexity it is so true to life that i feel i could be listening to neighbors tell the story esp the heartbreaking moments the prose is thoughtful empathetic and poignant but where does it take you but next door maybe that is the point","71":"i thought this was a very good book readers are divided some like me really liked it couldn't put it down and enjoyed the characters others found it boring hated the characters and were kind of two star ish on it hmmm i would be interested to hear from any friends who read or have read this book what you thought my best book of 2015 so far","72":"bought this book as it was written by a regis hs alumnus the story was well thought out just too broad in execution","73":"this review has been hidden because it contains spoilers to view it click here i find myself comparing we are not ourselves by matthew thomas to still alice by lisa genova both books depict the dilemma of early stage alzheimer's disease on a college professor and family but after that they diverge thomas paints on a much

this is much more than simply an account of a tra i find myself comparing we are not ourselves by matthew thomas to still alice by lisa genova both books depict the dilemma of early stage alzheimer's disease on a college professor and family but after that they diverge thomas paints on a much larger canvas 600 pages and has the degenerative illness afflicting a man this time instead of a woman a three generation family saga of irish immigrants in nyc is folded in with the disease narrative this is much more than simply an account of a tragic illness on a family it tracks the ups and downs of pursuing the elusive american dream eileen born to alcoholic parents hopes to raise herself out of tenement life through hard work as a nursing supervisor she marries ed who is obsessed with his academic research and would rather teach at a community college than take a lucrative offer from big pharma eileen is preoccupied with social status and appearances while ed refuses to wear the gold watch she gave him for his birthday on the grounds that it cost too much son connell enters their life and grows into a secretive and self centered teen the characters are well developed and believable if not always likeable the story started out slow for me i couldn't figure out where it was going and why after ed's diagnosis the book flew i was reading under the covers at night and on my daily walk fortunately no twisted ankles resulted in some ways dementia has replaced cancer as the biggest health fear this story taps into that angst the reader watches eileen and ed's initial attempt to hide the disease from co workers and friends eventually they are forced to sort through various care options none of them ideal ... or affordable as our population ages this fictional tale will become reality for too many households more","74":"i really loved this book","75":"meh this is a longish book none of the characters are particularly interesting or compelling they don't do anything particularly interesting nothing wrong with a book about the struggles of regular folk but make them people i want you spend some time with sadly the lack of compelling characters made the issues of the last third of the book not sure if it's considered a spoiler less impactful than it should be","76":"the book had so much promise and great reviews i really struggled with it kept putting it down going to something else it just dragged on and on","77":"simply brilliant matthew thomas has written a beautifully told story that captures to voice of the irish of men of women of the place of the time all perfectly we know these people and the story hits home with grace and eloquence read thomas' first novel and you'll be waiting with great anticipation for his next","78":"out of the dozens of books i have read this year this was one of my least favorites about halfway through i realized i was only continuing to read it because i just knew after all the depressing scene of the first half that there had to be a positive satisfying point to the story by the time it reached its conclusion there wasn't this was a difficult story for me to understand no that's not correct it was difficult for me to understand the point of the story the major focus at least of the latter portion of the book seemed to be how eileen and to some extent her son connell dealt with ed's alzheimer diagnosis and inevitable slide into the horror of that neurological nightmare but by the end it felt more like \"we made it through that\" than \"we overcame that and emerged better than we were\" though there was a tiny bit of that with connell they were unlikable characters in a depressing and monotonous story mr thomas has a way with words and is able to evoke nuanced feelings with a high degree of skill and talent i would still look forward to reading his next work because of that skill and talent i only hope that either he or i have reached a different point by then so that i will be able to enjoy the story he tells as opposed to just admiring his ability","79":"amazing book three lives intertwined with how life happens","80":"did i read the same book as some of these readers giving it four and five stars i thought ninety percent of it was a boring novel about boring people i could not wait until the end yet true to my habits i finished it i still have a difficult time giving myself permission to quit on a book before reaching the finish line but i should have started a new habit with this one","81":"tough subject matter but an excellent read i loved finding out more about that part of the country","82":"another enlightening insightful book about the horrible effects of alzheimer's disease on the patient as well as his her whole family","83":"not really immigrant fiction although i was hoping for that boring in parts it's really a long character study and as characters they do piss you off sometimes but i was also struck by the love in the family and how all families have their shit","84":"when eileen meets ed leary a scientist whose bearing is nothing like those of the men she grew up with she thinks she's found the perfect partner they marry and eileen quickly discovers ed doesn't aspire to the same ever bigger stakes in the american dream eileen encourages her husband to want more a better job better friends a better house but as years pass it becomes clear that his growing reluctance is part of a deeper psychological shift ed has alzheimers as of age 50 and slowly completely deteriorates hurting his wife and son","85":"i'm glad i save 5 stars for only very special books and if i could i'd give we are not ourselves an infinite amount truly the most honest heart wrenching book i've read in years i could go on about the beautiful writing the vivid characters etc but more than that reading the novel is a truly transformative experience if you read one thing this year make it we are not ourselves it's the type of book that will knock the wind out of you again and again and change you forever i'll never forget this one","86":"talented writer long story characters were interesting enough the main character's inability to see it or cope with her husband's illness despite being a nurse was maddening but maybe that is not uncommon hard to read about their suffering so beware not an uplifting read","87":" i have mixed feelings about this lengthy novel 21 hours in audio 640 pages in print the story follows the life of eileen tumulty born in 1941 her rocky relationships with her alcoholic irish american parents her thirty year or so marriage her career and experience of being a parent to her son her husband's early onset dementia and into her widowhood at its core it is about relationships yet the relationship between husband and wife remained a mystery to me as it changed over time and that between father and son is fully explicated only in the last pages through the rather clunky device of a posthumous letter though the letter was quite moving in some passages others refer to events i did not recall \"seeing\" in the book eileen's arm's length relationship with her parents carries forward her grown up son connell says the hug she gives him is the first time in his memory she disagrees that she has ever initiated such an embrace one of the book's strengths is the complexity of the characters they have strengths and flaws that shape their interactions believably eileen's a smart girl but family finances limit her educational choices and she becomes a nurse when she wanted to be could have been a doctor she meets and marries neuroscientist and college professor edmund leary who stubbornly refuses the more lucrative and prestigious job offers that come his way eileen sees his choices as a brake on the family's upward mobility connell loves baseball and is an excellent young player but eileen pressures him to give it up to join the school debate team which she thinks will lead to the best grades the best colleges the greatest success eileen is preoccupied for much of the middle of the book in getting the family out of their deteriorating jamaica queens apartment and neighborhood and into a \"nice\" house in suburban bronxville the family finances barely make the stretch but she plows ahead anyway meanwhile ed is deteriorating and the onset of neurological decline must be terrifying to someone so acutely aware of the consequences we see ed struggling to accommodate i couldn't understand why eileen a nurse takes such a long time to figure out what was going wrong with him it didn't seem to be denial that aside the author does a remarkable job portraying the challenges the family confronts as ed's capacity declines paradoxically eileen seems most loving and most deeply attached to him as he becomes less able to respond despite the grim subject matter the writing is perceptive and never maudlin thomas maintains a straightforward style much like eileen's own though for 21 hours of listening i'd like a little more story and occasional plotlines seemed nonessential like eileen's improbable and expensive drift into the orbit of a faith healer other reviewers have praised this book highly and it has many strengths in the writing that made me want to stick with it i freely admit i'm not a big fan of relationship novels so that may account for my cooler response while it is lauded for its depiction of late 20th century mores to me it is more significant as a cautionary tale of what can go wrong in our lives and relationships while our attention is elsewhere","88":"i would give this book five stars except that i probably will never read this again it was just too gut wrenching for me i have a parent with dementia and so many times i have felt like connell and not been of much help to my other parent but this is a wonderful book","89":"one of my favotites this year","90":"this review has been hidden because it contains spoilers to view it click here don't read this review i don't know 3 5 stars i appreciated it as a good telling of a family coming through the years and the father suffering from alzheimer's ed eileen connell i don't feel like writing more about this now maybe later","91":"whoa hard start to this book i did not care for it at all and found myself highly irritated with the characters i'm glad i persevered this has left me feeling melancholy and heavy hearted so why 4 stars for a book that is far from uplifting i guess because it captures what it feels like to love to love in all its' imperfection over a long and not so cookie cutter styled life it makes me really want to hug my husband and grasp on to all that is dear to me sad book","92":"i've been debating whether to stick with this book and saw under popular answered questions a thread about that very issue i'm just not pulled in enough and it sounds like i might not ever be a story about a family's daily life might interest me more if i didn't have a ton of other books to read with deadlines but then again maybe it wouldn't","93":"this is a brilliant book heart wrenching tale of alzheimer's and of love i cried lots","94":"sad and beautifully told story but much much too long i found myself skimming towards the end which is sad because there were a lot of sections that were lovely","95":"this book really went in a different direction than i thought it would when i read the book summary about halfway through the book i thought what else can happen in their lives why are their 300 pages left and then suddenly i knew what the book was about it was well written and really dealt with emotions issues well","96":" \"so much of life was the peeling away of illusions \"i had been very much looking forward to reading this book but unfortunately it has been quite a disappointment the first hundred pages about the childhood and teen years of eileen tumulty fly by and are quite promising but something curious happens as she becomes an adult gets married has a kid and begins to struggle with the way her childhood dreams have turned out the novel loses all momentum seriously loses all momentum and becomes a tedious slog i don't even really know how it happened but unfortunately it did big time for one thing after she gets married the focus slowly shifts away from eileen and onto her husband ed leary and the shift just doesn't take we spent so much time getting invested in eileen's story and author matthew thomas seems to take it for granted that he can just expect the same allegiance for her husband for another thing eileen's character loses her defining characteristic her drive and that makes her less interesting too it's a shame the end result is a rambling overly long novel that doesn't really have any focus or characters you can rely on getting through the 600 page length takes far more work than it should and that really is a shame because for a brief shining moment we are not ourselves really seemed to be going somewhere grade c for more reviews please check out my blog supposedly fun","97":"haunting beautiful mesmerizing i could barely put it down such a joy to walk into eileen's life and follow it through although the subject matter is a tragedy this book was full of love strength and the promise of redemption it makes human the face of alzheimer's and gave me hope i loved the writer's intense poetry of words his style and mastery of the topic was flawless what a great talent he has for spinning a yarn bravo mr michael thomas bravo","98":"i cannot praise this book enough a sweeping epic masterpiece in my opinion 640 pages that tell the story of irish americans eileen u0026amp ed leary from beginning to end it took me some time to read this parts of it would anger me these are not perfect people but matthew thomas portrays them as very real genuine and honest","99":"i didn't feel that emotionally connected to the characters and for a book this long i felt like i should care more in the end and i didn't","100":" my first advice for anyone reading this book don't give up i loved this book and it was mostly the second half that just tugged at my heart and soul it has incredible life lessons and is filled with such brutal honest from each of the main characters the book follows a couple from their childhood to their first meeting then on to their marriage the birth of their son their life i don't want to give anything away but this book is definitely worth reading i will be carrying these characters with me for awhile","101":"i enjoyed the book less and less as it went on for the first several hundred pages i couldn't put the book down but then each character became more and more loathsome ugh the son and a storyline that hit too close to home took center stage making several chapters feel torturous","102":"ah i loved this one started as one of those irish american immigrant family saga stories which i love but evolved into the story of a marriage and an ordinary inner life kinds of stories i love too reading this right on the heels of watching still alice made for a sad week or two this book was a deep and touching peer into one woman's life and family and decisions heartbreaks successes and failures so real very readable i just really enjoyed following along","103":"the part when the boy goes to watch his father lecture and the man is so obviously incompetent was too painful i had to put it down i liked the writing very depictive i felt by that point i would be going down the same dysfunctional pathways and needed a change so back it went another co reader noted patterns of characters appearing later on equally as intriguing but then again","104":"my favorite sort of book a long look into the lives of someone that could be yourself a character study that is heavy with reality we are not ourselves is a look ney an experience in the livingest and developing years of eileen tumulty the definition of an american born to irish parents raised in a bustling burrough in the most american city of them all eileen is tough on herself and others she knows what she wants to desperately escape her hyphenated american identity for the cookie cutter life of a wasp in second half of the 20th century granite counter tops and all this review largely focuses on eileen for i have never loved a more human character eileen works hard lives hard raises herself to be a well respected career woman with little money to show for it she marries ed leary equally irish in every way and they sink into their uniquely arranged life together their marriage begins slowly with very few social outings to show for themselves during this time it's clear eileen feels like she's missing out on what it's like to be a young married couple their lives move swiftly and as smoothly as any american married couple could in queens eileen continuously feels that her husband is not allowing her to live the life she wants her ideal is filled with richness of the petty kind while ed's mind is on the mind ed's studies and teaching keep him firm in his place he places high value in his work and believes himself to be truly making a difference eileen knows in her heart of hearts that she cannot blame him for being a truly remarkable gentleman sticking to his guns and honestly making a difference in the young men and women he teaches but her vision of a big house with a fence and yard never wanes life continues and changes occur mid life frustrations explode in the most muted way possible white lies of the kindest kind permeate this normal life until finally things fall into place shambly and largely in disrepair life moves faster and faster all the while the prose reads calmer and calmer in tone eileen is the raw definition of a human raised by humans raised by humans we are all scarred damaged angry eileen possesses the skill to suppress her emotions to truly express herself to continue to save face in the most tumultuous of times it's not that she lacks emotions but that she honed the skill to hide her heart in her formative years realizing early in life that tears don't fix the problem eileen is fiercely loyal to her husband and son while also being incredibly distant and hard on them both she has grand expectations even though she knows better than to expect the same from her husband and child i was never upset with eileen i understood her struggle we all do and in the face of what can easily be defined as one of the most devastating events that can touch a life she stayed as strong as she knew she could","105":"this was a very moving account of a families journey through life and all of its inevitable struggles it dragged a bit in the middle but the characters were so 'real' and came to life through thomas's writing what i walk away from this novel with a profound appreciation for families struggling with major health issues it also made me realize that the little moments with the people we love are the moments we will remember and cherish the most 3 5 stars","106":"an unevenly paced book and not quite a multi generational epic i was expecting but a really insightful glimpse into the struggle of alzheimer's","107":"3 5 i think it could have been shortened without losing anything though perhaps the relentlessness of describing the illness would have felt long no matter what but perhaps listening to this rather than reading it made it harder to absorb","108":"this book was so powerful that i found myself having to put it down after a few hours not because it wasn't a good story but it was based on a disease so close to home i had to sit with it in small doses the description was nothing like what i expected and i believe this story will haunt me for a while beautifully written and so glad it was recommended to me","109":"this could have been a very good bookit is sad that this book didn't have a better content editor the characters' behaviors were inconsistent beyond reason there was way way too much material that did not add to the story line there were passages that could have been so much better if they were conveyed in dialog instead of narrated the strongest part was the ending i would say the writing and story had possibilities if they had only been developed to their full potential by skilled hands","110":" hmm i'm not sure how to describe this it wasn't so much a story as it was a series of impressions from the viewpoint of a girl as she grows up through the years and then interspersed with her son's pov once he's about as old as she was when the book started the second half of the novel is almost entirely preoccupied with the husband's illness but because their meeting and courtship and really their entire relationship was only glimpsed at here and there it didn't have a ton of impact like the wife kept saying her husband was some sort of great man but we never actually see what makes him so supposedly great that's probably the best way to describe this nearly 700 pages of being told and not shown plus the pov characters were really irritating","111":"i'm finally finished this book was a bit drawn out to say the least it wasn't a very happy book and i couldn't care enough about the characters i didn't feel like i got to know ed well enough or care enough about him to feel overly affected about his disease sadly i would not recommend this one","112":"loved this book thoughtful tender and smart look at the sometimes harsh realities of unrealized dreams and aspirations when real life happens you just deal with it","113":"this is not a book one enjoys the main voice eileen leary is the daughter of irish immigrant parents from her childhood she was born in 1941 eileen has wanted to live the american dream husband who is a good provider children nice house nice stuff and she thinks she has found the way to this in college professor scientist ed leary over the course of the book which tracks her life to 2011 she gets a lot of it but she also gets a lot of the bad stuff that life can deal like a husband with early onset alzheimer's the book is more character driven than plot driven it's basically a chronological life history and the outcome is pretty clear from the middle of this 600 page tome on so the last half of the book is incredibly depressing thomas's writing is beautiful but it's greatest strength is also the book's greatest negative his writing is so real there are scenes so painful to read so while the book is quite well done and very affecting i'm not sure i'd recommend it to anyone except somebody who needs a good and long cry","114":"an amazing book about three generations of an irish american family spanning six decades in new york examining the juxtaposition of what we imagine from life up against what life ultimately is a moving often very uplifting and often terribly sad look at the dynamics of love loss and loyalty","115":"this novel follows the story of one character starting at age 10 and continuing through raising her child it's very well written and you really get to know the characters and all of their flaws the only reason that i'm not giving it 5 stars is that i felt that the pacing of the story was off at times sometimes the author speeds up the pace so things move quickly and then later things slow to a glacial pace","116":"who'd a thunk it i won this as a result of entering a goodreads giveaway i am a lucky first reads winner sept 25 14 and the book has finally arrived although i'm not sure how long it has been waiting in the mailbox this is the story of an irish american girl from new york named eileen tumulty who because of her less than ideal family situation is forced to care for her parents and grow up too fast she falls for an odd but endearing scientist named ed leary and they are soon married with a child named connell eileen sets out to make a good life for herself in spite of the fact that her husband does not always react to life's challenges the way she expects or hopes when she discovers the reason for this things take a very unexpected turn this is an ambitious and admirable novel its characters are vividly presented and fully fleshed out it has some similarities to a tree grows in brooklyn but is set in more modern times and takes on some different issues eileen ed and connell are all people who think that they have everything under control and they think that they have their futures all planned out but they must eventually face the bleak truth that this is not the case the novel examines how the characters' choices sometimes wise and sometimes not affect them and the other members of the family how they deal with their insecurities and how they struggle to see the meaning in all of it is what gives this book its depth and its resonance","117":" this reminded me of the goldfinch in that both thomas and tartt ran out of gas at the end but perhaps that's just a way of saying i wanted to keep knowing what happened next a good thing so would have been disappointed by any ending thomas does a wonderful job of creating a largely unlikeable heroine smug in her confidence in the rightness of what she wants for other people and what she thinks of them oblivious to her own limited view of the world and making us root for her because the people around her so obviously need her to succeed whether it's the son who is by virtue of being an adolescent never really himself or her husband whose illness renders him most obviously not himself or elaine who is not the self she so passionately keeps wanting to construct for herself or the people around her thomas does a wonderful job painting the picture of an ordinary world one in which none of us is ever wholly ourself","118":"i was lucky enough to win this through goodreads i read so many good reviews and the book was worth the wait this book had everything well drawn characters beautifully chosen words and a moving plot it was such an honest straight forward look at the changing times of the immigrant and the progression of the women's movement it was also a very raw look into how different family members may deal with sickness this is one of those books that stick with you long after finishing it","119":"disappointing unlikeable characters depressing plot kept waiting for it to redeem itself but after plodding throgh 600 pages it left me dissatisfied and frankly pissed off that i wasted my time","120":" i would say this is 3 5 stars i didn't really like it for the first 3 4ths of the book but the last quarter so great it felt like only bad things happened to this family especially the mom but in the end you get mentions of wonderful things that have happened in the family's life together that aren't included in the narrative it was the choice of the wife who tells the majority of the story to focus only on the bad things that happen she was so busy wanting a grander more affluent life that she missed out on the wonderful life she had i'd recommend it","121":"great epic story probably a bit too ambitious for a first novel as a physician i can attest that the depiction of alzheimer's is spot on my main complaint is that it was about 100 pages too long the story dragged on well past when it ceased being interesting where were the editors","122":"rich well written and sensitive portrait of a family starting from the 1940s to present day with eileen tumulty as central steadfast character moving and realistic portrayal of changes in the world around them as well as in themselves","123":"at first i thought this was going to be a family saga an irish american version of belva plain i was mistaken instead it is a wonderfully realistic portrait of an american family in the late 20th century life is what happens when you're making other plans goes the saying that certainly applies to eileen tumulty o'leary she has goals and expectations of herself education career marriage family she is never completely happy but her sense of duty overrides self pity they gave out no manual when you got married no emergency kit with a flashlight for when the power went out you had to feel your way around in the dark for the box of matches p 312 eileen o'leary is not going to be your bff but she is certainly like someone you know","124":"couldn't finish it","125":"very well written but at times it was tedious","126":"this book was terrible lost its way it noticed i was at the 50% complete part when the plot began terrible terrible book","127":"2 1 2 but i could have abandoned this book at any time i persevered because of the high ratings on gr kept thinking what am i missing i found this book flat none of the characters engaged me i just didnt care that being said i liked the last 50 pags quite a lot but not worth plowing through the rest a bit over 600 pages never saw what captured others that's what makes the world go 'round","128":" according to my dream interpretation manual dreaming about an old and dilapidated house denotes declining health and dreaming about owning an elegant house signifies that you will leave your home for a better one and fortune will be kind to you the main character in this book is obsessed with both her old and her future dream house the voice of this character who is female is written by a male author who successfully develops a convincible likeable woman character whom we can empathize with her isolated existence and thoughts are highly relatable also being his first novel it is evident that the characters places and situations have been growing and progressing in his imagination for i'd assume a respectable amount of time i kept thinking of the saying life is what happens when we're busy making plans as time unfolds and events take place in this novel each character discovers how fleeting life is and each evolves through their individual existential journey the character eileen muses the world didn't seem to matter very much our real existence was taking place somewhere else as we lived a shadow existence the story is also about family relationships and expectations and the word surprise is overused readers have commented on the book's heavy narration and i agree that first person dialogue is preferable for character development overall i enjoyed the book immensely and became involved in the dimensionality of the characters and their joys disappointments u0026amp problems such as most of us have experienced or will experience in life","129":"this book was awesome it's one of those books apparently called literary fiction where you think you're just reading a normal average story but under the surface the book contains some deep thoughts gems that you want to stick with you as soon as i finished the book i googled the author it's his first novel and i can't wait to read his next one","130":"long but held my interest to the end fascinating complex u0026amp honest no pat characters here especially eileen who is a very real and sometimes relatable in her insecurities also the portrayal of the son dealing with his fathers alzheimer's was right on","131":"really between a 2 and a 3 good premis great tough woman main character who drags her family by pure force into the solid middle class but soooo much too long description on description on our pratagonist and her envies about half way through tragedy hits and we have a different novel but not different enough no idea why this one has been so well received","132":"wow this is a hard one to recommend i can't say i enjoyed it the subject matter is way too raw but i was reluctantly drawn into the lives of the learys very well written brutally honest i have to say i miss the characters so i guess that's a successful story in my book","133":"not sure why i picked this one up it seems to be about nothing but it sucked me in right away until i got halfway and didn't think i could finish it some interesting perspectives but it hits a little close to home","134":"i didn't know the novel's big secret until it was revealed about halfway through and it hit me harder because of it the book is emotionally exhausting with deeply flawed but multidimensional characters and you really feel like you've lived eileen's life along with her i didn't rate it five stars because it needed to be whittled down and edited a bit","135":"i got this book as a table gift at a wedding of the friend of the author and our mutual friend is very smart so i knew this wouldn't be a fluffy book my first thought was genius i want a friend with a novel about to debut so i can give away books at my wedding and my second thought was i hope this is good because it's awfully long i haven't found the friend to write the book yet but i was ushered into the world of this book slowly it took me a while to get into it but once i was in i found myself going back for more and more it's the little moments that got me when ed makes a pile of wood that he never remembers and eileen can't figure out what it's for when connell and his girlfriend do the i love you acting exercise when eileen buries the statue in the front yard they were all so specific so on point that i gobbled them up without even really noticing them i recommend this book highly though you'll have to wait until my wedding date finishes it before you'll get my copy","136":"alzheimer's and love in everyday time","137":" the point wasn't always to do what you want the point was to do what you did and to do it well empathy he hadn't always had it it was a muscle you had to develop and then keep conditioned sometimes he thought his real goal wasn't to teach them to write better essays but to get them to think more about what it meant to be human you are not in this life to count up victories and defeats you are in it to love and be loved you are loved with your head down you will be loved whether you finish or not","138":"i feel somewhat guilty for only thinking this book was ok it is supposed to be something special i was not able to really become involved with the characters i really didn't look forward to reading it and was relieved to finish i would like to leave a more detailed review but don't want to leave spoilers main characters are abrasive socially enviousl eileen her good looking college professor husband ed and their only son connell","139":" this ambitious first novel focuses on the life of eileen tumulty the only child of irish american parents eileen observes the ways her parents' alcoholism and lack of education limited their options and plans to make a better life for herself when she marries research scientist ed leary she thinks she has found someone who wants the same things she does but ed turns down several promotions and job offers at prestigious schools which limits the upward mobility eileen longs for the first half of the book follows the couple to about the age of 50 despite their good careers and lifestyle ed eileen and their son connell seem dissatisfied with just about everything 300 pages of this were too much at that point something happened to change their lives and the rest of the book is about how the family copes and doesn't cope when they faced true adversity instead of imagined the character growth and well portrayed complex dilemmas drew me in thoroughly if given the option i would have rated the first half of the book two or three stars and the second half five stars","140":"eileen sacrifices her childhood to care for alcoholic parents and keep things afloat she yearns for a stable relationship and a home of her own she exhibits admirable strength to attain a larger home in a better neighborhood thinking she can escape her history of poverty and struggles fate deals her a bad hand but the book is filled with love and life and is beautifully written a must read","141":" we are not ourselves by matthew thomas is the story of the sometimes free fall spiral of the leary family's life the story covers a broad spectrum from eileen's childhood through the entire scope of eileen and ed's marriage - the dreams the regrets the joy and the sadness it is a character driven novel that completely draws you into the lives of the leary family read my complete review at http www memoriesfrombooks com 2014 reviewed based on a publisher's galley received through netgalley","142":" i can't decide whether i liked this book or not i didn't know what i was getting into when i borrowed the ebook from the library i just stopped at the first available book with a title i recognized i had no idea what the book was actually about only that it had gotten a good review somewhere if i'd realized it was over 600 pages i probably would have kept looking the book is driven much more by character than by plot and i often found myself wondering how the author would fill the remaining 400 300 200 etc pages but fill them he did and while i did think several times about giving up on it there was something about it that kept me reading i didn't find much to like about any of the characters but they did seem like real people just not people that i'd want to spend a lot of time with however i somehow feel like they're characters that will stick with me for a while in the end i'm not sorry i stuck it out and finished the book but i don't know if i can go so far as to recommend it to people at least not without a warning about what a commitment it will be","143":"i'm giving this book five stars thanks to the second half while the first part was good the second i found i hard to put down such a heartbreaking and eye opening story of love and helpless disease i can easily relate through the fate of some family members and feel like i have a better understanding of something so tragic after this breathtaking read","144":"just brutal poignant but emotionally exhausting filled with things left unsaid that still overwhelm us difficult to read at points but impossible to stop at others","145":"this might be a difficult read for some if you think of it as a fleshed out biography rather than a work of fiction it will probably help get you through a very long book that some may find puzzlingly bland","146":"could definitely be a little shorter but very compelling and well written great job at depicting a successful if not blissful marriage absolutely loved the epilogue i'd been getting tired of the book by that point but the epilogue made me wish it would keep going i'm a sucker for a good epilogue","147":"the thing that stays with me in this book is the disease alzheimer's so it starts out slowly moodiness forgetting some things work rituals getting more difficult a scary thing at age 55 his wife tries to take care of it all she has always had her dreams always wanting more out of life for herself and her family it always boils down to family and health","148":"entertainment weekly recommended this book as a sweeping american novel i plodded through it it was hard to care about the main character for me and i felt kind of blah about the book","149":"well written and i enjoyed the linear story telling","150":" i've yet to write a review on goodreads typically i use the app to remind myself of books i'd like to check out at the library however this debut novel by matthew thomas was so moving i felt compelled to share even if just with myself how powerful i found it i don't remember what prompted me to add it to my list of to read books but i'm incredibly glad i did this is an epic tale woven so masterfully i was quite simply unable to put it down and though it is considerably longer at over 600 pages than i typically finish in a day it felt so authentic and like such a realistic glimpse into a family with all its flaws and faults and imperfections that i became invested and couldn't turn away until i knew each character's outcome while this wouldn't normally be classified as a beach read it isn't all lighthearted sunshine where the hero prevails and the heroine gets swept off her feet and everything turns out roses i actually would recommend reading it when surrounded by life and something bigger than just oneself typically i put a book down and immediately reach for another but with this novel i feel the need to let it percolate before beginning another story which is the best way for me to make a distinction between a book that is good and one which is excellent this book is excellent","151":"i couldn't finish this it just dragged on far too long any empathy i had for ed was just used up and his spoiled son don't get me started","152":"i didn't expect to finish this i didn't like the first 200 pages the next 200 were better it is a good character study but i didn't find the principal character eileen leary particularly sympathetic it's hard to like a book when you don't particularly like the main character","153":"i loved this book it's not a fast paced novel but manages to be absolutely riveting it's been described as a 'quiet book' and it's true but very intense","154":"this was a long and painful read for me it's a character driven story but i could not connect with the protagonist her anger and inability to see what was right in front of her made reading her story a frustrating experience","155":"slow to start but really wonderful as it goes along terrific character development resonated with my memories from childhood growing up irish and all that brings to the table but more so with all the emotions and uncertainties in my current roles as both a wife and as a parent really enjoyed","156":"engaging but uneven at times the writing was brilliant and at other times whole sections were skim worthy","157":"this is a sprawling saga of eileen leary an immigrant who seeks the american dream or at least her version of it coming from alcoholic parents she yearns to better herself for her betterment means more it's the more that propels the character study that is this book her constant striving for the appearance of happiness seemed an excuse for her greed not only did i not like her i longed to grab her by the shoulders shake her and slap some sense into her money and a mink coat and a better house will never make you happy stop hating your husband stop looking at him as if he only should exist to please you and buy you things in that sense the characters were well written i knew who they were and i was constantly frustrated with them it's far more engaging to feel something about the characters than be bored on the other hand i never felt anything good the use of third person had a tendency to create a distance between the book and me i felt i was starting to number the times i read she the writer was very astute in the placing of one particular sentence on the last page of the book it was an observation of eileen's that brings her into some semblance of growth a keen moment that let me feel she finally got it she finally understood however it was a little too late for a real victory as i'd already suffered through over 600 pages reading about a selfish petulant teenager except she's a grown woman i'd for sure read the writer again though","158":"i wanted to care more about the characters in this 600 page tomb i wanted to be invested and captured in their fictional world unfortunately the moments that grasped at me at least were abruptly cut short and discontinued i understand the themes of the novel they are practically printed on the page and are already discussed at great lengths on reviews for me the connections of theme plot and character development did not blend each remained its own storyline rather than strengthening the book overall","159":"spectacular i cried through the last third and i'm not much of a crier and i found myself constantly astounded that this is a first novel six hundred pages and none of it wasted","160":"this review has been hidden because it contains spoilers to view it click here this is a book that would have benefited greatly from some editing it is way too long and sections of the book just drag it follows a woman from her childhood in 1940s brooklyn to the present day she and her husband are 2nd generation irish americans and the best part of the book is the descriptions of her life and a changing new york the worst part of the book is the endless pages devoted to her husband's decline from alzheimers disease i'm not saying this in a callous way there are hund this is a book that would have benefited greatly from some editing it is way too long and sections of the book just drag it follows a woman from her childhood in 1940s brooklyn to the present day she and her husband are 2nd generation irish americans and the best part of the book is the descriptions of her life and a changing new york the worst part of the book is the endless pages devoted to her husband's decline from alzheimers disease i'm not saying this in a callous way there are hundreds of pages of him acting oddly and no one can figure out why i put this book down many times out of tedium but it was the only thing i had to read on vacation so i powered through more","161":" i received an arc of this book through the goodreads first reads program i was immediately drawn into this story of eileen who is a little girl dreaming of a better life we follow her through her childhood with alcoholic parents and then her marriage to ed who seems sure to succeed ed unfortunately sabotages himself over and over as if he can't accept his due in life which drives eileen crazy we see a real glimpse into their marriage and how they resolve their differences eileen continues to dream of bigger and bigger lives a huge house parties a fur coat and work achievements while ed's star is falling quickly eileen is a very likable character and i relate to her childhood of dreaming about a better future i found this book to be very deep in regards to what is important in our lives what do we think will be important vs what is really important how do people reconcile themselves to that discrepancy this is mr thomas's first book but i look forward to reading more by him in the future","162":"no way is this story worthy of 620 pages i had to skip about 300 pages in the middle these characters live parallel lives with none of them knowing what's going on with each other also regardless of what it symbolizes looking for a house does not need to take up several chapters i just couldn't relate","163":"you know someone else commented that this novel reads more like a poem and i would agree for better or for worse the prose is lovely to read but the pace is slow perhaps it's just not my kind of book i finished it but now without skimming the third quarter of the book i was too impatient to move the story along","164":"an epic saga of an irish american woman and her family this book took me some time to read but it was well worth the time invested recommending this book to all my friends my full review of this novel can be found at www booknerdmama com thank you to netgalley for supplying me with an arc of this novel for in exchange for a honest review","165":"beautiful book it is somewhat painful but honest i found it difficult to walk away from and kept planning ways to just get back to it","166":"the beautiful story of a family the good the bad and everything in between","167":"epic family drama","168":"this book is over 600 pages and it felt like it although there were long moments of engagement i found myself not quite absorbed by the characters poor eileen never fulfills her expectations in life and is saddled by her love of family mother father husband and son who all create great barriers her husband ed unfortunately suffers and dies from alzheimer's disease ed's illness is described in detail and for anyone who has experienced this disease it unfortunately rings true","169":" 3 5 this is a 620 page book about three main characters the plot while not gripping is really not the main point of this novel in my view as soon as i figured that out i dove into it as a character study ed steadfast in his world view make a difference in your own orbit although he could be frustratingly stubborn he earns the reader's respect but i wouldn't want to be married to him eileen the book revolves around eileen who relentlessly chases her world view the pursuit of the american dream of upward mobility will bring true happiness and fulfillment ed and eileen's world views clash but she uses his passivity to match forward toward her dream the reader watches while eileen circles around her best self the entire time giving us a glimpse of depth vs materialism and image and then darting back off while i wouldn't want to be married to her either her loyalty to ed is to be admired connell ed and eileen's son has the best shot at evolving as we watch him through childhood into young adulthood his world view becomes clearer as the novel comes to a satisfying close glad i read it ready for something lighter","170":"undoubtedly the best book i've read in a long time a book that opened in my mind so many hidden realizations of my own fears experiences and longings","171":"the good stuff beautifully written author definitely has talent obviously the author has some experience with those affected by alzheimers and gives the reader some insight in how it affects those with the disease and their family and friends incredible character development you can tell he obviously took the time to give each and every character a unique voice i thoroughly enjoyed the early part of the story that dealt with eileen and her parents raw and honest plenty of damaged characters opening chapter intrigued methe not so good stuff honestly i just felt no connection to any of the characters not a badly written book in any way just not my type of story it left me feeling depressed could have used some editing in terms of length could have been a tighter more intriguing story with some scenes left out didn't like the racist overtones yes it gave some more insight into eileen's character but in the long run felt forced and slightly disturbingfavorite quotes passages there were no adults present so they were exposed to each other without buffering boys used to being at the top of their class each now merely one of many ed laughed and asked the doctor if he was married the doctor nodded then it won't surprise you to hear that my wife has been calling the shots as long as we've been married ed said and the doctor chuckled in husbandly sympathy watch that low class language she snarled and then she softened her tone oh hell 'shit' is right 3 dewey'si received this from simon and schuster in exchange for an honest review sorry for the delay guys i got kids they come first","172":" not always an easy book to read as it details the demise of a professor in his early 50s to alzheimer's but the book pulls the reader along with insight from all the family member's perspective so it is difficult to not care about the outcome not a very uplifting novel for sure but one that i am glad that i read it paints a horrific reality of losing control of one's body and mind but also shows that love between people still can remain when little else is recognizable of the person's original character","173":"there are no ordinary people or ordinary families told mostly from a professional woman wife mother perspective this novel examines one nuclear family with irish immigrant roots bumping along the river of life during our own current decades at times enjoying the ride and at times hanging on for dear life not quite knowing how or when to reach out and grab onto each other vivid portrait of american urban neighborhood life nyc across the past 60years well worked characters with realistic emotions faults aspirations disappointment dreams and fears i liked this book","174":"this review has been hidden because it contains spoilers to view it click here i can't review this so much as thank the author for the effect it's had on me your book has made me cry for the grandmother i lost to alzheimer's and the dad i lost to an equally relentless neurologically degenerative condition i lived through his loss remotely while my mum coped superhumanly at home until she could no longer manage i've read so much fact and fiction around the hammerblows these diseases inflict on both the sufferer and their loved ones but none so devastatingly accurate yet i can't review this so much as thank the author for the effect it's had on me your book has made me cry for the grandmother i lost to alzheimer's and the dad i lost to an equally relentless neurologically degenerative condition i lived through his loss remotely while my mum coped superhumanly at home until she could no longer manage i've read so much fact and fiction around the hammerblows these diseases inflict on both the sufferer and their loved ones but none so devastatingly accurate yet brilliantly accessible for once i want to read about these characters rather than turning each page with trepidation afraid of what painfully recognisable truth i'm going to uncover next you deserve all the accolades you've had and more for this incredible piece of writing thank you more","175":"i read this based on a number of favourable reviews but i must say i was disappointed i stuck with the story mainly because i enjoyed the writing style it kept me hoping that something would eventuate i don't want to add spoilers so all i'll say is that the storyline offered so much potential but failed to deliver as i said i did enjoy the writing style so i will give matthew thomas another try another book we are not ourselves is not going on my recommended reading list","176":"the story of a family who he to deal with disappointments and then finally with early onset alzheimer's in the father it was a bit long for me but parts of the story were very well written","177":" this is a novel not a story eileen tumulty is a fascinating smart girl and her saga through marriage motherhood and all their disappointments are heartbreaking and hilarious her husband ed leary becomes a beloved character and his experience with alzheimers is difficult to get through at times i thought the novel needed some serious editing but when i finished it part of the stalling and repetitive nature of the characters made more sense much of the story relating to their son connell i did not enjoy because he is not as likeable as his parents but ultimately dislike turns to understanding and as a reader you see connell is actually really well written","178":"readby mare winningham ireally had no idea what i was getting into i'm not sure how i got it on my reading list except that i am making an effort to read more contemporary literature and i think i saw it on a list of notable new books i had the vague notion it was a family drama about immigrants which it was but the drama was both more and less dramatic than i expected the novel is basically the sto when i began listening to the audio book we are not ourselves by matthew thomas beautifully read by mare winningham i really had no idea what i was getting into i'm not sure how i got it on my reading list except that i am making an effort to read more contemporary literature and i think i saw it on a list of notable new books i had the vague notion it was a family drama about immigrants which it was but the drama was both more and less dramatic than i expected the novel is basically the story of a life that of eileen tumulty a woman born in 1941 to working class irish immigrant parents living in queens new york the story follows eileen's life through her childhood education career as a nurse marriage and parenthood until 2011 leaving her alive at the end eileen's parents have a troubled marriage and are disappointed with their lot in life especially her mother who falls into a long illness and then alcoholism after suffering a miscarriage when eileen is nine years old eileen's father is a hard worker who works a second job at a bar the place where he is most happy so eileen takes over the cooking cleaning and care taking of her mother fortunately eileen is a smart resourceful resilient girl who does well in school despite her difficult home life at thirteen she gets alcoholics anonymous on the telephone and hands it to her mother opening the door to her mother's recovery just one of the redemptions that happen throughout this novel eileen's childhood and teen years set the stage is set for her over developed sense of responsibility and a persistent desire for a respectable stable upper middle class life the main ingredient of which is a house in a good neighborhood eileen is slim and attractive enough to get a job as a dress model in a department store while attending nursing school i found it interesting that department stores used to employ dress models for wealthy shoppers anyway she has lots of dates with interested men but holds out for one who she thinks will help her get to dream house and lifestyle she dreams of ed leary is different from the others he seems smart and ambitious he studying neuroscience and plans an academic career but when eileen buys him an expensive engraved watch before their wedding he refuses to wear such an extravagant item eileen nearly calls off the wedding eileen's father big mike tumulty tells her he is not surprised because ed's family has been in this country for three generations and none of them owns a house that's a sin he says eileen however loves ed and marries him anyway the book resonated with me on several levels it's about what it means to have expectations in life especially when living a life in a certain period in american history how sharply defined was that vision about what it meant to have a good life and how many people shared that vision it was difficult i suppose not to see it as universal the lush neighborhoods we see from past decades as well as the ones we see still being built are witnesses to the size of the market for this vision also eileen's life roughly coincides with the life of my mother who was born in 1939 the daughter of second generation immigrants also working class my mom also dreamed of a better life that involved a house in the suburbs and also achieved that dream and like eileen she also faced many disappointments actually eileen faces more than garden variety disappointments her husband always unusual becomes more and more eccentric though he is never in sync with her ambitions she works hard to make their life work after 10 years of marriage eileen finally becomes pregnant at age 35 long after she and ed have given up hope of becoming parents their only son connell is born in 1977 and joins the novel as a major character going through his own up and downs being profoundly changed by the end of the book it was interesting how the author showed the development of connell's character wavering between strength and weakness good and evil at the end he 34 years old and we see get an idea of what kind of person he has become eileen is able to buy the house where they have been renting an apartment on the second floor but things never quite work out as she hopes and ed keeps getting weirder and weirder turning down great job opportunities insisting on teaching community college students for a lower salary wearing old clothes freaking out over odd things never wanting anything to change but he is great father to connell and the sex is always good until something worse happens and the family faces a dark challenge that changes everyone i ended up loving this novel eileen is a wonderful character a strong courageous woman but with some serious flaws the way thomas portrays her is both deeply compassionate but completely honest i found her development as a character to be a fascinating look at the intersection between personal character and cultural influences the last couple of chapters are especially beautiful as the novel comes to bittersweet resolution but the book was also quite long and parts of it were painful to read there are characters who appear rather suddenly without any past history such as bethany a former co worker who leads eileen to the edges of a spiritual cult you are just told that eileen knew the person the past but such minor flaws are easy to forgive because the writing is generally wonderful and you care so much about the characters in the end i am a better more aware person for having read it the story sticks i have learned things and become more sensitive to the sorrows and struggles people may be living through i have increased insight to my own family past new things to consider as i sift through the history and the memories all these things are priceless gifts and therefore i must consider this novel a keeper","179":" \"polished prose\" the new york times \"epic of small events\" los angeles times and \"extraordinary portrait of alzheimer's disease\" the guardian i would have to agree with this last comment about the depiction of alzheimer's but not with most of the praise given to this first novel i struggled with it exasperated on almost every page by both the emphasis on too many unnecessary details on one hand with not enough illuminating details on the other then there's the often cumbersome writing - the frequency of sentences so chunky and so lengthy that i had to reread them several times here's one example \"he asked her to get him another napkin because they kept them behind the counter and it would have required some negotiation on his part to get one and she felt a surge of connection to him that made all the nights of his holding her settle in like a dog going to sleep with a sigh by a fireplace and she wanted to reach out and touch his face but she knew that she would never be with him that something about the circumstances of how they'd come together made that impossible that their lives were too different too incommensurable and that while they'd had this thing that she saw meant more to her than she'd understood while it was happening it too now was gone \"reviewers have said it took thomas ten years to write this book i have to admire his tenacity but find it off putting that he manages to lose the reader at certain points the character of virginia is a good example it took me a while to remember that she was the woman eileen met once thirty years earlier in a store's dressing room now living in her desired upscale neighborhood eileen is determined to have virginia be aware of her improved economic status so after their first and only meeting thirty years earlier eileen drives to virginia's house to confront her really on the positive side reviewers have hailed the author's depiction of alzheimer's disease my criticism of this part of the novel is the fact that while eileen is a highly trained and experienced nurse she doesn't recognize the need for her husband to wear a medical alert bracelet even after he has deteriorated dramatically and she has allowed him to walk to town where he disrupts traffic it is only when ed's disease reaches the ultimate point of disorientation that eileen finally yields i muddled through to the end of the book knowing that my personal opinion is at odds with those of many critics i think that additional editing might have made me somewhat more satisfied","180":"this book was so depressing for me that i almost could not get through it since i have several close family members with the disease that the father had reading about his deterioration was almost too much to bear i had no idea that this sweeping multi generational family drama has this disease as a major theme however still alice did not effect me like this book did probably due to the time in my life when i read it","181":"joyless lives of mildly interesting people over decades","182":"at first i wasn't sure about this novel because it didn't have a compelling plot and i wondered as to how interesting this set of characters could possibly be i ended up thoroughly absorbed with their lives rooting for them and being angered by them a wonderful capturing of the immigrant experience","183":"wonderful and moving family story very thought provoking","184":"i am so proud of myself for finishing the worlds most depressing book cannot recall one happy moment in this book but i must have been somewhat interested in the characters to keep on reading so for that a second star","185":"the book is well written the main character eileen leary is interesting and passionate but most of the other characters are rather one dimensional basically the book is too long the plot too straughtforward and predictable","186":" the book is wonderfully written focusing on characters and their lives not on high drama it is inward focused a study of ordinary people like most of us just trying to do our best with what we have banked from our experiences growing up it takes courage to stick with the book as the family descends the ladder into alzheimers there have been many books and movies in the past few years written produced on the dreaded disease but this book gives one of the most thorough accounts of its impact on a family by the last two hundred pages the reader is hoping each character is able to find some reason for their life some joy some peace as they come to know themselves","187":"impressive painful story of a family and marriage affected by early onset dementia felt very real to me","188":"good family saga i particularly liked it because it took place in geographic areas i'm familiar with having grown up in nyc it was very realistic and a good depiction of life throughout the years the characters were very believable as was the storyline a little too long but easy to read and kept me anxious at every turn to keep picking it up to finish it although i didn't want it to end","189":"read this book and you will learn about yourself","190":"i was 200 plus pages into this 600 page book before i fully grasped just how depressing it was going to get too far in to quit and yet i just didn't enjoy it i wanted to find something uplifting here but there wasn't enough to make the trip worthwhile","191":" definitely needed a good edit i appreciated the effort at a decades long sprawling novel but there was a lot of scenes and anecdotes that could have been omitted and the novel would have been great one huge factual error on page 618 there is a passage about roberto clemente that reads his plane crashed in puerto rico during an off season relief mission he attempted to fly to nicaragua in 1974 to deliver food to starving people the issue is that roberto clemente's plane crash took place on new year's eve 1972 not 1974 i can't believe that made it past the editors","192":"bookends hooked at the beginning pushed through much of the middle to reach a beautifully written ending anyone else think franzen esque here even the character development","193":"451 pages in and i just can't go on the positive reviews have kept me in this long although character rather than plot driven i still couldn't care less about these people nor am interested in what happens to them this felt like a really boring documentary that shouldn't have been made sad i wanted to love it","194":"great character development not a happy read but a great one","195":"the first half of this story as the disease progressed but wasn't completely revealed created tension and suspense i knew the problem and found myself cheering for eileen when she finally figured it out a perfect introspection into alzheimer's","196":" this remarkable debut novel chronicles sixty years in the life of eileen tumulty eileen is the only child of irish immigrants living in a tiny apartment at an early age eileen assumes a mantle of responsibility for her mother due to the haze of alcoholism that surrounds the family eileen is determined to find a way out of this lifestyle and this determination is characteristic of her throughout the book when she meets and marries ed leary a respected research scientist and teacher she believes that she has found someone who shares her dreams of a better life when their son connell is born eileen's intensity about improving their place in the world escalate even more while ed is content with what they already have when ed's early descent into a disease from which there is no return occurs eileen's determination and resilience are tested beyond any imaginings matthew thomas writes with a poignancy and clarity that define his style and impact this book these are characters who are doing their best in life altering situations and the details of their life are vivid and heartbreaking i regretted when this novel ended due to the strong connection with the characters who came alive on its pages matthew thomas is a gifted writer and this is a story i will long remember","197":" there is much to admire here but at least as much that frustrates part of this may be my own expectations after reading reviews when the book was published many calling it a multi generational epic about an irish american family a draw for me add to this that my own second generation irish american mother was born the same year as the central character eileen tumulty leary and i'll admit i came to this book with some notions on what this kind of story might reveal true we are not ourselves is epic in scope spanning three generations and 620 pages but there are characters that are flat and undeveloped and plotlines that are dropped in ways that aren't consistent with what a book of this length should be able to do for example eileen's cousin pat her very favorite relative and someone she considers as close to a brother as she could have goes off to vietnam and then nothing no follow up no return he slips back into the story and back out an unimportant fringe character despite the reader being told of his significance in eileen's life another example after purposely waiting to become pregnant and then struggling to become and remain pregnant she and her husband ed finally have a child a son named connell a page later he drops out of the narrative emerging twenty pages later in the interim eileen's mother dies her father dies ed is offered a plum job and the leary's buy the multi family house they've been renting in how strange that this much wanted child is so absent from his parents' lives and that when he is mentioned he is usually called the boy i found eileen thoroughly unlikeable she is a controlling striving judgmental woman who always wants more--more for herself and more for others than they want for themselves she is vaguely racist but if accused would righteously reject that idea outright when she's looking to move to a better neighborhood she says it wasn't that she wanted to avoid black faces she wanted to avoid black anger black retribution black vigilante justice she didn't want to have to watch a neighborhood go to ruin again and supposedly it was the most ethnically diverse square mile in the world but she wanted to be surrounded by people who looked like her family and sad to say she doesn't evolve as the times evolve around her in the very last pages she is musing about the indian family who bought her old home how they actually made indian food at home wasn't the way forward to assimilate of course this goes beyond food to their mere presence so many indians were there all of a sudden and so many of her friends were gone i think thomas portrays her xenophobia pretty well it seems an essential part of eileen's make up and is so like many in our country who like eileen is the child or grandchild of immigrants but who resent more recent immigrants making their way around her but i'm not one who can't like a story if i don't like or relate to the characters what bothers me here is that so often eileen's behavior is at odds with how the author has portrayed her she is smart and driven earning a masters in nursing yet she doesn't recognize obvious signs of her husband's illness and doesn't take appropriate measures to ensure his safety so out of line with what a well trained nurse would do maybe the point is that eileen is in some kind of denial but it left me skeptical it was also hard to swallow her reckless financial choices--a house way out of their means borrowing against said house buying a fur coat on top of it all-- but i suppose those choices are in line with her social ambitions if not with her supposed intelligence perhaps the biggest letdown is that a story about an irish american family in the mid twentieth century would neglect the irish catholic experience the church is central to irish american culture either as something burbling in the background as a marker for life's milestones or as something questioned or even rejected again there are a few perfunctory mentions of going to mass but otherwise this fundamental piece of irish american ethos is absent in a 600 page book that seems like a glaring omission there is so much more to this book than what i've addressed here but in many cases the story skates from plotline to plotline without much depth the telling of this family's experience with alzheimer's is harrowing but it felt like just that a telling so going with the goodreads star rating i liked it liked it enough to continue on chapter after chapter despite some groans of frustration along the way","198":"i can't believe how quickly i managed to read this i was hooked from the early pages an extraordinary story about ordinary folk none of whom are all that likeable but they're all the more engaging by dint of their human failings an extremely impressive debut and an epic tale of one family's struggle to live love and be loved","199":"i have such mixed feelings about this book as someone whose own mother suffered from the same affliction as ed leary i recognized the symptoms long before the truth was revealed perhaps that made the story more predictable for me there were also moments when i felt painfully that the author was trying to educate the reader rather than narrate the story of his characters the book started slowly with a lot of back story and history about eileen and her family that later becomes the set up for major plot events in the story and i'm not sure all of that back story was entirely necessary the author could have easily cut the first 60 100 pages without damaging the character development or plot the final section of the book was deeply moving especially during the scenes between the son and father eileen's practicality and fierce determination which can be off putting early on proves to be the glue that holds everyone together i found myself liking her more as the story progressed the writing ranges from fairly pedestrian with long passages of summary to truly lyrical poetic prose because of this stretch and the uneven pacing i felt the book itself was uneven in quality when it's good it's very very good when the quality lapses the book strains for the reader's full attention if i could i would give the book 3 5 stars but as a nod to those moments of brilliance i tipped my rating to 4 stars matthew thomas is an author to watch for i suspect his next book will be even better","200":" how did this book generate the heat author reviews and marketing campaign that it did it's adequately written but hugely uninvolving 600 pages of random scenes adding to very little for all of its length i never got a feel for any of the characters and that goes double for the eras through which they move the book never seems to move past the fifties yet suddenly the reader is jarringly confronted with the cosby show and mike tyson's punch out and why were eileen's parents part of the novel at all i'm convinced that anyone who makes it into the irvine mfa program is given immediate access to the big publishers were you or to i submit the novel's first three chapters to any agent unanimous rejection would be the response i candidly admit to succumbing to the book's beautiful cover two page new yorker ad and the heaping praise found on both i blame myself","201":"i enjoyed this book though it was sad i love the epic sort of story that follows people for a lifetime","202":"what a wonderful story the characters were believable the events plausible so easy to empathize with the emotions and feelings explored no murders no surprise twists no dystopian worlds just a good portrayal of people living their lives yet so compelling and haunting","203":"i had greatly looked forward to reading this book being a fan of the family saga genre it was quite a disappointment the book dragged on and on and by the last 100 pages i was skimming","204":"not a quick read but i liked it nonetheless a compassionate and wise chronicle of one family's life the way the family deals with an unexpected illness was both sensitive and realistic a beautiful book","205":"3 1 2 stars maybe 4 but i expected to love it and i didn't love it it was a bit too long i felt that some character development was rushed over and then some of the story got bogged down in peripheral detail overall i did not feel satisfied after reading 620 pages though i must say that it was extremely well written i couldn't really work up the empathy for eileen the main character i just did not like her very much","206":"600 pages and spanning 50 years and i still didn't want it to end a girl grows up in an irish american family and knows she wants more in life than what her parents can offer her somewhat of a coming of age as we see eileen goes to college becomes a nurse and starts a family the real story happens when the life she was dreaming for and had started to build takes a detour sad thought provoking good","207":"a beautiful story chronicling the hardships of life carried through three generations the changing faces of the immigrant population in new yorkcity and the ties that bind them to one another","208":"while i thoroughly enjoyed reading we are not ourselves there are many who would not this is a well done story of the human condition how we live our lives while dealing with disappointments compromise and long term illness and the way we deal with our decisions a somewhat depressing and sad story but one that has helped me to see so much more about what it means to be a family and how our experiences are not just ours alone but are part of each person that was present","209":" felt like a very deeply felt well told two part biography the first half depicts the irish immigrant experience in queens and the second half details the damage inflicted by early onset alzheimer's on family and friends the story is told both from the perspective of eileen leary a first generation immigrant who never stops striving for a life better than the one she has and her son connell who struggles to find himself and deal with the demise of his father both halves of the story feel like the author got it exactly right amazing how he never lapsed into judgement about the failings of his characters so even though their behavior was frustrating as a reader you never write them off ultimately a simple message anout the power and importance of love empathy and connection","210":"this review has been hidden because it

half way through the book everything is turned on it's head why did i read it misha collin tweeted about how amazing this book was and that he was going to do a book club for it and so i bought it out

we follow her hopes and dreams and gradual maturation as she seeks to better herself half way through the book everything is turned on it's head why did i read it misha collin tweeted about how amazing this book was and that he was going to do a book club for it and so i bought it out of curiosity i respect his opinion and wanted to see what could have moved him so deeply favourite idea part the quote in the epilogue about fathers and sons he could honor his father by loving the kid the way his father had loved him and if he had to be vulnerable in front of the kid if he had to be defenseless and useless and pathetic if he had to forget things and piss himself an get lost on the way home then so be it if the kid didn't handle it well well that was what kids did they went out too often they stayed out too late they said things that cut to the quick they forgot responsibilities they broke your heart years later they thought about it all and what did parents do they saw more clearly than their kids did they forgave their kids even if they didn't say so even if they couldn't say so they did i still get emotional when i read it getting to the conclusion and connell's epiphany about family and his desire to have children of his own even with the risk that he might inherit his father's alzheimer's made the entire book worth it overall if it weren't for the fact that i also had this book as an audiobook and that it required no effort to just listen to it for 2 hours each day on my commutes i probably wouldn't have finished it it's slow so slow and while some passages were quite beautiful it just couldn't hold my interest long enough i didn't understand or agree with the way the characters acted or thought all the time and i wasn't interested enough to see what would happen ed and his slow decline due to alzheimer's was the turning point i don't know enough about the disease so to take this journey was fascinating and heart wrenching at the same time and for it to hit him while he was still so young was brutal eileen and connell were interesting enough though and very very human i read some of the other reviews on goodreads where people complained that they didn't like these characters but i get it they're flawed they make mistakes and do things that we don't like they run from their problems and try to escape through sex or conspicuous consumption they are hit with things they're just not equipped to handle and they break or pretend it's not happening ultimately i was sympathetic to them as well even when i wanted to throw the book down and yell at them and i was just so happy relieved to see connell's maturity at the end he'll be ok life will go on i would have rated this as 3 5 stars if i could but having to choose i tipped it to 4 more","211":"highly recommended","212":"this book took me forever to complete the story was very good characters were very real and i think many people can relate to parts of all of them my only criticism is that the book was way too long and many of the parts could have been cut out it follows the story of the main character from when she was a little girl up to her old age and focuses on family life and chasing the american dream","213":"3 5 stars was way too long but beautifully written and made me feel things lots of unnecessary one or two pages chapters that could have been cut because i didn't feel they added to the story but the story itself was honest and raw and sad","214":"i found myself irritated with the main character and then it took a turn that made it personally difficult to finish","215":"oh my this was a challenge for me tremendously sad characters lives isolation from those they loved a book i had to push myself through i wanted to read it but diving into it each day was a kick in the gut","216":"this debut by author thomas has gotten a lot of hype promising to be a devastating family saga it certainly is a saga and an overlong one at that i started off relatively interested but got bogged down by the sheer length and slow moving plot i wanted to shake eileen the main character and wake her up to what was going on with ed it was obvious to the reader and boring to watch it stretch out for so much of the book without her realizing maybe that's what it's like in real life but eileen felt like a character in complete denial i skimmed the second half of the book because i just couldn't take it any more it's not a one star due to the writer's talent at creating scenes and ability to craft realistic if unlikeable characters but this was not a book that lived up to my expectations","217":" this amazing novel has some significant flaws but it overcomes them and wins you over and is such an achievement that after sobbing through the last 100 pages i gave it 5 stars there is a very awkward shift from eileen's backstory into her marriage around 100 pages where the characters feel cardboard cut out and the whole thing jars a bit get through it read on you will be rewarded i don't want to spoil the book but it is an incredible portrait of the disease which ed has i know a lot about it having spent the past year or more making a documentary with people like him and the description of his deterioration rings so very true matthew thomas grapples so brilliantly with life death and faces it so honestly through his characters it's an extremely affecting read which will stay with me for many years to come","218":"very long and the ending was very disappointing","219":" a book i really enjoyed but felt like it just went a little too long the story follows eileen tumulty the daughter or irish immigrants in new york in the 1950s and her life from childhood to old age after spending a little time on her childhood the book really focuses on her relationship with her husband ed and the life they have together in the process we discover the hopes and dreams that eileen has and which of those can be fulfilled through her marriage and her family with ed in the end the book provides opportunities for reflection on what duty and obligation means in a relationship not just husband and wife but also mother and son and father and son as a result the reader's opinion of the three primary characters in the novel shift frequently throughout the course of the novel as i stated in some ways i felt like the flash 60 pages of the book made the story drag on a bit too far however when an author decides to continue a book beyond what a reader would normally expect it makes me pause and try to discern the significance of those pages in the authors mind in any event the book is well written interesting and worth the read","220":"this was a difficult book to rate as there are many parts of the book that are extremely well written and yet there are just as many uneven sections where the characters fail to be realistic or you simply lose your interest this is a long book so there are many elements to the story and i took away some important insights and reminders about life and enjoying it as it is not always focusing on what you would rather have and the book also portrayed aging and illness in america in a way that made me grateful for my health and my access to excellent health care but it is the inconsistencies and the long sections that don't seem to have any particular purpose in the overall story that have held me back from giving this book more stars near the middle when ed's behaviour becomes increasingly bizarre i became quite frustrated surely a wife who is a practicing rn would have taken action sooner ellen is a difficult character because she is so emotionally distant and unavailable to those around her but she is well drawn but her striving for more and not appreciating what she has got tedious and contributed to the feeling that the book was too long i'm glad i read this book but admit that if it hadn't been a book club book i might have given up early on in the end i'm glad i read it and i believe it has an important message i just wish it could have been a couple of hundred pages shorter","221":" firstly i avoid these kind of books i prefer my books to be an escape from reality rather than an emotional punch in the kidneys and this book was a gutter punch that left me reeling did i enjoy it i loved it i avoided it i eyeballed it while it lay on my bedside table waiting for me i read a few pages cried a bit rallied my nerves read some more i read fast usually devour books but this book made me chew slowly savour the story i lived the lives the deaths the grief and ultimately the hope in the face of all that love can ultimately cost you and how much more you'd willingly pay what an experience it turned out to be","222":"how is this transcendent it plods along and is utterly boring if i wanted to read the vapid everyday doings of a bored housewife i'd well i'd rather not but that is what this book is about eileen marries young and apparently below her ambitious station for she is ever unsatisfied with her husband she longs for a more expensive exciting life and we are treated to page after page in this tome about her repetitive thoughts on what she wants to wear eat and live in utterly boring","223":"3 5 i was determined to finish this even though half way through i was ready to quit it was totally worth the long ride to be with the characters through their journeys their lives show well how life guides us to where we are and creates who we are the way the book ends is perfect","224":"matthew thomas's debut novel we are not ourselves follows the life of eileen tumulty revealing through chapter length vignettes her troubled childhood her time in nursing school her marriage to ed leary her relationship with her son and the family calamity that casts a shadow over her life in middle age the novel sweeps sensitively over the grand landscape of the life of the leary family offering exquisitely drawn details at each stop on the journey","225":"if i could give half stars i would give a 3 5 this book is hard for me to rate i loved the writing and the fact that the story is character driven but at times the story dragged i found myself skimming through many pages i also didn't realize by reading the inside cover that much of the book is about how a family deals with a debilitating disease other topics fade and this becomes the main story","226":"i'm still trying to decide whether the s l 0 w pace of this novel was part of the underlying plot certainly the glacial pace of events helped me focus on the thoughts of eileen a woman wanting to have a better life than her irish immigrant parents yet her focus on some of the outward manifestations of the good life leave her blind to her own family there were times when i wanted to scream at her don't you see what's going on","227":" \"we are not ourselves\" by matthew thomas promised to be an instant classic a characterization of the struggle to reach the american dream and a snapshot of immigration and family in the mid 20th century cosmopolitan world while it certainly does create an epic snapshot of one family's domestic and economic struggle it fails to suck readers into that snapshot the book reads like a timeline the plot doesn't thicken or crescendo which does make for some spot on realism but unfortunately makes it a bit boring and hard to dive into from time to time i would not reread thomas' \"we are not ourselves completing the novel felt more like a chore than a pleasure don't get me wrong there were chapters and moments that i really enjoyed but most of the time i felt a great deal of anticipation that never went anywhere i would recommend this book despite the heavy nature of the text the novel is quite intellectually stimulating and would be great if studied in a classroom setting it is not as engaging as i hoped it would be as i mentioned before most of the plot if you can call it plot leaves you longing for some big happening but fails to deliver while this method of story telling does give the story a striking amount of realism it just doesn't do much else it is original we are not ourselves is a book about family and character development that spans across two generations it's interesting and heart breaking to follow the characters on their individual paths we struggle with them and struggle against them it is intellectually stimulating thomas' book charts the vast changes that occur to the american landscape the development of suburbia and american society his realism highlights women's issues race class issues economic issues and what it means to struggle for the ill defined american dream all in all i give it a solid 3 out of 5 stars my ratings are based on the following five star scale will i reread - 1 star will i recommend - 1 star is it engaging - 1 star is it original - 1 star is it emotionally intellectually stimulating 1 star","228":"this book was not enjoyable it went on too long the characters were not likeable i cannot recommend this book","229":"matthew less writes with such compassion for his heroine eileen leary that reading this book is akin to peering into her brain and heart as a child a young wife a middle aged mother and then a widow we are not ourselves manages to out franzen the literary darling which is all the more remarkable considering this is his first book and his day job was teaching high school english eileen is a prickly protagonist one who suppresses herself in many ways but then lashes out with a vicious temper at strangers and loved ones she has similarities to olive kitteridge and i hope hbo or another broadcaster will consider a similar miniseries treatment in pitch meetings with potential publishers how did the agent summarize the plot without falling into cliche alcoholic irish immigrant parents raise eileen in queens girl meets boy they move to the suburbs with their young son and one of them suffers a serious and prolonged illness it's an unrelentingly sad story that is a marvel of honesty detail and emotion","230":" points for keeping me reading it even though at first i wasn't too interested still the flow kept pulling me but it came into its own about a third of the way in as the real story began to emerge alzheimer's has such an insidious onset that it is hard to recognise at first it gathers strength and becomes progressively disruptive of the mind the personality and the family this was exceptionally well described and touching and the letter toward the end squeezed a sob out so bumped up for that too","231":"heartbreaking","232":"good but really hard to get through because of the subject matter","233":"2 5 stars the first half of the book was a struggle for me and i mean the entire first solid 300 pages of this book i kept wondering if i should move on to something else but i have a hard time giving up on a book and i was still holding out hope that it would get better since it seems to have gotten a lot of high praise i have a hard time holding on when i don't care about the characters and eileen was pretty annoying with her constant desire to always have more for her life would begin when a she moved b she had the perfect kitchen c they had more money it was always something the book finally did pick up for me with ed's diagnosis the book was still depressing as hell but at least i felt something for the characters as they navigated through this new heart breaking life then things petered out again at the end i don't think it's a book i'll remember long term but there were a solid 200 pages in there that i actually enjoyed","234":"the writing was just o k but it's 640 pages of unrelenting misery eileen the main character always wants more more money a better house more prestige in her job a bigger job for her husband just more if that's not irritating enough it's all about her and i do mean all eileen thinks if she can just obtain the next thing her life will be perfect until the next big thing comes along and she's again wanting more and more if there is a more depressing book i don't want to know about it just give me a head's up so i can miss it i've had enough miserable people novels for a while","235":"unlike many best sellers this book was a very serious look at a very serious subject it was clearly written if not imaginatively so the subject matter is so familiar that it was refreshing to read about it from such a plain perspective the author did not reach for any cheap emotional hooks or use other techniques to engage us his writing style was engaging enough this is not a book to like it is a book that should be read in order to help understand our own situations and emotions","236":"decent but easily 300 pages too long every single solitary mundane repetitive thought and observation entering the characters' awareness was just mind numbing after a certain point plus the story was beyond depressing if you're gonna make me live through 450 pages of a man's degradation into alzheimer's at least have the surrounding characters achieve some joy somewhere along the line no i guess not","237":" we are not ourselves matthew thomas author although the illness of ed leary is at the heart of this story because he morphs into someone who is no longer himself the tale is really eileen tumulty's it explores her early childhood and takes the reader right up to her old age she was brought up in a middle class neighborhood her dad was the neighborhood go to guy he held court and offered advice in the local bar after his workday ended and before he went home for dinner which was always at the same assigned hour served by her mother he was content with his narrow life although his wife was not and she eventually became an alcoholic it was eileen who took control and sent her mom to aa this was to be eileen's persona as she grew up she took charge and made things happen often at the expense of others although she was considerate she seemed most interested in her own happiness first she had the ability to move on with her life and not look back she only dealt with those things that she could cope with comfortably and she looked away from everything else as if it never happened she worked when she had to in order to get a good education and eventually became a nurse while pursuing a master's degree she met ed leary ironically a research scientist with expertise in the workings of the brain he like her father was content with a mediocre kind of life tending to the needs of others before himself he refused promotions in favor of teaching those less fortunate and remained working at the community college until circumstances forced him to leave ed and eileen married and had one child connell connell like his mom seemed to serve his own needs first but also like his dad enjoyed assisting others they seemed like a good upwardly mobile family but they were really not on the move time passed they moved from one home to another because of eileen's persistence but basically ed remained where he was never accepting advancement and so he never grew when misfortune struck eileen did take control once again although she really had no choice she tried her best to cope with the situation she faced but sometimes put her own needs before the needs of those most in need of her support she was not always where she should be by choice but still she was in charge and made demands and compromises when necessary especially after ed's unfortunate diagnosis the author dissects the family's decline as the devastating disease that had no cure and no remission became an enormous burden to bear the story carefully examines the varying reactions of those close to the family and the family members as ed's disease developed further and further until it was hard to recognize him as the man he once was he deteriorated physically mentally and emotionally through the narrative the author explores the issues that must be faced by the family members in order to cope with the new financial and emotional needs of both the victim and those that serve them eileen does the best she can but in the end wonders if her best was really the best she could have done guilt haunts eileen and her son connell he was just a teenager about to graduate high school when his father became ill and it is only a few years later that the toll it takes on him is obvious the carefully drawn picture of ed's steady downward progression and eileen's desperate reactions sometimes inappropriate and unexpected gave the most meaning to the story however there seemed to be several long winded and excessive descriptions that went on and on the extra dialogue went off tangentially lending nothing further to the story because of the excessive wordiness after awhile the story felt like one long eulogy whose purpose was to over involve and overwhelm the reader emotionally in much the same way as the narrator of the audio book seemed overwhelmed portraying the character totally on the basis of feelings and leaving out any intellectual interpretation perhaps i would have liked eileen more if the narrator's tone hadn't been so cloying the reader sometimes over emoted in inappropriate moments which almost mocked what she was describing rather than lending it the appropriate gravitas that it required i also read the print copy for clarification of some points and i think the print copy was superior the best part of the book is its exploration of alzheimer's disease and how it effects others besides the victim it points out that the ability to communicate may not be the problem rather it is the lack of communication that is at the heart of most of life's crises the guilt and shame that often follow in the wake of illness and death is most often misplaced the book attempts to do too much there is too much philosophy too much emotion too much description nothing is really left to think about because the author attempts to provide all of the answers in the end the lack of communication between those that could and those that couldn't created chaos and misunderstandings failures of purpose and moments of misconduct sometimes it necessitated starting life over again","238":" initially i wasn't sure i wanted to continue reading this book as the subject matter got off to a rather grim start i was hesitant to immerse myself in what appeared to be 600 pages of heartache and misery however it didn't take long before i became inexplicably entwined with the journey of the leary family it was an honest real portrait of a family whose struggles failures and triumphs were intimately brought to life both heartbreaking and uplifting this book is an unforgettable celebration of family and love","239":"loved this book moving and incredibly well written","240":"beautifully sad proud poignant story how can this be a first novel","241":"i cannot give enough praise to we are not ourselves the only disappointment matthew thomas has not written more i have been spoiled every book i read is now compared to we are not ourselves at one point i didn't know if i would be able to finish the book because of its emotional effect recommendations for works similar to matthew thomas writing style would be greatly appreciated","242":" we are not ourselves is a beautifully written profoundly real and emotionally devastating novel i finished the book weeks ago yet it continues to weigh heavily on my mind this is the debut novel everyone is talking about it has been described as everything from a family saga to the new great american novel since its focus is on a single family unit i wouldn't necessarily call it a saga but it definitely has all the characteristics of a great american novel we are not ourselves begins with an irish immigrant couple in queens and their only child eileen she takes center stage early on what follows is basically her story her yearnings struggles and strivings for a better life her pursuit of the american dream and the obstacles she encounters along the way eileen pins her hopes on scientist ed leary they marry and have a son connell named for the author of the novel mrs bridge which eileen encounters during pregnancy eileen pushes her family onward and upward but it's obvious ed does not share her aspirations he takes comfort in routine and resists change as ed enters his fifties he becomes withdrawn easily confused and even more adamant in his insistence on maintaing the status quo eileen is painfully slow in figuring out what's happening to her husband but most readers will certainly guess the true nature of ed's problem once it is spelled out and his illness is labeled the novel becomes sadder and increasingly difficult to read especially for the reader who has experienced similar life events in the second half of the novel the family comes to terms with ed's illness and attempts to move forward connell who had been in the background begins to play a larger role none of the characters are especially likable but they all ring true small human dramas play out in their everyday lives it is interesting that the author chose to keep ed's own story and experiences out of the narrative also of note i took great delight in the author's vocabulary and word choice i will certainly read whatever matthew thomas writes next bottom line i was totally consumed by we are not ourselves and do not remember the last time a book had such a profound emotional impact on me","243":"this book is extremely realistic i didn't enjoy it so much as appreciate it for its realism i think it was especially real for me because my grandmother had alzheimer's and i understand what elaine and the family are going through","244":"i really liked this book it's a long one following the life of an irish american woman in new york city from birth to her older years the characters are sharply drawn and multi layered i became very attached to them foibles and all highly recommended","245":"beautiful but painfully depressing i had a hard time finishing it","246":"this review has been hidden because it contains spoilers to view it click

eileen works and tries really hard to keep everything together and connell their son who doesn't quite turn out or deal with things as eileen would have hoped on occasions i've had a real lump in my throat and it makes you appreciate normal life eileen has huge aspirations for the family maybe a li this is a very in depth character study of a family dealing with alzheimer's disease it's so well

out or deal with things as eileen would have hoped on occasions i've had a real lump in my throat and it makes you appreciate normal life eileen has huge aspirations for the family maybe a little too high and i'm not sure ed was really her ideal match but there are some really touching moments she says at one point that she had spent so long in bed turning away from her husband how she wished she could lie there facing him now it's shows how much we take for granted until it's too late she is a frustrating woman though and you probably won't like her and at times it is long winded but it is quite a haunting book and i have enjoyed the challenge more","247":"very depressing story about a family living in new york and how their lives never go the way they would like","248":"i'm on the fence about this book i see too many authors using lists of things as a literary convention the subject matter was very difficult to read about so if the prose was lyrical it would have made a difference i feel like i'm only on the fence because all of the acolades make me feel i should have enjoyed the book more","249":"very good well written the characters often are unlikable but in a way that makes them highly realistic a very melancholy feel to the book i was pleased with the ending","250":"epic family saga that follows eileen tumulty daughter of irish immigrants from her birth in 1941 all the way to an epilogue set in 2010 or thereabouts very interesting about immigrants' issues in new york in the 40s and 50s and how it's shaped their attitude to work marriage and where to live the second half of the book deals more with eileen's husband's issues and the effects on her and their son and it made for a very emotional read highly recommended","251":" this book was brilliant compelling devastating and gut wrenching and i came very close to not reading it i was uncertain as to whether this book was for me and i hesitated for a long time i liken this book to something my sisters and i used to do as kids we would find a good sized rock and dare each other to look underneath we knew that whatever was there wouldn't be pretty but we would eventually lift the rock from its resting place and shriek in shock and delight at the creepy things we always discovered we are not ourselves is not a pretty book once you start be prepared for a stunning and emotionally draining family saga that avoids cliches and bluntly deals with the realities of marriage the anxiety of raising children and the desperation and agony of coping with the lengthy drawn out tragedy of watching a loved one die from a debilitating disease i was shaken by this book and frequently felt as though i had been sucker punched for all its sadness however the book was illuminating and beautiful i am very happy that i looked under the rock this time for those who are interested i found that this novel compared favourably with v s naipaul's a house for mr biswas and jonathan franzen's the corrections","252":"very very long winded book the writing is good but i found myself skipping over very large and boring sections elsewise i'd of never been able to stay with it some parts were interesting some weren't all in all it is unclear whether this book is supposed to tell a story or make you think it didn't quite do both at the same time","253":"this review has been hidden because it contains spoilers to view it click here it was hard to care about any of the main characters in thomas's debut novel we are not ourselves instead of feeling sorry for eileen i just found her irritating and whiney ed's character didn't not feel fleshed out and their son connell was just more of the same self obsessed characterization that flooded the novel this is not a family that anyone wants to belong to and it focuses on the family's struggle to rise above their immigrant irish status we are not ourselves familial misery is it was hard to care about any of the main characters in thomas's debut novel we are not ourselves instead of feeling sorry for eileen i just found her irritating and whiney ed's character didn't not feel fleshed out and their son connell was just more of the same self obsessed characterization that flooded the novel this is not a family that anyone wants to belong to and it focuses on the family's struggle to rise above their immigrant irish status we are not ourselves familial misery is similar to the family in franzen's the corrections but it lacks franzens beautiful prose and it does not contain his keen social insight this is a long and depressing book about alzheimer's and i would not recommend it for anyone who has gone through this awful disease with a loved one more","254":" it's hard to describe what makes this a five star book it's fairly narrow in scope and the contours of its plot are familiar to me and probably most other americans the writing is superbly executed but not unique in style for me this is generally a big plus what elevates it to the highest rating is that i enjoyed every page could imagine these characters and their world vividly and found myself thinking about the book when i wasn't reading it about 200 pages in with the major plot development clear i wondered how the author could possibly carry it for another 400 pages but he did","255":"just getting started on this one and enjoying it tremendously will update this review when i finish it update finished it very good novel but it would have been a better novel if about one quarter to one third had been edited out it just got a tad tedious this story did not require 600 pages","256":"could not make it through everything went grey and redundant around 150 and has not bounced back some 100 pages further in maybe things turn around but i am not pulled in enough by the characters to wait it out","257":"toooooo loooonnnggg i liked the beginning chapters describing eileen's childhood etc there was a little too much involving her adult years and dealing with her husband's alzheimers","258":"while well written there were no characters i felt a bond with i often enjoy flawed characters even anti hero types but this novel kept me at arms length throughout the span of three generations of a family the author used tight prose and well described scenes but no character progressed beyond its introduction","259":"a patient and unblinking close up on one family one marriage one woman other people come into frame and a good half century of immigrant life in new york city is intimated with enough specificity that i felt as if i had lived it but this story belongs to eileen and her incredible drive her intractable flaws and the life long battle in her heart between shame and love it's a beautiful novel","260":" i received this book courtesy of simon u0026amp schuster canada after entering a goodreads giveaway this book focuses mostly on the psychological aspect of the characters family members while they go through various life experiences at first the story is told from eileen's the main protagonist point of view i couldn't help but feel sympathetic to her childhood struggles dealing with an alcoholic mother but at some point after getting married and having a kid she started doing things that made me shake my head and sometimes i even thought she was a total bitch this is what kept me hooked though when eileen's kid connell gets older the author makes occasional shifts relating events from his point of view i really related to him as i was also bullied at school when i was young but he also ended up doing morally questionable things the characters' flaws and how those affect each others is what makes this book interesting the author explores many themes alcoholism disease materialism xenophobia racism married life with its routines and concessions loneliness selfishness the sacrifices the american dream but the main idea i retained from this book is the damage caused by materialism by trying too hard to create a nice facade to impress others and also the power of a simple hug","261":"this book snuck up on me i kept putting it down to start something else but it kept calling me back i thought it was a bit on the long side and i found it hard to like any of the characters but it was mesmerizing sad and beautiful it will stay with me for a long time","262":"library e book","263":"it was hard to like this character driven novel eileen was so into her own world while her real world was decaying all around just like the second house she bought where the foundation was rotting it does all get resolved in the very end i liked ed the best","264":"i suppose i picked up this book because i never tire of reading well written tales of irish america and this one had gotten good reviews we are not ourselves is so much more than that though and is so good that i am slightly bereft to be done even though there were times when its pace seemed to verge on being too leisurely this is definitely a case where slow and steady wins the race and i look forward to reading more from first time novelist matthew thomas","265":" i wish i could shelve this under great american novels and it's close but not quite there as a debut novel this is quite exciting i spent a year once reading first novels of all the writers i admired most just as a way of giving myself a little encouragement today's debut novelists come out a little more polished it seems to me both because of the content of mfa programs and because of the network of mentors many of these writers are able to build through mfa programs this is a smoothly written book some have called it beautiful but i would stop just short of that because although the sentences are built with care i wouldn't call language a first concern of the book the style serves the subject mostly though the particular cadences of immigrant speak are mostly absent and would have enriched the book quite a bit i think so this is a book that's about the assimilation of irish catholic immigrants in america specifically in new york which the author tries to claim in an interview is a microcosm of america which is just wrong with alzheimer's at its heart some in europe today argue that autism is the disease that best sums up the current national character of america but i think you could make at least an equal case for alzheimer's we are not ourselves is about alzheimer's in the way that middlesex is about being transgender as hermaphrodism serves as a metaphor for first generation descendants of greek immigrants in eugenides's novel azheimer's serves as a metaphor for that experience among irish catholics in thomas's book i think the eugenides book is slightly more successful keeping in mind that eugenides was a more experienced novelist when he wrote that book while i loved we are not ourselves for the way it rendered extremely complex characters showed how someone could be deeply disappointed with a spouse while loving them completely expressed the ambivalence of those who are mostly assimilated toward new immigrants who are still showing their colors so to speak the way it dealt with the difficulty family members have of dealing with alzheimer's the way it rendered a woman's struggle to balance family and career plus trying to live out the american dream which is different for those born into that dream and the way it avoided the alienation endemic to contemporary american lit in just about any other novel dealing with alzheimer's for instance the protagonist would be completely isolated and for one reason another would not have any close friends or relatives which is not the case here nor would the protagonist have any passionate dreams at stake because passion is largely lacking in american lit today again not the case here i had some problems with the book though the narrative voice was distant especially in the first section when we see eileen's childhood this is critical to our understanding of her character and the immediacy the horror of that childhood is not given to us as i said above the ethnic tonality of this experience is missing as well also missing is any real grappling with religion while i recognize that irish catholicism is largely an ethnic category and that many irish catholics identify more with the tradition than with the content of catholicism i had a hard time believing that there would not have been some railing at god as ed fell sicker we don't actually go to church with eileen and or ed ever it's mentioned that they sometimes go and that eileen went every sunday as a child so really she never had any sense of reverence for and connection to what she experienced in church as a child even if she later grew out of that there was some commentary on how good people should be rewarded and how that hasn't borne out in her experience later but i thought there should have been more perhaps because of the choice to keep the voice in distant omni third you don't get much interiority in this book at all much less any spiritual interiority and i found that absence hard to credit in this community of characters i mean the author's day job was teaching in a jesuit school come on where's the spiritual juice understand i'm not asking for a religious treatise i'm only saying that if you come from a tradition steeped in religion and you move out of it partly as part of your quest to assimilate more fully into american life there would be some rub there i didn't have much of a sense of eileen's mother other than that she was a drunk and also beautiful fair skin dark hair but i can't really see this woman in the way i can see eileen's father i thought that was odd in a book so centered on a woman's experience i would like eileen to have thought more about her parents especially about her mother as she aged and became a mother herself all of us do that i also wondered why menopause didn't play more of a role most women have a lot of memory and word finding issues starting in their 40s eileen must have been in the throes of menopause during ed's decline so why isn't she panicking that maybe she has alzheimer's too i know i am most women i know are these two absences the mother and the physical reality of womanhood which can make it hard to cope with both family and work obligations were the only off notes for me in an otherwise impressive rendering of a woman's lifestory my biggest issue was that what i thought was the real theme of the book the fact that we children of immigrants are not ourselves was not fully developed instead the book got preoccupied with the rendering of alzheimer's itself and seemed to forget what this was meant to be a metaphor for i thought that choosing alzheimer's as the central concern was brilliant don't get me wrong for immigrants who move into assimilation so much is lost there are huge holes in eileen's memory partly because she doesn't care to know about what her parents left behind in the old country about the griefs that drive their alcoholism consequently there are even bigger holes in connell's memory he is entirely american willing to walk out on his father during the worst of the disease even leaving him alone and helpless in the house after his father has already fallen on his face during connell's watch there's a lot of richness in the way the family's denial of ed's condition mirrors their denial of their often painful heritage yet while eileen reaches a bit of peace with all this loss in her willingness finally to accept that there's beauty in the way the indian family who bought her old house has preserved some of their traditions she doesn't reach a point in her growth where she fully examines the ways in which she is not herself and in which connell is not himself as a result of her drive to assimilate we are not privy at all to the ways in which being a descendant of immigrants who never made inroads into the american dream affected ed since he is the one with alzheimer's i wondered about his family and the holes in their memories ed is a neuroscientist and i'm not exactly sure why aside from the opportunity for irony i mean i don't really know why he's so passionate about this field and also i don't know why the author picked that particular thing i think there's a case to be made for the dilution of human experience caused by assimilation for the deterioration of a people when it trades membership in a tradition for the house in westchester but it wasn't quite made because the richness of eileen's and ed's legacy was not revealed to us we mainly saw the negatives of their parents' culture some have seen eileen as shallow and she is in a way because she denies herself her past but i think that criticism is largely a perspective of those who come from an already assimilated segment of american culture and who themselves have lost touch with what the intermediary generation the first generation went through in order to move their families from the poverty of their parents to the security of the american middle class or even upper middle class i think it's a common experience that in the desire to grasp the american dream of upward mobility you leave your past utterly behind and you tend to focus on the concrete house car status in addition the shame of poverty is so acute in our culture cf marilynne robinson's lila it's easy to see how someone born to it could want more than anything to achieve the trappings of wealth i also suspect this criticism is the perspective of those who did not finish the book as eileen eventually comes to see that material gain does not matter as much as family ties all in all i didn't think this book was quite as accomplished at depicting the impact on the north american psyche of the immigrant experience it's not just about what we come to but what we left behind there is no mass arrival in a country without an exodus from another one there is no pioneer without a hugely traumatic experience behind her the impact of that trauma is still felt by all of us i believe handed down through the generations via approaches to parenting as jane urquhart's away then again i don't think that was urquhart's first novel either one particularly poignant theme that both thomas and urquhart treat is flight in we are not ourselves we see how flight has exhausted eileen her parents fled ireland eileen fled her parents' household their culture and to some extent their values she fled the church she fled her first home as new immigrants from different backgrounds moved in initially she fled the knowledge of her husband's illness and fled the obvious that her husband and her son were not as ambitious as she was i think that sometimes it takes your whole wad to move one step out of your parents' world in our society and then you run out of energy some minor nits i had a hard time believing that ed had a fully equipped lab and could do so much research at a community college perhaps his college was extraordinary in this regard but this was never said don't community colleges emphasize teaching over research i got that he didn't want to go to a research only position or to an administrative position but both teaching and research were important to him and i wasn't convinced he'd get to do so much research at that school i thought nyu might have offered a better balance actually and i didn't understand the issue with eileen's insurance wouldn't she have had insurance with all of her jobs even if she jumped from one to another i thought her professional trajectory could have used more attention in general because it's important to her character and to the theme of a woman's journey though american life at that time even if she went under ed's insurance for any number of good reasons wouldn't she have been able to get insurance without waiting for ten years and been eligible for medicare once she retired i do understand that thomas wanted to make the point that the american healthcare system bankrupts hardworking families or at least puts the kibosh on their aspirations but i felt it needed to have a more organic cause such as the 20% coinsurance being enough to kill them also it didn't seem to be the case that it did kill this family also i thought she'd been head of nursing at her previous jobs so i wasn't sure why she was under the thumb of that difficult boss near the end it seems her career stalled out but because we didn't see much of her journey through the workplace i wasn't clear on why how i guessed she had to turn down promotions or perhaps step down a bit in order to have the energy to care for ed this is a conundrum for a lot of women so i thought it should have been more overtly handled nevertheless this is an extremely complex novel that covers a lot of ground perhaps it's unfair to ask it to have gone into more of the story more deeply","266":"mostly this felt like a pedestrian trot through one womans life with a bit of her sons thrown for good measure the books real strength is in the depiction of what happens to the husband it is marvellous and well worth reading for that alone","267":"i would really give it a 2 1 2 didn't love it i felt like the story had such potential but the author skipped over really pertinent information and bogged us down in really unimportant information i also did not like any of the characters except maybe her drunk father in the beginning his writing is nice the editor needed to help with consistency of information","268":"at times this book seemed grindingly slow and painful sometimes it seemed all about eileen and her human errors but the pace and wonderful conclusion were a beautiful blend you finally realized that all along it was really about the struggles of family life and the love between a father and a son i hope i will be as tough and as strong as eileen and keep that interior memory of the purpose of family","269":"at its surface we are not ourselves tells the story of the everyday passing of life over the years including changes in family homes jobs etc throughout it subtly sent the message to be content with life as it is rather than focusing on making it to events accomplishments or milestones that are believed to represent happiness","270":" a character driven novel and no plot just the story of the lives of one irish catholic family from the father big ed through the daughter eileen and finally through her son connell i felt the author was true to his characters though the gaps in the stories and years at a time made the book a little choppy even at 600 pages at the end i felt like the story could have been honed down 200 pages or that the thomas should have said screw it and gone michner and written a 900 page book without the gaps in our characters lives","271":"a multi generational family novel that somehow manages to be heartbreaking and joyful sometimes at the same time the main character is fascinating and real in a way that lets you admire sympathize with and dislike at various points throughout the book","272":"i wish i possessed the eloquence to write the review this book deserves to me it's an amazing feat to turn the seemingly mundane lives of a small family into more than 600 poignant and compelling pages","273":"this book is emotionally tough we had a serious debate at our book group as to whether it was too realistic and thus hit too lose to home i liked the story and the characters but i felt drained at the end i wonder what edits could have been made as well to make it a bit shorter","274":"like the review by mary lin i thought the first 1 4 of this book was a bit long and could have benefited by further editing i also think that the story is about what happens but not much about the internal lives of the characters having said that the subject matter eventually draws you in after about 1 3 of the book there was never a point where i wanted to stop reading i think it is worth looking at","275":"like the characters and story well enough but there's too much it could stand to lose 150 pages","276":"this is a book about life parents children moving gentrification new york marriage sickness death it's all there while i did enjoy this book i found parts lacking i felt that i was rushed directly from eileen's childhood into adulthood skipping parts of her teens and college years that would have been interesting to explore given her immediate willingness to marry ed","277":" if you were to ask me while i was reading it i'd tell you i hated this book it's depressing crushing and indicts everything from the american dream to the institution of marriage to the u s health care system the characters are so flawed they abut the far edge of relatability and yet i couldn't put this book down a third of the way through it despite not liking any of the characters their trajectories their choices i was hooked this book is just too damn human to be dismissed eileen ed and connell are so fallible that they somehow become auspices of people we know people we are we ache at their needs we cringe knowingly at their mistakes we recognize their impulses it's a giant novel that rolls along a story more than follows an arc there is no one true protagonist there is no one fight against evil it's a breath more than a paragraph a history more than a novel it's a depressing snapshot of a city a family a disease it's like the macabre emotionally ambiguous twin to george eliot's middlemarch i hated it i cursed it i felt it honestly i don't know if i'd rather hug thomas or slap him and somehow i think that's part of the point","278":"currently about 1 3 of the way in i'm losing interest and not invested in the characters i'm not incredibly interested by the writing style debating whether to keep going for another 300 pages but i don't like quitting books kept going and ultimately skipped 100 pages but made it through not bad i wanted to see how all the characters' continually awful decisions turned out","279":"this is one of those books i was supposed to love i knew going in there wasn't much in the form of a plot but the utter bleakness of the whole thing was what did it for me","280":"beautiful writing tremendously sad story with no payoff","281":"we are not ourselves the debut novel by matthew thomas tells the story of the struggles and triumphs of several generations of an irish american family as they travel through last half of the twentieth century and into our modern time but this description may make it seem as if we are getting a sweeping look at a large boisterous immigrant family - when what really end up with is an intimate look at the life of eileen leary the daughter mother wife nurse at the center of it all...as well as the struggle she faces in her own small family and in their own uniquely personal way at 600 pages the book is no small read though the paragraphs and events whiz by we see eileen's childhood days as she dreams of a way to get past her turbulent upbringin dreaming of a better life by making her way into the american upper class on the arm of her handsome and smart scientist husband ed her husband however fails to meet her expectations but they continue to float slightly upward due to her hard work as a career nurse and her dreams of more the tone shifts a bit half way through when a dark surprise halts that trajectory that just started to seem real including the new bigger house in the suburbs eileen continues to try and use her smarts and willpower to create a normal experience for her son connell as he grows up while she reckons with what has become of her husband about half way through the story connell himself gets a voice as he inherits the family legacy and starts to try and figure out just what he has in his hands this book gets under your skin the characters are more real than many i have lately read the story of one family set against the back drop of the myth of the american dream i felt very connected to eileen as a mother wife and nurse myself with a husband and only one son her struggles felt real and there many moments in which i shared her sadness deeply the simple prose in the novel make it easy to read but do not dismiss this one as lightweight certain passages where so moving while spare in the text almost poetic to even get a bit sentimental while one might argue that the book needed some editing down especially in the first half for example a very minor character returns in the back half that i had so little memory of i had to flip back and search hard to find why i should care about this scene i am genuinely glad to have been a part of this messy family for a few weeks","282":"i don't get the hype i'm only 100 of the 620 pages in and am bored to tears the writing itself is just okay way too much exposition and the protagonist is a whiny bore i can't imagine reading another 520 pages of this so i'm putting it down for good i just looked around on goodreads and saw quite a few other comments like mine so it makes me wonder how this tome has garnered so much praise","283":" i realize a lot of my book reviews end up comparing the author to anne tyler i suppose this is because i am drawn to fiction about fairly typical american people with one or two added quirks or circumstances we are not ourselves is another one of these books but instead of a short novel that can be easily read over a rainy weekend he gave the readers an epic tale of a family that could have been imagined by tyler the main character eileen is consumed with the goal of rising above the social status she was born into she falls in love with ed who is more content to stay where he is and make a difference in his students' lives than he is in moving up to a higher paying career they both love their son connell but express the love in their own ways as connell grows up the family dynamic is challenged by an illness that slowly consumes ed how the three main characters and their friends deal with the progress of the illness is at the heart of the book the epic scale of the story allows us to become intimate with the characters i found myself identifying with eileen ed and connell at various times in the narrative i love having a good long book to sink into for a week or two this book gave me a good ride and left me with a lot to think about","284":"this long book is like a long private conversation with a fairly unremarkable family it snuck up on me in a surprising way and pulled me into their very interior world","285":"read this book 620 pages of beauty and truth","286":"sad and beautiful it reminded me of richard ford's work good solid writing at first it was a bit tedious but slowly and steadily it grew on me i started to fall in love with the characters the writing is adept","287":"at times brilliant at other time ungainly in length but heart rending nonetheless and the final pages made me cry which no book has done for a very long time","288":" i always like books with straightforward prose but has quotable and thought provoking words this is one of them it is fiction but it is unflinchingly honest about how each of us have a good noble side and also a very human often self serving side with a very realistic story as the backdrop you cheer the characters on but also get frustrated or appalled which is how i believe we often feel about those we love the most the emotional humdinger for me is close to the end in a letter the father writes to his son the unlikely outpouring of wisdom and love is a missive i could only hope to receive","289":"this is a lengthy poignant book of thoughtful small moments lots and lots and lots of small moments it's simply and elegantly written but so very long and unabridged alzheimer's is that a spoiler not sure is treated with dignity and respect and the characters are compelling enough i finished it probably only because i skimmed through parts rather quickly and am glad i did but it wasn't easy on a side note i really wish i'd read this before slow dancing with a stranger","290":"kinda sad and maudelin but extremely well written","291":"this review has been hidden because it contains spoilers to view it click here eileen tumulty leary's does not go exactly as she hopes as a girl growing up in post wwii brooklyn the daughter of irish immigrants she pictures her life with a successful man in a fine

meets him but he turns out to be more interested in intellectual successes than financial ones she has difficulties getting pregnant and settles on having one child the ultimate blow to her dreams arrives when ed is diagnosed with early onset alzheimer's disease a thoughtful book it explores many aspects in the life of one family from the mid 20th century to the present including alcoholism career pressures and the desire for a better life for one's children however the emphasis and heart of the book is how eileen her son and husband deal with alzheimer's disease they are often less than heroic as they deal with the slow and tortuous advance of a horrible affliction in the end it is an honest and sympathetic depiction of lives lived given the circumstances and conditions people are handed more","292":"at least 300 pages too long the story line about altzheimer's is interesting but of course sad and all the characters except the poor guy with early onset altzheimer's are unlikable so really a difficult book to get through","293":" this is an epic family saga type book - think wally lamb but a little quieter - exactly the kind of book that i can really sink my teeth into get involved with the characters and come away feeling like i've gotten to know and love another family like i have new friends we are not ourselves follows eileen tumulty raised in queens by irish immigrant parents from about the age of ten - in the 1950's - to the present in that time she takes care of her alcoholic mother meets practical scientist ed and gets married becomes a nurse has a son connell and basically the reader just follows this family throughout their lives it may sound boring but it is far from that there's a ton of struggle and strife and the push pull of a marriage and family here there's also a big event that happens to this family about three quarters of the way through the book that changes a lot of the direction of the novel i thought the writing in this novel was incredible and despite its length i couldn't put the book down i really got involved with these characters and even though i had a difficult time liking any of them that seemed not to matter as i just felt for them they didn't act the way i would have acted didn't see the world how i do yet i couldn't help but get them does that make sense anyway i thought this book was just as great as everyone says and i highly recommend it","294":"this novel is such a sensitive and raw portrayal of the relationships within a family and the struggles and desires we all face it felt so true and real it was a bit depressing but sometimes real life is eileen is strong and inspirational she just keeps going and she never loses sight of what's important i feel like this book is a lesson about what matters most in life and a reminder of how to love in the face of tremendous obstacles i would have given it 5 stars but it dragged for me a little in the middle overall though a fantastic read and a really impressive debut for matthew thomas","295":"i was ready to walk away from this book multiple times i think i finished it more out of a sense of obligation than compelling characters or plot","296":"painfully slow build up to a better story ending of family glad i read it but it took serious commitment i prefer page turners","297":"i almost gave up on this book about 25% of the way in to it because i didn't really care about it and i had another book in the queue that i wanted to start however i accidentally picked up this book instead of the other on the way out the door and ended up getting far enough along to want to read more i'm going with the other reviewers that said some parts are a 5 and others are a 3 i wish i could give it a 3 5 but this system won't let me it was a long read and some parts weren't great but overall i'm glad i read it there was an especially wonderful few pages near the end that left me with a good feeling","298":"when writing a huge sweeping saga let's remember to sometimes incorporate moments of lightness shall we sheesh","299":" this sweeping epic of a novel about an irish american family contains many pleasures strong characterization compelling settings and real human conflict that kept me reading i did find that the scope of the novel created some gaps in the development of the relationships between and among family members over the generations and sometimes backstory appeared that seemed odd since the events had been skipped as the book moved chronologically through the years despite that i enjoyed this novel very much and recommend it to anyone looking for a story about real adults in conflicts of the heart http sarahkennedybooks com","300":"i'd rate this 2 5 stars full disclosure i received an advance readers copy of this book from netgalley in exchange for an unbiased review eileen tumulty grew up in queens in the late 1940s and 1950s raised by irish immigrants in queens eileen's father was a legend in their community a larger than life figure whose counsel everyone in the neighborhood sought her mother faded into the spotlight and was incapable of showing eileen any real emotion alcohol was always plentiful in their lives and the quality of her parents' marriage and the calmness of their home depended mostly on how much alcohol was consumed and who was the one doing the drinking the dysfunction in her parents' lives forced eileen to become independent and take charge at an early age intelligent and driven she was still a woman growing up in the 1950s and 1960s so while she dreamed of a career as a lawyer or doctor she chose the road that was open to smart girls like her nursing and as she flourished in her studies she was determined to have a life--and a marriage--better than her parents when she meets ed leary a young scientist who is very different from the men she has met before she believes she has found the man who will help her fulfill her dreams yet she quickly realizes that ed's ambitions do not match hers--in fact he is far more satisfied with the status quo than she understands and as her career advances and she hopes for a home of their own a haven to raise their son connell she discovers that what she believes to be ed's lack of ambition his stubbornness and inflexibility actually mask a larger problem that will change all of their lives we are not ourselves is a moving story about a family affected by challenge and how it both brings them together and tears them apart it's a book about wanting more than you have as well as not wanting what you do have it's also a story about the fragility and intensity of relationships between spouses and between parent and child matthew thomas is a very talented writer while i liked the book's plot at its core i felt as if the story could have been told perhaps even more effectively in 300 or so pages rather than the 640 pages the book runs the challenges that the learys face take a very long while to be fully revealed while i understand the importance of the background of eileen's childhood as it served as a catalyst for all she longed for in adulthood the book spent more time than it needed to there and in laying out the details of the learys' day to day lives i found the last quarter or so of the book the most moving and where thomas' writing really hit its stride if you like sprawling family sagas this is definitely a book for you there is much to like about we are not ourselves it's just the payoff takes a very long time to reveal itself","301":"a tough subject alzheimer's but handled very well parts of it were so well written to deserve five stars but at other times it was as if the author lost his way a bit i do recommend this book especially if you have someone in your family dealing with the disease","302":"i absolutely loved this book it is a must read","303":" born in 1941 eileen becomes the caretaker of her parents who are both alcoholics she dreams of a different life and falls in love with ed who is a research scientist she constantly wants more for her family meanwhile ed develops alzheimer's disease i found the book depressing many details were given about events that i felt were not important while other situations were not developed such as eileen's job as a nurse it would have been more interesting to write the book from different perspectives from their son's point of view","304":"for a character driven story the characters were surprisingly flat and only roughly filled in i'm not marking it as dnf cause i read about 400 pgs before throwing in the towel and i want credit for that","305":"wow after i finished this i quickly paged to the author bio looking for more works i could dive into and was shocked to see this was his debut novel the story draws you in from the beginning and eileen is a beautifully flawed character you are truly in her head at first it's jarring when we occasionally switch to connell's point of view but i came to love him as well the picture of their lives is rich in detail being roughly the same age as connell i really identified with the era in which he was growing up the tragedy of ed's ordeal is faced head on often in stomach turning detail but in the end we feel we have come along on this family's journey and the end left me in tears only one of three books to ever touch me to that effect his prose is gorgeous and not intrusively so it's very organic i look forward to more","306":"the last third of this book was so sad though beautifully written it was only very rarely that the happy events of a life were mentioned but surely there were some","307":"this book nearly got 5 stars from me thomas writes with unflinching honesty about human nature family and mortality i was almost disturbingly affected by these characters the choices they made and the circumstances life handed them maybe because i'm the same age as ed in much of the novel and could relate to him at times uncannily i'll be thinking about wano for a long time","308":"this review has been hidden because it contains spoilers to view it click here darling do you remember the man you married touch me

brutal reality of what it must be like fo darling do you remember the man you married touch me remind me who i am stanley kunitz this quote is one of the two epigraphs found at the start of this book it is very haunting and truly captures the spirit of this book still alice approached early onset alzheimer's from the perspective of the afflicted this book on the other hand captures the progression of the disease from the perspective of spouse and child and does so with the sometimes brutal reality of what it must be like for the family of the alzheimer's patient ed is diagnosed with alzheimer's in his early fifties eileen is ed's wife and this is more her story than anyone else's she's a nurse who arguably should have twigged to what was going on with her husband sooner but then again no one really wants to see the worst even if it's right under their nose when ed is finally diagnosed it throws her life and her plans for the future into deep chaos connell ed and eileen's son has a very hard time accepting the disease as well as any responsibility for the care of his father this really is an epic we follow eileen through six decades of her life her humble beginnings dealing with her alcoholic parents going to nursing school meeting and marrying ed struggling with fertility before finally having her son dealing with ed's quirks prior to the diagnosis dealing with ed and connell after ed's diagnosis through to the ultimate outcome of what the disease has in store we see eileen trying to keep her dreams for her life alive as much as possible in spite of some pretty daunting financial upheavals we also get some of connell's perspective on how he's dealing with losing his dad all in all i found there were some aspects of the book that were glossed over too quickly hence only four stars vice five but ultimately i loved the language and general flavour of the book and found it to be a true picture of what life can be like for those who find themselves in such a monumental and life changing situation i look forward to reading more of mr thomas's work more","309":"read this one on vacation wouldn't recommend for a vacation read as it's a bit heavy not entirely sure what i should write so as to not spoil anything i would say that i have seen several reviews that call the book slow i think the slow parts are well worth the work to get trough it is all important set up for what comes later in the book now i just need to read something mindless and significantly less heavy","310":" i gave it 2 stars because it is well written however i keep trudging through this book and grow to dislike eileen more and more ed isn't the man eileen makes him out to be in her head obviously they should have had a discussion about goals and expectations as smart and goal driven as thomas makes her out to be i find the placating of ed's needs and goals over her own to not line up with the eileen from part 1 and the racism just makes me cringe and it's not even the kind where a person admonishes themselves or it's even explained that this is how she grew up and it was taught to her eileen somehow convinced herself that walking with an indian family one time makes up for her racist attitude to them and then proceeds to go back to ignoring them and soothing her own self serving agenda it just suddenly appears as a character trait and i was pouring through reviews wondering if maybe it's just over my depth and scope of knowledge and feeling inferior because i'm just not getting what others are getting the more i read the negative reviews and see others have the same issues with this book the more i realize i'm wasting valuable reading time on this i'm not finishing this epic sweeping saga eye roll also i don't think parents and one son qualifies as multigenerational i'm just saying maybe if matthew thomas would have written about eileen's father i could have enjoyed it more he obviously was the most interesting well developed character in this book","311":"thomas has written a beautiful book about an irish american family set in queens west chester and environs the city becomes a steadfast backdrop for this emotive account of the family mother son father and the father's ultimate slow inevitable loss to alzheimer's heartbreaking and wonderful at once","312":" i finished it but reluctantly and started to skip paragraphs i thought this novel to be long and mundane can't quite figure out why it is so popular it does treat dealing with alzheimers in one's spouse but that doesn't happen until well into the book rather dry approach to a woman and her uneventful life as far as i am concerned sure she struggled and connived and put up with remaining unfulfilled but over all i really didn't give a damn too long too dry and just ho hum good for a long plane ride...you won't laugh out loud or cry thus disturbing the other close passengers not that that happens to me","313":"this novel lives up to every expectation set upon it by the cover comments and the reviews","314":"i've been seeing this book everywhere and was eager to crack into it given its popularity thomas is certainly an excellent writer his characters are well imagined the pace of the story is slow and steady and some passages are breathtakingly beautiful i can't go above three stars however given the distracting casual racism his main character exhibits haphazardly throughout the book i could find no real discernible purpose for these brief but disturbing passages other than to take me out of the story and wonder what the author must be thinking serious flaws in an otherwise solid debut","315":" i'll give a little more than 3 stars it's impressive especially for a first novel the deliberations of jackson heights and woodside from 1951 onward are spot on terrific and the plight s of eileen as daughter student wife mother woman are totally believable and make important statements about dreams plans responsibilities compromises and more but the novel needs heavy duty editing few narratives require 600 pages to tell and while expansion and reiteration can underline the significance of themes they can also bog down plot delivery and become annoying i can read any tough stuff including accounts of the complexity and anguish ands brutal miseries of alzheimer's but sometimes the adage that less is more bespeaks volumes that said i recommend the novel particularly to those interested in a realistic rendering of a specific irish american family","316":"engaging relatable and real i was totally caught up in the lives of this little irish american family in new york and their ordinary disappointments and triumphs i found it very moving","317":"amazing amazing amazing this well written story reminds us of what is truly important in life family and all the love that can be found there","318":"this book has been described as an epic story totally agree the story weaves thru the life of a family impacted by alzheimer's at times i wondered where this story was going and wondered at the same time how the author could wrap up this book there would many emotional moments as each character dealt with the diagnosis while trying to keep dreams and hopes alive and moving forward my only criticism is the length of the book that in itself was epic","319":"i loved this book","320":"one of the best books i've read this year although it's a super long book 600 pages it feels like just the right length it's an honest touching and even heartbreaking examination of the leary family yet it's not sentimental and smarmy be prepared to contemplate how you would deal with the chronic disease of a family member read it you won't be disappointed","321":" we are not ourselves was one of those novels that traps you in from the very start and doesn't let you go until you've turned the last page about halfway through i was starting to question whether i'd finish but there's something incredibly satisfying about making it all the way through 620 pages that kept me going thomas is a skilled storyteller who writes in a really day to day style i enjoy making my way through novels written like that it reminded me a little bit of jonathan franzen's freedom which i really really loved but i know some people find them a little dry what really made we are not ourselves enjoyable was how realistic each of the characters were you can relate to elements of each of their lives despite the unique circumstances they find themselves in as for the end of the novel epilogue 2011 it made my heart hurt would i have made the same decision as connell probably not but thomas' message about the eternal connections of family focusing on the interconnected nature of parenthood and childhood was a lovely heartwarming conclusion to the story i would recommend this book to anyone who has quite a bit of time on their hands and is looking for a realistic account of a family's life in new york if the kid didn't handle it well well that was what kids did they went out too often they stayed out too late they said things that cut to the quick they forgot responsibilities they broke your heart years later they thought about it all and what did parents do they saw more clearly than their kids did they forgave their kids even if they didn't say so even if they couldn't say so they did","322":"3 5 stars--loved the writing to start but at least 100 pages could have been edited out a reminder that life never goes exactly like we might plan it to be thankful for our loved ones","323":"this review has been hidden because it contains spoilers to view it click here it was really a depressing read halfway through the book you find out a main character has early stage alzheimer's dissatisfaction with one's life was the over riding theme well written fully developed characters just way too depressing","324":" this friends is why we read novels because occasionally you stumble upon a storyteller who can take the mundane and make it magnificent matthew thomas has written as accomplished a debut novel as you'll ever read it is the kind of sprawling multigenerational family epic in which you become immersed even lost members of an irish american family in new york struggle hard love fiercely and grapple with alcoholism poverty and racial tensions eileen is captivated by the american dream of upward mobility which provides a kind of healthy ambition before enslaving her to a largely unattainable future the devastating emergence of alzheimer's disease is beautifully portrayed and the descent into it is heartbreaking there are moments of grace and kindness and others of cruelty and all of them feel utterly authentic it is a very long novel yet i was so sorry when i finished it it is a movie waiting to be made","325":"can't say i didn't like this book it just got boring and i eventually abandoned it for something more engaging","326":"at about 150 pages boredom set in and it would not go away there was no excitement to this book just a recitation of every day facts the story just plodded along and i gave up","327":" i wanted to like this book and i must have as i gave it four stars it was however a slog to get through the protagonist eileen leary has far reaching ambitions and goals for herself and her family these are admirable qualities to have but her family husband and son are like cinder blocks tied to her ankles as she tries to rise out of the depths of mediocrity it was so frustrating to read about their complacency when she clearly wants more for them her attempts to make them reach beyond their grasp creates a shrillness and irritability in her that could convince the reader she was nothing but a shrew from the beginning the devastation that is revealed to be the source of her husband's undoing is poignant and heartbreaking this is a novel that plainly illuminates every thread that makes up the tapestry of marriage and parenthood","328":" i started reading this book with major trepidation guessing where it would go after reading just a bit of it it is not a subject i enjoy reading about i ended up being glad i read it and thought it was very well done the characters are complex and their relationships and the difficult circumstances of the family were compelling i alternately loved and disliked eileen the main character and ended up deciding she was a deeper more caring character than i thought this is a long complex book that brings out lots of emotion and makes the reader really think about his her own relationships the commitment of marriage the meaning of love and the empathy for people caught up in a relentless disease i really recommend it and liked it hard as it is to read","329":"the story of a life from childhood to mature adult the ups the downs and how the human experience deals with the situations presented a read that takes you to another's day to day","330":"this is a lovely book i liked the family and realized that life is never the same for everyone i appreciated the guilt but also the alzheimer's experience it expresses so many human emotions that we all will experience because we happen to be human i liked eileen because she was able to cope i liked the story because we all have that great choice to love and tell those we love that we do very good book highly recommend","331":"reminded me of a franzen novel i loved the characters in this novel and the many different themes reads like an epic novel","332":"though this book was a bit redundant it was a beautifully told family story that spanned several generations i didn't know much about it when i started it so i wad surprised when the plot turned to early onset alzheimer's","333":" i liked this book pretty well overall wasn't mad about it didn't dislike it it feels like an older style of book to me the way it takes the story slow without a lot of dramatic flourishes i could feel thomas's passion for these characters in the way he digs into elaine's and connell's flaws unflinchingly i liked the ending very much i think the characters and insights will stick with me and though the book is quiet it offers insight without fanfare like a camera on a scene into the costs and desires of the upwardly mobile middle class in the latter 20th century for me it isn't a five star book because it didn't leave me burning to pick it up in every spare moment but i was glad i finished it","334":" ... when i am gone i want you to hear my voice in your head hear it when you most need to when you feel most hopeless when you feel most alone when life seems too cruel and there seems too little love in it when you feel you have failed when you don't know what the point is when you cannot go on i want you to draw strength from me then... when the world seems full of giants who dwarf you when it feels like a struggle just to keep your hear up i want you to remember there is more to live for than mere achievement it is worth something just to be a good man... 4 5 stars for we are not ourselves by matthew thomas in this 620 pages long epic story we witness how the once so happy family of eileen nurse ed college professor and their son connell struggles when unexpectedly faced with ed's alzheimer's disease at a young age eileen and ed who both moved from ireland to new york city and who worked hard all their lives to be able to give their son a better life than the one they had see their future falling apart we witness family's and friend's reactions some good most straight out filled with fear we witness the anger of ed and how powerless he feels the despair of eileen and how she does anything she can to be able to keep ed with her at home instead of a nursing home the story wonderfully describes the different stages in which the disease hits and how the characters react to it how the equilibrium within the family is being shaken over and over again and restored over and over again however sad the theme the book is written and built up in a way that keeps the whole of it not too heavy to read it does make you wonder about how we judge people and how it's easier to look to the other side when someone's in need but the enormous strength and will to live of ed and is family members make for quite light reading 620 pages worth every word of it","335":"one of the best i've read suspenseful and true","336":"this is an extremely well written and thought through novel the appeal for me lays in following eileen leary through her almost entire life and seeing patterns formed in childhood play out in her marriage and in her relationship with her son thomas includes a lot of wisdom in his novel there were sentences i marveled over and pondered the story makes you think and reflect upon your own life and what truly matters","337":"this was a beautiful and poignant story about families and dreams who are we and how do we keep our integrity and develop maintain an identity through difficult times mr thomas shows himself to be a terrific story teller i highly recommend this book","338":" am i the only one who thought it was absurd when chapter after chapter an accomplished career nurse did not figure out that there was a lot more going on with her husband's behavior than a midlife crisis regardless of the medical understanding at the time reading the events and then not having the people closest to him call out need for diagnosis was almost painful likewise it was hard to reconcile the callousness that eileen showed for her son and husband with the idea that she had so many friends to talk with and who would do anything for her","339":" i was lucky to receive a copy of we are not ourselves by matthew thomas in a goodreads and simon u0026amp shuster giveaway i was not familiar with this author or his work the book was the saga of an irish american family in new york during the second half of the 20th century it is the larger story of the pursuit of the american dream urban development and decay in the latter part of the 20th century and the dedication of teachers and nurses but also the very personal story of family relationships parents' hopes and dreams for their lives and those of their children how lives and goals can change dramatically when a devastating medical diagnosis is received it is a very realistic portrayal of the anguish and heartbreak of early onset alzheimer's disease and how it affects everyone in the family the background story of the author matthew thomas is also very interesting he was a high school english teacher at new york city's xavier high school a graduate of the university of chicago and johns hopkins who worked on this book for over ten years and received over a $1 million advance for the book","340":"extremely character driven novel long but riveting i really enjoyed this book even though the second 1 2 was morbidly depressing it really pushed thoughts of our mortality and how we deal do not deal with it finished in the span of 1 day that's how engrossing the story was","341":"i connected with many parts of the books the story told expressed true to my experiences the lost of a father from the eyes of a son","342":"a beautifully written heartfelt story","343":"i can't believe this is matthew thomas' first book it is so well written the reader is invited into the leary family with full access to their thoughts and feelings this book definitely made me question some of the ways things we should do in order to be successful the true lesson carpe diem a must read","344":"this book was nothing like the reviews that promised an epic irish american novel of the century it was overly long and quite boring the only drama came at around page 350 and it was too little too late for me don't waste your time reading this one","345":"i thought that this book was beautifully written with all the main characters perfectly fleshed out and believable despite the ordinary setting this was not a boring book i kept on reading to see what would happen even though the novel is a quiet domestic novel about one family's struggle against early onset alzheimer's on one level it is a story about one woman's efforts to live the american dream through hard work and intelligence but on another level it is a ove story i really liked the assured writing style and may read more by the author","346":"i think this may be the first book in my entire life that has made me cry a brutally honest look at a family dealing with tragedy sickness and the straddling relationships associated with them the writing was absolutely beautiful by far one of the best books i have read in a very long time","347":"really 4 5 it made me cry in the break room at work","348":"excellent book great character analysis","349":"a great experience being inside these characters thoughts slow moving but authentic experience even though i thought the end felt tacked on to the present ness i actually really liked the end it redeemed a lot of time spent in lives i didn't want to spend so much time with so three stars not for poor anything jut because it didn't hit my gut","350":"an entire life is contained within this book full of heart emotion and truths","351":"middle class ennui abounds in this beautiful written novel that spans 50 years in the life of one queens woman's life but be warned as well written as it is it's still a stone cold bummer","352":"a beautiful beautiful book characters were amazingly developed with each individual's story woven into another's i had no idea that the story would center around alzheimer's when i first started reading it i chose it simply because it seemed to be about the evolution of a family and their lives shared with another the additional layer of what impact this devastating disease had upon the family caused my heart to break and fill beyond measure","353":"i could ould not decide between 3 and 4 stars would have given it 3 5 the writing was inconsistent sometimes achingly beautiful and at other times not engaging at all my favorite part is the relationship of the father and son beautifully felt it is an honest book and has life lessons for us all","354":"i read this on a recommendation from misha castiel collins himself and i'm really glad i did spellbinding","355":" an excellent piece of literature we are not ourselves is full of brilliant writing beautiful language and extensive character development through more than one generation while the plot seemed to move slowly at times the book's other strengths made up for it as the story proceeds i found myself wanting what's best for each character shaking my head at some decisions and celebrating with them at others for much of the story it highlights the effects of alzheimer's disease on the one who is inflicted and the loved ones who surround him a worthwhile read","356":"when i started reading we are not ourselves i really liked it but then about a third of the way into it i thought i didn't but yet kept finding myself picking it up to read upon finishing i'm glad i did i found eileen hard to like she had grandiose ideas about how their life should be but yet when they obtained some of that lifestyle she wasn't happy or comfortable with it she loved ed and connell but was sometimes almost cruel to them especially connell almost too late she realized the point wasn't always to do what you want the point was to do what you did and to do it well that's at the end of chapter 90 for me that last paragraph summed up what eileen was like at the end of the day no nonsense and practical not a happy feel good book but i'm glad i finished it","357":"the book got off to a slow start and at first i found the third person narration off putting but as the novel progressed i began to understand why there needed to be some distance between the narration and the perspective of any particular character a powerful depiction of mental disintegration and painful reading especially for anyone who has experienced something like this in a friend or family member","358":" it took me a long time to finish this book the story of an irish american family in queens from mid 20th century to the present the writing was fluid and evocative but the three main characters mother and striver eileen father and scientist ed and their son connell were alien to me their life experiences their reactions to events and their interpersonal relationships were outside my own experience even the noble choices eileen makes were ones i wasn't comfortable with but as i travelled the years and the life of eileen i began to respect her and if not fully understand her at least appreciate the depth of her character and without spoiling the story when i read ed's letter to his son i felt i had been given a treasure to be savored and remembered for the rest of my life and isn't this the mark of a great book revealing the humanity in characters and binding them to you this is a book i will not soon forget","359":"if the beginning and middle had been as good as the end i may have given it 5 stars had it not been a book club read i may not have finished it so many books too little time the end resonated many truths for me and will stay with me","360":"good grief i would give this book 10 stars if i could it is by far one of the best books i've read in years if not ever just an amazingly tender beautiful gut wrenching well written touching book brought tears to my eyes on several occasions really really really beautiful both thematically and in the writing i listened to the audio version and the reader mare winningham did a fantastic job i couldn't stop listening even on the treadmill when i usually need something much jazzier than an audio book definitely a must read","361":"love to discover new writers u0026amp this 1st novel by thomas is a pleasure to read set in nyc this is the story of eileen leary coming of age striving to move up in the world it is a story of marriage u0026amp family love u0026amp regrets writing is beautiful and the story will move you","362":"this review has been hidden because it contains spoilers to view it click here super disappointed the author tries to create a modern epic about people who simply aren't that extraordinary it is a story of two second generation irish americans who meet marry and grow during the second half of the 20th century in new york this book could have been a great book at maybe half the length the wife who is the protagonist switches between moods so often and sharply it's a miracle her husband doesn't notice and think she's bi polar oh wait he can't notice because immedia super disappointed the author tries to create a modern epic about people who simply aren't that extraordinary it is a story of two second generation irish americans who meet marry and grow during the second half of the 20th century in new york this book could have been a great book at maybe half the length the wife who is the protagonist switches between moods so often and sharply it's a miracle her husband doesn't notice and think she's bi polar oh wait he can't notice because immediately upon saying i do his personality switches immediately and all the wonderful qualities we were told about him magically disappear later on we're supposed to believe that this is the first sign of his early onset alzheimer's disease but since the author is so focused on the wife we only see him as the stupefyingly two dimensional person she usually sees him as and almost hates until of course he winks or touches her shoulder and she is suddenly reminded that he is her prince charming the son is forgotten about for ridiculously long passages of time only to be reintroduced at various points of the aging process so we can see that he has learned nothing and grown even less before each new period of his life jr high high school college there is a passage that says he is going to reinvent himself nope never happens time is given to showing how by letting one of the cool kids cheat off of him he is brought into their circle for a bit during a series of prank phone calls they engage in as a group he is forced to call one of his long time nerd friends who figures out it is him perfect set up to show the consequences of this action and maybe some reflection and growth nope never happens the author is so concerned with creating this epic and jamming it full of every thought that comes to his mind he allows reality to become precarious if not disappear an old friend of the wife's is introduced late in the book a jamaican woman so we know she's spiritual who takes the wife to a faith healer she is slowly won over not because it is going to help her deal with the inevitability of her husband's disease but to give the son a chance to show one example of strength seriously that's the only logical reason that whole passage exists that or to show that the wife is as flighty as her continual mood swings indicate and she doesn't have enough money to pay for repairs on the house but she can pay $8 000 a month for the nursing home another $3 600 for a live in house keeper she no longer needs because the husband is in the home but it's nice to have a round so she can have a brief affair and pay for her son to go to college sure why not why let a few facts get in the way of a bad bloated overlong story and i mean seriously overlong after the spoiler alert husband dies the book trudges on for another 100 pages just so we can learn the son goes back to the job he had working as a doorman in manhattan and that he got fired from once before and we can meet a bunch of people in the nursing home who are probably just as confused as we are as to why any of us are still here after 550 pages more","363":"beautifully written multi generational epic that will warm and break your heart one of the best portrayals of love family and commitment that i have ever read","364":"resonant title check intricate structure check realistic characters check relevant social issue check symbolism check heart barely a flutter as a former english teacher i'm always searching for a book that checks all the great literature boxes but also elicits a powerful emotional response in the end this story just left me sad for all the characters","365":"this review has been hidden because it contains spoilers to view it click here this book could have been easily half its volume as it was so unnecessarily detailed the story picked up around part 4 of the book where i expected more details regarding what the family was facing and how they were reacting their own way the story fell flat for me as i predicted early on what's going to happen or may be i have read better books regarding alzheimer disease that this one was not what i expected","366":"not at all what i thought this book would be but it's a true love story","367":" i don't throw around words like brilliant very often but this debut novel is it i kept asking myself how does he do it this gentleman bravely chose to write in the first person a woman's life from childhood to older age she experiences everything from an alcoholic mother to a husband with early onset alzheimer's disease this was amazing in its depth and insight nothing about this book was easy material and he wrote it with such delicacy sad topics like alzheimer's can come off overwrought but not here he dealt with it with dignity and humanity the most impressive thing was his ability to be so immersed in the female mind as the main character i feel like authors spend entire careers trying to do what he accomplished in his first novel i hope he keeps writing because i will be a reader of his for many years to come","368":"this is a book which beautifully speaks to so many topics love marriage grief the fact that terminal illness has many more victims than those who are actually sick and also the way the health care system works directly against those who are sick and their families it made me laugh and it made me cry but more importantly it made me think about all of the above long after i read the last page this is a book which will be with me for a long time","369":"i loved this book thomas's writing style is just as i like intelligently sensitive very descriptive lots of words and with a talent for understanding domestic life i tend to read a lot of books about families and marriage but this one is so unique in that while full of some drama and tough situations it shows what the institution of marriage is supposed to be an idea so seemingly antiquated in comparison to the immorality and selfishness we are surrounded by today that it seems fresh vital and therapeutic i loved getting to know eileen so very well and to hear her entire detailed life story we can see the evolution of her drive her frustrated younger married self her striving on through the years as a wife mother and employee she isn't a martyr at all in my opinion just a very hardworker who was trained young by having an alcoholic in the family she had to be the rock the stable one the force who holds it together she does it all without being overbearing but also without being terribly demonstrative of love either but she and ed are so solid i love that though they don't have a sunsets and candlelight romance they have the real thing a full on forever one and only mega love affair that you can only achieve by decades together oddly or maybe not so ed's problems seem to give her the outlet for love that she needs it kind of echoed an earlier passage in the book about the satisfaction she had in bathing connell as a baby that was delicious and so easy to relate to connell and ed's relationship is really good also i don't know if i was supposed to be mad at connell for his inability to help his parents much but i wasn't i really got him and knew that that the reason why he couldn't was not apathy but the opposite love i suppose they are all 3 what you could call repressed but in the end what you really saw is their love for each other in action like john mayer says love is a verb not a big showboat on parade a great long read to get lost in for awhile","370":"an excellent book so many great insights a good story about what feels like a real family i don't want to say more and give away what happens but it is good it's long and it felt long but i was grateful that it kept going didn't want it to end","371":"don't know why i slogged through the whole book the main problem is that is is just too long and not worth the effort i never felt the characters were real thomas gave too much and not enough information at the same time the letter from ed to connell at the end listed many activities that i couldn't imagine really i kept thinking this book reminded me of an epic poem it would have been much better at 300 pages i did enjoy the spot on descriptions of lower westchester county where i grew up but that wasn't worth the effort reading the entire book","372":" solid and interesting thomas' style is very reserved and separate his storytelling calm and matter of fact good storytelling though and a heartrending but ultimately hopeful story at that i was impressed with how thomas made eileen both sympathetic and incredibly annoying and i was impressed with how he made connell both sympathetic and incredibly annoying and how by the end of the book and the end of some of their trials both had truly changed and grown in plausible ways i do wish some of that growth had come about more slowly perhaps throughout the book instead of primarily at the end but i was happy for the growth nonetheless i think that the growth that both of those characters made opening up to life to its possibilities despite genuine and ravaging tragedy was a beautiful theme as eileen notes the first time she actual tries indian food or perhaps the first time she visits the desert i can't remember \"there were places she now saw that contained more happiness than ordinary places did unless you knew that such places existed you might be content to stay where you were \" so true a worthwhile timely and lovely read though i'm not sure i'd call it a new american classic especially timely for anyone dealing with or having dealt with the indignities and awful nature of debilitating diseases like alzheimer's or even dementia sigh","373":"i probably would not have chosen this book if i'd known it was about alzheimer's disease then again it could be about any family any illness my family the pacing and banality that some criticize served to create a feeling of complacency that there is time life is long hope regret disappointment opportunity the circle of life empathy it was gut wrenching and i was moved to tears","374":"eileen and ed both grew up in dysfunctional families they meet marry and while eileen is convinced that ed is the perfect partner to help achieve her obsessive focus to live the american dream ed has different aspirations the author captures the early fractures and mounting emotional turmoil brilliantly can eileen's determination in having a child or move into a 'better' neighborhood serve as a magic potion to regenerate their lives would familial dysfunctional patterns re surface in this generation when a mental illness is formally diagnosed the impact on the lives of eileen ed and their son connell is devastating and isolating about mid way thru the book though i became restless as the story seemed to hit a plateau i tired of tedious details and became frustrated with eileen's actions and inactions but i stuck with it the story remained a slow moving read but matthew thomas's writing convincingly captures the courage determination strengths and weaknesses of his characters","375":"a large sprawling novel about an irish american family in new york a novel about an ordinary family living their lives and what the author shows us is that all lives even ones we presume are ordinary are truly extraordinary to watch the family progress thru their lives particularly after one of them is afflicted with a life altering disease is to see into the human condition this is a stunning work and very thought provoking","376":" the first half of the book introduced the main characters eileen tumulty and her irish american parents her husband ed leary and their son connell the story is told by eileen and connell the second half of the book described how this family dealt with a life changing event ed's diagnosis of alzheimer's in his 50s the author had a lot of years to cover 1951 2011 he seemed detached from his protagonists and i was never sure if i missed something in the telling because so many years would go by and some descriptions were sparse who and what was the prologue about was this a metaphor for something i didn't get it were the father and son in this fishing story supposed to be ed and connell i don't recall them fishing they bonded over baseball games i downloaded this book from susannah's audible account","377":"this book was 200 pages too long it started out great and was a nice story but the author got carried away about 3 4 through the book","378":"i'm going to have to sit with this one for awhile before permanently assigning stars because i really struggled with this book it was very slow at the beginning and i really didn't like eileen at all she frustrated me greatly things picked up at about the mid point but it was really the last quarter of the book that started to work for me in fact the last 4 chapters made the rest of the slog worthwhile i think but that eileen just not anyone i'd want to spend any more time with","379":"i didn't really do any pre reading about this novel i gave it 2 stars because it was an uncomfortable read for me the subject matter hit very close to home and i just slogged through it was also a very long read my review i am sure doesn't do this book justice i think it was too personal for me to judge objectively as a novel so don't let my review be a deciding factor in whether or not you read this novel","380":"too long but it made me cry on an airplane","381":"this was depressing but a good story great insights into living with alzheimer's and losing a spouse and father maybe hit too close to home for me right now but it was a good book and brought up thoughts and emotions i haven't been able to express","382":"this book was long but i really really loved it it was raw and emotional and very real stick with the story it spans decades generations and was worth every minute almost gave it five stars goodreads needs to add the half star ratings","383":" growing up in queens in the 1940's eileen tumulty dreams of a way out of her rough and tumble neighborhood the tiny apartment where she grows up with her irish immigrant parents veers from a mood of celebration if the right amount of alcohol is present to bleakness when it's just the family no guests and no alcohol eileen dreams the big dreams and when she meets ed leary a scientist who is beyond those boys she lives with in the neighborhood she falls hard and begins to dream of life with ed opening bigger and better doors ed and she marry they welcome a son connell but their life continues to do the same day after day eileen tries so hard to get ed onto the same stage where she's playing socialite and it never happens in fact he withdraws more and more and the marriage starts to tilt the family tries to hold it together but one or more curveballs that no one sees coming may tilt that world over for good you cheer for eileen to rise above her humble life but somehow due to the realistic vibe of thomas' writing you know it's just not meant to be their lives unfurl and the family attempts to hold it together superbly written true to life characters and one long novel there are parts of this book whole chapters that seem to lag and really play not much of a part and that's why only four stars but still one excellent rendering of the american dream not becoming a reality i can see why this book sparked a bidding war across the ocean it's completely worth the battle","384":"started slow but i'm glad i stuck with it very emotional through the last half of the book i'm so in love with eileen and ed that i feel like i know them personally eloquently written beautifully composed a good read all around","385":"i felt like i was living as part of this family while reading the book it is a book more rich with characters and mood than with plot and events the characters were so well developed and endearing in their own ways it has been a long time since i've cried reading a book and i cried a whole lot when this one ended one of my favourites","386":"an intensely detailed and beautifully written portrait of a family i won't go so far as some other reviewers to say a new contender for the elusive great american novel but definitely a powerful new voice in matthew thomas some flaws pacing was sometimes grueling but there's a lot to latch on to here and even more to love","387":"i was excited to win this book from a simon u0026amp schuster giveaway on goodreads there are some beautifully written sentences and paragraphs in this book but because of its length and how unlikeable i found the characters at times i give it 3 stars","388":"one of the most moving experiences i've had with a novel in a very long time it moves a bit slowly through the first quarter of the book but please don't give up it's worth the time it takes to get to know the humanity behind these extraordinary ordinary people","389":"loved it the characters are written realistically and trigger deep emotion without being overly dramatic or clocking you over the head with what you should feel the story pulls you in and anyone who has experienced or is experiencing events similar or remotely similar to this family's events will feel it in their chest","390":"this book moves really slowly and i had a very difficult time making it through","391":" i'm not sure whether to rate this 3 or 4 stars by the end i'd give it 4 but for much of the book just 3 very well written and interesting but it often felt like a chore to read it maybe because that's how the characters seemed to view their lives a lot of the time but i did enjoy it and think it's a worthwhile story to tell a family dealing with disease don't want to give too much away tho' it became obvious to me what was going before it did to the characters probably on purpose characters are very distinct with strong voices but at times i felt i was missing something about them like we get told late in the story about how beautiful the mother eileen is and i hadn't pictured her that way at all the book covers a great deal of time and the sense of place and time are very clear and specific the characters are not particularly likable but i did come to care about or at least understand them by the end i'll give it 4 with the caveat that it's not really for everyone and can be a bit of a slog sometimes","392":"beautifully paced narrative complex characters so well developed they feel like real people you've come to know and understand it's easy to get lost in this story and forget this is a fictional piece of literature i look forward to reading more from this extremely talented author","393":" oh eileen come on yes it had to be done i'm hard pressed to find a more full bodied heroine from the books i've read so far this year eileen is quite thoroughly herself but never more so than when she tries to be someone else she has a case of keeping up with the joneses that almost ruins her family but is also possessed of a stunning capacity to love it's interesting to me that the character i liked the least was the son but he did get better with age thomas is a careful storyteller really getting you inside of the characters hearts and heads in a way that makes you feel as much an observer as a part of it a bravura effort from a super talent","394":" yikes just not feeling this one either i was so hopeful too a story about the daughter of irish immigrants sounded like it was right up my alley but i'm just having trouble caring about eileen and her supporting characters seriously i just had to rack my brain for a second for the main character's name my other beef with it she reached her 50's in about 130 pages and there are still about 500 pages left it was a rapid aging where i didn't feel any connection with her it's unfortunate but like a tale for the time being maybe i'll try it again another time","395":" it took me a couple of chapters to decide whether or not i was going to be able to connect to eileen tumulty whose life is chronicled in this worthwhile novel but then while i was still trying to decide i found myself unwilling to put the book down like any terrifically crafted character eileen sometimes makes choices that make me wag my finger at her and sometimes rises to challenges in ways that make me shake my head in wonder at her strengths a tale of immense sadness and admirable overcoming read this wonderful novel it's full of moments that will fill your heart and and give you pause and you'll be glad you did","396":"3 5 stars beautifully written thoroughly honest incredible character development but slow very slow at times","397":"i won this through a goodreads giveaway if it had been a library book i likely would've stopped reading it i didn't find any of the characters likable and the plot was mundane i'd rate it 2 5 stars the writing was fairly decent","398":"this review has been hidden because it contains spoilers to view it click here i liked it well enough in the beginning what with the detailed descriptions of literally every neighborhood i have lived more than 5 years in u0026amp the baseball u0026amp the irishness but the drawn out discovery of the alzheimer's became a little tedious u0026amp uncomfortable after a while u0026amp i sort of more than skimmed the last third bc the alzheimer's stuff made me so sad but the letter he writes his son heart wrenching too long u0026amp drawn out but still affecting","399":"bleak and maybe a bit longer than it needed to be...good though","400":"maybe more like 4 5 stars but i am giving it a 5 because i found it really hard to put down that to me always means i like the book","401":"this is a beautifully written book about the lives of three people it is very long and quite sad the newspaper reviews are glowing and i agree with them many of them reveal that the man has early onset alzheimer's disease and the author's description of that is devastating because he writes so well","402":"liked it so much mostly because of all the bronxville mentions","403":"this came thankfully recommended and i can't be objective about it because it resonated in every single way right down to a certain coffee shop high school hospital and mother named eileen","404":"absolutely loved this book i think i may suggest this one for my book group to read","405":"i would give this book 3 5 stars i enjoyed the arcing storyline at times the story was raw and heartbreaking and others i wished it would move along faster the theme of the american dream and how we define happiness was well explored throughout the book","406":"i rated this a two because it was just way too long i don't mind a long book if there is a lot of action but this book had none i started skimming around 150 and gave up around 300 it wasn't a terrible book just needed to be like 300 pages shorter","407":"a slow sad book about the death of one's dreams as they are swallowed by the chasm of real life i obviously loved it set in queens as well","408":"this is a book about people and oh what people living breathing on the page we hear about their hopes and dreams their successes and failures their faults and failings sometimes the simplest stories when we'll told are the best the story here is simple and the most interesting things about the book are the characters who populate it the writing is never over blown but in its simplicity it reaches out to the reader and draws them in the characters are so human that it's impossible not to feel for them as they struggle to deal with what life throws at them i really enjoyed the book more than i expected to it really resonated with me","409":"reading this 700 page book was quite a project but i'm glad i hung in because it got better and better would be a great reading group book but for some the length would be problematical i would enjoy discussing it because it is totally character driven and there are so many inconsistencies and contradictions in the thinking and behavior of this family lots to talk about","410":"after 140 pages i gave up nothing was holding my attention","411":"although i did grow a bit impatient with this book off and on i am surprised upon finishing it at how much it continues to resonate in my mind and here we are one day away from saint patrick's day and i finish a 600 page book presenting an exhausting yet touching portrait of an irish american family in new york city matthew thomas is easy and satisfying to read and the chapters flow along in spite of being disconnected frequently at first you think it is the story primarily of eileen but the other two major characters the men in her life slowly creep in to occupy full spaces for themselves her husband ed leary and at what moment do you feel the signs of his early onset alzheimer's is obvious and their only child connell we experience all three of these lives quite fully eileen who became a nurse yearning for a better life she only vaguely understands the impetus towards and which she only partially achieves and whose fears are constantly undermining her ability to enjoy the here and now ed the intellectual the quintessential absent minded beloved professor who resists any move towards advancement and whose decline is laid out in clear and difficult to read through details connell trying to navigate a life interrupted by the inevitable this is also the american dream destroyed by the realities of a protracted disease in a culture that will take away everything because of the realities of the health system early on eileen has already summed up the future the real world was so messy the light imperfect the paint chipped the happiness only partial and yet love binds as it abounds it sees you through towards the end connell reads a letter written for him by his father years before he died and that will bring you to tears years will pass in an instant i will be gone will you remember me on the sidelines cheering for you i will not always be here but i leave you with a piece of my heart you have had the lion's share as long as you have lived","412":"it was long which could be good but wasn't there was no continuity one small chapter led to another one the characters emerged in starts and stops it would sound like for years she was alone and then suddenly expect you to believe she had this full social life the husband would be awful but you were supposed to believe her enduring love it didn't flow it wasn't believable the characters from chapter to chapter didn't connect too many superlatives too danielle steelish destined to become a classic should not be on the book jacket","413":"it took me a good 300 pages before i really got into this it's by no stretch a bad book not at all it's spectacularly written it's so painfully honest and raw which is fantastic to find and it's very much like reading about someone's family history but it doesn't often taken me that long to get into a book and it was very difficult to make myself keep reading i only started to get into this near the end it did make me cry it made me laugh at parts but it was a very heavy going book a good read but not necessarily something i'd set out to read unless you've got a lot of free time","414":"i have an incredible amount of admiration for the author matthew thomas he wrote and got published a 600 page novel but unfortunately i cannot recommend this book i don't feel i got the point of it until the very last eight page chapter it spent too much time on small details that didn't matter the protagonists didn't really come fully to life and to the degree that they did their lives didn't matter to me too long too much but congratulations to mr thomas nonetheless","415":"originally posted on the book musingseileen tumulty did not have an easy life growing up she was raised in the 1940s by working class irish immigrant parents in most cases eileen had to take care of her parents but eileen was adamant on making a better life for herself she met ed leary a scientist and was convinced that with his station in life she found the perfect partner with whom she can live her american dream ed leary is an intelligent man but eileen soon realizes that ed does not share the same aspirations as she does he gets various opportunities for better jobs yet he turns them down each and every time as he chose to rather spend his time on research and working as a college professor eileen continues to pursue better opportunities for herself her husband and her son connell when eileen decides to move out of her neighborhood ed was adamant that he does not want to move soon eileen noticed a change in ed he was easily confused very adamant about his routine and resistance to change and an overall increase in his stubborn personality it soon transpired that this change in ed could be attributed to an illness a psychological disorder that would soon change their family life dramatically we are not ourselves is a story about family that are very character driven eileen was a flawed character in so many ways she was very particular about the way she wanted to live her life but she was also very judgmental and intolerable against other cultures and people it was one of the main reasons why she wanted to move to a better neighborhood that is one aspect of her personality that really made me not like her that much her relationship with her parents also had an impact on her relationship with her son connell she was hard on him at times and constantly tried to push him into a direction that sometimes seemed he didn't want connell's story plays a large role in the novel too but mostly ed's story is being toldfrom eileen and connell's experiences his and his family's struggle with his illness are described in heartbreaking detail although ed's illness and the way it changes the family dynamics is the main story in we are not ourselves his story from his own perspective are never addressed in the novel even though that would have been an added bonus we are not ourselves still remains an emotional read and beautifully written novel this lengthy novel is slow moving at times but the overall story is worth the read i'd recommend it to anyone who enjoys family sagas and especially if you enjoyed elizabeth is missing","416":"wow stunned at what an amazing book this is can't believe it is a first novel deeply moving","417":" i hardly know what to say about this book matthew thomas is clearly an extremely gifted author because i didn't like one single character in this novel i really couldn't stand a few and yet and yet he got me to keep turning pages through this tome of a novel until i reached the last one his writing is extraordinary and he gets you to step into the lives of this family and live along with them even as you want to resist the main character eileen is like that totally abrupt unlikable woman you know we all know one this book is like being inside her head all day not exactly where you want to be but you just can't help yourself now that's good writing","418":"heartbreaking story some beautiful writing but there were also sections that seemed as if the author was just filling in details to get to the next scene and characters subplots that could have been scrapped or trimmed way down without losing anything relevant to the main plot e g bethany and the new age group connell's rebellious behavior eileen's house hunting this was very ambitious for a debut novel and i expect the next novel from thomas will be much more tightly constructed","419":"this book gave me anxiety all the possible wrong choices one can make that will decide the course for the trajectory of your life were exhausting i suppose i should have given it 5 stars for all the real angst it caused me as i suppose that means he's a great writer but i'm just glad i finished it without self medicating","420":"kind of hated this book don't love people bumbling through life","421":"this review has been hidden because it contains spoilers to view it click here i'd give this a 3 5 if possible i liked it a lot but it was so sad i didn't enjoy it especially in the end this is exactly the length of book that i enjoy and i think the ordinary story of a regular family was beautiful in its own way it was just a little boring and got long around halfway through the book you find out that ed has early onset alzheimers and it is heartbreaking to watch him die i think it is a real reality for a lot of families and i'm terrified that it will happen to me or i'd give this a 3 5 if possible i liked it a lot but it was so sad i didn't enjoy it especially in the end this is exactly the length of book that i enjoy and i think the ordinary story of a regular family was beautiful in its own way it was just a little boring and got long around halfway through the book you find out that ed has early onset alzheimers and it is heartbreaking to watch him die i think it is a real reality for a lot of families and i'm terrified that it will happen to me or someone i love i think it would be very difficult for some reason i didn't enjoy this book as much as still alice which addressed the same topic more","422":"not an easy book to read i thought it was going to be more about the irish immigrant experience but it was really more the story of a family and their struggles i am not sure why it was on so many must read lists","423":"any review wouldn't do this book justice it is in some ways a typical multigenerational saga of three generations of an irish american family from queens and brooklyn by marriage with the usual family dysfunctions fueled by alcoholism and lace curtain ambitions that those novels always have but this novel changes midway when the 2nd generation eileen's husband falls ill the remainder of the novel is how eileen and her son connell as well as husband ed deal with his fatal illness it's so very painful to read on one level but the author manages to balance that with the depiction of complex characters i couldn't stop reading there are flaws at times the author rushes through the years just giving us snippets sketches of scenes which distanced me from the characters too much for example but the flaws didn't stop me from reading","424":"well written finely drawn characters and a subject that holds special meaning for me all added up to an almost great novel the author should have quit while he was ahead the ending felt like an afterthought a misguided attempt to tie a pretty bow around a broken gift and pretend it's fine it felt like a response to an editor's admonition you need a more hopeful ending sometimes life is tragic let it be","425":"honest yet heartbreaking read i didn't like any of the characters very well written","426":"i did not fall for the leary family i wish i could get behind eileen in the first 500 pages sadly did not happen until the final 100 as with the goldfinch the editing fell down in my opinion","427":" i wish i could give this book more stars matthew thomas weaves a story of eileen tumulty from childhood through middle age and brings along characters who play a major role in shaping her life eileen yearns for a better life for herself after she is married she sets certain benchmarks for what constitutes success the right career for her husband a home in a good neighborhood the right school for her son she never quite gets all that she yearns for and as the tragedy of her husband's situation unfolds her yearnings begin to change to reflect a new normal mr thomas has created living characters in eileen her parents her husband and her son his prose is absolutely gorgeous the story is real and the reader is drawn into the characters' lives i absolutely loved the ending of this powerful and moving story it was perfect this is a must read","428":"i read at least a book a week so after a month of struggling to reach the half way point on this one i gave up i really wanted to like this book the writing was good but the story was loooong slowmoving and quite frankly boring my 3 stars seems generous but the novel is well written","429":" the only book assigned to me in high school that i didn't finish reading was samuel richardson's pamela i made it far enough to write a term essay and also to know i didn't need to finish reading it to be fair pamela was published as a serial and richardson probably wanted to finish the thing eons before he did but popularity being popularity the guy couldn't say 'no' to churning out another excruciating letter i may not be in school anymore but the guilt i feel in not finishing a book remains a combination of panic that i'll be found out and a sort of bafflement that this terrible book had been assigned in the first place sure no one \"assigned\" matthew thomas' we are not ourselves but they may as well have the book reviews proclaimed its excellence and compared it with the genius of franzen and this is why you shouldn't bother with book reviews as i committed another day's worth of reading to this interminable and ponderous novel i kept reminding myself how well it was received elsewhere kept urging myself to find in the insufferable level of detail something akin to beauty or marvel kept assuring myself that this book had been awarded prizes and so had to be of some quality the fault was mine i thought for being an impatient reader well no more 250 pages into an infinite waste of time i stopped i'd figured out where the plot was going to give it it's airing an irish american family lives its life the mother wants a bigger house the father has early onset alzheimer's and the son is an undefined ill described mess of wanting to hit someone and i didn't care enough to force myself through the purchase of the overly expensive house the unravelling of the alzheimer's mind and the one can only assume eventual character development of the son it's very possible i'm wrong that in my impatience for excruciating detail and an absence of conflict i've missed a gem of a novel that said i'd in no way encourage you to read this one but then this is a book review and you've already stopped reading it","430":"i found this one really interesting and it will stay with me but i did not like the characters at all and that held me back from liking it more still it would get at least another half star","431":"very well written but subject matter is quite depressing characters are well drawn and painfully realistic with as much or more dysfunction than the average family","432":"s l o w can't made i finally made it through the 600 pgs","433":"200 pages too long and yet wanted more heartbreak and mediation on grief","434":"beautifully written slow moving authentic and full of many thoughtful questions i didn't give it a 5 star because i think it could have been edited down in some parts there are readers who will find it too slow but i loved all the details raw feelings struggles and confusion","435":" thanks to netgalley and simon and schuster for this arc 3 5 if i could give half stars there are no perfect people in this book i liked them one minute and didn't like them the next and then liked them again that's pretty much how i felt about the book overall because for me it's really a character driven story rather than one that is driven by the plot a lot of ground is covered here the early part of the book is actually my favorite part even though there are heartbreaking moments with 8 year old eileen dealing with the problems of her irish immigrant parents her mother is an alcoholic and her father though well respected in the community is a gambler at times this part of the story reminded me a little of the quiet beautiful writing of alice mcdermott given her tough childhood it makes perfect sense that eileen wants bigger and better things in life - a bigger house a more prestigious neighborhood - what she sees as a better life and you can't fault her for those desires she marries ed a scientist and professor and believes that together they will acquire the house and the better life that she envisions shortly after their marriage eileen becomes disillusioned with her marriage as it becomes clear that she and ed no matter how much they love each other do not want the same thing my least favorite part of the book was the pages and pages of eileen whining and plotting about how to get that better house this is about more than just a house though it's about ordinary people trying to live their day to day lives with their dreams aspirations and daily burdens ultimately it's about these characters eileen ed and their son connell finding out who their real selves are in the face of devastating illness that changed everything in this family this is a great debut for matthew thomas and i look forward to what he will write in the future","436":"another epic novel about life beautifully written did not want book to end so true to life","437":"so good so good so good thank you misha collins for the book rec i don't read a lot of literary fiction these days so i might not have found this one on my own i am so glad i didn't miss it","438":"the core of this multi generational story could be good if it wasn't lost in the minutiae that makes it seem never ending","439":" 4 stars there were times during my almost 21 hours of listening where i thought this was going to be a 3 star book and not worth the time commitment however the ending was very satisfying and although i finished it a couple of days ago the leary's are still in my head particularly ed and that accounts for my feeling that we are not ourselves is worth the 4 stars mare winningham gives a 5 star performance truly great particularly in her portrayal of eileen the book summary does not reveal what the book is really about and i won't either suffice to say i've read quite a bit on this topic and it was well done here my only complaint is with eileen a nurse for crying out loud being so obtuse matthew thomas has a beautiful way with words","440":" for the second time this year unplanned and unaware i have ended up experiencing multiple books movies media on the same subject i had no idea what the subject of this book was just that my friends were reading it and recommending it and that's enough for me imagine the impact of watching still alice in the theater the night julianne moore won the academy award well deserved and finishing this book the next day devastating it has taken me a few days to even think of what to write this is a wonderfully written compelling story of one woman from childhood to late middle age i did not want to stop reading about her life though i was very glad not to be living it excellent and don't forget that other word devastating if you're curious the other item that goes along with this trio is elizabeth is missing","441":"stunning and infuriating beautiful and heartbreaking a real and honest story of illness family growing up and growing old and the bonds we make along the way i feel a sense of loss now that i'm done real loss","442":"while i was in the middle of reading this book i stopped to read some reviews by others because i was confounded by it it had gotten such good reviews that i was really looking forward to reading it it was very good in some ways well written and interesting story and yet it had this distant and stilted quality it was a long book and i'm surprised that i stuck with it but i guess i'm glad i did the story of the arc of the life of an irish immigrant girl from her childhood through her adulthood marriage parenthood i'm still puzzled by it's excellent reviews","443":"i was torn on a 4 or 5 for this book it is definitely not for everyone very dark but somehow i could not put it down i think this will be one i will actually remember and that alone is enough given how many books i read thought provoking but very sad","444":" raw emotion that is what i felt reading we are not ourselves this debut work is about a family...not the wider world or the major events of the more than six decades it covers just a family not even an extraordinary family just a typical american family with so many dreams and aspirations some of which will be accomplished but many more will be rationalized or compromised away this book will leave you thinking deeply about your own life your family and your place in the world stunning beautiful prose and the characters were so vibrant i loved it","445":" i very much enjoyed reading about the immigrant experience and the struggles they faced when they came to america not only the financial but the social struggles as well this book reminds of us what is it to strive for the american dream and realize what we may give up in the process it is a also a story of when a family's dreams become sidelined by a devastating illness and the courage it takes to live each day the author matthew thomas wove his alma mater regis high school into the storyline the rigorous admittance procedures the student tunnel entrance including the stressful lincoln douglas prep as a member of the debate team for a tournament against stuyvesant hs i enjoyed these passages very much as my own son attended this fine school some of the narrative may have benefited from a bit more editing but i believe the well developed characters and their journey make it a worthwhile read","446":"i loved this book with my whole heart when i finished it i immediately sent a fan letter to the author anything i try to say in this review won't be adequate to express how excellent this book is i'm a therapist and there's something about the way the author gives us a look into the lives of ordinary people their struggles and triumphs big and small that came across as so real and true maybe it's enough to say that from now on i will read anything matthew thomas writes i'm hoping he has ten more books like this one in a drawer somewhere","447":"a stunning examination of life as a first generation american thomas captures the hardships joys and little idiosyncrasies of the life of an irish american woman trying to support her family anyway she can","448":"it is long 600 pages and slow going sometimes it is character not plot driven but it is beautiful and honest and frustrating and rewarding","449":"a great book that captures the feel of a life in the last half of the 20th century and the dislocations of the 21st written in a fluid and vivid manner it's a hard book to put down","450":"we are not ourselves in a quiet brutal and honest look at life love family and loyalty this book is character driven not action driven the first half drug on for me but once i reached the halfway point i could not stop listening the family's battle for connection and understanding in itself is at times heartbreaking and other times heartwarming this novel is a wonderful surprise to me as i had no expectations going into it","451":" it's hard to review this book there's a lot to like and a lot i didn't like for one thing it is way too long and the longest part is also the most depressing and boring a lot like life but then i don't need to read a book like it maybe i'm too close to the situation having a number of relatives with alzheimer's it's a family's story how they are affected by alzheimer's and how they get through it but it could be anyone's story and truthfully i didn't find it that interesting it is beautifully written some parts interesting and uplifting and it did keep my interest enough that i slogged through the boring parts and finished it not exactly a stellar review not sure i would recommend this either","452":"this book was haunting to me i really liked the art of fielding so i knew i wanted to read another by thomas but it was a little close to home at times but a powerful story","453":"this book was not what i had expected it span several generations of an immigrant irish family and i was quite surprised by the turn of events half way through the book","454":" i wish it was possible to give a 3 5 i almost stopped reading this book multiple times but i kept going it occurred to me that many newer novels don't seem to have a plot where's the tension that keeps the reader reading maybe that's why i've been reading mysteries that basic desire for a story that compels one to read just one more chapter in a dream a friend told me that many modern novels are about the cups and saucers of every day life and this book is exactly that in the end of this story those cups and saucers are in fact deeply meaningful i'm glad i kept reading","455":"it felt like the author gave up on the protagonist's history halfway through the book for such a difficult life it would have made sense for her to bring her childhood into the troubles she faced later on","456":" this book is a thoughtful examination of the most basic components of our relationships with our families it takes place over several lifetimes and in sufficient detail to draw the right reader in the writing voice is conversational and easily recognizable i'm lucky to have lived in ny metro for more than thirty years now as many of the characters idiosyncrasies are exactly as i have observed them myself many of the places are places i know and the author has done himself proud with the knack of picking exactly the right detail element to settle the reader right into the heart of the character it does take a long time to tell this story properly i read this in hard cover and immediately remarked to my wife as to how thin the chosen paper stock was now having closed the back cover i can offer my heartfelt thanks to the publisher for the weight savings that decision made possible readers who enjoy carrying a heavy tome about for days in hand as well as heart can add a star to my review if printed on normal stock it would need a hand truck closing that back cover i can also say that this is an important emotional book it deals with one of the most terrifying maladies in existence it puts a remarkably memorable face on love and expectations i sincerely hope i will never forget it","457":"easily one of my fav reads of the year so far well written","458":"such a good read the characters and their lives and relationships are going to stick with me for a while","459":"this is a powerful and moving book that will appeal to readers of both popular and literary fiction it's a sweeping multi generational family saga with a plot that makes you want to keep turning the pages at the same time thomas addresses some big thought provoking topics why we want more than we have the nature of our responsibilities to others and what it truly means to love someone for better or for worse despite some flaws such as an overly long exposition in the beginning of the novel the book packs a devastating and emotional punch i would rate the novel about a 3 75 out of 5 you can read my full review here http leilarice blogspot com 2014 08 i received a pre release copy of this book from the publisher simon u0026amp schuster through netgalley in exchange for an honest review","460":"it took me more than five weeks to read this 600 page book i wondered why i kept reading but i did it did capture me this is a true american novel the american dream from the perspective of a highly intelligent and hard working women the female voice is not quite right and this is the book's major flaw the love story that lies underneath the main narrative is also hard to believe sometimes but does a book need credibility to be good it was hyped and it was not worth the hype but it is still a good read for those who love and appreciate literature","461":"i'm a sucker for multigenerational family epics and this absolutely fit the bill more than that though every character in this book was beautifully drawn and completely real as long as you're ok with possibly crying at the end of a book i highly recommend this one","462":" if i had to review this book for publication the review's title might be 'mindfulness' for real finally a post modern novel that's not post modern and free of cliches to boot this is not an easy book to read - but it's for good reason because this is a book about unfiltered life it's about the fact we live lives with no rational plots no happy endings and that working hard doesn't necessarily - and most often doesn't - yield the expected returns it's about harsh relationships love unspoken - but above all it's about the dangers of looking forward or back of hanging onto history or constantly obsessing about the photogenic future you always envisioned your hard work would bring but never did it's about finally learning to rest with the fact that life brings what it will and that it's the way you handle what you're allotted in the moment that counts it's about being present - but in a way that makes sense for those of us who don't have the luxury to go to yoga who want to gag when we hear jon kabat zinn or the benefits of \"mindfulness\" proclaimed in a culture where cliche reigns and obscures the truth which were once at those cliches' core this is a book about never taking anything for granted about how the best good comes in small gestures about the circle of life and the universe and how small we are in it grains of sand it's quite beautiful the first novel i've been able to finish in more than a year we should all be grateful matthew thomas has entered the lit verse","463":"i have mixed feelings about this book it's well written and a good story but felt just way too long to me at times it was hard for me to stay engaged","464":" quiet tension builds from the beginning of we are not ourselves matthew thomas' ambitious debut novel is told primarily from the perspective of eileen tumulty a woman who aspires to a better life for herself than of her parents irish immigrants who have settled in the blue collar enclave of woodside queens as eileen strives for upward mobility she simmers with the slow rage of a woman for whom envy and insecurity are as constant as a powerful work ethic and family loyalty eileen fixates on moving to bronxville a posh suburb in new york's westchester county she begins to obsess with this idea even before the section of queens to which she and her husband ed leary move becomes less manicured as it grows more diverse the novel covers a sweep of fifty odd years in the first half i often felt as if i were seeing characters from a distant remove coolly reported with more \"tell\" than \"show\" than i prefer we're told for example that eileen is deeply in love with ed but i wasn't convinced midway through the novel when ed leary succumbs to a catastrophic illness which the reader diagnoses long before eileen the narrative turns in a far more tender and fully realized direction and the book evolves into a love story nonetheless don't expect prose as rich as many of this novel's accolades suggest though i wouldn't call a 606 page book \"lean \" much of thomas's writing is plainspoken then you stumble across a passage like \"her radiance was like a recessive gene come to life after generations of hibernation in the bloodline \" knowing the author was capable of such a sentence i wished there were more of the same an engrossing family saga with memorable characters believable details insightful passages and a poignant father son letter you should not miss","465":"exquisitely written family epic perhaps my favorite book of 2014","466":"i started this book yesterday unaware that mathew thomas would capture my undivided attention i read the first page and the story unfolded from the ink on the paper by the end of the first chapter the fiction book is as real to me as the ground below in other words this is an epically deep book","467":"lovely prose didn't warm to the characters but was hooked by the story pretty long book 600 pages","468":" the first part of the book is a bit slow but after that i couldn't put it down a family saga with fully developed characters who are so completely real i found myself not liking some of their behavior anyone who's family has been impacted by alzheimer's disease will appreciate the starkly realistic portrait of the disease and the more universal theme of how serious illness can leave a profound mark on family relationships the writing especially in the last two thirds of the book is well done a very good first novel","469":" this book was exhausting i should have known by the title that it was about alzheimer's i almost don't want to call this a spoiler because either you want to read about this disease or you don't every scene was so beautifully written and so descriptive i totally understood the characters and why they did what they did but it was a long book and a long slow fail for the husband i really wanted more of how her life would evolve after being the caretaker for so many years complicated and sad but very well written","470":"i might not have picked this book but i'm glad my book club made me read it the family saga was very gripping and kept me turning pages until the end it was not all fun or satisfying as the father's illness alzheimer's and decline was difficult to read about but the way the author described the emotions and inner turmoil of each character was very skillful and realistic it always amazes me when a male author can so effectively inhabit his female protagonist's mind and this one does i recommend the book with reservations those who have been through the experience of having a loved one succumb to the ravages of alzheimer's might find the book difficult to read","471":"i really enjoyed thomas' book his story of a family told from the perspective of the limited number of characters is in depth moving and straight from the heart we fell their thoughts worries concerns pleasures as they occur the tale is very long and covers a lifetime but it never drags it's very well written and felt","472":"read this book for a book discussion though not finished at the time we met i continued reading to the end quite a journey the details of eileen and connell through their life with ed are long and tedious sometimes but really immerse you in their characters like them or not","473":"tried twice to read this and read over 200 pages just could not go on nothing to like about the characters and i wanted to scream at eileen and ed multiple times done too many other good books out there to read or re read","474":"this book i wanted to like it it is very long but that usually does not bother me the main character eileen i wanted to smack what a superficial status conscious shrew the woman is a nurse but it never clicked with her that her husband had some serious mental health issues the depiction of alzheimers is heartbreaking i skimmed over some chapters just too much unnecessary verbage stuck with it to the end phew","475":"dry not enough character development too much time leading up to diagnosis eileen's motivation was not believable ambition and guilt drove her not love","476":"this book started out very promising good writing interesting characters and story but eventually i lost interest as it became tedious and the main character grew into an adult i didn't much like i'm putting it aside","477":" arc through netgalley thank you netgalley first i should say this is a very long read some parts of this story held my interest while others left me indifferent it is often written in the third person as such this story is mostly told rather than felt it begins in the 1950's childhood of our main character eileen coming from a painful irish immigrant background eileen wants more out of life if fact this is the main theme of the story she is always looking for greener pastures cares only what others may think of her and believes having more is what life is about this is the american dream which carries itself throughout this book eileen chooses a husband who is refined and sentimental in doing so she soon realizes that he miserly and content with his life as it is while something is happening to her husband at a much deeper level there is no attempt to understand only a deeper drive for more eileen has trouble conceiving and even suffers a miscarriage all the while being indignant and jealous of friends who can when she finally conceives later in life it is all about being the perfect family the child himself grows up indifferent and as such is reluctant to help even when he is desperately needed while i understand the need to better oneself i believe this comes from the inside not the outside i found this book interesting in what one believes is success especially starting out with so little but i mostly found it sad that in so doing nothing matters but the material","478":"this is one of those books that is a really good book but made me uncomfortable to read because of how much i hated the characters at times in the end i was glad i slogged through but the middle especially was tough to stay interested enough in the story","479":"really well written book and such complex characters but i didn't love it because there was so little joy or levity in the book possibly none too much of a downer for me","480":"i initially loved this book but then i began not to like the main character as the book went on and on her actions and feelings seemed out of line with who i thought she was i became frustrated with her for such a long and well written book i still don't feel as if i really understand her or her family","481":"seemed way too long and went down an unexpected path i liked the first couple chapters and then it was not so fun","482":"not greatthe second half was much better than the first the first half could have been left off or maybe used to let the reader get to know the characters better especially ed before he got sick as it was it seemed like just skimming the surface of their lives also i couldn't stand the character of eileen she was clueless snobby racist and materialistic","483":"parts of the book were well done but honestly it was just too long i don't mind misery in a novel but these characters had no real redeeming qualities i stuck with it to the end but i have to admit i skipped quite a few pages","484":"eileen and ed both grew up in dysfunctional families they meet marry and while eileen is convinced that ed is the perfect partner to help achieve her obsessive focus to live the american dream ed has different aspirations the author captures the early fractures and mounting emotional turmoil brilliantly can eileen's determination in having a child or move into a 'better' neighborhood serve as a magic potion to regenerate their lives would familial dysfunctional patterns re surface in this generation when a mental illness is formally diagnosed the impact on the lives of eileen ed and their son connell is devastating and isolating about mid way thru the book though i became restless as the story seemed to hit a plateau i tired of tedious details and became frustrated with eileen's actions and inactions but i stuck with it the story remained a slow moving read but matthew thomas's writing convincingly captures the courage determination strengths and weaknesses of his characters","485":"poor eileen she wanted so much and tried so hard only to be thwarted at every turn it seems i felt i understood eileen even if i didn't always like her she had spent her life adjusting hopes downward is a quote from the book that pretty much sums it up 3 1 2 stars","486":"this review has been hidden because it contains spoilers to view it click here so i didn't actually get to the end but after 81% of the novel i just didn't care how it was going to end eileen drove me nuts with her superficiality and her slowness to act on her husband's bizarre behavior that was clearly indicative of health problems she was a head nurse for crying out loud my heart broke for ed who gave me some insight into what early onset alzheimer's can do to a person connell was just a terrible person way longer than it needed to be","487":"i absolutely loved this book even though it was painful to read in spots my dad didn't die of alzheimer's but something similar and reading the last half of the book was extremely painful for me to read as it hit really close to home it is a beautifully written book one that cannot get out of my head no matter how hard i try if you have time to read a lovely book on life marriage and parenthood this one i would recommend it is not a beach read by any means but it is an excellent reading","488":"this book is so good it's just about a family and their lives but it is very real and touching recommended unless you need a lot of conflict and action","489":"boring","490":" 3 5 stars worth the length just for the letter that ed wrote near the end this book calls to mind two sayings the first from thoreau who said roughly that most men lead lives of quiet desperation and the second life is what happens while you're making other plans the plot of this is not an easy read ed and eileen and connell struggle a lot and there are so many times i wanted to shout at eileen but i had the benefit of being an outsider to her life i kept reminding myself that lots of people are probably like her hoping for a change in circumstances for life to really start for the next thing to bring it all together and as soon as you get it want the next thing the only drawback is that i figured out what was wrong with ed loooooooooonnnnng before it was revealed it was like page 150 when i had the thought and it was well past page 300 when it was finally revealed i found it hard to believe that the family hadn't figured it out it was so very obvious to me even after the reveal connell and eileen don't look back and think oh should have known they are shocked having lived through the illness and slow decline of a family member i can attest that the disappearance of friends was all too accurate the writing is absolutely fantastic and i think what kept me going through what is admittedly not an easy life","491":"this is a lovely poignant story of love expectations and loss it has left me thinking in the best way possible","492":"this review has been hidden because it contains spoilers to view it click here i am so grateful to finally be done with this book which seemed to never end perhaps i am not a sophisticated or discerning reader but i don't understand all the hype about this book it did pick up towards the end but overall i was in danger of filing this in the gave up did not finish pile for a good 80% of the time if the author was trying to write a book about how everyday people deal with the challenges of life he has succeeded his portrayal of ed's descent into dementia is reali i am so grateful to finally be done with this book which seemed to never end perhaps i am not a sophisticated or discerning reader but i don't understand all the hype about this book it did pick up towards the end but overall i was in danger of filing this in the gave up did not finish pile for a good 80% of the time if the author was trying to write a book about how everyday people deal with the challenges of life he has succeeded his portrayal of ed's descent into dementia is realistic i would have enjoyed spending more time with ed's pov rather than so much in eileen's there's not an identifiable plot line here and if you are someone who likes that kind of thing this isn't the book for you i was too far in when i realized a story wasn't going to happen that this book was about a life i didn't find it as emotionally moving as others did and didn't cry at all if i need to read a good cry i'll read angela's ashes or the kite runner again but this book didn't touch those places in me eileen is an unlikable character who unfortunately isn't interesting unlikable must be interesting at least in my literary universe i e gone girl girl on a train etc she doesn't show much growth and remains materialistic and racist xenophobic almost until the very end i was frustrated with her inability to accept people as they are and with her obvious lack of insight into ed's medical condition she's a nurse why didn't she figure things out sooner and with her subsequent unwillingness to put safety measures in place for ed for fear that people would find out although this is consistent with her character there are a couple of sections that we get bogged down in why was soooooo much time spent on the house hunt i understood what the new house and moving out of the neighborhood meant for eileen and in the real world house hunting can take an eon but far too much space was dedicated to the house hunt i wanted to pull my hair out anyway clearly a lot of literature reviewers and readers alike loved this book but i can't count myself among them more","493":"what started out as a really engrossing book about an irish american growing up in nyc in 1950 through 2000 became a chore the problem was whole side stories that go no where main characters that never allow you to connect and sections that could be removed without any impact very disappointed and looked forward to ending","494":"found it to be an amazing book","495":"it's been compared to franzen's books both freedom and the corrections one of my favorite books and is worthy of the comparison the characters are so completely real that it's hard to imagine they don't exist somewhere in the world a heartbreaking but beautiful story","496":"family in nyc growing old striving favorite quote the point wasn't always to do what you want the point was to do what you did and to do it well","497":"good writing but a long depressing read about a somewhat unlikeable main character who has a husband with alzheimer's","498":"just wow really huge but not sprawling because of the satisfying episodic structure which somehow makes you feel part of every important domestic moment and yet skips years at a time three generations evoked through quotidian details characters so well rounded and real dozens of sentences that demand to be read out loud to capture their brilliance and dozens more containing truths you want to hang out on a banner in front of your house","499":" meticulous and ponderous matthew thomas's debut novel we are not ourselves spans several decades from a classic new york irish immigrant story to the grinding tragedy of dementia and health care in the 21st century united states at least prior to the affordable care act i've just lost a loved one to alzheimer's and there is tremendous mercy to be realized in the relatively short span of time between diagnosis and death--only a few years and only in the final months was the decline as devastating as what is portrayed in we are not ourselves still the descriptions of what patient and caregivers endure as the brain slips into the shadow of dementia are chilling heartbreaking and painfully familiar despite the connection to the themes and many beautifully written passages i struggled to connect with much of the narrative it often read like a laundry list of events rather than a story of flesh and heart the relevance of eileen tumulty's childhood her irish immigrant parents her mother's alcoholism her father's conflicting public and private personas is lost as the decades roll on and eileen becomes someone else entirely that she is largely insufferable is not a detriment to the story i have little patience for readers who have little patience for unlikeable characters but the immigrant story seems to belong to a different book what we can and must endure for those we love is deeply private and personal matthew thomas shows us the terrible costs exacted by dementia the tragic loss of money time memory patience energy vitality and hope","500":" we are not ourselves is the story of eileen tumulty the daughter of irish immigrants eileen grows up with distant parents in a tiny apartment her father is a great guy a friend to all he's full of advice and helps people to better themselves he wants no better for himself he spends all the money he makes at the local bar eileen's mother becomes an alcoholic eileen spends more time taking care of her than her mother ever spent taking care of her eileen longs for a better life she wants her own home she wants friends and respectability she wants nice things her husband is a scientist who is just interested in science he does not worry about making impressions and does not care to live in a nicer house he loves his family and lives for his son and his work things start to change and this book ultimately comes to be about family and diversity and how they cope with a devastating life changing issue the story takes place beginning in the 40's and goes into the early part of the turn of the century it is a long slow book that builds and tells an incredible story that will stick with you for a long time it is at times very difficult to read the story is so well told and you care so much about the characters that you hurt and struggle and cry right along with them as they face all of the issues of a long eventful life i would highly recommend this book but please set aside plenty of time because this a book to be savored and contemplated","501":" the second half of this book absolutely engulfed me emotionally it was beautifully written the number of times i had to pause for a second while reading just to give my heart a break were non trivial and i felt like thomas' characters were real honest and genuine which i think isn't always the case in novels dealing with difficult or sad subjects that said i almost put the book down before i got to the second half because i felt it was a little slow and i couldn't quite see the plot development initially","502":"beginning is great interesting about the challenges of the poor irish loses steamed way felt adrift finally gave up no interest in ending","503":"i know it's a trite phrase but this really is a modern classic it has the feeling of reading classic nyc lit a tree grows in brooklyn etc not something i was itching to read or finish but reads well slowly like watching a long film","504":" this is a book about love love between a father and a son love in a marriage it is also a book about life the good days and the bad days matthew thomas writes in wonderful descriptive details and he is not in a hurry either so pour a glass a wine brew a pot of tea and enjoy this well written account of the leary family which consists of ed a biology professor eileen hard working mom and full time nurse and connell their son who they mold and encourage we all have or will have struggles in our lives and we are all not ourselves at times it is our loved ones that matter the most the ones who continue to love us in spite of our flaws the ones that encourage us take care of us and help us during our difficult times and i loved the letter ed writes to connell it is an amazing letter from a father to a son and a highlight of the book","505":" i heard the hype and was excited when i went to my library and saw this sitting on the shelf it's 620 pages long but the reviews said that it was an epic tale and one of the best books of the century blah blah blah i didn't really enjoy reading his book other than the fact that i have close connections with where this book takes place several references made me laugh out loud because i know the places so well the main character of eileen is not a likeable one i just didn't like her and couldn't really figure her out the character of virginia was so random that i didn't see why she was included in this book or what her relevance was the husband acted so strangely that i was saying out loud he's got dementia or alzheimer's but the wife didn't figure that out for another 100 pages it was frustrating i don't know why the son was treated so poorly by his mother or why he kept making such poor decisions i just didn't get this book and i still don't get why it's on every best 10 books of the year list","506":"optimism is the only reason i finished this because it was not the writing the plot or the characters all of which were flat and lifeless","507":"i enjoyed this book despite not enjoying some of the characters eileen and connell are tough cookies to like i felt eileen was coldhearted sort of racist and uppity with no reason frankly i was always surprised in the story when she would refer to one of her many friends because she was not much to like connell was a disappointment ed's illness took a lot of words to get through and maybe it was just a tad much i didn't need to hear about every line of drool coming out of his mouth not the worst book i've read but not one i will likely recommend","508":"this book was wonderfully written and it was heartbreaking you really felt all the emotion of the very emotional story overall a sad story and sometimes very difficult to read but it carried you along and i could not put it down","509":"having had a little time to reflect on this book i decided the writing was decent but the circumstances and the characters were miserably depressing i felt great relief upon finishing it","510":"giving it 3 stars only because i liked the writing style but hated the characters i wanted to like them but i just couldn't it was a struggle to finish ugh","511":"this book took me a while to read not because of the number or pages but because it didn't really interest me enough to want to keep coming back by the end of the book i didn't really get the point there was some interesting parts but other then that it bored me","512":"this book was over 1000 pages on the kindle it did not need to be that long i kept wondering why the editor didn't demand cuts but i kept reading you definitely know the characters by the end and it is a real life","513":"wrenching","514":"powerful multi generational family saga 620 pages but worth the effort","515":"if you're looking for a plot driven book this isn't it while some may label the book slow or boring i found the character driven nature of the book spanning from 1951 to 2011 to be quite engrossing albeit a few moments when the narrative admittedly dragged on a bit","516":"this was a tricky one for me the writing was enjoyable and kept me interested but it was really difficult for me to latch onto a story line it spans several decades of a family's development but i kept looking for a stronger central line outside of this is our life and how it is changing that was missing for me it made it hard to stick with hence this bad boy putting a halt on my reading for a year and taking me almost half the calendar to get through it but all that said once it got ya it got ya i'd be a liar to say i wasn't crying through the better part of the last quarter hopefully thomas' sophomore effort doesn't take another decade to write because i'm definitely looking forward to what else comes from him","517":"well researched account of life with alzheimer's a beautiful passage in this book of a father teaching visualization technique to his son book was too long by a third bits and pieces stylistically content jumps and overloaded lists a first novel with a lot of unevenness not elegant not well edited main characters did not always make sense in a way that suggests life still compelling and moving enough to finish he has enough honesty and openness to keep you reading author is fortunate to have the friends and connections he does harbach must have weighed in because of the role baseball plays","518":"we are not ourselves is an astonishingly perceptive work of art by debut novelist matthew thomas succinct but accurate descriptions of settings make the reader feel like s he is there experiencing what the characters are experiencing the characters themselves are so real that one feels a deep attachment to them and forgets that they are not personal friends their story is compelling and the emotional honesty with which it is told is heartrending matthew thomas has begun his writing career with a bold literary masterpiece","519":"this is one of the best books i've read in a while i had a bad book hangover from the art of fielding by chad harbach u0026amp he reviewed it took me about a week to read i'm in love i hope you all get to enjoy the heartfelt story and experience the same emotions as i did as you read about eileen u0026amp her family battle hardship and rise again","520":"heartbreaking but very interesting","521":" who would ever think that an almost blow by blow account of an ordinary person's life from young girl to grandma age would grab a reader and never let go until the last word perhaps it's the writing there's the yet another romantic breakup for the son the little sedimentary deposits of his need had piled at her feet until they blocked her view of him then there's the heartrending comment on the academically brilliant but emotionally challenged husband he'd been a stranger in the world for most of his life or perhaps the need to devour this story originates in the innate desire to hope that an ordinary life is after all worth living","522":"wow i had no idea this book was almost 700 pages when i chose it for my book club i really had misunderstood the premise of wano entirely it is not about a dysfunctional irish family it is about a 50ish year old woman dealing with her 50ish year old husband's alzheimer's disease prior to this is is about her striving for upward mobility it's a great book not light not fun but absolutely read worthy probably 4 1 2 stars","523":"three unappealing characters dealing with alzheimer's grueling","524":"i'll be the first to admit that i love a tale of ordinary life but even i may need a little more plot than this book provided still i did enjoy it hence the 3 stars","525":"it was not great reading it i sort of got the feeling that he had several copies of reader's digest's vocabulary builder quizzes and he simply seeded those more difficult obscure words into the text of the book here and there another book written by a man with a woman as a main character he should stick to writing from and man's point of view the son the other character whose mind from which we get to see the story is written well there was an interesting take on the american health care system as well as a personal view of a family with the major bread winner being stricken with a most cruel degenerative disease one review promised me warmth and humor as a family struggles i saw no humor and the warmth might heat a closet i suppose a very small closet i ended up loathing the main character i'm glad another reviewer suggested she might be labeled narcissistic it was kind of interesting poking around in her mind but not for 600 pages the son ended up being psychologically crippled his mind was less interesting but more accurate both had opportunities to reach beyond themselves to a higher moral plane but never take it basically the story is a train wreck and i never liked looking at train wrecks and what the heck the prologue had to do with the rest of the book i am perplexed the boy and his father never resurface","526":"i have just finished reading this incredibly well construced book i felt as though i was living as a fly on the wall in the life of the learys eileen ed and connell it was written with such sensitivity and beauty the subject of an academic having alzheimer's disease is not an easy thing to write about but the writer tackled it with great depth and understanding i found the bond between father and son very moving and there were many passages in the book which were very thought provoking i think the book will win many literary awards and they will be well deserved i have no hesitation in recommending it to my book reading group and others that i know","527":"absorbing heartbreaking story of a family's struggle with early onset dementia","528":"i cannot stop thinking about this book which is kind of hilarious considering i wasn't sure if i even wanted to finish it about 3 4 of the way through an honest portrayal of a family's every day life that combined tells a greater story of what it means to find connection and love one another at times it was really hard to get through but thomas is a wonderful writer and i am glad i stayed with him to the end","529":"this review has been hidden because it contains spoilers to view it click here it was a long slog in part because of how my life has been while i was reading it that said it wasn't a page turner yet i wanted to finish it i didn't even begin to like any of the main characters until almost the end of the story it took that long for eileen and connell to get a clue and begin to stop being self absorbed and remote the last couple chapters redeemed the story which began to turn more interesting for me when sergei was introduced","530":"this wonderful story portrays the honest reality of marriage friendships parent child relationships and stunned me as it laid them bare it is not about illness but about life and appreciating when it is good and valuing it it is about love but real love not storybook fairy tale love it is one of these books that makes you reflect on your own life and relationships and what is important the characters were real flawed people that i came to care about so much by the second half of the book that i could not put it down and wept my way to the end","531":"i'm rating this 3 7 rounded up to 4 stars matthew thomas has talent but spending 10 years on a 630 page book is too much not your usual irish american story a plus the first 200 pages are too slow paced characters well drawn but not always likeable ending was weak story line is good telling what it's like to love and live with someone suffering from alzheimer's is not your usual fare poignant story interesting characters i have hope for mr thomas to produce more and better books but shorter please","532":"this book was so very real authentic a grownup book for grownups i would never have enjoyed this book in my 20s 30s much less had my heart touched in intimate ways like it did in my early 40s this book was deeply meaningful and thought provoking this book resonated with me the same way as a tree grows in brooklyn and a prayer for owen meany","533":"beautiful family story spanning decades audio was fantastic and worth the 18 discs it took to get through","534":"such a slog the main character makes herself into such a martyr in a way that makes it impossible to sympathize with her it's wordy insanely long and slow going","535":" far from a perfect book it's too long and often after characters are introduced they're soon forgotten i also questioned the point of the chapters told from the pov of the son versus the wife mother who is the main focus of the book so the book is flawed but it is also the most insightful heart rending rendition of the impact of early onset alzheimer's on the sufferer and other family members that i have ever come across be it in the movies on tv in articles or in books it is a very long book i read it on my kindle so am not sure of the exact page count but it has to be north of 600 pages it could have been edited down especially toward the end but i could not stop reading it and now that i've finished it i can't stop thinking about it every stage of this devastating disease is portrayed with precision and empathy from the early ambiguous and puzzling symptoms through to the progression when the afflicted truly are no longer themselves rather imprisoned within the disease the author's honesty in portraying the tug between sympathy and resentment on the family's part was brilliant one of the best books i've read in a long time i could go on and on but i won't except to say read it","536":"i loved this book i was prepared for nothing to happen so i wasn't looking for a suspenseful book it is just a lovely story of a seemingly ordinary family with a terrific message of perseverance and honesty i was captured from the beginning and never wanted it to end","537":"an amazing story about a wonderful and strong woman you will never forget this character and her life http leatouchbook blogspot fr 2015","538":" the writing and the characters were wonderful i just loved this book but i was in tears many times i didn't know the main premise of the book when i read it so i don't want to state it here i thought about the book last night after i finished it to the point that it kept me awake be warned if i was in my 20s or 30s i don't think i would have liked this book much not enough perspective just speaking for myself the book is character driven and if someone really is into plot this isn't your book i will reread this book in a few years and see what else it has to say","539":"i loved following the life of this family full of flaws hopes dreams disappointments and love each character offered a lesson in acceptance compassion and coping with human frailties","540":" we are not ourselves by matthew thomas was one of those books that take you by surprise what i mean by that is it had the ability to draw you into its story without really trying thomas' writing was powerful in how he manages to express the ups and downs of eileen and her family so earnestly and beautifully you don't really notice how engaged you are into the story until you realize how far into the book you've gotten or when you have finished it thomas did a great job in his portrayal of eileen i felt that he brought her to life in such a realistic manner giving her both goodness and faults she represented the everyday person who had goals to rise above her station and all that it encompassed you can relate to her desire to make a better life for herself you can admire her for her strength and determination to make her dreams and plans a reality giving her your support when she tries to push her husband ed and son connell into working with her to build up their lifestyle however there are times where it showed its ugly side her desire to raise her lot in life not only involves the financial aspect but also how you want others to perceive you often times eileen limits herself because she worried about what others would think of her if she behaved or dressed are certain way that would contradict how she presented herself to others it also makes eileen out to be hard and solely focused on the monetary and material nature of life giving the impression of a woman that can be unlikeable and yet through the good and the bad aspects you get a sense of eileen as a real person she wasn't the perfect illustration of a person striving to be better than her parents and giving connell a better life than she had the writing was such that the heart and emotion of the story really made the story that much more impactful the narrative had a reflective tone to it giving it an abstract look into eileen's ed's and connell's mind the were many moments where the emotions of the story were vivid and very poignant whether they are small moments such as taking in a baseball game or life changing such as alzheimer's those moments carried so much heart and emotion that you can't help but be moved by them in addition the book had its fair share of moments that reflected the thoughts and feelings of the times that eileen were living in both the good and not so good but the thing is the nature of those feelings are ones that the general population have had in some form or another so regardless of whether you agree with them or not it points to the general dislike of humans to changes and of the unknown when i started this book i honestly didn't know if i'll end up enjoying it the beginning was a little slow for me and i wasn't sure where the story was heading or how it would play out but without me being aware of it eileen and her family slowly drew me into their lives absorbing me into their trials and tribulations at the core eileen illustrated the drive to be better than our predecessors through her we lived through the heartaches and hardships to trying to achieve our life plan and the adapting that is needed when it twists into unexpected territory the book felt real and honest which doesn't happen often and when it does you learn to appreciate it in the end received advance reader's edition from goodreads frist read giveaway","541":"a very touching book if you can make it through the slooooooow middle 100 200 pages where you begin to doubt if anything might actually ever happen once the meat of the plot kicks in that long passage makes sense but that doesn't make it any less of a chore to get through","542":"this is a wonderful heartbreaking joyous book while the characters are not always likable the are all too human they evolve they stall and they live at times this novel may have hit too close to home but it made me think about my life and the people in it a very worthwhile read","543":"this is a book that their is a great deal to write about as i read the book my feelings changed intermittently at times i was frustrated and then at others felt that the raw emotion of the book was some of the most powerful i have read this is a a very focused story through over six hundred pages this is a book which focuses on just three people a husband wife and son the book is told primarily through the eyes of eileen tumulty we meet her as a little girl and follow her into old age as a small girl eileen is captivated by her father a driver for the local schaefer beer distributor as well as a local big man in the irish community her mother is not a warm woman she is an alcoholic who on her deathbed advises that at times she would have given up all of her life after becoming sober for just one more drink eileen does well in school and wants much but the times she grows up in do not allow her to go as far as she might have liked she does become a nurse and does achieve a high level of professional success she meets her soon to be husband ed on a blind date on new year's eve ed is much of what she had dreamed about intelligent driven and important for her not so obviously ethnic irish over the course of their marriage however eileen becomes disappointed in ed's career decisions it seems to her that as a neuroscientist that excels and gains prestige self defeating and minimizing when he continually turns down career advancement to continue his tenured position teaching at bronx community college at this time of the book it becomes hard to like eileen she is a cold calculating judging person who does not accept her inherently nice husband for who he is she has more than she ever had growing up but it is not enough she becomes obsessed with getting a larger home a home that says something from the street ed happy and settled does not want to move he has been having trouble adjusting to the modern day students who are much more demanding in his eyes one day he takes his son to class with him and connell becomes witness to a flame out as his father loses control of the class after eventually goading ed into a move it becomes clear that the house though having the right address and great potential also needs a great deal of work ed never complaining takes his how to manuals and sets to work soon it becomes apparent that he is struggling with some kind of problem when the diagnosis comes we are given a picture of what alzheimers disease can do to a family ed's is early onset and especially virulent the cruel irony of a brain researcher getting this awful diagnosis is apparent to all it was in this section of the book especially as ed was still moderately functioning that my dislike of eileen reached it's height she was impatient and often times cruel connel who by now is a teenager starting high school does not acquit himself in a good way either still as the book progresses and eileen works diligently to care for ed to keep him home as long as possible we see the best of her a telling conversation occurs when in a conversation with the now grown connell she hugs him and he says that it is the first time in his memory she has ever hugged him first this woman whose mother was so ungiving showed in her own actions at the end of the book tears flow one if they have made it that far would be inhuman not to do so in the end a book that makes you laugh that makes you angry makes you want to shake the characters and later to admire the fierce determination they display to doing the right thing this is a book that will stick with you","544":" this was one of the best books i've read in a long time i have not done background research on matthew thomas yet but i want to find out if he has personal experience with a family member who has gone through some of the experiences described in this poignant beautifully written book i had been worried about finishing the book in time for my book group meeting but i ended up finishing weeks early because i simply could not put this book down the characters are vividly drawn and i found myself having a love hate love relationship with eileen i felt like i knew her so well the book raises issues about caregiving work life balance relationships frustration and eventually peace with one's station in life i cannot recommend it highly enough and i eagerly await thomas's next book","545":"the story begins with eileen a first generation irish young girl living in jackson heights queens in the 1950's what is extraordinary from this novel showing the hardships of immigrants during that time and how new york city was changing different people different cultures changing jackson heights honestly this novel left me to reflect the hardships in life but love as well ah what a perfect reading to begin my summer with a story of family love friendship life 3 generations in it i couldn't ask for more i cannot wait what else does matthew thomas has in storage in his future novels coming out inspired by the great gatsby to kill a mockingbird and so on matthew thomas showed the readers for this novel to be epic and enduring so much love and care","546":" the plot of matthew thomas' debut novel is summarised in the quote from shakespeare's king lear that prefaces the story saying \"we are not ourselves when nature being oppressed commands the mind to suffer with the body \" in the lengthy story that follows we observe the life of eileen brought up in a family ravaged by alcoholism and disorder and growing into a life that she tries to take control of both in her career as a nurse and also as a wife and then a mother however she is unable to influence everything when her husband ed is diagnosed with early onset alzheimer's disease she and her family have to find new ways of coping with the unexpected matthew thomas takes his time with this novel in more ways than one it apparently took ten years to write and at more than 600 pages it takes a considerable amount of time to read it took me close to 200 pages to really settle into the flow of the novel because whilst it spans a lifetime it takes its time over small details these small details contribute to the larger aspects though the glimpses of alzheimer's onset and the impact of easy to overlook familial events i have read a few novels around dementia of late so was wary of another wondering what else it would have to contribute but we are not ourselves has been one of my most moving of those contributions it really focuses on the way alzheimer's can decimate a life and those around it however it also gives opportunity for eileen to grow in her strength and in her resolve to love in spite of circumstances alongside eileen's experience as wife and eventually care giver we are provided with the viewpoint of connell ed and eileen's son who grows from babyhood to early adulthood throughout the story as a child he favoured his father and longed to emulate him but when he begins to lose the man he thought he knew it hits him hard excuses abound as to why he stays away from home during his college holidays and i found myself getting increasingly frustrated with him it wasn't too long before i saw his fear and his sadness for what they were though with scenes between connell and his father that nearly moved me to tears matthew thomas' precision at portraying the intricacies of a life affected by dementia was abundantly clear the number of accolades we are not ourselves has been considered for is justly deserved this is a novel rich in detail and sensitive to depict both family life and illness in the accuracy needed it isn't easy reading not only for its length but also for its unflinching approach thomas' years of work result in a story i would commend to any reader looking for family drama illness narrative or more simply a brilliantly written novel","547":"listening to this on audiobook and loosing interest it is slightly slow paced but i appreciated the story of the main characters real life issues with dysfunctional parents raising a son and the ups and dons of marriage and loss of health","548":"the only thing worse than reading 282 pages of this book would have been reading 283 pages of this book that many pages equates an entire other novel i could have been engaged in it felt as if thomas was quietly observing very boring lives unfolding in front of him and decided to document it it's too bad because the first line had me thinking i might be reading a family saga akin to 'angela's ashes' the daughter eileen is brought into the pub where her charismatic irish father is easily the centre of attention every man refers to him for advice and laughter unfortunately the characters fall flat almost immediately after this first scene i really didn't know who they were and had no emotional investment in them whatsoever the problems each one of them struggles with is dragged on and on and on... eileen when she's all grown up wants to move and buy a new house and wastes not only the realtor's time looking at properties she can't afford but wastes the reader's time with unnecessary details ed the husband is behaving stranger and stranger every day and yet noone in his family wife or son or any of his colleagues or students in fact think he needs to see a doctor or get some help they just keep shrugging his inane and obsessive behaviours off like that was weird... oh well and move on connell the son acts like he's about 8 years old in some cases when he's in fact 14 at this point and then acts like he's 16 in others sometimes he's athletic sometimes not he gets bullied because he's a nerd but then doesn't want to move from this neighbourhood because he has friends what kid getting bullied every day after school would not jump on the opportunity to get out of there no kidding we are not ourselves you are not yourselves and i can't figure out who anyone was honestly because it felt like the book was on auto repeat most of the time painfully exhausting the same scenarios over and over again and never moving forward","549":"more like 3 5 stars but similar to goldfinch not sure i would recommend it it was hard work reading this book u0026amp it took me a long time to care about the characters in the end i'm glad i finished it but it was definitely not a quick read","550":"i loved the premise of this book the author did an amazing job of capturing the desire of the main character to manufacture this almost perfect life for herself the one flaw in my opinion was it felt choppy at times but the overarching message of living the life you have always resonates deeply with me and i'm not sure i've read anyone that captures it better than eileen","551":"depressing and i have enough to be depressed about well written yes but so slow and no story sometimes you wonder what the characters see in one another","552":"poignant well written at times it was a little indulgent and i wanted to know more about eileen perhaps that was the point she was superficial a look at the long painful demise into dementia and the effect of it on the human being and their family perhaps a commentary on hope as well","553":"a great big story that will stick with me for a while it's easy to see why this landed on so many top lists of 2014 i went into the book knowing very little and i think that's how it's meant to be savored beautifully written painfully so at times epic and utterly honest","554":"one of the most moving books that i have ever read","555":"there are things you feel that you can't explain ed said you know other people won't understand them one of those books that are so well done it seems beyond words to express how it makes you feel i loved every part of this even the slow parts the parts that broke my heart and even the stretches when not much happened eileen ed and connell are good people but with their own flaws they go through life doing the best they can even when life throws things at them they didn't expect some decisions and behavior of each of them you don't always agree with but it rings true at the same time and you understand the reasons motivations for it sometimes eileen would get on my nerves i knew she wanted more from life but now and then i wished she would have appreciated the life she did have more it warmed my heart though to see her and ed together their marriage wasn't perfect but it was a solid loving relationship when a certain event happened i was proud of them for how they handled it and pushed through words are failing me a bit here which in its own way is a high compliment to the author this is an elegant sometimes haunting book and it gets you thinking quite a bit would highly recommend specially the reading guide at the end happy reading all waves my hat off to you mister thomas","556":"this book may not be everyone's cup of tea but i loved it once i started i didn't want to put it down the characters with all their flaws and foibles pulled me in and held me character rather than plot driven this could be the story of any one of us the underlying theme however is always love and family and what we do to preserve this i leave it to others to describe the plot my reaction was visceral and emotion based an amazing debut novel and family saga","557":"much of this was deeply moving but it was too long and too slow i think a good 200 pages could have been trimmed and it would have been a better book i kept putting it down and not getting back to it for a while because it was failing to keep me interested but it had some beautifully written powerful sections i had mixed feelings about this one","558":"heartbreaking and achingly effectual it rarely pops but burns slowly and bright it put a lot of interpol songs into my head specifically not even jail and direction this is the best fiction i've read in a long time","559":"this started out as an interesting well written story but turned into a long depressing slog reading it came to feel like such a chore that i finally gave up about two thirds of the way through and i hardly ever do that i heard it took 10 years to write this book it could take just as long to read it","560":"this review has been hidden because it contains spoilers to view it click here foremost this is a story about family the threads that pervade family are love compassion understanding and evolution following this family over time we see love compassion understanding and evolution while maybe 50 100 pages longer than it had to be this novel tackles the pain of alzheimer's disease and the ways in which each family member deals with this horrible affliction","561":"eileen is the only daughter of two alcoholics her husband has early onset alzheimer's the book is very well written and i had a hard time putting it down but really with a plot like that how can it be anything but a tale of misery yes eileen's life is filled with little bright spots yearnings and triumphs but i just found the story of her husband's loss of mind too painful to enjoy i wouldn't recommend it to others","562":"this book is weirdly described as a multigenerational family saga if that's what you're looking for you may be disappointed but it's a great character study of a family struggling with the american dream","563":"wow what a beautiful and at times heartbreaking book it was very long 650 pages but worth the time i finished it at 1 22 am i couldn't put it down for the night until i finished it this book will stay in my head and heart for a very long time","564":"it absolutely took me too long to finish this novel but i really enjoyed the characters the storyline and the writing it's one of those novels that forces you to think about yourself the debilitating nature of illness and the brevity of life heart wrenching at times frustrating at others and moving all the way through good read","565":" not many books grab me as surely and swiftly as this one at every step when i want things to move a certain way for a character i've come to love mother father and son the author pushed the story further out and by the last page it all made beautiful sense the details of this story are small and intimate but they build to a crescendo of human life love and passion during christmas i read sections aloud and cried at the masterly work of this author he writes quick simple sketches of great drama pain and beauty finding a book this beautiful is one of the best things about reading by far the best book i read this year as an author i felt deeply moved and in awe of matthew thomas this is one of those rare books that deserves every accolade a beauty","566":"an irish american family in queens","567":" written in excellent prose but bogged down by details you could argue that there is a reason for the detailed 600 page account of the leary family's life but it slowed the already slow narrative down there were parts that were riveting and parts that felt a little disjointed all in all this didn't quite do it for me but i'll be reading whatever matthew thomas writes next after reading some reviews it seems to me that a lot of readers who didn't like the book deemed the characters unlikeable eileen especially has been described in pretty harsh terms i find that odd she is certainly flawed but aren't most of us are those readers and their loved ones really such paragons of virtue or am i a horrible person with really low standards nah i felt a great deal of empathy for eileen and found her unrelenting struggle for a better life moving and loved the author's non judgemental approach to his characters we should all be so lucky to have an eileen in our lives when we lose our minds and begin pooping ourselves","568":" i read novels and memoirs and history because i want to know what goes on in other people's lives i sometimes wish i could read people's minds to see their histories their fears their pride their essense behind the masks they wear to survive around others i don't need drama explosions deep inner turmoil or many other manufactured plot devices the drama of day to day living is enough to capture my imagination if an author can write well and create strong real charcters matthew thomas does both in we are not ouselves with such skill that 600 pages doesn't seem too long eileen and connell are the main characters in my mind because circumstance makes it impossible to get into ed's head yet ed too is both sympathetic and not at the same time even after i discovered the twist for lack of a better non spoiler word i could say it here without ruining the book because the twist is just part of who eileen ed and connell are their ages and history up to the reveal affect how they react to and are shaped by it but the beauty of this novel is the twist could have been anything including the one thing you see as the defining tragedy diagnosis twist in your own life","569":"this novel never harps or belabors its points it lays them out beautifully and simply leaves you alone in your thoughts at the intersection of what i wanted and what i got at least it did for me the gem of the book is eileen who is so richly developed over 60 years that when the book is over it's difficult to remember that she is fictional","570":"i liked this book but didn't love it firstly it was very long secondly 600 pages to watch a family's heartbreak over alzheimer's disease is not an uplifting topic especially of one's own family is bridging a similar gap and thirdly the wife's social climbing ambition vs the husband's refusal to change his status quo got repetitive and predictable as i am on vacation i had plenty of time to devote to getting through it and it did hold my interest in a macabre sort of way as i had it loaded onto my nook i stuck with it but am happy now to leave it behind for something with a bit more get up an go to it the good news is it could have been the goldfinch","571":"a dear friend recommended this book because of the beautiful language what struck me most about this book was the depiction of early onset alzheimer's brutal and absorbing i found myself carrying the worry into my own life the one weakness in this book was the lack of carry through on developing the impact of the wife narrator's abysmal financial choices it felt incomplete as if she got a pass on her poor judgment because of her husband's illness","572":"it was probably a better book than a three star ranking but it hit me too deeply the portrayal of alzheimer's was spot on and horrifying as the disease is i didn't handle it very well","573":"the characters were interesting and i liked being able to really watch them evolve the plot sort of drags however it sometimes went in unexpected directions as i was reading i often felt like something was amiss","574":"read this book for a local book club then didn't make it to the meeting whoops anywho this story of a family and their personal struggles through life is kind of a downer and as such the length seemed excessive i went into it ready to glean the author's point yet could find none nor did i figure out what the title meant unless it had something to do with the fact that one of the core struggles in the second half is alzheimer's","575":"i almost gave up on this half way through as i not only didn't like any of the characters i didn't care about them either the second half was a bit better because you learn why at least one of them is so unpleasant","576":"oppressive for the first 450 pages i could not stand eileen and her grasping nature and that really made it difficult to continue eileen became more bearable as the novel came to a close and stopped making decisions that made me cringe","577":"one note about an issue that is part of why this book got four rather than five stars from me that issue is money which is addressed realistically for the first half or so and then increasingly and bizarrely unrealistically for a novel that manages to build in a relatively good take on class at least for a u s novel by a white writer that in fact is to a fair extent about class especially class aspirations and attitudes it dives off the deep end once the plot becomes mostly about a main character's alzheimer's it is completely unrealistic that this family could pay for the son's tuition at the very fancy and expensive university of chicago and the point is clearly made that they pay for it without resorting to loans or aid and pay many thousands of dollars per month for the character's nursing home and pay some $4000 a month for an aide who stays for a while even after ed enters the nursing home and keep up house payments etc ed was a bronx community college professor eileen is a nursing supervisor these people do not make big money and even with the vague mentions of liquidating their retirement funds etc this kind of spending just would not be possible why does it matter because it breaks the willing suspension of disbelief and tarnishes the otherwise fairly well done and interesting grappling with money and class issues that are among the novel's themes it would have worked so much better if the story had continued in a realistic vein with all the horror and desperation that would actually have ensued in terms of paying for alzehimer's care","578":"the long read but good compelling franzenesque american family fiction with an emotive draw","579":"slow lacklustre boring i feel like i just flatlined my way through 600 pages of mundane drivel had this been a library book i wouldn't have laboured my through it like a sodding naked mole rat unfortunately i wasted eight pounds and ninety nine flipping pence on this stale and lifeless tome as well as several hours of my life that i'll never get back hopefully i can now get my ed on and forget this book ever happened","580":"i get it that it's a bildungsroman it's a very slow bildungsroman however the plot is excruciatingly slow that you have to read everything there is about eileen's life the book in my opinion is about 400 pages too long this would the first book that i gave up before finishing in a long time","581":"this review has been hidden because it contains spoilers to view it click here although long i never felt tired by this book i felt frustrated how could ed's family not think he might have alzheimer's how could eileen not realize connell was not ok how could eileen be such a narcissistic unsympathetic character despite these questions i wanted to keep reading i did not care for eileen and had the book been told in first person i am not sure i could have finished but the third person narration and the switch from connell to eileen made it tolerable the story is although long i never felt tired by this book i felt frustrated how could ed's family not think he might have alzheimer's how could eileen not realize connell was not ok how could eileen be such a narcissistic unsympathetic character despite these questions i wanted to keep reading i did not care for eileen and had the book been told in first person i am not sure i could have finished but the third person narration and the switch from connell to eileen made it tolerable the story is nothing fantastic but the characters are developed and you want to see what happens to them almost to the point where i would read a follow up about connell's family i grew up in westchester so there are references to home that made me happy throughout the book i would certainly recommend it but would warn people you aren't going to walk away with a new best friend in eileen leary more","582":"i cried 17 times throughout this book it'll shred your soul but it's worth the pain","583":"gosh this was long lush some beautiful moments after chipping away at the latter half for weeks trudging to be quite honest the last cluster of pages made me bawl and bawl there's some more mundane depression induction in there as well definitely something special though if you can put enough into it to get that little bit of epiphany back","584":"tedious","585":"this was not an easy one to rate large sections of the book were touching and insightful and worthy of a 5 then other sections seemed disconnected and didn't hold my interest well i'm glad that i read the book and recommend it but be prepared for some slow sections","586":" highly recommended this was a sobering book about a main character who faces the loss of the love of her life to a disease that threatens many the author provides a heartbreaking vicarious experience bringing tears to my eyes as he describes the losses of the everyday bliss of a loving couple in minute detail so shocking to think of losing what one takes so for granted the novel doesn't shy away from the enormity of life's challenge in spite of eileen tumulty being an incredibly hardworking and ambitious trained nurse eileen is trying to hold back the inevitable tide as she attempts to save her husband ed life was never easy for eileen raised by irish immigrant parents in queens where family ties and alcohol play major roles then eileen meets ed a scientist and she thinks she's found the perfect partner to help her achieve her version of the american dream but over time she recognizes that his decisions have likely been influenced by his own perceptions of what was to come their son connell tries desperately to help and to be the son eileen expects but he flounders eileen is not perfect but she is brave and i won't soon forget her","587":" this book was amazing there is no mystery no plot twists no action it's simply about life it resonated so much with me it was simply a book about getting older and how spouses and children react to getting older it was about learning life lessons and evolving into the person you were meant to be it was about our concepts of success being material but true success is about finding love and loving there were amazing lines throughout the book it's long it's not exciting but it is incredibly lovely","588":"a very long read a good story that could have been much shorter","589":"horrible couldn't finish life is too short to waste time reading a book i'm not enjoying","590":"story of wife whose professor husband has early alzheimers","591":"exceptional an incredibly absorbing exploration of the life and family of eileen leary remarkablycrafted as the character's personalities and values are revealed simply through their day to day experiences and interactions a read to be cherished","592":"thoroughly enjoyed the trajectory of eileen's life mirrors a favourite saying life is what happens while you're busy making other plans","593":"yes i almost didn't get around to picking this one up but i am infinitely glad i did the quintessential family saga heartbreaking and thoughtful almost every word in the right place","594":"brutal honest readthe genius of this prose is the authors impeccable gift with detail you live and breathe these characters this all amounts to a devastating and enduring story i found the novel to drag a bit towards the end overall a stunning debut","595":" awful over written not a single likable character especially not the chronically disagreeable selfish protagonist and her socially awkward and selfish son does every teenager in american literature have to be a socially awkward self pitying loser even the alzheimer's victim while sympathetic was not particularly likable i wanted to quit reading several times but soldiered on because a friend said it was her favorite novel ever ugh after reading 90% of this endless novel i finally accepted that it was never going to get better and bailed","596":"i loved this book it took a few chapters to really get into it but after that i couldn't put it down it's beautifully written and i found myself totally immersed in the lives of this family i just finished the goldfinch and loved it too but i think i enjoyed this one more","597":" i cannot recall the last time a book brought me to tears several times this book was truly a great book it is character driven and i at times had difficulty liking or caring about eileen i found her to be aloof and removed from the emotions of life until the end when she is looking back and expressing how she was feeling the letter ed wrote to his son connell was so raw and full of love i had to stop for a moment to just let the feelings be this is not an easy light read by any means it's a saga of a family and all their warts i was saddened when it ended","598":"very sad beautifully written","599":"it took me over a month to finish it and let's be honest there were some times where i didn't think the author was ever going to stop and really needed to do so however i love books that have good characterization and this definitely had that this is the story of the things we strive for and never get a story of the things we settle for that often surprise us it is mostly ed's story but also eileen's it is hope and disappointment love and loss regret and redemption if you have the time to sit down with it it's definitely worth the read although as i said there were definitely parts where i found myself skimming because the writing was becoming a little tedious all that though is made up for in a beautiful story of one family's life","600":"the most beautiful book i've read moved me to tears especially this line you are not in this life to count victories and defeats you are in it to love and be loved","601":" the story of eileen and ed the challenges they face the story of their marriage is beautifully written ed is a scientist and teacher at a community college and eileen is a nurse who becomes and administrator their only child connell is part of the glue of their marriage as i read i was drawn in their lives eileen's dreams of a better house in a better neighborhood ed's initial resistance and their purchase of a fixer upper which ed was unable to fix due to illness the descriptions of connell's adolescence and selfishness during that time rang very true","602":"overhyped for sure there were some interesting and well written parts but for the most part i was so frustrated not often that i skim pages as it felt so mundane","603":" so many details my interpretation is that this novel shows us what happens when the american dream takes the form of a relentless struggle to make a good impression eileen's obsession with buying a house in the right neighborhood with an impressive front driveway and entrance leads to the purchase of a house with multiple structural problems and other developments resulted in the appearance of an attractive home but only in the rooms that guests saw the rest was moldy and rotting ed's illness likewise might be a metaphor for the emptiness of eileen's materialism","604":"we are not ourselves is not the typical kind of book that i read but my interest was piqued by a couple of reviews of it and i'm so very grateful that i picked it up because i had a hard time putting it down until i had finished it and even now i don't think i've truly put it down this is the kind of novel that stays with you because it is about what is always the most complicated subject matter for most of us family it is the story of eileen the daughter of irish immigrants raised to believe in the american dream that every generation will be more successful than the one before it she sets firm goals to make that happen and drags her husband and son with her as she builds an exterior life to show the world how far up she has come from the humble beginnings of her parents but it's the full access into her interior life that makes the novel so compelling and fascinating so much of everyone's life is lived internally that is where we second guess ourselves berate ourselves and pity ourselves all while maintaining the outward appearance that all is well it is also where we dream without giving an external hint that there is something more that we want to be in this novel even with all the access to her inner workings this reader still found her so distant but i also found her endlessly sympathetic because she recognized that distance in herself as well but always believed that she would have time to overcome it everything she believed in told her that she had to have the right exterior to portray to the world before she concern herself with the needs of the family housed within it because i refuse to write in a book i found myself using flags for the first time in reading for leisure but there were passages in this novel that i just know i will have to go back to from time to time and there's an entire chapter that moved me more than anything in recent memory when a father gives his son a moment to believe in the impossible and in doing so makes it real for him that belief that creating joy in your interior life and having little to no concern about if it does or does not become a reality is in such sharp contract with all that governs eileen's life and story that it became even more poignant to me this is a small story in that it is just about one family over the course of about 60 years with larger world events rarely mentioned and yet it's an all encompassing story because family struggles are universal","605":"epic in time 1940s to basically today and number of pages 640 if not in scope we really only get to know three people and then a fourth sort of near the end matthew thomas's massive family saga we are not ourselves is curiously addicting mostly thoughtful and perceptive about class and ambition and fear and desire vivid and expressive but ultimately doesn't cut it narrative wise to ascend into the great american novel status to which it aspires the action takes place mostly in three locales woodside queens where eileen tumulty grew up with a mayor of such and such block bar kind of irish father jackson heights where eileen moves with oddball strangely unambitious scientist professor husband ed leary and their semi troubled under achieving son connell and finally after that neighborhood changes aka becomes more hispanic then indian to the wealthy suburbs of bronxville where eileen forces the family to move into a house they can't really afford all three neighborhoods are nicely rendered bronxville in the 1990s which i know well to a weirdly specific degree as thomas rattles off the actual names of every store in town on multiple occasions and we spend an enormous amount of time inside the head of eileen to a lesser degree inside connell's phew and because a major plot twist wouldn't allow it not at all inside ed's who's actually the most interesting and certainly the most unpredictable character eileen's self conscious strident striving for status gets wearisome pretty quickly and connell's mostly a dud but their family dynamics and thomas's ability to paint a scene plus the seemingly eccentric volatility of ed keeps you turning pages even when nothing's really happening and you don't particularly like any of the people with whom you're hanging out","606":" wow had no idea the direction this saga was going to take me in... irish american irene tumulty grows up in a household littered with alcoholism which afflicts her with a seriousness beyond her years a sense of needing to control things in her life and a need to suppress her feelings... resulting in a woman who is strong and structured in everything she does but rarely shows any warmth to those in her life her life follows a fairly normal pattern... she studies to become a nurse marries college lecturer ed leary has a son and settles in to the monotony and predictability of everyday life... so much so that at one point in this story i struggled to continue... i waded through the drudgery and repetitiveness of the life of the leary's wondering if it was worth continuing i now realise how powerful this writing was i felt exactly as irene felt i also came to the very slow and painful realisation that something quite serious was wrong with her husband ... ed was suffering from early onset alzhiemers and as the story progressed matthew thomas wrote about this in such an intimate and moving way that at times i felt helpless and so so sad for irene for ed and for their son connell all struggling to deal with the hand they had been dealt in their own ways this is a really interestingly written story moving slowly in some parts but winding it's way beautifully to a sad and reflective ending for me","607":"uhg i really disliked this book so slow and plodding i never quite understood how the beginning had anything to do with the rest of the book it was almost like these were two separate stories thrust into one once you get to the crux of the story the reader is easily bored i disliked the characters and really thought that eileen was a vicious and spoiled woman with no compassion for anything that doesn't revolve around her","608":"an overly long novel part irish american immigrant experience part family coping with alzheimer's the first part has been done better and more subtly and movingly by both alice mcdermott and colm toibin and the latter by lisa genova but nevertheless this is a moving involving story","609":"i'm not sure what to give this because i'd only give it about 3 stars for the first half which i didn't love because the 3 main characters in the family were not very loveable or redemptive and i don't like that in a book but the second half really pulled me in and i found it fascinating i'd give it 4 stars this is a book farrah loved","610":"i heard so many good things about this book so i was looking forward to reading it i kept hoping it would get better it didn't there were times i liked it but there were more times i didn't i felt the book was about 200 pages too long some events were told briefly in a narrative others dragged on for too long from the perception of one of the three primary characters","611":"although subtlety compelling it is resolutely glum and inordinately drawn out","612":"times like this i'm very grateful i frequent my public library if i had paid for this book i'd be positively peeved i could not make myself finish it made it 14 hours into the 21 hour audiobook way too tedious i think this author is a franzen wannabe however it doesn't even come close to freedom","613":"this is not a book i would pick up and read again family saga that to me did not ring true although you had to admire the main character eileen overall i did not feel the emotion in the story that i expected","614":"just a warning this is a long slow book","615":"don't bother not worth the time it was cool to read about a time and place in chicago that overlapped with my tenure there mid 90's hyde park but that's it","616":"a wonderfully touching story where we accompany eileen leary and her family through two generations and experience with them the devastating effects and inevitable demise of her husband ed who is diagnosed with alzheimer's disease a well handled portrait of the disease empathetically regarding it from various relationship standpoints","617":"such a stunning accomplished novel yes it's long but i appreciated the way thomas shows us the evolution of the characters all three main characters change throughout the course of the story among my favorite lines is this one near the end when connell contemplates when to open the letter from his father he wanted to preserve the seal of possibility on it to reserve the option to project whatever he wanted onto it to use his imagination to drag himself out of the hole he found himself in i loved this book","618":"story of family husband suffers illness","619":"what a thought provoking book about social class family loyalty to oneself vs others and the choices we make throughout our life it also explores the desire to achieve more than our parents and how relationships and dreams change as we grow older very readable but heavy stuff","620":"this book was far too long and overly emotional in parts it was a spectacular portrayal of what happens to a family when someone gets a incurable disease","621":" we are not ourselves is a slow quiet book it follows protagonist eileen leary from her childhood to her old age introducing us to a wide cast of characters but centring firmly on her husband ed and their son connell the huge scope of the novel trying to encapsulate a whole life could easily have resulted in a slow laborious read but thomas's masterful plotting avoided this entirely the novel lingers appropriately on significant moments without ever drawing them out too long whilst the intervening months or years between these moments are deftly and briefly covered in a way that progresses the plot without cheating the reader the novel focuses heavily on the personal lives of its three main protagonists and its beauty lies in its compassionate and touching but never sentimental portrayal of their relationships and emotions the love between husband and wife between parent and child their struggles and fights their attempts to stay together in the face of adversity i don't want to reveal too much about the central struggle the characters face but the slow unravelling of ed's self is beautifully done heartbreaking and utterly captivating there were moments were i had to put the book down and take a moment to process the emotions thomas evokes so well in my opinion the novel is less successful in its attempts to range beyond its central family it touches on issues of race immigration and changing neighbourhood demographics it makes some moves to critique eileen's aspirations to the american dream and so on the novel doesn't deal with these issues badly as such but compared to the powerful main story they feel a little lacklustre and unexplored eileen's xenophobic tendencies for example are a major driving factor in her desire to escape from jackson heights and move out to bronxville but after many many years her views are suddenly changed by a single meal with the indian family who bought her old house i appreciate however that doing justice to these issues is difficult especially when your main plot is as intense and sprawling as this one we are not ourselves is a novel with big ambitions whilst it is as all novels are flawed and has its weaknesses it is nonetheless a powerful gripping read which engrosses you in the lives of its three central characters a definite five star debut and i'm looking forward to reading whatever matthew thomas produces next","622":"this book just did not catch my interest i stuck with it but it was a chore i don't know if it's just the way that the characters were presented or what but they are all extremely unlikeable i was really hoping to like this one but i did not","623":"i enjoyed it but it was slow read ithe words really brought me into the picture but life went slowly by i thinkit had to be slow to get where it was going but it was a little too slow","624":"this review has been hidden because it contains spoilers to view it click here pg 594 from letter written by ed to connell when i am gone i want you to hear my voice in your head hear it when you most need to when you feel most hopeless when you feel most alone when life seems too cruel and there seems too little love in it when you feel you have failed when you don't know what the point is when you cannot go on i want you to draw strength from me then i want you to remember how much i cherished you how i lived for you when the world seems full of giants who pg 594 from letter written by ed to connell when i am gone i want you to hear my voice in your head hear it when you most need to when you feel most hopeless when

want you to remember there is more to live for than mere achievement it is worth something to be a good man it cannot be worth nothing to do the right thing more","625":"i would rate it as a 3 5","626":" i hate to do this but i have to bail on this book i really hate it look i'm not one to shy away from sad or depressing books seriously bring it on make me cry authors put me in a funk that will last a week over the sad decrepit life of some fictional character i dare you however 300 pages into this i can't find any redeeming qualities here i hate every character except the son the story is boring eileen is too concerned about appearances the husband is a prick both before and after the alzheimer's diagnosis i heard such great things about this book but it's just not matching up with what i'm reading","627":"i got an advance copy of this book and was thrilled this is truly one of the great family sagas there are certainly depressing elements to it but that is to be expected i rarely give 5 stars to anything and as a matter of fact i rarely review books but the beauty of we are not ourselves needs to be shouted from the rooftops","628":"this was a good read","629":"it's obvious when i find the time to read a 620 page book in 4 days of a busy week that this book is a page turner it's emotional reading at times i decided 6 years ago there is a fate worse than death and it has a name dementia well substitute alzheimer's and the symptoms and havoc it wrecks are pretty much the same well developed characters one couldn't help liking so without giving away too many details i think this book is worth reading","630":"who are wei am still trying to figure out what the author means by the title the title was not chosen randomly but with purpose who are we are we more than that imagine we have conjured up that plan we have for our life or are we less i found the change in narrators interesting as there was multiple perspectives i could be inside ed during his initial descent until ed wasn't there anymore and poor eileen as much a prisoner within the walls she built as ed was in the walls his disease built for him","631":"having a hard time picking this book up but i am determined to finish way too long and descriptive","632":"i received a digital version of this novel from the publisher simon and schuster via netgalley in exchange for my honest review thank you this debut novel is a very long read about 600 pages and spans several decades starting in the 1950s the protagonist is eileen of irish american ancestry the first third of the novel is about her childhood and coming of age her upbringing by an alcoholic mother and a gambling father is sad but she is determined to make something of herself eileen has the desire and ambition to better herself move up in life and live in a nice home neighborhood but soon realizes her scientist professor husband has no such desires while they love each other very much they are worlds apart in what they want out of life eileen and other main characters are very well developed but i felt there were too many minor characters and at times the story stalled as scenes played out too long during the last one third the story picks up speed when a devastating disease wrecks havoc with many lives i found it to be heartbreaking because i have volunteered to help and care for people suffering from this complicated disease due to thorough research mr thomas' description of the progression of the disease was right on he is a talented writer and i think he'll be a successful one","633":"this book should come with warning sticker will break your heart","634":"ok olivia i read this because you gave it five stars i have to say after the first 50 100 pages i was ready to put it down and call you and ask about the 5 stars but after that i really got into and couldnt put it down","635":" how much did i not need to read this book how much am i depressed beyond measure it's a tribute to the author's skill that i stayed with it even when it took a frustratingly familiar and very sad turn trying to avoid spoilers here let me just say it is a very painful story of eileen ed and connell but i couldn't tell from the reviews that it was heading in this direction and they were all raves suffice it to say still alice i knew what i was getting into really lovely writing some sentences that rang so very true and a tear or two but the doom cloud it created will hang over me for a bit and p s although i recognize the power of denial not just a river in egypt the length it lasted made me crazy particularly when we are reading about a nurse","636":"although there was a lot of redundancy which occasionally made for tedious reading i still think this book deserves five stars no spoilers i promise but the protagonists are all so flawed and impossible at times that i couldn't help but care for them","637":"a very very long mostly boring book about eileen and her family lots of unnecessary words in here as if the author had a field day with a thesaurus i began to hate the book about halfway through i'm happy it's done","638":"i'd probably give this a 3 5 at times i found it slow and dull but the real life feel of the slow pace and the realities of wading through all of the ups and downs of every day living kept me reading not an easy book but a very thoughtful one lots of good quotes life is going to give you things to be angry at i don't want you to be consumed by that anger or forget how much you're capable of pg 298 on to 299 i loved this entire exchange between father and son believe and you become powerful this was his final gift to her to silence her regrets about the paths she hadn't taken eileen's realization after her husbands death from alzheimers pg 574 real estate he couldn't help hearing another meaning in the phrase what was his father's real estate there was the investment portfolio and the house and the things in it there was the contribution to science there were the altered lived of the students he'd taught and the impacts those students had had and would have on others and then there was him he was his father' real estate pg 588 love the thought that our children are our greatest assets and our real estate this will be one defeat more will follow victories will follow too you are not in this life to count up victories and defeats you are in it to love and be loved you are loved with your head down you will be loved whether you finish or not pg 594 ed's letter to son connell would that we can all receive a letter like this one","639":"this extremely well written novel is simply a story of a family in the latter part of the 20th century in new york it is not a special story but the insights the author brings to everyday moments makes it a page turner eileen tumulty is a young girl in woodside queens living with her two parents who seem not to have a relationship her father is a larger than life storyteller familiar to people who know irish bluster matthew thomas tells eileen's story at a quick pace stopping every now an then to put a spotlight on a particular moment that remains in the reader's memory whether it is her mother sitting on the coach cigarette in hand or at her deathbed when eileen gets married the story slows down as we see what happens to her familythe story is a heartbreaker but it is simply the story of human life it's joys and sorrows well written and well paced read it","640":"i can't remember the last time a book brought me to tears like this one did in the final pages i don't want to say too much to spoil it but it's a beautiful sad and also hopeful story of three generations of an irish family in nyc it's one of those books that you're happy is so long because you don't really want it to end","641":"this is an epic novel filled with intense emotions and reflections as we move forward in our daily life to love and live it's not a short read by any means and seems a bit windy at times but such a rewarding read once read the letter from father to son should be framed such a loving way to show a fathers love and hopes and dreams for a son","642":"make no mistake this is a book about alzheimer's disease in that regard it is a powerful portrayal of the far reaching effects this horrible disease has on families and sufferers however as a whole the book fell flat to me the character development was uneven the pacing and depth of detail strange and choppy many other reviewers chalk this up to this being a debut novel but i'm not sure","643":"oh so sad if you want to learn about alzheimer's then you will appreciate this book however if you are looking at this book because of the irish connection i'd suggest you look for another book perhaps it was because i read this book over a snowed in weekend and found it to be way too depressing","644":"this is a tough one to review for me i love loved the first half i really liked the next fourth and the last fourth was a huge bummer for me it was still written beautifully but to be honest i wouldn't have picked it up in the first place if i knew what the last half was about it's a personal thing for me","645":"well written but very long 200 pages too long i put it down several times because nothing earth shattering was happening but i kept picking it up i finally finished reading it and realized it was actually very enjoyable the first half is an intimate description of the family and their relationship with each other and the second half is how they deal with the unexpected","646":"enjoyed the journey of the main character's life","647":" after reading rave reviews in mainstream and respected media i was completely annoyed by the time i was done with this drudge of a book yes thomas writes clearly but i found way too many declarative sentences one after another after another to find the narrative compelling he told a story period we all can tell a story about our family or someone else's and our story will always be more interesting to us than anyone else's that's the way the book made me feel i began not to care the reviews teased with promises gripping unpretentious backed with soul destined to be a classic incompatible to my response to it no is what i'll say if someone asks me if it's a good read ok is all","648":"600 pages of one family of 3 2 parents only child deeply loved it couldn't remember why i'd placed it on hold i'd say the less known about plot the better though not a super plotty book did you like the art of fielding even tho it was 'about' baseball while not being about baseball at all ditto this i think the striver mother was what really made if 5 star instead of 4 star i know some strivers thankfully i'm not one of them yet am susceptible to thinking sometimes i should be more of a striver maybe this is a bit of 'what if you were' loved this one finished in 4 days","649":"a beautiful story expertly crafted and endlessly engaging it's a thoughtful commentary on life career family and human struggles i was mesmerized for the entire length of this finely woven story thomas's characters are fluid they are changed by their experiences and their age and the time in which they live i highly recommend it","650":"well if you want a book to match a week of grey clouds and pouring rain this is the book for you it was well written and you certainly get to know the characters intimately well but the sun never really breaks through the clouds in this story perhaps would have been a better winter book certainly don't take it on a beach vacation unless you want to be debbie downer","651":"mainly it's a story about early onset alzheimer interesting enough but about 300 pages too long the book had a lot of potential but it got drowned out by too much mundane narrative","652":" please i just have to finish this this book is well written although i don't always feel i know these people well but if i had known it was about the the excruciating detail of someone with alzheimer's i never would have picked it up i don't really want to read about this tortuous descent into hell and yet having been an english major i feel this puritan obligation that i must finish this book so if you want to be depressed this is the book for you o k finished it it was a well written well crafted novel at the wrong time in my life the end was not nearly as depressing as the descent but glad to have finished it and moved on lesson learned read the back of the book before grabbing your next read","653":"this review has been hidden because it contains spoilers to view it click here this is the saddest book i've ever read i think trying to describe to someone why they should read it would almost be impossible how do you say the book is about the depressing decline and death of a man with alzheimer's disease and its effect on his family and make it sound appealing still i thought it was extremely heartbreakingly well written and would recommend it","654":"a 3 5 the writing was so good that it didn't matter that i didn't really like a single character i read this months ago and it's so much clearer in my mind than books that i read weeks ago which for me is a testament to the quality of the novel read this book","655":"when the bookseller asked me what i thought about this book i hesitated why couldn't i just say great i think the author created some great characters some of the language was beautiful but there's a certain je ne sais quoi about this one","656":"great book very long and has some slow parts but overall a really great read misha collins explained it best with his wife's reaction \"it can't be as good as you're saying \" fifty pages in she was still skeptical and said \"i like it \" in a slightly cavalier tone \"but i think you just read it when you were in a weird mood \" 100 pages in she disappeared into her room and began ignoring me and the children when she finished it she found me in the kitchen her glasses were wet with tears she hugged me and said \"beautiful so beautiful \" read it if you have the time and want to be blown away","657":"disappointed i wonder if it had been 300 pages less it would have been better the book started out with promise slowed down in the middle picked up towards the end and then fizzled out i didn't particularly like eileen or connell ed was likable enough and matthew thomas wrote his character well but all in all this book could have been that irish american family saga in fewer words and have been a really good book","658":" this book was hard to rate the reason i gave it two stars is because i think it hit too close to home and i found it depressing living your life always yearning for bigger and better things and then realizing too late that what you had was actually amazing the idea that if you buy the beautiful house it will make you happy if you don't do better than your parents you're a failure i read books to escape and i find that i don't enjoy them if they're too real if i see a reflection of society myself maybe it deserves more than two stars because thomas was able to make me feel that way but i just wasn't a fan","659":"this review has been hidden because it contains spoilers to view it click here a bit too drawn out as well as being depressing","660":"why does every good book have to be depressing why can't we just create happy books where everyone gets everything they want i mean i know the answer because they're not satisfying or too unlike life anyway this book is about as life like as you can get middle class people doing middle class things after i was done i couldn't decide whether to cry or just shrug it off and keep going i chose the latter but the book resonated thomas' writing is spectacular and while the story of the leary family isn't fun or exciting it's thoughtful sweet and all too realistic","661":"i found this book hard to rate sometimes i loved it but a lot of the time i found it just dragging on i felt like it was well written and i knew i wanted to finish it but it just didn't grab me like i had hoped it would","662":"this book was laborious and meandering and i wanted to put it down at least 19 different times its writing was uncomplicated and pretty much unrewarding i was telling friends about this book i was reading that i was growing to loathe and then bam he lands it beautifully truly remarkable so read it","663":"a difficult book to rate presented as a epic but it doesn't feel like an epic perhaps the scope is too small i read this as entertainment weekly named it one of the best books of 2014 and said you would ugly cry at the end well that didn't happen the book starts off with a lot of history on this family basically the first half of the book which i'm not sure why it's even there really i don't think knowing all this background adds to the story and there isn't a likeable character in the entire book which doesn't help either i considered giving up on the book after a couple hundred pages but i'm glad i didn't the book gets better in the second half and the whole thing really skips along anyway so i was able to get through it i didn't know the twist that was coming in the second half and i'm glad i didn't so i won't reveal it here it ends up being the whole reason d'etre for the book so i'm surprised they didn't give it away in the marketing materials it could have been more moving if i cared about or liked the characters but it was enough to get me through","664":"i don't normally read this sort of book unless it is by wally lamb but i couldn't stop reading it what a glorious first novel by this author it felt a lot like lamb's books i understood the protagonist so well elaine leary and her story resonated with me this is also a great detailed description of loving someone with alzheimer disease i know i will think of it for a long time and often","665":"just thinking of this book again makes me wish i could re read it afresh is that a word i loved each of the characters in the family and could see them what they wore how the houses looked and felt the emotion coming off of the pages tough at times but a page turner","666":"ugggg i had to take a break from reading this book because i found it was really depressing i felt the ending dragged on a bit and i was starting to lose interest in the characters but overall i thought it was well written and a believable portrayal of family dynamics when an unexpected tragedy overcomes the lives of those involved i found it heartbreaking at times it tugged at some of my deepest fears if you're up for a depressing theme it's the perfect book for you","667":"great writing such a great story highly recommended can't believe this is a debut i look forward to reading more from matthew thomas wow","668":"i picked this up because it reminded me of the art of fielding by chad harbach one of my favourite books there are similarities a character driven extensive story about the shortcomings of being human but i ended up being quite underwhelmed thomas' characters are not as sympathetic what is with this slightly racist views of eileen that only seem to evaporate when it turns out she likes indian food and his metaphores often come across as unfitting he walked the aisles deliberately like a big cat stalking its prey looking at dresses without touching them nevertheless this is a convincing and tenderly written story about how a loved one slowly sinks away in alzheimer's disease","669":"this review has been hidden because it contains spoilers to view it click here matthew thomas has told a compelling story this 620 page book is the story of eileen ed and connell tumulty eileen a nurse and ed a scientist who teaches at

will be to leave this life behind i want you never to forget my voice my beloved boy you mean the world to me more","670":"wow loved this book a beautiful and honest look at life 60 year story of a family that just grasps you and keeps you reading through good bad and ambivalence really powerful know there are parts of the book i will be thinking about for a long time to come","671":"i started reading this not knowing that it was ultimately the story of a woman who had to deal with her husband getting early onset alzheimer's it took a long time getting to this after much build up with her rather depressing early life with difficult parents that this is a first novel and took 10 years to write is noteworthy but there was a lot of meandering about what was the main point to me","672":"was not expecting the tear jerker that it was re read the last 30 pages a few times a great book","673":"this quiet contemplative book examines eileen leary's dreams for her life what she does to make those dreams come true and how she reconciles herself to her reality and limitations i had trouble feeling much empathy for the main characters however esp the son who was awful i'm also surprised that reviews don't mention ed's demise into early onset alzheimer's which makes up almost half the book","674":" i wanted to like this book it came highly recommended to our book club and in just glancing at the reviews on goodreads it definitely presented as a book i would enjoy this novel is certainly character driven and not plot driven usually i enjoy character driven novels but this one could have used a bit more plot to help drive said characters i will say i did value the realness of the characters they truly had human flaws emotions and experiences but i did not like any of them enough to actually care about what was happening to them i definitely don't always love the characters i read about but there typically there is something that encourages me forward curiosity about their fate or the journey toward said fate or in some novels there are characters you love to hate i had figured out the diagnosis so to speak early on and even anticipating the trajectory this would take the story in i still could not connect to the book or the characters although i will say overall the writing the prose is quite good looking forward to what my book club members have to say tomorrow evening","675":" this is an excellent 1st novel about a 3 generation irish american family the tumultys in queens new york the immigrant parents are humble poorly educated u0026amp financially modest hardworking u0026amp hard drinking but their daughter eileen has ambitions to rise upward in education u0026amp society she will become a nurse u0026amp administrator with a successful career when she meets ed leary a neuroscience teacher u0026amp researcher she feels they are meant for each other but discovers that he has much less ambition for change u0026amp social mobility and is much more content with his situation they have a son connel who lacks the direction u0026amp energy of his mother or scientific inclinations of his father though he is equally fixated on baseball but will grow up after failing to complete his college courses to discover that he really wants to teach u0026amp write much of the story deals with ed's premature development of alzheimer's in his 50's which nearly leads to his marriage breakup until eileen realizes the cause of ed's cold u0026amp aggressive behaviour and which puts a cap to his career eileen becomes a devoted caretaker of ed until his death the book deals with many american themes the immigrant experience with successive waves of different ethnicities succeeding each other in the neighborhood the importance of blue collar work as a springboard for social advancement racial issues are brought up the imperfections of medicare the marked inequalities of income the clash between the traditional close multigenerational families u0026amp the newer isolated nuclear model","676":"i received this book as part of a goodreads and simon u0026amp schuster giveaway while it's a long and heavy read it's worth sticking with it it is a beautifully written novel but one that leaves the reader just a bit unsettled the characters aren't living but are merely existing in their miserable lives she spent a lifetime adjusting hopes downward sums up how hopeless the characters are in finding controlling their own destiny they are always waiting on others to act differently or say something differently that will render their lives changed and therefore happy it's a raw and emotionally told story of lives not really lived","677":"it's been a long time since i was so moved by a book i was so absorbed in the story that the length seemed immaterial thank you matthew thomas for letting me follow all the most intimate moments for this family","678":"the story line was not what i was expecting but it was interesting it was the story of a family where the husband father is the victim of early onset alzheimers and the effect of this on the entire family glad i read it but i thought it dragged at the end which is the reason i only gave the book 3 stars","679":"this book was an amazing character study i felt that the author really deep dived into allowing the reader to understand the various characters motives when dealing with a tough diagnosis not an easy read but definitely worthwhile","680":"4 5 stars i loved this carefully written book the story of an ordinary family and all its messiness particularly the consequences of our choices and dealing with things out of our control within the family unit this author has great insight into human behavior and emotion","681":" we are not ourselves is a look inside a family struggling with alzheimer's disease it's a story about how a husband wife and son cope with the overwhelming challenges they face and with a heartbreaking illness that grinds to its inevitable finish by the time she meets ed leary eileen tumulty has already decided what she wants out of life and that is to escape from the woodside queens neighborhood where she grew up as the daughter of hard working but hard drinking irish parents in a loveless marriage eileen spent most of her childhood propping up her mother and running the household once married eileen's dreams of an elegant home seem within reach she is a successful nurse ed is a brilliant research scientist and she can already envision where his career path will take them a baby boy connell completes the picture what eileen doesn't foresee is ed's resistance to change he's happy where he is first as a tireless and hyper focused researcher and then as a professor at a community college intent on making his mark right there this is a story in itself full of complicated family dynamics and marital conflict but when ed is diagnosed with alzheimer's disease the leary family changes into something else once again the burden falls on eileen to step up and make key family decisions including the most important one how long to keep ed at home i was drawn into we are not ourselves because of this story set up thomas has a simple sometimes clipped but often elegant writing style he includes a lot of side characters and scenes however which plump the book up to its hefty 623 pages it's hard not to question these digressions including a good deal of baseball references most appreciated by fans but extraneous to others side plots such as connell's stint as a doorman and eileen's visits to a series of cult like therapy sessions have only loose connections to the plot in addition a long rant about the american healthcare system seems contrived and preachy despite its length the main characters especially eileen and connell remain undeveloped which makes it hard to identify with them because the reader knows little else about eileen's emotions her drive for a better life merely comes across as selfish cold and judgmental connell is equally self absorbed and unable to do his part it's tempting to give him the teenager's pass for being irresponsible but there's just not enough in his character to warrant it thomas leaves a frustrating gap between all three characters and when he does bring them together their emotional connections are hard to believe ed is the center of the story and is the most developed character even before his diagnosis it's easier to sympathize with him when eileen tries to push him around that also makes it easy to dislike her and connell maybe that's the whole point of the book's construction to force the reader to focus on ed and perhaps that's why eileen and connell are such flat characters i guess i just wanted to like someone in the story the only one who came close was ed criticism aside i did enjoy the book and there were many moving sections and telling dialogue where only a few words make a great point one of thomas's obvious talents here's a great example when ed receives his diagnosis right away eileen says they need to get a second opinion ed's response says it all revealing a keen sense of self awareness we don't need a second opinion he's the second opinion another favorite scene is when ed and eileen are at macy's ed is intent on buying her a dress for christmas he wants to surprise her but eileen has to help his ability to communicate has already begun to crumble but he puts his words just right 'i like you in blue ' he said the simplicity of the declaration put an ache in her chest he directed no animosity at her for having rescued him in the transaction he seemed to feel only a naked desire to please he was being stripped of pride of ego ruined destroyed he was also being softened scenes in the nursing home are equally moving giving the reader insight into the meaning of ed's limited words some of them heartbreaking i think this is the strongest part of the book and the most beautiful part of the book is ed's letter to connell while a reminder that there are no guarantees in life is nothing new ed has the best advice for his son what matters most right now is that you hear how much i want you to live your life and enjoy it i don't want you to be held back by what's happened to me a good message and connell will try to take it to heart","682":" this is a long book it takes about half the book for the crux of the book to be revealed but if you are even slightly intuitive you know what the crux is well before page 300 it is very detailed but there are details or strands that the writer begins to develop but leaves undeveloped which is a bit frustrating examples of this are the bullying of connell how is this resolved for the adolescent young man eileen's struggle with her weight as a consequence of the tremendous stress she faces from page 300 the end of the novel sergei the characters are somewhat two dimensional still it's worth the read if you have the time or if you are the kind of person who can have two or three books on the go at one time","683":"overly long but an enlightening portrayal of what it's like to live with and take care of a spouse with alzheimer's i kept thinking that the lavish lifestyle to which the protagonist aspired only make her struggle worse but the narrative seemed to gloss over that factor","684":"this is a book about people not events at times it is slow often it is sad and frustrating but overall the story is so believable i didn't always like the characters especially eileen sometimes ed although the ending makes them so flawed and human i found myself drawn into their messy imperfections","685":"read in english read all my reviews on http urlphantomhive booklikes com i received a free copy of this book from the publisher via netgalley in exchange for an honest review thank you this is the story of eileen and her irish american family in new york describing several generations from her youth her marriage to ed and her son connell life hasn't been easy on eileen even if it doesn't always show on the outside i think this is a novel we'll all hear a lot about in the coming months i did a quick check and it's already available for pre order even in a dutch online bookstore which most often means there are plans for translation already it fits perfectly in the genre for books that depict a family and also the changes in the world around them through a longer period of time i have to admit that i hadn't really read any of these novels yet but i certainly liked we are not ourselves and might pick up some others at moments i could really feel for eileen as she was trying to do what she believed was best and encounters setback after setback in hindsight some of the decisions made by the characters become more logical however the book comes in at over 600 pages and it felt a bit too long for me i think the story could've been in one or two hundred fewer pages adding to the readability of the book still i enjoyed reading it the prose read nicely and i would recommend it but you'll have to take some time to read it","686":"this review has been hidden because it contains spoilers to view it click here pretty good start then sad as all hell","687":"this book would have been a 4 star if it wasn't so long good grief it's as if there was no editor the story was great the characters were definitely well defined but i found myself skipping so much detail and missing nothing because it just went on and on","688":"this is one of those books that sticks with you long after you finish at times it seemed to drag when talking about everyday occurrences that come with life but it is all essential in the end it really emphasizes the importance of appreciating every day because you never know when it might come crashing down a very powerful read","689":"in a word heartbreaking rich and believable characters a perfect sense of changing times the difficulties of life a book that made me incredible sad but real life is rarely a constant picnic important reading","690":"this novel is so well written and filled with all the emotions and stuff of life pain sadness regret longing fear death guilt mistakes family lies friendship love joy desire lust compassion education baseball understanding honesty actualization truth and above all hope","691":"spectacular debut novel that looks at eileen her husband ed and their son colin as they go through ed's life with alzheimers i was stunned and taken by the depth of the characters and watching all of the emotions as they faced ed's decline and then how they rebuilt their lives afterwards great descriptions characters and dialogue can't wait to read the next book by this author","692":"i have very mixed feelings about this one i think it takes too long to get to the point of the story which i guess is the main character dealing with her husband's alzheimer's i think the author did an outstanding and incredible job of describing the progression of the disease and the relentless loss of abilities on the part of the victim though you would have a hard time finding a better depiction of that however it is was incredibly frustrating to me to read how long it took for eileen a nurse to figure out what was happening to her husband maybe i misunderstood the timeline but it seemed to take years and it was so obvious the man couldn't even transcribe numbers from one piece of paper to another and he was a brain researcher his son went to work with him ed was a college professor and the dad couldn't teach at all maybe at that time early onset alzheimer's wasn't as known but still i had another big issue and i am not sure i can explain it for most of the book the author describes the main characters a certain way but at the end he completely changes the person they were mainly ed the husband through their married life ed worked long hours teaching and researching and then would come home lay on the couch and listen to music with headphones he did not seem to be an involved parent or husband at all then at the end there is a lot of discussion and a letter from ed to his son describing all the catches they had the baseball games they attended the museums they went to the walks they took etc i was so surprised when did those take place did i sleep through those parts i felt like the same thing happened with ed and eileen's social life the author was always describing how isolated their family was and alone just the three of them then there is all this talk of all the dinner parties they attended the annual christmas dinners the barbecues etc it just didn't make sense to me i would definitely not recommend this one all the characters are people you hope to forget","693":" after reading many positive reviews i was disappointed i like long novels was drawn by the irish american theme but was frankly bored much of the time really hard to get through the core character's husband struggles with alzheimer's later in his life and i felt some connection here as my mom was a long time caregiver to my dad who struggles with the disease for years that my main connection was to that sadness maybe says it all part of it may also be a personal need to take a break from family epics as i've not enjoyed the last couple i've tried i side with the lower scoring reviewers here on goodreads on this one too long too flat under edited","694":"this book is not what i expected at all overall it was a good story that brought up a lot of different issues and it was interesting to see how the people in this family reacted and dealt with them it was a story about love dreams expectations and reality to me it seemed a complete account of the family and could of in fact really happened that way","695":"the first novel of this author is a masterpiece weaving the story of two children of alcoholics as they fall in love marry and build a life only to be challenged by the brilliant scientist husband facing early onset alzheimer's disease not an easy read in some places but well written","696":" a modern day epic that absolutely wrecked me a story of an irish american family a marriage the modern day economy and most importantly a woman who is striving to make more of her circumstances even if she ends up making mistakes it is eileen who is the heart of this novel and her relationship with her spouse ed and her son connell as ed slowly sucumbs to alzheimers and connell grows up and apart was realistic and devastating the last quarter of the novel brought me to tears especially ed's letter to connell i recommend this book but know that it will be a hard read it was for me","697":"for the first 100 pages i wasn't sure i could come to care about eileen leary and her daughter of irish immigrants quest for the american dream but somewhere in the middle of this family saga i fell into the story although i never fell in love with the characters","698":" this is a tough one to review because while it's beautifully written it's not for everyone it's really long my copy clocked in at 620 pages and concentrates on one family over a number of years my best comparison is to the corrections also for those who need their main character to be plucky and likable this is likely not for you still i think thomas writes accessibly and beautifully and his account of the life of eileen leary is brutally honest in particular when addressing her attempts at upward mobility at the occasional expense of her family's feelings and preferences eileen wants so much to have a certain type of life in a certain type of neighborhood of course she quickly learns that no house or neighborhood is going to make anything easier when dealt a true tragedy this book is raw and honest and is not afraid to show each character at his or her worst and best for that reason i do recommend it and will read anything else thomas publishes","699":"i really didn't like this book it took me forever to get through and i never really understood the point of it it follows one character throughout the entire book but then ends and wraps up with another character entirely it was interesting getting to peak into the life of alzheimer's but again that didn't even come into play until the second third of the book ultimately it left me scratching my head with remorse for all the time i spent trying to trudge through it","700":"like life this book had it's ups and downs which is appropriate given that it's the story of a family there were parts of the book that were very upsetting and difficult to read and more than once i found myself hating some of the characters for their intentions and reactions however their actions were real which is what made the book so compelling","701":"i've gotta say if anyone should have loved this book it was me with parents who grew up irish catholic in queens and a father who went to regis hs and spent his career in academia but for 600 pages nothing happens it is the every day life of not very interesting people they keep referring to it as epic in scope but i felt none of that these were terribly ordinary people living small lives not sure why i stayed with it so long can't understand the hype at all","702":"so many seemed to love this book or at the least liked it a lot i found it a bit on the boring side i tend to love books about multigenerational families but this one was so long and took a long time to get to any real subject matter i started out listening and despite the fact that the narrator mare winningham actress was very good i gave up and skim read the rest of it listening to every word even in a good book can become very tedious and tends to make me impatient wanting to yell get on with it the main character eileen was from an irish american family the book starts out with her family of origin eileen saw no affection between her parents she married ed a scientist and professor who she felt would be ambitious and together they would live the american dream unfortunately her dream was not realized as ed was not at all ambitious and later develops early onset alzheimer's they have one son connell and the beat goes on heroic characters as the book blurb states not really just ordinary people getting on with life in their own way","703":"not a good time for me to read this didn't know the topic before hand my bad but the author obviously lived through what he was writing about","704":"moving story of a marriage changed by early onset alzheimers","705":"my rating 3 5 starsthis is the family saga of an irish american family who lived in queens in the beginning of the 40's by being raised among her immigrant parents when eileen tumulty meets ed leary a brilliant scientist she is convinced that her life will change for better after several miscarriages eillen manages to conceive a son connell in the meantime she is obsessed in finding a new house in a \"good\" neighbor and suffers with her husband's lack of ambition when he refuses to work for a pharmaceutical company what makes their lives change then with 42 years old ed is diagnosed with alzheimer's disease in the meantime connell is attending to a college in chicago even being a professional nurse eillen will have to cope with this terrible disease and its consequence in their ordinary life despite the fact that the book is very well written and the plot is quite involving i found it is too long in my humble opinion as a first and debut novel this book has its own merits another interesting book about the same subject still alice by lisa genova see my review here tells the story of an alzheimer's patient but told by herself","706":"this is a long slow read but it is well worth it i am fond of stories that tell the lives of everyday people in a clear and perceptive way and this novel does that well","707":"wow i could relate to this book on many levels i saw myself in ed during his teaching years could relate to his illness and the impacts on others excellent read","708":"i hate to say it but i think despite the accolades this book is receiving it could have been greatly edited the writing is cold in that i do not feel what the characters are feeling there is so much repetition in making points things i've been told are no no's but what they heck do i know there is no predictability in this business i just know that after 150 pages i stopped so did two other readers i know i think he is a really good writer but again the book could have been pared down and the characters were more like sketches","709":" i am not sure how many stars to give this book it was too long and many of the characters not likable i found it difficult to read at times that being said the family's struggle with dealing with early onset alzheimer's disease was unflinchingly honest yet beautiful at the same time having a family member who succumbed to the same disease the everyday difficulties the family encountered rang true and touched me after all is said and done i think i would give this novel 3 and a half stars","710":"i was 150 pages into the book and thought about setting it aside as it didn't seem to be going anywhere on it's way to page 620 but i'm glad i didn't this is a pretty good effort for a first time novelist the book is at times quite grim but hope love and resilience thread their way in","711":" interesting portrait into an irish american family from the 1950's until now at first i was a little annoyed at how it was written it seemed disjointed with episodes from their life discussed in chapters and then never brought up again but eventually it all came together and i was really enjoying it the main character is a strong woman who endured a difficult childhood and became successful in her career as a nurse married a scientist professor had a son and then had to support and take care of her husband when he becomes ill like many immigrant families each generation worked hard to ensure their children and grandchildren had it better the ending is perfect except i would have liked to have known more of what her later life had been like","712":"i enjoyed reading this family portrait their hopes and dreams and disappointments and their ability to cope the love is in between the lines realistic and capturing a slice of american middle class life this is a well plotted and well executed novel no complaints and i hop e to see more from this author","713":"this review has been hidden

too and settle into a middle class life in jackson park but things are not all that they seem and this revelation is when the book begins to fall apart for me let me save you 300 pages of reading ed has alzheimer's somehow despite her nursing bonafides eileen takes years to discover something that the reader figures out in half the time the signs are all there from his forgetting his grades his mood swings his aloofness ext but apparently eileen never learned symptoms of the disease in medical school this leads to several moments that bounce wildly from cheap sentimentality to mean spirited bombast as eileen needs to find a way to take care of her husband and afford the couple's newly purchased house in bronxville one problem with the book i had was the sheer unlikability of eileen and connell eileen is so obsessed with owning a home that she comes across as selfish and highly self absorbed connell cares so much about being accepted by his peers including in a cringe worthy moment when he and his friends prank calls a korean kid and pretend to be looking for a chinese restaurant that he never developed much empathy from me along with being selfish eileen also carries around a lot of negative beliefs about people of color that further distanced me from her i also had a problem with thomas' decision to write the book in the third person since the story is mostly about eileen anyway why not just have her narrate it maybe he felt that the multi generation element of the book would be difficult to pull off if she narrated the story but in scenes when her parents die we need to be able to know what she is feeling to sympathize there are some good moments in the book like the scene when ed takes his son to class but at 648 pages the book is way too bloated padded and overblown to justify its thin story more","714":" my response to this book was all over the place i had to convince myself several times to keep reading i'm not sure if my problems with the book are rooted in not liking the characters as people or if i just didn't like the plotting or both what i am certain of is that i consistently had a sense of wishing the author would spend more time at some moments and hurry up through others that he wanted to pick apart at a snail's pace almost as if i was a passenger in a car because i needed to get to the final destination but i hated how the driver was driving i would definitely recommend this to people who enjoy family sagas as long as they are fine with characters that they don't find likable","715":"i loved this book so did my husband recommended it to my book club they gave it five stars","716":" i have just finished reading this and have to reflect before i write my review but i will say that although i liked none of the characters they are all rather self centered i liked how they developed through this intense real picture of three generations of a family searching for opportunity love and a measure of success completely authentic review from the nytas a young woman training for a graduate degree in nursing administration eileen tumulty longs for the day when she will marry and take another name it's the thoroughgoing irishness of tumulty with its redolence of \"peat bogs and sloppy rebel songs\" and deep defeat from which she yearns to detach herself she wants the sort of bland decorous wasp name that will label her as an unhyphenated american bright attractive and strong willed eileen is passionately ambitious determined to shake off the poverty haunted alcohol ridden atmosphere of her childhood and achieve not only wealth and comfort but a sense of belonging shame is the deeply buried force that drives her although matthew thomas's \"we are not ourselves\" tells the story of three generations of an irish american family the action is seen mainly from eileen's point of view she meets edmund leary the man she is to marry on a blind date on new year's eve an outing she has been vociferously resisting but as her roommate invites their two dates inside their apartment eileen thinks she hears both softness and strength in ed's voice and sure enough he seems to have an appealing gravity an admirable seriousness of purpose he knows she didn't have to come on this date he whispers in her ear but he promises to make it worth her time at these words \"her heart kicked once like an engine turning over on a wintry afternoon \"ed is a scientist a brain expert with a special interest in the effects of psychotropic drugs on neural functioning as they become a couple eileen sees a bright and prosperous future before them however what neither realizes is that they want very different things from life when merck offers ed a lab of his own with state of the art equipment and a team of assistants he turns it down in favor of a quiet life of teaching and scholarship the same thing happens some years later when he's offered the deanship of bronx community college though eileen makes her feelings very clear he refuses that job as well while she pictures the beautiful american life that's within their grasp her spouse stubbornly refuses to budge there are bitter quarrels about ed's career and yet as eileen reflects after many years and almost indescribable travail she understands that she had never believed in something called love until she met ed leary it was when she was dancing with him on that fateful new year's eve and he kissed her it was then that she experienced a sensation she had always thought of as \"malarkey \" the sense that \"everyone around them had disappeared and it was just the two of them \"it is this deep abiding love that is put to a terrible test when ed is found to have alzheimer's disease at the age of 51 here the novel takes a darker turn as eileen struggles with increasing desperation to keep ed with her and out of a nursing home the novel's description of the remorseless progress of the illness -- more aggressive at this time of life -- reads like a tortuous descent into hell it is one of fate's cruelties that an expert on the brain should slowly succumb to this particular illness amazingly however \"we are not ourselves\" isn't ultimately depressing written in calm polished prose following one family as its members journey through the decades in an american landscape that is itself in flux it's a long gorgeous epic full of love and life and caring it's even funny in places -- and it's one of the best novels you'll read this year","717":"this is an amazing story well written and very thought provoking","718":"complicated feelings at work here the subjects he weaves together--new york assimilation social mobility and class filial responsibility and alzheimer's--have a lot of resonance for me there'll be a bloom millions piece up in august stay tuned","719":" this novel feels like two different ones it begins as a view of a first generation irish family in woodside new york and an ethnic new york reader can identify clearly with the trials joys and challenges the experience presents with the marriage of the second generation however the novel becomes a painful exploration of the ravages of early onset alzheimer's disease on an upwardly mobile second generation family not only is the patient not himself but his wife whose story this really is doesn't really understand who she is either you could make a case that the first part of the novel with its celebration of sacrifice and loyalty in the face of a loveless existence is essential to the understanding of eileen's confrontation with her husband's disease eileen who sought to escape the drudgery of her parent's life winds up facing far worse in her own life while the novel is well written i found the meticulous attention to the heartbreaking details of this disease and its effect on everyone to be very depressing i probably wouldn t have chosen to read it","720":"wownow i have to get the rest of matthew thomas's books i'm sure i hope they are half as good as this book","721":" i've been processing this book for a few days after finishing it trying to decide the best way to review it first of all it was a rather long book that encompassed a long period of time from the 1950s to 2011 it's hard to give an accurate summary then i found myself unsure how to communicate what it was that i liked about the book because i wasn't even exactly sure what it was i'll do my best the book is about eileen it begins with her relatively affectionless childhood where at a young age she was required to care for herself and her parents we continue to follow her through the beginnings of her career as she meets her husband as she eventually has as little boy connelly it's detailed and specific without getting wordy in fact the prose remains fairly aloof from the ups and downs of the leary family just the same when tragedy befalls them i found myself a bit melancholy the next morning without understanding why for a while it was because i felt as if something bad had happened to a family i knew and cared about in fact it was just a bit too realistic it felt entirely plausible because of that it made it harder to like i don't prefer to encounter too much reality in the books i read i have a certain vulnerability when reading there's a fine amount of trust that is given the author that as i entrust my thoughts and emotions to them that they will be gentle if they can't be kind there were parts that were neither gentle nor kind like real life it was brutal and often very sad ed's letter to his son connell made me frankly cry which i'm not usually given to the book would definitely be rated r for sex and language which again i read to escape that kind of thing not encounter it reading about the intimacies and all to true to life flaws of people is uncomfortable and sad the things that happen are unfortunate i don't want to feel sorry for the characters i read about i want them to triumph i think the triumph came in the love they shared and the lessons they learned also not unlike real life but it's still sad over all i would recommend this book it's long it's hard it's quite lovely at times the letter ed wrote to connell cemented this book in my mind as one of the best i've read but some of the other parts didn't sit as well with me","722":"an unflinching portrayal of alzheimer's disease","723":"greatest novel to come out of queens ever","724":"probably more of a 3 5 star book for me i think the book is a bit too long and i lost steam about 2 3 of the way through but ultimately it was worth finishing the author does a good job of making the characters complex and three dimensional but because there isn't necessarily a lot of action it's not really a book you can't put down a worthwhile read but not necessarily a book i'd put on my favorites list","725":" this is a well structured beautifully written book about one woman's middle class american life beginning in fifties and ending in the present day we meet eileen at age 10 and follow her through school college her career and creating a family of her own it focuses chiefly on her relationships first with her parents and later with her husband truly i found it a little short on plot at least until it gets to the part where she and her husband have to face a huge and unavoidable crisis one that affects millions of people all over the world it's a long book and that's fine with me when the story is compelling and merits all those pages i think this novel could have used some additional editing as at times the narrative drags if you enjoy books that are mainly centered on character and how our childhood shapes our adult choices you may find this a worthy read","726":"characters stayed with me for a long long time loved this book","727":" matthew thomas' debut novel we are not ourselves is a rewarding read in the long run due to the author's strong sense of perspective but suffers from page to page in its prose detailing three generations of an irish american family in 20th century new york city the novel is bound to be thick but there is such stark contrast in the first and second half that it could be two separate novels the central figure in the story is eileen leary the american born daughter of irish immigrants in the first half of the book thomas focuses on eileen's childhood and her growing up too quickly in a small apartment with hard working alcoholic parents the second part of the book concentrates on eileen's relationship with her own family and her struggle to care for her husband who suffers from an unexpected disease all while raising her son connell thomas has a very strong grasp of characterization eileen ed and connell - and even eileen's parents - all emerge as memorable characters as they develop within the same family structure thomas writes mostly from eileen's perspective but in the latter half switches to connell's on occasion with a finely tuned capacity to understand these character's points of views thomas often writes short chapters and quick vignette style scenes in a linear progression by the end of the novel a reader has a full portrait of the characters' everyday lives but also a clear indication of how they have changed the novel's literary value is in the development of the characters however because of the size and scope of the novel thomas' prose feels rushed eager to move forward the short scenes he writes often fail to draw the reader into the moment particularly in the first half of the novel far too often the author tells us exactly what eileen thinks sees and feels and sometimes it is frustrating not to decipher it for ourselves thomas leaves very little about character emotion and motivation for interpretation on the micro level at other points especially with connell the writing becomes elevated interrupting the flow of the discourse in terms of plot the length means that some minor characters and themes are never given the full attention they deserve for example thomas forgets about eileen's relationship to ed's mother after the marriage another example of an unresolved plot line is the faith healer who tells us that ed is fighting for his soul and that the spirits of ed and connell have been interacting with each other thousands of years creating anomalous mysticism that fails to impact readers in an otherwise straightforward story the novel occurs over so many decades that the prose feels underwhelming and inconclusive at times we are not ourselves can be frustrating to read because thomas has so much to get through although his ability to narrate in the third person without sacrificing the limitations of eileen's or connell's individual perspective is admirable almost certainly the novel could be shorter or at least split into separate stories as the content is so varied from the first to the second half instead of trying to capture three generations thomas may have been more successful focusing on the effects of ed's disease on the family overall this debut novel feels like two novels packed into one but a good read nonetheless","728":"excellent touching heart breaking and a little scary to think of what the future could hold the story of a family and their deep love for one another even when they are striving for different goals it is a long book 600 pages and sometimes tough to read because of the subject matter but a fantastic book never the less i didn't want to put it down","729":" if we are not ourselves then who are we that's the question that thomas weaves into this beautifully rendered multigenerational novel but doesn't so much try to answer as much as letting the carefully created lives speak for themselves as they discover as much about themselves as we do we are not ourselves follows eileen leary nee tumulty a girl born of irish immigrants living in queens as she deals with a semi tumuiltous childhood as a young woman in nursing school she meets and marries ed leary a studious neighborhood kid making good as a research scientist before becoming a college professor they have a son connell move from jackson heights at the height of the neighborhood cultural shift to bronxville to a house they can barely afford but deeply covet all the while ed starts acting out in strange ways that eileen cannot fully understand leading to a devastating diagnosis yet her devotion love and determination only grow into something more devote while there is a thread of melancholy that wends its way through it is quite life affirming of a novel showing how through the choices we make and those we have no choice in contribute to a life that needs to be lead for that is where your life is in the details if we are not ourselves then it is because we are always changing finding new and deeper layers to our core selves","730":"come on matthew - i'm ready for another good good","731":" stories about families dealing with alzheimer's parkinson's and or dementia wreck me and this novel was no different even if you don't know someone who's succumbed to one of these illnesses the way thomas captures the passage of time in his character's lives as well as their less likable behavior alongside their redeeming qualities made for a novel i didn't want to put down if you're looking for a fast paced plot driven book this one won't be your cup of tea still add it to your to read list for a time when you want to dive into character driven writing you won't be disappointed","732":" in some ways this is just a simple story about an irish american family the beginning reminded me of angela's ashes but this family becomes an archetype for all families eileen first the daughter burdened by her parents then the young woman filled with hopes for a better life then the wife and mother who makes mistakes and has to cope with the burden of her brilliant modest loving hardworking husband's alzheimer's illness and the son connor who disappoints but is loved unconditionally and eventually matures and becomes the good man his father hoped he would become the lumbering pace of the novel put me off at first until i realized the pace had to be slow because a life doesn't just pass in an instant thomas wrote so much of life was the peeling away of illusions when i was young i lived with the illusion that everything was possible i'd be the perfect mother wife teacher friend daughter sister i never anticipated that life was going to give me things to be angry at as thomas says or that i might be consumed by that anger when i was young i took so much for granted thomas reminds us of the myriad infinitesimal pleasures and beauties of life that are so precious there is so much to live for the citrus snap of fresh black tea the compression and release of a warm stack of folded towels carried to the closet between two hands the tinny resonance of children in the distance when heard through a bedroom window the mouth fullness of cannoli cream the sudden twitch of a horse's ear to chase a fly the neon green of the outfield grass the map of wrinkles in one's own hand the smell and feel even the taste of dirt the comfort of a body squeezed against one's own oh my this novel is soooo good","733":"too long too depressing","734":"terrific book","735":"a lot has been said about unlikeable characters being a poor criterion of what makes a book good or alive but i couldn't bring myself to care about anyone in this novel and the emotional impact really suffered for it i actually almost took a little pleasure when something bad happened to eileen even though those bad things mostly occurred through her blameless but boring and barely sketched out husband i got so bored of reading about this racist white lady and her unattainable american dream thomas is invested in telling you all the details of her day to day life and for a book with such a devastating revelation at its center it feels like nothing is really happening but really what is with all the place names and baseball statistics at points it felt like that snl sketch of a show set in california where the drama keeps being interrupted by driving directions","736":"we are not ourselves by matthew thomas | madaboutthebookshttp helannsta com 2014 08 19 we ar","737":" horrendously painful for two primary reasons 1 the circumstances vacillate from horrible to hell no one is happy or satisfied the protagonist is miserable from childhood to old age virtually nothing good happens ever 2 every awful thing drags on for at least 100 pages you anticipate the inevitable but it takes the author eons to get you there so frustrating i'm still not sure how i pushed myself to endure this book in it's 620 page entirety but now that i've conquered it i wish i hadn't","738":"great read frustrating when you find how your life relates so well sometimes very honestly written foolish monetary decisions wanting to live better than those around us spending more than we ought to not being able to put someone else's needs before our own and in retrospect seeing how that backfires taking the easy way out and feeling the shame wonderful book","739":"wrenching this book made me frustrated and broke my heart and i'm a little mad at the author for toying with my emotions like this if anything the suffering of eileen might make your own burden seem small how bitterly you can weep for people who are not strictly real i read the author's question and answer at the end of the book and he said he meant for it to give people hope about what they can withstand from this life and it did the exact opposite for me it left me despairing about the fate of humans how small and inconsequential our lives and our happinesses how every good thing will end how your best hope is to live a beautiful life with someone you will eventually lose slowly or suddenly or both i can not recommend this book not because it wasn't very good but because it was crushing i have been flattened and i suppose that is the hallmark of good fiction and that does not make me feel any better about it read at your own risk","740":"reaching the end of a book in tears is a sign of excellence for me what an excellent first novel this is from matthew thomas i didn't know what to expect from it it started out as a story of irish immigrants but before long that aspect became simply a piece of background and the heart of the book revealed itself as love family aspirations disappointments and accepting and making the most of what life offers us","741":" it may have taken him ten years to write but matthew thomas's we are not ourselves is certainly worth the effort in william shakespeare's king lear the title character tells his courtiers gloucester and kent and the fool we are not ourselves when nature being oppressed commands the mind to suffer with the body it is from this that matthew thomas takes the title of his novel we are not ourselves a novel long listed for the guardian first book award the quote is certainly apt centring on eileen tumulty a woman in pursuit of the american dream we are not ourselves follows the unravelling of her husband ed leary who is struggling with early onset alzheimer's disease as his family comes to terms with the disease and its effects both physically and mentally both eileen and ed begin to understand who they really are it is easy to see why we are not ourselves took ten years to write aside from being 620 pages long the sheer detail of the characters' lives from childhood through to old age must have required a lot of preparation and background work to make them come to life on the page the work has paid off however eileen is particularly well done thomas encapsulates her pursuit of the american dream and the change of her personality and even likeability as she starts to care for her husband her suburban and difficult life towards the beginning of the novel where she copes with her parents' alcoholism sets the ground for her constant pursuit of something better even as it almost dupes the reader by not preparing us for ed's illness later on however the detail of eileen's life does mean that we are not ourselves occasionally lacks tension and pace the beginning of the novel is particularly slow to start with but it is worth sticking with once the focus shifts onto eileen's marriage the story picks up immeasurably the latter stages were difficult to put down but one thing thomas does well is not straying into too many sentimental moments eileen's career as a nurse helps with this somewhat her practical approach to her husband's disease means a more rugged realistic approach to a sensitive topic area - an approach which very much benefits the novel as a whole for a first novel we are not ourselves is an accomplished and engaging work let's hope his next one doesn't take another ten years to write","742":"i think the end summed up the entire book and some parts became so clear","743":"i think this was a good well written book from a literary critic's perspective it was a difficult book to read in that the characters were frustrating and being about a youngish man's decent into alzheimer's sad","744":"i thought this book had promise at the very start but it was a chore to read characters were not attractive so long inconsistent only trudged through because it was a book club read","745":"it's hard for me to write a review of this book since i just finished it and am still emotionally raw from it maybe that in itself is sort of a review i think it would be impossible not to be moved in some way by this book the beginning of the book is fine but i found myself wondering what the author could possibly spend the next 500 pages on after it took him only 100 to get main character eileen tumulty from 8 years old to somewhere in her 40s i won't say what happens next since all the reviews and the book's own publicity seem to be treating this plot turn as a spoiler even though i thought it was pretty obvious what was happening but i soon realized that it was critical for author matthew thomas to set up eileen's past and develop her character in these early pages in order to tell the main story with maximum emotional resonance not for everyone not even sure if it was for me but well done powerful stuff","746":" this book left me feeling highly disappointed i had read such great reviews and even seen this book on people's best of 2014 lists but it did nothing for me the prose is quite nice and the words themselves are not hard to read the story is a whole other matter there are some good moments for sure but they are few and far between the majority of the book is a boring depressing frustrating tale of mother and son growing up in different eras and generations around new york city the mother eileen is the main character and we learn of her early life as an irish catholic family in a time where they were the norm in her area of the city her father drinks her mother drinks but then goes to rehab and eileen spends much of her time taking care of both and running the household she grows up she goes to nursing school and she meets ed ed soon becomes her husband they get their own home and it's all very nice if not original the main fault i had with the novel is that the author seems to skip the majority of moments that prove and display eileen and ed's affection for one another ed is frustrating aloof and seems completely uninterested in what eileen wants for herself and her family the two have a son connell who then has chapters of his own as he grows the main plot point of the story is introduced around midway as ed after having been behaving even worse than usual is diagnosed with early onset alzheimer's the whole of connell's story feels like a forced father son growing up story but misses having any heart at all connell was never more than a selfish at times idiotic character the book could have done without while it's possible to sympathize for eileen the heartfelt moments lacked emotional credibility because i found myself not having believed in her or ed's marriage in the first place by the end of the book the only emotion i felt was relief that i was finally done","747":"oh man two books about alzheimers in 2 months it was a good book but also very hard time to read something more cheery","748":" we are not ourselves is an intimate portrait of a family struggling with modern issues of identity and self of obligation and guilt and of image and the need to put on a brave face i'm not going to kid you it's heavy but if you love realistic fiction this novel is well worth the read even after suffering through tragedy and a bit of chaos with this family i found myself deeply moved by the end the ending itself is beautiful this is one of those works of literature that will leave you thinking and reflecting on life i would actually give it a 4 5 if goodreads would let me","749":"a tragic story that ends in hope makes compelling reading thomas' debut 610 page novel tells a story that could happen to anyone what happens when your spouse is diagnosed with alzheimer's in his 50's how do you explain his bizarre behaviors to your high school aged son how does cope with dad who mentally and emotionally is no longer dad how do you cope with the financial burden how does your life continue lawyers suggest divorce so that medicaid will help but emotionally how can do you that how do you handle working a full time job and coming home to nurse your spouse and how do you keep your heart from breaking when he's moved to a nursing home beautifully written this story will stay with the reader long after the book has been read","750":"i received this book for free through goodreads first reads per my own rating system i have to give this three stars because i finished reading it but it took a long time and it felt like work at times in fact near the end i was speed reading just to get it over with hoping there would be some big payoff that would make reading the thing worth it there wasn't but there were some interesting and compelling elements to this books things i enjoyed and appreciated i can relate to eileen a girl who grew up wanting more of the american dream and strived to make that happen to eileen as a middle aged woman looking back on her aspirations and realizing the limits of what she can actually accomplish and eileen as a wife who when tragedy strikes makes herself into a hero rather than a victim otherwise it reads like an everyday account of an everyday person in everyday america i kept waiting for something to happen that would really hook me but it never did","751":" three parts of wanou0026gt first part drew me in right away eileen tumulty's early life struggles and path to a brighter future u0026gt the middle part was very slow and at times tiresome it is hard to keep going u0026gt but then the in the last third it gets better again and also as a reader you realize why the lagging and rigmarole middle part was so essential to the story as a whole general thoughtsforever i kept thinking where this plot was going i had no idea and would never have expected what is revealed in the last third of the book repeatedly i wondered what it was that was being portrayed what this story was about until reader finds himself herself in the midst of a very very realistic story the sense of fiction decreases and the sense of realism starts overtaking reality maybe in addition an other thing is very satisfying for the reader the title of the book makes so much sense now it pays off having oneself worked through the boring middle section it is eileen's story and yet it is the reader's story somehow suddenly that is the magic of the book the shift of being someone else's story to becoming one's personal story happens as soon as the reader realizes s he's been in a similar situation to eileen's planning life ideally seizing opportunities and dismissing others setting goals pursuing a brighter future running after the best me and in the end achieving what you dreamt of and at the same time not achieving what you've dreamt of but something completely different we are not ourselves cleverly and smoothly illustrates how we their to seize life in and with our own hand and from it like forming sand in the palm of our hand but then unexpectedly watching that very same sand we just thought we were in control of running slipping through our fingers through the learys novelist matthew thomas charts the story of the american century particularly the promise of domestic bliss and economic prosperity that captured hearts and minds after wwii grcontent aspects a generation story family tragedies and how to handle them a classic american story a book about women's strengths about girl power a book about money status and wealth and how it matters to us to people a book about culture and culture shift between generations in the us a book about alzheimer a book about the meaning of life subtly a book about identity this is an identity work at its finest a book about the pursuit of happiness who we are u0026amp who we think we are u0026amp who we want to be u0026amp who we end up being an ironic book the scientist who loses his knowledge eileen complains about her neighborhood being more and more populated by immigrants when her parents were irish immigrants formal aspects some magical wow moments which feel like an having an epiphany about life's journey evocative images and moving language on eobvious strength the novel has is they way how it evolves unfolds slowly and delicately what it is about","752":"overall not impressed by this book it had moments where i hoped it was starting to be great but it just never clicked for me","753":"this book was really depressing not just because of something big that happens to one character but because i didn't like any of the characters it's a book starring unlikable people treating each other poorly for the most part","754":"bear in mind my rating is based on the fact that i could not finish the book so it may not be reflective of a review where someone has read the entire 600 pages however that was the problem with the book i found the tone flat the characters dull and uninteresting and the story plodding and depressing i just could not fathom dragging myself through the following nearly 500 pages perhaps it has some redeeming value somewhere along the line the professional reviews seem to think so but i can't continue to read about people who go nowhere in their lives and are at such cross purposes with one another the most unfortunate part of this book is that it is written by a graduate of the mfa program at ucirvine where i got my ba in english i'd like to support a fellow alum but it will have to wait for another stab at a novel from matthew thomas","755":"wow i don't even know how to describe this book i will first say that the author's writing is genius secondly this book is not for those that are looking for an uplifting happy fiction read the author is so talented that you think will think it's non fiction about a family of 3 generations it is an emotional read i felt anger sadness shock and most of all informed of what it is like to have a family member with alzheimer's my grandmother died of alzheimer's but because of distance i wasn't around to see what it was like for her and my extended family what a horrible disease if you decide to read this book you need to hang in there for the first 100 pages as it is pretty slow in the beginning but will make more sense later lastly i can't believe this book author hasn't won more awards than it has","756":" omg it took me so long to finishhhhhhh this is why i don't listen to audiobooks that have more than 10 discs worth the effort yeah sure i like a good multi generational epic family story this one had a lot to say about faith in the future upward mobility and the breadth and limitations of familial love i listened to 90% of this on audio but read the last 20 pages in print i think i liked the audio better i think the literarylanguage might have kept me from actually getting into the story so there's something","757":"i really want to give this 3 5 stars but i'll be generous it's really really well written no doubt this is gorgeous prose however it draaaaagged along for far too long like a couple hundred pages too long the end gutted me it redeemed the mucking along middle of the book for me personally a wonderful story of a family and history both theirs and new york's","758":"this book was at times excruciating to get through but by the end i was glad i had read it it says a lot about love and life and family and it's a deeply moving account of what it means to be human would recommend and say to stick with it even amongst its more tragic moments","759":"i did not think i'd enjoy this book at all as i tend to be allergic to male authors but surprise this was a wonderful engaging portrait of a loving hard working woman's life i'm really impressed with how well drawn the protagonist eileen was the peter pannish son connell is a thoroughly modern character unflinchingly shown in all his selfishness there's a guy only his parents could love ed's final letter to connell is a masterpiece","760":" when i started reading this debut novel i wondered whether i would even finish it after all it was 620 pages quite an undertaking for a novice but i kept reading devouring every page living every moment with eileen tumulty leary daughter of irish immigrants through her youth as she cared for her parents while yearning for a better life her career in nursing brought her stability recognition empathy and later her marriage to ed leary whom she loved absolutely their son connell born to them after years of waiting decisions difficult decisions needing to be made it's all here in her story the good the bad the ugly the exuberant the tortuous the sad the reflective the determined her son is bullied by classmates her husband is bullied by his students she was smart and strong but there were times when she just wanted to be foolish and weak the super human way that she is bread winner caregiver meal planner grocery shopper laundress there is a tenderness about her when her nursing is needed at home as well as at the hospital matthew thomas' prose borders on poetry it was a joy to read i read this arc courtesy of the publisher","761":"poignant heartbreaking and heartwarming best book i've read this year kudos to mr thomas for all the exquisite writing","762":"in the end it's really a story about love the love that's shared through an imperfect yet average marriage the love that's shared between parents and their children a love for life i didn't particularly enjoy the first half primarily because i didn't really care for eileen she always seemed focused on the wrong things status a nice house fancy things and ignored what she did have when the story takes a turn midway and life throws the leary's a curve the novel really improves eileen still lacks empathy but the relationships change and deepen and in the end eileen grows into a person who though still not lovable is very real and honest thomas took ten years to write the novel it's obvious he improved his craft over time","763":"sometimes i felt this was a really good book and other times i felt it dragged i would give it a 3 5 but thought it was good enough to round up versus down","764":"a weighty read it took me quite a long time to get through although it is beautifully written maybe i am just heartless or it is because i am at a completely different part of my life that this book didn't have the emotional effect on me that it had on other people even so the message rings true we are not ourselves rather we are shaped into who we are by our family and the people we surround ourselves with epic i guess so in terms of following one woman through her entire life but when i think of epic i think of a hefty book that builds worlds peoples and contains heroic battles in this book i guess you could say that eileen's family is battling to find themselves i am glad i took the time to read it even though it could have been trimmed up a bit","765":" my five stars are for the audio version this is a story that is riveting for its everyday ness there is no murder no betrayal no psychotic break it's simply a regular family living through the ups and downs the misunderstandings and makeups during decades of marriage at times it brought me to tears other times the gifted writing of matthew thomas left me in awe this in bed after a marital spat touch was their high ground when the slick cliff of words proved treacherous thomas stuns throughout with such originality and sensitivity can't wait to read more of matthew thomas","766":"i loved this book it was full of life and so real these weren't just characters they were real living beings living their lives i couldn't put it down","767":"eileen was ambitious to move her family out of the city to westchester but her husband ed was not on board for that kind of moving up in the world her son particularly had trouble finding his way particularly worrying that he would be beset with his fathers same illness i felt like eileen spent her life trying to get there while at the same time trying to help ed make it through in comfort i liked this book","768":"i was totally engrossed in this story right there with the characters at times very emotional often very real especially when the characters made imperfect choices quite long but never tedious for me","769":"wanted to love it but merely liked it i was drawn by the opening vignette and it chugged away at a good pace for the first 100 pages or so and then got bogged down only to free up around the 400th page a character study of an irish girl and the bonds of family and love over a lifetime the strange thing is that although this is a fierce love story eileen really hangs in there i never felt that there was fierce love but the writing is at times breath taking and there is a real truth to this story this is a love built for the long run and a stubbornness to see it through now i need a short funny less demanding book please","770":" this isn't an easy book to read it is filled with details and description of feelings surrounding the dreaded reality of alzeimers at times i felt as if the book was worth more stars than available to use to rate it other times i was ready to toss the book the character development was absolutely beautiful so i found myself ploughing through the slower sections i also have to say that this is one of the few accounts of alzeimers that seemed totally honest throughout the entire book i recommend this book","771":"while i enjoyed this book it was far far too long 620 something pages i was so aware from the start of the book of its length that it was a bit off putting for me it follows the main character eileen from the time she was a younger child of about 10 years old to when she finally retires and all that came in between these years it was a somber book and for some reason even though eileen was depicted as being a pretty selfless person i felt there was something unlikable about her","772":"enjoyed this characters are beautifully written and the story is uncomplicated but reflects an interesting story of a first generation emigrant irish family which made it relatable to me a good solid read","773":" the chapters pass quickly but the book reads slowly i absorbed this story in my bones it paints a full picture but was so hard to read because it's so sad it was draining like hanging out with a pessimist there were no good things in between the sad moments it was uncomfortable because one small thing led to another and it felt like things were going to get out of hand very quickly i'm glad it switched voices so i could get connell's perspective as well as eileen's i thought ed's would come in as well but the story was able to be told with just the two of them the rant against the healthcare system was true but awkwardly placed it conveyed the panic when things are falling apart but i felt it could've been weaved in as they explored options and come across more lightly than the monologue did a few quotes from the book 'don't ever love anyone ' her mother said picking the papers up and sliding them into the bureau drawer she'd kept her ring in 'all you'll do is break your own heart ' at school she usually had the answer worked out before the other girls put up their hands but the last thing she wanted was to draw any kind of attention to herself she would have chosen of all powers the power to be invisible she had enough energy to make important changes in her life to pull her husband out of a pit to yank her whole family out of the maw of a neighborhood that threatened to swallow them whole she wondered whether she should have forced her hand sooner but they gave out no manual when you got married no emergency kit with a flashlight for when the power went out you had to feel your way around in the dark for the box of matches find all my reviews at http readingatrandom blogspot com","774":"the writing is brilliant and this soul wrenching sad sad story hit so close to home i was reminded of my own family of 1st u0026amp 2nd generation european immigrants on almost every page maybe because of this i also found it profoundly depressing -- in the same way i felt immobilized for days after reading franzen's the corrections so while i can't say that i actually liked this book it's not often that i am so deeply affected by a story we are not ourselves is an amazing debut and matthew thomas is talented with a capital t read as a netgalley advance copy","775":"an outstanding novel i was absorbed in the story of eileen leary daughter of irish immigrants who grew up in queens ny in e 1950s eileen isn't really a sympathetic character in many ways but she is compelling i don't want to say too much about the story as it's better to let it slowly unfold without foreknowledge highly recommended","776":"3 5 stars this is not the type of novel i normally read it started slowly for but i found myself very interested as the novel progressed the end was lovely if not a bit heartbreaking","777":" a multigenerational debut novel of an irish american family from queens my hometown which begins in the early 70's my coming of age years i knew i would automatically relate my thoughts that the sexual revolution of the 1960's simply never happened in queens was validated and with reviews such as \"destined to be a classic\" i thought i would love this book instead i do not know how to rate it this story is completely character driven and not plot based which i normally do not mind and can enjoy ex \"someone\" by alice mcdermott however in this novel i kept waiting for something rather than the obvious to happen yes the main character a good irish girl couldn't wait to get married yes she wanted the american dream etc for me the real problem was that i didn't like or dislike the characters which is important in a character driven novel still the writing was superb especially when the author is describing the husband's personality change caused by alzheimer's disease which reads like a slow descent into hell while reading this book for a review i fluctuated from two to four stars now that i finished it i'll settle on a three","778":"this was beautifully written but terribly depressing","779":"people expressed this book being a downer unlikeable characters and not edited well i like books with rather unlikeable characters first of all as they are more real this book was like diving into the middle of a family's life encountering all the weaknesses fears vagaries of growing older joys and disappointments of life in general in 20th and 21st century america thumbs up","780":"excellent writing plotless books always confuse me but i do love them this is just a life nothing truly extraordinary happens and yet it is beautiful","781":"this story was somehow quiet and unassuming and yet deeply impactful painful at times and uncomfortably thought provoking the nyt review used the phrase calm polished prose which i think is a perfect description this is not big lyrical writing but it is still beautiful and actually beautiful i think in its simplicity the main characters in the story struck me as being incredibly real and normal though this is a character driven novel as opposed to a plot driven one i don't feel that there's much i can say without spoiling the steady plot progression in all a book that came out of nowhere and surprised me a bit i'm glad i read it and will have to continue processing how and why it got to me so much","782":"this long probably overly so family saga is a treat for anyone who enjoys multigenerational stories of fully fleshed out complex characters whose lives are a strange mosaic of trying to push away from their backgrounds and strive for better or at least different the main character is bright ambitious and driven to rise above her working class queens ny background while her cautious and root bound husband anchors her to the old neighborhood and the old values their son draws from each but also has to come to peace with his parents' compromises as well as the specter of the disease that he may have inherited from his father","783":" when i started this novel i was expecting the standard story of a daughter of poor irish immigrants in nyc who strives for a better life for herself the jacket cover and synopsis indicates nothing much more than that i appreciate that this work of fiction takes on a story line which has most often been reserved for a female character but not in this case it is a rather long book which shows realistic detailed accounts of the characters' relationships without the use of drama for drama's sake","784":"didn't finish this one it dragged plodded on and on and by the time i stopped reading about 25% into the looong book i realized i wasn't invested in any of the characters and really didn't much like even one of them so i quit well written but i just couldn't go on","785":"it is an enjoyable book but a tough one if it is looking to describe the current new yorker through three generations he has succeeded it is dark though and at times little redemptive value of any character but at times beautiful writing and am glad i read it","786":"this book is long and felt even longer than its 600 pages i wanted to really really like this book it had so much potential to be a meaty emotional read which i love it wasn't writing was good just never enough insight into characters and relationships and at times i just wanted it to be over","787":"i am so impressed with this book the characters are so real that i couldn't stop thinking about them concerned about their problems irritated at their behavior worried about them etc i had to remind myself they are 'only' characters the beginning was a little slow as the world came to life but suddenly i was hooked and couldn't put it down i believe eileen is going to be hanging around in my head for awhile to the author bravo","788":"while this book got great reviews i was not blown away i found the book and story longer than they needed to be and the plot was predictable too the characters were hard to relate to","789":"tough call on this one writer is very good story is of course heart breaking but overall way too long and for me too much frustration u0026amp anger with most of the characters especially eileen","790":"this book has all the hype and that may be overinflated the writing is quite clinical so even when trying to convey emotion and capture some relatable slice of life matthew thomas's writing reads with the emotional depth of a grocery list i respect the scope and the difficulty of the subject matter but ultimately did not care about any of these people even though they were such jerks they should have been infuriating i'd read his next novel to see if it's better maybe eh","791":"really good story a bit wordy and too detailed but very touching and well written","792":"this book drags on and at times it is painful intentionally so i can't say it is was always an enjoyable read but i can say that i will forever be a different person for having read it i suspect that is preferable for a work of literature if also unpopular nowadays i've never encountered such an expert and honest portrayal of it's subject matter and i find myself thinking about it often this book is not for everyone but it probably should be","793":"important and moving and mature mature in the way that people become when that discover what this thing called life is not what it's about what it is","794":"according to my kindle i sobbed through the last 40% of this novel in my opinion that's just a little too dehydrating to give it 4 stars this one is more of a 3 5 than a 3 though","795":"this is a debut novel and i can hardly wait for the next one eileen tumulty born in 1941 spends her childhood caring for her parents in queens she becomes a nurse finds a wonderful man ed leary and they marry and have a son connell the family story is poignant and moving highly recommended","796":" okay i don't think the description of irish saga is what this book is about a better description would be it is a urban middle class family's struggle to cope and transition with unexpected challenges if you can stick with it this is a long book it provides lots of fictional but true insight into family behavior and coping methods my only wish as a reader is that the coverage of the main characters would have been balanced out through out the book i felt there was a lot of expansive scenery dressing and an edit to this would have helped","797":"the second half of this book was much better than the first half the first part surprisingly felt very contrived and superficial to me but the second half made up for it with its depth of characters and lived up to what i expect when reading a hyde book all along i wanted to give it 3 stars until the second part which touched me so much that i nearly gave it 4 stars i'm still unsure about my rating","798":" this poem by jane hirshfield appeared on my facebook feed this morning and struck me as the perfect epigraph to this book my life was the size of my life its rooms were room sized its soul was the size of a soul this is indeed a book about a life sized life its greatest value is in how that life shines forth as whole and worthy without the grand narrative strategies through which a character is usually redeemed there is neither a grand epiphany and realignment of values nor a dramatic act that punctuates the life as a success or failure there is just a person who is neither significantly more insightful nor significantly more ignorant than the average person who goes through her life learning some things but failing to learn some others whose circumstances are shaped more by fate and chance than by choices she freely makes in other words she's more like most of us than she isn't as is true for most of us the choices she makes are neither fully condemned nor fully affirmed by their aftermath there is just an exchange of one set of circumstances for another and an adaptation to those new circumstances eileen is most remarkable in her resilience and buoyancy her ability to work determinedly within the limits self imposed or otherwise of her life to not give in to despair as her mother did in watching her you witness how an average person makes what they can of their life no more no less and yet i bought we are not ourselves after attending a reading by matthew thomas as a local book festival it's not normally the kind of book that grabs my attention but i was inspired by his remarkable story of working on it for ten years until he felt it did justice to his original vision of his characters and their lives as someone who is attempting to write a novel for the first time and who has battled with my fear of ruining a good story which i might not yet have the skills to convey his story gave me hope i can continue to work on my book until it is good i was also struck by how deep his emotional connection with his characters seemed to be as he discussed them in light of the excerpts he read from the book he came across as such a humble soul capable of such intense compassion the effect was touching and profound i couldn't wait to read his book i was sure that once i did it would be a four star book at minimum i mean after that impression of the author and the million dollar bidding war over his book and all the praise it's received how could i do anything but love it and in the end i did love it but not like i thought i would i did not love it easily or right away i came to that love over time through living with the book's flaws and my frustration with them through resisting the impulse to abandon the book when it was most difficult to love it thus living its moral through the reading of it that the circumstances that led to my reading it made me not want to think badly of the book made it all the more jarring when i did i found that characters sometimes collapsed into two dimensions philosophical and political monologues sometimes arose unnaturally in dialogue rendering the story temporarily pedantic symbolism was sometimes a bit too on the nose pacing varied widely in other words for all its realism the seams showed at times reminding this reader that the author was trying to make a point by writing something a certain way killing the illusion it was easy to tell that the novel had been written across a very long span of time it was uneven and its different parts didn't quite cohere it pained me to think a little more than halfway through it that i would only be able give it three stars if i was honest about my experience of reading it i was relieved and happy that the book did the opposite of what so many books do it got better the closer it approached its end and matthew thomas stuck the landing so well that it redeemed the struggles i had while reading it and made it easy to give it four stars after all in the end this book's strengths are greater than its weaknesses it is emotionally affecting and you do care about the characters especially the central characters of eileen ed and connell who come across as complex and real you reach the end and feel you've learned something about life that could have only been learned by following these characters through their lives something that could never be conveyed by an abstract statement attempted in summary their stories stay with you and make you think about your own life a little differently the first 100 pages of we are not ourselves were the most difficult for me to get through but there were also some parts in the middle that were a slog while much of the book is languid and kept me turning pages easily some parts required me to push through them as i could some of my difficulty with the first section of the novel was how idealized and unreal i found eileen's father mike to be he verges on being a gary stu character he's strong and traditional and one of the guys someone who commands immediate respect with a powerful frame and confident demeanor yet is also intelligent sensitive more progressive than his peers less racist he is full of profound wisdom that others absorb with rapt attention on and on it goes i felt like maybe this was supposed to convey a child's idealization of a parent but that was never quite clear there were never any moments in which the filter of idealization dropped away i got tired of reading about mike and was relieved when he faded to the background as a character i frequently struggled to understand eileen and probably had the most trouble connecting with her in that same first section of the book where i was having trouble connecting to mike it was clear that her experiences growing up in a working class family with little ease and freedom shaped the desires that drove her through the rest of the book but it was never clear how she got from point a to b in her thinking for all the nuances of her thought and feeling to which i was privy as a reader i was struck by how little i was shown of this most significant piece of her inner life the development of her philosophy and values was something that mostly happened off the page as i read i also had trouble understanding why eileen stuck by ed again and again as he failed to give her the things she most wanted in life why would a character who is not a sentimental person who is hard and tough and practical ultimately live a life of devotion to a man whose way of thinking frustrates and confuses her more often than not a man she neither tries nor wants to understand throughout the book eileen shows a lack of curiosity about him and about so many other things she seems in the end a strange creature an intelligent woman who doesn't think and yet by the end of the book i felt like i understood her i respected her and i can no more explain it to you than eileen could explain herself to herself despite this being the story of a family struck by a fate none would choose and despite the fact we follow them along a difficult path of slow and grinding loss this is not a tragic book it ends on notes of hope and redemption and the sense that love has ultimately prevailed for everyone life could have been different but everyone accepts that it wasn't and no one becomes bitter that said there's ultimately something melancholy in the arc of eileen's life hers was a life of few choices a life limited as much by a lack of imagination as by circumstance and yet the greatest success of this book for me is that despite all the times a character does something that doesn't quite come across as convincing the sense of peace that both eileen and connell find at the end is totally convincing not only can they not condemn their lives or paint their recollections of them in the ochre of regret neither can i","799":"heartbreaking real and sad extremely well written the characters are all worth knowing","800":"long read seemed to take a long time to where it wanted kind of whiny","801":"2 5 but almost 3 stars at one point i kinda enjoyed this book for about 300 pages and that is probably about how long it needed to be","802":" stunning for a first novel this was pretty ambitious not least because of the length and the emotions that were explored but also because the book crossed decades when i picked up the book and read the back i had no idea that it would be an intricate portrait of alzheimers disease almost unique in its portrayel and insight if you want to know what it's like living with alzheimers disease and not even being in your sixties then this is the book to describe it to you painful funny tear jerking laughter inducing this book has it all","803":"no no no i am so mad this book exists because it completely tore me apart it was very well done but i wish i never read it soul crushing","804":"i would have enjoyed it more if it had been a bit shorter the author does write about living with alzheimer's from both the sufferer and families point of view very well","805":" this book man honestly overall it was a very enjoyable read the style and level of writing weren't over the top or too simplistic especially for the subject material by the time i realized that the plot was actually picking up as it's written in an almost biography format i was already way into it and didn't want to stop there were places that could have definitely been taken out but either way the characters were interesting enough for me not to mind it i will say by the end i warped a couple pages by crying all over them and let's be real the best kind of books are the ones that can make you feel something this book is a charming rendition of how an average family works through their lives the best they can and love each other the best they can and i think that's the most important thing this novel can offer how even though the leary's have a rough time about life they still manage in the end to show their love for one another even if it's after they're gone i had so many favorite quotes but i won't bore you by them because it's something that changes from person to person","806":"i am listening to this book narrated by mare winningham the narration is flat but so is the writing the writing does not lend itself to audio as the writer often uses words that are seldom verbalized so it is jarring to hear them spoken the story reads like a factual diary without any emotion the writing makes it difficult relate to the main character and i'm not that interested in knowing what happens to her next the premise is compelling but the writing is not one of my main complaints was the overuse of similes example the stinsel hung thick like cooked spinach come on seriously","807":" this book was incredibly hard for me to read through for many many reasons i don't wish to spoil anything for future readers so i won't go into detail but this novel is an emotional roller coaster ride you get to see life through the eyes of not just one person but two generations of people the complexity of relationships the generational differences between parents and children the struggles every family faces at sometime or another even if those struggles go by different names this plays into why i had trouble reading it i am used to and prefer stories that follow a single characters point of view a limited third person the switching of viewpoints is often off putting for me and really it still was in this book but even when i tried to put it down and move on it nagged at the back of my mind i needed to know how it turned out all in all i thought the story was great the characters their motivations everything in fact i often had to remind myself this wasn't a true account of something but it was somewhere someone has experienced almost exactly this it suffered in terms of length and sometimes had too much detail but i would still recommend this book to anyone looking for something to read","808":" this is the story of eileen tumulty the daughter of irish immigrants and her journey through life and covers a 60 year time span while the book is long i never felt it dragged and i was eager to see what lay ahead in this story it is beautifully written and so realistic as it describes the struggles faced by eileen and her family i felt empathy for all of the main characters in the book and actually had tears in my eyes as i read the letter from ed to his son do not let the length of this book deter you it is definitely worth the time it takes to read this book","809":"great read for how early alzheimer's affects others including family but a little to wordy and some chapters could be eliminated without losing story","810":"this review has been hidden because it contains spoilers to view it click here i am torn about this novel the writing is incredible so smart and eloquent and incredible i absolutely loved it for about the first half and then as the story got darker it got harder to read this book follows the life of a woman who dreams of breaking out of lower middle class and how she deals with her husband and son who continue to add to her disappointment i loved all of the new york stuff and again i loved the writing","811":"initially thought i was going to really like this but soon grew tired of the characters and found myself skimming through the pages","812":"a real joy to read it's amazing that this is thomas's first novel he's a vivid writer who creates a believable world for this novel which primarily traces the life of eileen tumulty leary an irish american woman living in new york the novel definitely has a thornton wilder quality in that the main characters eileen ed and connell are frequently unable and or unwilling to say and do what they really feel inside thomas does a commendable job of illustrating how so often in life this can be the case for all of us highly recommended","813":"i almost stopped reading this book about three times because it kept getting really depressing and sad i am glad i finished it it turned out to be pretty great although not a feel good or happy read by any stretch it's heavy both emotionally and literally ha this book must weigh 10 pounds","814":"beautiful but so very very sad","815":"this was a very long book it started out with promise eileen and her life growing up in her irish household and her thoughts on how she envisions her future problem is that it is do ordinary nothing much un ordinary happens i kept waiting for something different to happen","816":"this is one of those books where you wish there was a half star because i would have given it 3 5 the book started out strong and kept me engaged until the last 4 or 5 chapters it lost steam in the end and could have wrapped up more quickly all in all though a solid choice for reading groups because the entire book was character driven","817":"this book deserves more than 5 stars the story of a 20th century irish american family their struggles loves and heartbreaks leaves the reader reeling eileen ed and connell and their extended family and friends will linger with me a long time the description of ed's alzheimer's disease and the family's dealing with it is difficult to read and beautifully written thank you matthew thomas","818":"not my kind of book starts sad and descends into the full bummer but without a big takeaway for me to make that worthwhile 2 stars because it's well written i just didn't like it","819":"read this if you like family sagas you don't mind a really long book you like character analysis you don't care if there's not much action if you like stories about new york city you can handle sad i loved it but i was in that mood","820":"left untoldthis story had no direction even though it covered several generations in one family i finished it and was still waiting","821":"i liked this novel when i first picked it up but then it just got so slow and hard to read i never finished it and i was three quarters the way through i just couldn't push myself anymore","822":"the first 40% of this book reads like a lengthy wooden summary and then the book's actual plot reveals itself a wife who wanted more almost gets it but then has to guide her husband's long and slow descent into alzheimer's the long slow descent takes the remaining 400 pages i liked this book enough to finish reading it but not enough to give it three stars","823":" an undoubtedly particular book without a precise plot or rather with a plot that is the life of a woman described by following almost every passing day and with minutia the childhood of the daughter of irish immigrants with an alcoholic mother and a father that she mythicize the choice of a school that she doesn't like but that's what everyone expects from her the marriage with an exceptional man but that soon will become ill from alzheimer's and that will test all his will power both before getting sick because of his moral rectitude both as sick the late motherhood and the attempt to pour in her only son all the ambitions that she could not meet at the end of the book however the woman almost disappears remain his son and his attempt to come to terms with his father figure well written but too full of episodes of which one end up not understanding the importance thank simon u0026amp schuster and netgalley for providing me with a free copy in exchange for an honest review un libro indubbiamente molto particolare senza una trama precisa o meglio con una trama che e la vita di una donna descritta seguendo quasi il passare dei giorni e con minuzia l'infanzia di figlia di immigrati irlandesi con una madre alcoolizzata e un padre che lei mitizza la scelta di una scuola che non sente sua ma che e quello che tutti si aspettano da lei il matrimonio con un uomo eccezionale ma che presto si ammalera di alzheimer e che mettera alla prova tutta la sua forza di volonta sia prima di ammalarsi a causa della sua dirittura morale sia da ammalato la maternita tardiva e il tentativo di riversare nell'unico figlio tutte le ambizioni che non ha potuto soddisfare alla fine del libro la donna pero quasi sparisce restano il figlio e il suo tentativo di venire a patti con la figura del padre ben scritto ma troppo pieno di episodi dei quali si finisce col non capire bene l'importanza ringrazio simon u0026amp schuster e netgalley per avermi fornito una copia gratuita in cambio di una recensione onesta","824":"this is a hard book to rate the novel is about an ordinary family life so there's nothing gripping to keep your interest until closer to the end when the family suffers a tragic diagnosis at that point the book had me hooked however for the first 300 400 pages i got very bored at times and almost put the book aside the writing and analysis of human emotions and lives are very well done though and that's what kept me reading plus i checked other reviews that recommended sticking with it overall this is an insightful look into how humans come to define themselves how they cope with change and how we are shaped by our past present and future if you're looking for a thrilling page turner this is not your book but if you enjoy getting to know characters on a deep level and agonizing as you see them make avoidable mistakes this is a good book for you","825":"i really liked this book i love stories of families and the struggles and joys they face this story was very sad though probably because it focuses on how life doesn't go as we plan there are unforeseen things that happen in life that change our path or give us a life we didn't plan it is a touching story i'll admit i cried","826":"this is a multi generational book about an irish american family i think i like sprawling books about everyday people in contemporary times their struggles and successes which is why i liked this one i think there could have been a bit better editing in the early few chapters of the book but after that it did pick up quite a bit and moved along much quicker","827":" it was a bit hard for me to rate this review with stars there were times that i thought that i was going to give it 3 and other times 5 stars so i've settled in the middle of the two instead of being plot driven this book seems to be solely character driven where you get a feel of the families individual idiosyncrasies and if you pay particular attention to detail you can see how the twists and turns in their lives cause subtle changes in each character as you would in real life this story is best summed up as being centered around one family mostly following the mother eileen and their ups and downs throughout life although i would have to say that it was mostly downs than ups eileen wants to live a life of prestige she not only graduated from high school but received a bs in nursing as well as a masters in nursing administration at some point she finally meets a man that she deems worthy enough for her after giving up the dream that some wealthy man would sweep her off her feet and allow her to live off of his wealth and when life sets in and things start to move off track eileen chooses to overlook them as if they weren't happening because in her mind her life was going to be projected the way she wanted her life to actually be eileen and her husband ed eventually have a child and name him connell luckily for connell his dad seems to be great at giving him emotional support growing up eileen's mother was very distant and as a result eileen is hard and off putting almost as though she were narcissistic but i am not sure that she could be labeled as so it seemed that her image would shift from indifferent to cruel to passive and then controlling i couldn't quite figure her out but i felt sorry for her son because she treated him horribly at times i think deep down though that she loved him the best way that she knew how because this story is mainly character driven it is long and at times slow moving i think this would be the only reason why i didn't take the plunge and give it five stars i think as much could have been achieved with developing the characters in the story had it been tightened down to at least 100 less pages but this is my personal opinion the author did an excellent job with making the characters three dimensional because i found myself getting angry and frustrated at the mother when she would act so indifferent to her son or controlling toward her environment and at other times when she was so oblivious and chose to see things not as they really were at times it was painful to read these parts because as the book progressed i began to loathe her she reminded me a lot of the mother from the movie book 'ordinary people' beth jarrett because she was wound so tight and was so concerned with outside appearances than to open her eyes and look at her life as it really was at first i thought that the book failed by making the mc so dislikable but the more i thought about it afterward i realized that the character of eileen was so well developed that she pulled some serious emotion from me if you are looking for a great character driven novel then this is definitely the book for you","828":"this is an impressive book it's big but it doesn't feel that way when you're burning through that pages parts remind me a bit of a tree grows in brooklyn which is clearly a compliment it's warm vivid and haunting","829":" consuming engulfing penetrating confused me too not about the quality of this book or of the writing but about how to sum it up effectively it is basically a character study of three people over the lifetime of one of those characters if you enjoy immersing yourself in the depths of other people's minds this is the book for you as a therapist and a therapee it's a word now homie i thoroughly enjoyed it it's this rich kind of layering that makes me feel less alone in the insanity that comes with living inside a human brain 24 7 i felt as if i had been a witness to the lives of these three people through writing so smooth and natural it seemed as if i had come by the information through experience","830":" this book was terrible it became a chore to finishing reading and its 600 pages the description is so misleading the irish american part is for the first 50 or so pages when she was a child then the rest of the book is just her as an adult and her and her husbands boring life there are parts about the sons life that are thrown in at times when you think what was the point of that it starts off so strong with what you think will be a great storyline than deteriorates rapidly much like her husbands health you will read this book waiting for a climax something anything to happen and nothing does this book is a snoozefest and not only that but a 600 page snoozfest don't waste your time","831":"this book has received so critical acclaim i thought it would be great or even if it wasn't my cup of tea at least recognizably well written but alas no getting through this book was the reading equivalent of chewing on soggy cardboard it was clunky and flat and blah which is hard to do with the topic the author chose to tackle but he managed it anyway so i guess that was an accomplishment","832":"honestly waivered between 3 and 4 stars for this one it almost ended up on my abandoned shelf midway but i managed to stick it out very slow going and tedious at times it just wasn't what i expected of an irish immigrant story based on its description as being epic in scope","833":"read this only if you are prepared to do some crying this book is about a small family of three what comes before them and how the author leaves them and all the challenges that come up in life when the worst possible happens but we are still alive and along with coping have lots of disparate needs","834":"the writing was fairly good and the first 200 pgs or so promised to be quite a read then it all went downhill very depressing conjointed overly wordy if this hadn't been a book clubchoice i would have not have completed it","835":"fantastic book so beautifully written","836":"disclaimer i received an advance copy of the book free in exchange for an honest review we are not ourselves is a stunning novel and it almost defies belief that it is a debut effort although the publisher does state that he had already put two other novels in a drawer before this one it tells the story of three generations of irish americans in queens who are linked through eileen the daughter the wife the nurse and the mother as such it is the classic story of immigrants in the u s disoriented at first but then adapting integrating and thriving one hopes but it is also the story of eileen's relationships with the men in her life her father big mike who is the godfather in the mario puzo sense of their community her husband ed a brilliant but unambitious academic and neuroscientist and her son connell who bears the legacy of both of his parents and it is also the story of a george baileyesque character from it's a wonderful life in which every time he thinks he's on the brink of getting what he wants it's taken away but he ends up richer for it if you read this book for no other reason read it for the evocative and beautiful language the tree was heavy with ornaments strings of lights and tinsel clumped thick as cooked spinach she had worked hard for years and if she had nothing to show for it but her house and her son's education there was still the fact of its having happened which no one could erase from the record of human lives even if no one was keeping one after a few months had passed the cup of guilt he'd been carying around for having gone away when his father needed him for letting him go into a home simply dried up and he was left holding the empty vessel of his routine she patted the ground in search of pebbles to leave on the gravestone it was a jewish custom she had picked up like a magpie building a nest of grief for now while he breathed and moved while he felt and thought there was still between this moment and the one of his dying the interval allotted to him and there was so much to live for in it the citrus snap of fresh black tea the compression and release of a warm stack of folded towels carried to the closet between two hands the tinny resonance of children in the distance when heard through a bedroom window the mouth fullness of cannoli cream the sudden twitch of a horse's ear to chase a fly the neon green of the outfield grass the map of wrinkles in one's own hand the smell and feel even the taste of dirt the comfort of a body squeezed against one's own now having said all of that a couple of caveats 1 be in a strong emotional place when you read it i'm serious 2 as epic as the book is 620 pages in my copy there are a few places where the narrative jumps unexpectedly if the book is truly eileen's story where are the details of her time in college surely there was some culture shock when she left her sheltered neighborhood and met students from other backgrounds at least there isn't much about her daily work either i think the book would have been stronger if we'd been shown how she became such a good nurse and supervisor given the role this will play eventually final word i have a major collection of bookmarks i seem to pick them up without realizing it and then i can't get rid of them because reasons i didn't notice until i was almost at the end of the book that the one i had selected for this book said life is under no obligation to give us what we expect margaret mitchell uncanny how well it mirrors the theme of we are not ourselves","837":" this young author has great promise this is an ambitious book in its scope there are times when it shines but without giving too much away it is critical that the reader really care about one of the main characters and unfortunately i just didn't find this character to be understandable or very likable so i couldn't get invested in his fate i do think thomas does a better job than most male authors who choose to write about a central female character and there were moments that felt very real and true in this book","838":"i loved this beautifully written beautifully read by mare winningham i found myself looking for mindless household tasks to do so i could listen for hours on end very absorbing story of a typical upwardly mobile irish american family very real very touching ordinary flawed people elevated to tell profound truths by a gifted writer i would gladly read another several hundred pages about them should a sequel come along","839":"don't usually like stories about irish alcoholic immigrants catholics but the book is superbly written","840":"this book was a slow burner for me at 600 pages it was a slow read and at the beginning it almost seemed to be moving in real time you follow the life of eileen tumulty through her childhood but mostly through her marriage to ed hers remains the main voice but you sometimes get her son's perspective the novel really caught my attention several hundred pages in when the title begins to make sense then i was hooked i loved the slow clear description of family life not always logical not always explained why do people behave as they do sometimes regretting their decisions for ever i wondered why matthew thomas choose to write the family's story in a bit of a vacuum and that's why i couldn't give the book 5 stars you never really heard about their friends colleagues or any life they had beyond their house or each other in this way the novel lacked depth","841":"this book was so incredibly heart felt it was a strong character study and it was easy to become engrossed in the lives of the characters which made it even more of an excellent read it flowed together and was beautifully written my only complaint is that i don't feel like it was necessary for it to be quite as long as it was otherwise i feel that this book was excellent","842":"i really like matthew thomas's writing style it's thought provoking while still being straightforward and unpretentious this is a story that springs from character rather than plot and the characters are very well drawn most of it is from eileen's point of view and while she certainly has faults she's materialistic and impatient and even though she doesn't think of herself this way definitely on the racist side you like and sympathize with her","843":"this is a really well written book about a family history when the story comes to its inevitable close there is a slight drop in the quality of the writing but i didn't want to put this one down","844":" ok if i'm being completely honest i'd give this book 3 1 2 stars it is beautifully written no doubt about that i'm from nyc so i always love a book about new york the characters are lushly developed and meticulously drawn all that said the last quarter felt like homework to me i'm not sure if it's because it was incredibly depressing or because i had just heard a review of the paying guests on npr and desperately wanted to start that or both i had also stopped caring that much about the protagonist i wasn't going to abandon it because i had invested a lot of time and energy in the book already but i was relieved when it was over not the best review one could give i suppose but i decided to round up instead of down just for the beauty of the prose itself","845":"the book was hard to read at times the characters were at times frustrating and at others heart wrenching it's a story of family","846":"this book had some flaws it's not really about anything and yet i couldn't put it down it's a relatively simple story about one family's life through the second half of the 20th century it also could have been about 100 pages shorter without sacrificing anything nevertheless it was extremely compelling and moving highly recommend","847":"if you can wait 300 pages this book becomes really good it takes a long time to get there though i often felt like the author was telling a story instead of writing a book if that makes sense there's not enough dialogue for me it's a lot of she did this and then this and then this i often wondered if this was the story of matthew thomas's own family it felt like he was telling me his family history i got through the book by imagining eileen and ed were the author's parents and he was the teenaged connell","848":"i found this book to be very compelling having grown up in westchester county not far from where part of this book takes place i felt that certain connection to it however i pitied eileen tumulty as she is such a sad sad character some mild spoilers i always felt as though eileen was never happy with what she had in her life she had a husband who adored her a son who was craving love and attention and had a better life than her parents did yet she always seemed to complain and always wanted more i felt so awful for ed the endearing ill husband and like many people in all days and ages and in many societies they are too late in realizing that everything they needed they had all along and poor connell as an only child myself not having my mother drop me at college would have made me not come home either i did thoroughly enjoy this book to see the psychological nuances and the troubles of a family from within i was rooting for them all along and my heart broke a few times in the process i am very much looking forward to reading more from this author","849":"this debut follows eileen leary born in queens to irish immigrants in 1941 as she strives for betterment and a shot at the great american dream the author himself was born in the bronx and grew up in queens","850":"we are not ourselves when nature being oppressed commands the mind to suffer with the body from king lear shakespeare we are not ourselves tells the history of a family beginning with the childhood of the mother eileen through her marriage to edmund and the birth of their son connell it is not a spoiler at this point i think to say that the novel deals with the early onset of alzheimer's disease thomas's depiction of ed's alzheimer's is gripping to say the least the clues to ed's suffering mind slowly begin to accumulate until finally the reader along with eileen and connell finally comes to a slow realization that ed has this life changing disease eileen is depicted as an intelligent woman who is forever clawing after the classic american dream always wanting a bigger house and a better class of friends connell is depicted as being a little lost immature and selfish the disease and its aftermath make profound changes to their character the first part of the book is probably the least interesting but it gets so much better eventually some deep truths about what is truly important in life emerge","851":" i had a hard time deciding how to rate this book if half stars were available a 3 5 would be about right i rounded down because although it is well written it did not have that spark for me to put it into a more elevated category it is apparently the author matthew thomas's first book and it is a very long book over 600 pages i think it was too long and could have benefited from some sharper editing thomas uses the length to provide a lot of depth and layering for his central characters it is a character driven novel and it explores the lives of eileen tumulty and her parents and moves on to eileen's marriage to ed leary and their life with their son connell no spoilers here but it is quite poignant in parts and i found it to be a very enjoyable read","852":"could not finish","853":"so sad it was a slog for me to get through it got better once some awful behavior was explained about 1 2 way through but i can't say i liked this much in spite of great reviews kind of like an irish version of the corrections only without the wit","854":"this review has been hidden because it contains spoilers to view it click here well i finished it stayed up late to slog through to the end i agree with other reviewers that many of the characters especially the principle ones were unlikable that eileen's racism and materialism made her for me unsympathetic as the daughter of a woman who died of alzheimer's i found it almost ludicrous to imagine a nurse would miss the early signs of dementia i didn't understand much of the boy and then man that connell became i had trouble understanding eileen's acceptance of well i finished it stayed up late to slog through to the end i agree with other reviewers that many of the characters especially the principle ones were unlikable that eileen's racism and materialism made her for me unsympathetic as the daughter of a woman who died of alzheimer's i found it almost ludicrous to imagine a nurse would miss the early signs of dementia i didn't understand much of the boy and then man that connell became i had trouble understanding eileen's acceptance of her husband's single minded obsession at the expense of his family in short because i failed to understand the motivations of any of the central characters for the things they did the book was ultimately a disappointment i will give the author major credit for his dead on description of alzheimer's though having lived through it once it was an ordeal to repeat it so why two stars because my friends i have finally reached the point where a potential one star book doesn't get finished see my review of light years more","855":" i don't trust myself to write after having read this book but i shall try it was beautiful in that it was a genuine portrayal of life and the human condition of the events that form us and turn us into the flawed people we are the people that try to love one another to the best of our capabilities and forgive each other when it isn't quite enough this is not a happy book it is not one you want to read on the beach but it is one you want to read because it understands you it empathizes with the darkest most anxious parts of who you are","856":"this was an absolutely wonderful book to read the grace and humanity was heart rendering","857":"still alice with an edge and i really liked it still alice broke your heart this story breaks your heart and shares the difficult frustrations especially when no one really knows whats going on but suspects not an easy story because i think you grow to really care about the characters","858":"rarely does a novel move me to tears but this one did matthew thomas delivers an emotional but unsentimental wallop when he created eileen tumulty and takes the reader on a journey through her life starting in the 1950's as a girl and ending in 2011 it's a love story really a love story between a wife and husband a love story between a mother and son a love story between a father and son it's not a sappy love story it is a realistic love story the characters even the minor ones are beautifully developed this story will stay with me a very long time","859":"this is an account of a woman post wwii trying to live the american dream but as she grows outward her husband a brilliant man is struck with early onset alzheimer's","860":"excellent excellent amazing book the english major in me wants to write a paper comparing it to the goldfinch by donna tartt","861":"well written but long meandering and depressing","862":"i really like the story and i love all the characters i think the book is superb","863":"review to follow once i have dried my eyes beautiful epic an all time favourite not sure any review i write will do this one justice","864":"the first half was slow character building but the last half was lovely i'd recommend it but those first 300 or so pages crawl","865":"the story of eileen leary from her caregiving years as the daughter of heavy drinking parents to her marriage to ed she strives to have the life she's always dreamt but the dream is darkened by the change in ed hard to hold everything together good read","866":"in his lengthy and exquisitely written tome we are not ourselves matthew thomas brings the reader inside the idea of the post war american dream and the reality of life seen through the eyes of the leary family when irish immigrant eileen tumulty meets ed leary she just knows he is the one a scientist he will have dreams and aspirations and they will live in wedded bliss pursue and the american dream or is it all an illusion the reader gets an excellent look at the idea of post world war ii america ideals and realities and everyday life through eileen ed and their son connell we are not ourselves is a beautifully written poignant novel about love family dreams ideals and ultimately reality as thomas takes the reader through the life of the leary family and all that encompasses family life we are not ourselves is a book that will stay with the reader long after they have finished i would recommend we are not ourselves to any reader who enjoys excellent works of fiction as well as to those in book discussion groups","867":"this review has been hidden because it contains spoilers to view it click here it was national read a book day on september 6th and i pretty much devoured matthew thomas's we are not ourselves i've had a problem all summer where finding time energy to read has been difficult but binge reading we are not ourselves made me feel a lot better the novel begins with our protagonist eileen tumulty tumulty tumultuous is not a coincidence as the rest of the book will reveal she spends her whole life trying to take care of others and fulfil personal dreams that although it was national read a book day on september 6th and i pretty much devoured matthew thomas's we are not ourselves i've had a problem all summer where finding time energy to read has been difficult but binge reading we are not ourselves made me feel a lot better the novel begins with our protagonist eileen tumulty tumulty tumultuous is not a coincidence as the rest of the book will reveal she spends her whole life trying to take care of others and fulfil personal dreams that although more disillusioned at times than practical make us sympathize with her nonetheless she marries ed leary again leary king lear is not a coincidence an intense practical and extremely productive academic they have a child connell who is bright like his father and as subject to the pressures to conform as his mother can be the novel revolves around this trio usually tracing their shared yet individual lives from one angle at a time putting distance between each of them in a way that accentuates their different perspectives and concerns in all ways we see how they all act in ways that are not entirely themselves be it connell's decision to act like a jerk in order to fit in with the cooler kids eileen's fleeting cult experience or most distinctly ed's alzheimer's figuring out what was wrong with ed was my main incentive for reading on i should have gotten the hint because of the leary lear connection but i kept thinking it was ocd until the reveal he was the least cliched character in the novel eileen with her ambition to buy a house escape jackson heights and connell with his adolescent urge to fit in were the closest to being stock characters but ed stood out as the one who was most 'not himself ' not only because of his illness but also his attempts to masquerade his discomfort around his family and friends when eileen threw parties his letter to connell was one of the most poignant points of the novel matthew thomas is an alumn so perhaps it's no big surprise that connell eventually goes to uchicago the description of campus cobb the med the rockefeller chapel all honestly made me feel pretty nostalgic for college i'm flying back in two weeks and am going to make it a mission to leisure read as often as i can i might not be able to produce a review after every book but i've decided that is okay getting the words into my system will be good enough \"life she thought was like that sometimes for years things were a certain way and then in an instant almost without conscious thought they weren't that way any longer as if all the hidden pressure on their having been the way they'd been had found release through a necessary valve \"\"you are not in this life to count up victories and defeats you are in it to love and be loved you are loved with your head down you will be loved whether you finish or not \" more","868":"it was slow at the beginning and the only character pov i liked was connell's eileen seemed stuck up and ed was too insane seeming even for my liking after the halfway point though it seemed to speed up and i enjoyed it a lot more","869":"so well written but was disappointed that a good portion of it dealt with alzheimer's that was an unwanted surprise looking forward to his next novel and hoping it will be less dark this book was ultimately quite sad but oh so we'll written","870":"i am between liked it and really liked it so the verdict is 3 5 stars what i will remember about this book is a strong girl who became a stronger woman wife mother and worker sometimes this story drags but readers do feel the full weight of eileen's challenges disappointments and broken dreams very touching portrait if loyalty in marriage","871":"beautifully written hard to read in parts but worth getting through i was really moved by the realistic view of family life and how this family handled all the major and minor changes that came along","872":"a sweeping family saga probably more interesting to readers who have spent time in queens the last third is pretty sad i'm not saying that as a spoiler","873":"lovely and sad","874":"interesting characters well written episodes that taken all together and by all i mean 522 pages seemed like it may have been a response to the prompt tell a story in excruciating detail of all of life's frustrations unfairness and losses no need to connect it with a single theme or viewpoint","875":"this is a wonderful book it is a family saga a commentary on post wwii america and an intimate look at illness from the various perspective of the characters i loved that the later setting was an area i know very well it helped me understand the actions of the main characters in various scenesvery well written and it never dragged for me wanted to finish it but didn't want it to end","876":"this review has been hidden because it contains spoilers to view it click here found myself sympathetic with characters and wanting to continue with them would have liked better if the book ended with edmund's death after his death i lost interest in finishing","877":"the audio version i listened to was beautifully read by mare winningham this is a solid read oddly enough for me this was another literary gem structured around the lives of a family of three mom dad and son having just read us and the unlikely pilgrimage of harold fry i was not looking for another such story but found the similarities very interesting this is a poignant tale that overflows with personal introspection i enjoyed it very much","878":" i thought this was one of the most thought provoking books i've read in a long time i disagree with the readers who say that the book was too long and that the first 200 pages could be shortened if anything i would have liked the book to be longer the most fascinating aspect to me was the character of eileen leary most reviewers haven't paid much attention to this aspect but i thought that the most important factor in the development of her character was the fact that she was the child of alcoholics many of her character traits the striving for a better life the preoccupation with how outsiders view her the caretaker role are directly traceable to her youth in a household of alcoholics this is splendidly brought out by the author i would liked to have seen more of eileen's early life and more of her later life those times rush by in the novel and i would liked to have seen them explored more deeply there are a lot of life lessons in the book the characters are presented as far from perfect and often preoccupied by matters that seem trivial but they grow over time in a way that seems natural and not contrived i would say that most readers would find much to think about from the story of the learys it was hard to read in places heartbreaking in others but definitely worthwhile i couldn't put the book down and would recommend it highly","879":"what a beautifully written book just loved how it was written and the story if told","880":"i didn't necessarily like any of the characters in this book but they were real normal full of flaws once ed's health issue was figured out it became very hard for me it hit a bit too close to home but again it was realistic and honest","881":" i feel like it took forever to get through this book and given that the audio is 20 hours i guess it sort of did the story is long and there are a lot of details about mundane things and every day life so much so that you think you know everything about these characters and then the author casually slips in some trip to italy or whatever and you're thinking what when did they do that because that big stuff never mentioned honestly though my biggest problem with the book was that i just did not like eileen she frustrated me greatly always wanting what she didn't have always thinking she'd be happy when she had the perfect house or perfect job or perfect kid life doesn't work that way and i suppose she finally sees that at the end and it did pick up at the end i truly enjoyed about the last 1 3 of the book but it sure took a long time to get there recommended for those who enjoy family sagas","882":"darn it another well crafted story that though i cerebrally appreciated the author's hard work and skill i wasn't emotionally engaged in after the telling of eileen's childhood i was hoping the tone and pace of the story would become more personal but it became less so after eileen marries it just becomes such an ordinary story of unlikeable characters that i confess to skipping pages to see it through darn it","883":"one of those slogging family dramas well written and it delves into the minds of the characters but i didn't find any of the characters very likable so it was hard to get fully engaged a difficult read too dealing in too much detail of characters' physical and mental crumbling","884":"i wanted to like this based on all the award nominations but i finally put it down reminded me of oates we were the mulvaneys downward spiral of various family members just kept plodding along vs being truly captivating meh","885":" i never write reviews but i feel i should start but with a book like this this is the problem i can't really explain why i loved it it was just good was it perfect no and especially some of the parts about eileen's son in his rebellious time as a bratty teenager rang a little corny but nobody in my experience writes teenagers well so many books or tv shows i read all these reviews praising the author for the accurate depiction of teens and particularly the way they talk then i read or watch said works and am so disappointed the only person who gets how kids talk is larry clark or i guess harmony korine but that is another discussion the way her son is written wasn't the main point of the book or my review eileen and her husband are the best most realistic and beautiful part of this story it's just really engrossing and well written and the story broke my heart i couldn't stop thinking about it for a long time that's all i want to say really","886":"i'm twenty percent into this one roughly 127 pages of 612 and i don't really see where it's going as far as sweeping novels about the century i think i'll stick to smiley's series or even follett's i'm not particularly fond of the main character here and i really hate how she thinks of her son as the boy as if he's a complete stranger there are just too many books i want to read to keep being bored through another 450 pages of this one","887":"a very long book but well worth the read amazing insights and beautifully written","888":"i'm conflicted about this one it's very real and raw but also very boring at times which is how life is so perhaps the author was successful there there are some beautiful and heartbreaking moments good and bad and i was exhausted when i finished it do with that what you will","889":"this was a long read for me not because i didn't enjoy it but because sometimes i just didn't like the characters and it is a character driven book it spans the lifetime of the main character and while she was strong she wasn't likeable to me","890":"this is so great and heart warming a story hasnt made me cry from both good and sad moments as this one i recommend this to all my friends","891":"one of the best books i ever read the flow vocabulary depth of characters perfect","892":"i find it interesting that this book's ratings on goodreads average out to four stars yet so many people posted questions along the lines of this is boring should i finish it my answer is no thomas is a good writer there are some nice turns of phrase in there but 600 plus pages of she went here she went there boring i read 127 pages and know very little of the main character's motivations for example why did she freeze up and not help her young son when he was choking thomas tells the reader it was because she loved him so much huh things like that happened over and over add to that the monotony and i gave up on this one perhaps thomas should write short stories the chapter about sixty something big mike answering a younger bar customer's challenge to a foot race would have been a nice stand alone story","893":"it took me half a year to read this book but in the end i'm so glad i didn't give up on it the lessons it taught me are invaluable if it seems slow boring or even mundane at times push through it at least make it to chapter 98 kids hug your parents and tell them you love them parents love your children and learn from the mistakes and accomplishments of edmund and eileen leary","894":" it was the best of times it was the worst of times would have to divide this book into three parts the beginning was a well written coming of age story about a young lady of irish immigrants i was interested in her thoughts and desires and her love story with her husband i then began to feel the story dragged on for quite a while the main character is not a warm person and i did not relate to her feelings of being a parent and a mother the end third of the book was heart wrenching and sometimes more than i could handle i guess any book that can evoke emotions can not all be bad i am just happy i finished this epic","895":"this is matthew thomas first book it took him 10 years to write the book it paints the picture of life in queens and bronxville ny from 1951 for the next 50 years it is difficult reading at times but it made me think about who we are and what matters in life it is a book about much more than alzheimers i am glad that i read it","896":"this review has been hidden because it contains spoilers to view it click here tedious that's the first word that comes to mind when i think about this book if i hadn't been reading it for book club i would have given it to oxfam after the first 100 pages it meandered along and then trailed off towards the end i was left wondering what it was all about alzheimer's and its impact on the family the immigrant experience in america hmm","897":"this book grows on you as you get invested in the characters in my opinion it is too long and still alice is way better","898":"beautifully written but very sad with main characters that are incredibly real and rounded","899":" this is the fully believable story of a couple with one son matthew thomas the author understands the dynamics of couples and the reality of raising a child eileen wife and mother is a nurse she expects her smart academic husband to join her in her upwardly mobile journey through life ed is offered a well paying job by a drug company ellen is thrilled ed turns it down knowing he'd be a lapdog he wants to be the watchdog who makes drugs in his own university lab connell their son is very believable as he progresses through the stages of childhood and adolescence i won't ruin the story by revealing the complex conflict and problems the family face i'll just say that i highly recommend this novel it is skillfully crafted and a joy to read","900":"this has somewhat mixed reviews and i can see why the writing is beautiful but the story is really slow moving i was never bored enough to give up but i didn't exactly want to sit and read this for hours at a stretch either","901":"one of the best books i've read in years matthew thomas' prose keeps this calm book mesmerizing it is a story of a woman from an irish american family her life as she ages is not unusual nor terribly interesting the fact that this young author wrote such a beautiful 600 page novel that took him 10 years to create that is amazing his characters felt like part of my life and i miss them now that i've finished the book","902":" this is a very well written book that had me feeling depressed literally from beginning to end i could not fully enjoy this book i kept hoping for some uplifting moments that never came for almost the entire first half of the book i felt very removed and disconnected from the characters and the story i think because the stage was being set for the second half of the book the second half due to circumstances i will not give away allowed for a slower pace and had a more intimate feel finally bringing the reader into the story this book stays with you after finishing it but it was tough going for me","903":" listening to this book is like listening to a gossipy relative tell a long drawn out story about members of a family in the audible version i got as far as section 14 out of 104 which is about 3 5 hours in the story is told in past tense third person e g and then she did this and he did this and she felt that and so is very much told not shown which makes it boring the characters all seem sad and disappointed in their lives and marriages life is too short to be buried in someone else's unhappiness without any seeming reward it got lots of great reviews and 4 5 star reviews so maybe it's just me so glad every book is refundable on audible if you don't like it","904":" a story that spans generations with the primary center comprised of the leary family eileen ed and their son connell a seeming bland story if i were to provide a summary you may very well pass this one up in some ways not much happens however that is very true to most lives lived most of us will not have grand adventures or exciting escapades most of us are born perhaps going to school then working maybe having a family and loving everyone loves someone and we all try to grasp whatever bits of contentment we can from life because this is the only life we get anna quindlen declared this to the be the best book of the year i think it is too early to make such a bold statement but i do see why she said that i was sucked into this from the beginning and had trouble putting it down when i wasn't reading it i was thinking about the characters wondering where they would go i've just finished and i will be thinking about this for awhile this book will not easily leave this story is an epic telling in and of itself and the author makes gorgeously wrought erudite observations about life and love and the choices we make as we barrel blindly ahead","905":"enjoyed but found the ending weak","906":"an epic novel about the misery of ordinary life told over decades by various members of a new york family nothing in this book is beyond what you could imagine happening in your own life this is what makes it powerful extremely engaging it is an impressive debut","907":"slow in a lot of parts especially the beginning but great character development and exploration of alzeimhers","908":"i loved the slow careful telling of this important story and its influential characters","909":"although i kept reading this book it was like living a dull and boring life i kept thinking something wonderful was going to happen to eileen","910":"my thoughts on this book were all over the board as i read it the book started strong but then i felt bogged down with the extremely long paragraphs and depictions which drove me to the point of skimming whole chapters trying to pick up a thread i wanted to follow the author is a decent wordsmith and the storyline was interesting because it was so unremarkable but i would have enjoyed some condensation of words","911":"i give this five stars not because this is an exciting book or even a very interesting book i give it five stars because it is a beautifully and carefully written book the characters are as real as you and i and they live a compelling life of ups and downs disappointments failures and moments of pure joy this book will take you a while but it's worth it","912":"i listened to this book on audio cd mare winningham reads without much intonation or dynamic and the tone of her voice lacks something i often found myself getting bored and by the end of the book i just wanted it to be done i think if i would have read the book i would have better captured the author's passion and would have been more affected by this moving story the narrative is a brilliant depiction of american life from 1941 to present and is a commentary about status material wealth medical insurance or lack of coverage and image in the end what is most important is revealed spoiler alert to love and be loved","913":" i won i requested an advanced reader's copy and i won wohoo characterization five stars the characterization in this novel is outstanding at no poin we are not ourselvesreview note my thanks to simon u0026amp schuster book's publisher for allowing me to receive a free advanced reader's edition goodreads firstreads of this book in exchange for an honest review this review is based on a copy that may vary from the final published product reason for book's selectioni won i requested an advanced reader's copy and i won wohoo characterization five stars the characterization in this novel is outstanding at no point that i can remember did i stop and think why would s he do that or no way would s he say that narration three stars this is eileen's story the reader is privy to her thoughts feelings and life for most of the more than 600 pages in this copy yet late in the novel the reader experiences a shifted perspective and becomes privy to the thoughts and experiences of another character it could certainly be argued that this shift represents a natural progression away from eileen as she ages and therefore a transition to the next generation or perhaps a shift to draw attention to a special relationship in the novel and therefore connect the reader to a certain character but after hundreds upon hundreds of pages the shift is jarring dialog four stars in my opinion the novel's dialog is very true to life especially in the context of private struggles and home lives description three stars the novel contains some beautiful descriptions however it also contains what i am terming description bombs the reader is moving along in the story and all of a sudden there is an obscure adjective or adverb that is out of context in the plainer language of the rest of the text some of these might be edited out before final publication but there seems to be a slight mismatch or unevenness in some of the language ingenuity premise four stars as regards premise the first half of the story not necessarily of the book is okay but the second half of the story makes the tough slow reading worth it the second half of the story is approachable grounded and relatable in a deeply touching way plot three stars this plot is tough to rate because the book is long the story is sectioned and if the reader can slog through the first part of the story the second scrubs away some of the general apathy left in the first however the first page before part i is so out of context disconnected as to be worth cutting entirely true it is mentioned in the epilogue and the reader is supposed to feel the connection but again this connection lacks context is the character who feels this connection the boy if it is the same boy then the feeling would be something he could place solidly in a memory this sort of event is not something a young boy would have trouble remembering even in the context of genes this kind of memory would be one of the last to go in any event what does this connection and obscure reference add to the story part i represents slow reading and i felt little connection to any of its characters it is designed to build a backstory that will later help contextualize the character's lives decisions dialog and so on however it has to be said that only real literature lovers are going to plow through it i was tempted to stop reading before i had even hit the first 100 pages but since i received a free copy i felt compelled to continue had i just checked this out of the library or purchased it on my own i would have stopped before page 100 part ii is gripping and compelling and the pace and general enjoyment of the story increases so dramatically that i found myself wondering what could be done to lessen part i's potential for keeping readers away the epilogue is a nice bookend that in my opinion requires no mate errorsthis is an advanced copy so it contains some printing errors and other minor issues all of which i am sure will be caught before final printing and while this is not an error per say the book is filled with uses of because as a subordinating conjunction which by extension means this book is absolutely rife with commas before because i lean toward the school of thought that minimizes commas save the harvard comma argue all you want but the harvard comma matters especially before because positivesthis story is truly touching and it speaks to the cyclical nature of humanity i am glad to have read it drawbacksthis is dense reading the book is large making it less than portable for commuters some of the description bombs left me with a sense that either the author is trying too hard in places or that the author is occasionally inserting rather obscure and or academic words simply because he can since the book should carry a consistent language level throughout this is in my opinion off putting most of all part i will weed out some readers final thoughtsi would not call this story perfect but i would call at least its second part masterful literature lovers will fall in love with this book and should the publisher succeed in drawing attention to it i think it is true that it could become an obscure classic","914":" i am being generous with a 4 star rating because it is a family saga of epic proportions that may loose some readers along the way 640 pages of the trials and tribulations of eileen and ed that is being compared to corrections a good comparison to me because i didn't particularly like the the characters in corrections and the characters in this novel were pathetic at times i don't want to be a spoiler but the last half when ed developed a dreaded disease i had to put the book down read something lighter and then give it another try if you liked corrections then give this one a try would love other opinions after reflecting to write this short review i have gone back and changed it to a 3 star read","915":"i would give the first part 5 stars the end 4 stars but way too much in the middle that was very hard to get through it is great writing but i did not feel that the characters were well developed for example eileen is apparently a very good nurse and has worked all her life but we never hear anything about what she actually does at work there are parties with all her close friends but you never see her spending time with those friends outside of the parties there are also way too many tangents in the story the author has a lot to say but i am not sure it was all necessary we know early on that this will end very sadly so it was hard to have to continue to read to the very end","916":" 2 5 starsi received a free digital copy from the author publisher via netgalley in exchange for an honest feedback we are not ourselves focuses on the life of eileen tumulty born to irish parents in new york eileen strives to make a better life for herself and a better marriage the book follows eileen through childhood young womanhood marriage children and all the ups and downs in between eileen eventually becomes eileen leary wife to ed and mother to connell i thought this book would be a real insight into eileen's life but at times i felt like a stranger watching through a blurry window not 100% sure what i was looking at or what i should be looking at despite being with eileeen through so much i actually felt very little connection to her i also thought the book was too long some parts of eileen's life were skimmed over and others parts of it just had too much focus it was so packed with words it was difficult to read at times huge chunks could have been taken out without a negative effect to the story as a whole it was just too long and too far from what i thought it would be i found myself getting bored a lot with it and when i came back to it after putting it down and reading another book i felt i didn't really care if i finished it or not","917":"a beautiful family story of dreams lost and found and the devastation of alzheimer's on a brilliant mind i listened to this beautifully read by mare winningham i don't know that i would have made it through the print version due to the sheer length and volume of detail not all of which was necessary had the book been more seriously edited i would give it five stars","918":"as you can see this book took up most of my summer way too long this a family saga where the husband has early onset alzheimer's my dad died of the same disease so i'm quite familiar with it i felt the characters fell flat and really didn't care about them which is not good when the whole premise of this book is to tug on your emotions and symphony for this family glad i finished it finally no surprises here","919":"i couldn't decide between a 3 or a 4 rating i probably would have gone with a 3 5 but since that wasn't an option i gave it the benefit of the doubt i thought the characters and emotions in this book were very relatable","920":"this review has been hidden because it contains spoilers to view it click here painful read i kept flashing to the title in the first third or so looking for more direction but once it shifted my flashing on the title was more of a touchstone the characters struggle so much more than maybe one would like their struggles though make them more real imperfect deluded impulsive or stubborn we are these qualities too as readers i think that's why the characters' so very human flaws pained me so as a chronicle of living with a debilitating and degenerative disease painful read i kept flashing to the title in the first third or so looking for more direction but once it shifted my flashing on the title was more of a touchstone the characters struggle so much more than maybe one would like their struggles though make them more real imperfect deluded impulsive or stubborn we are these qualities too as readers i think that's why the characters' so very human flaws pained me so as a chronicle of living with a debilitating and degenerative disease it's a downright scary read very well done i'm glad i stuck to the novel despite my frustrations with the characters and topic after all aren't we all at times not ourselves like the talking heads song goes this is not my life more","921":" this book is decently written but i didn't find it very effective in its structure the beginning of the book describing eileen leary's family life could have been eliminated entirely without losing any real insights about the characters more time should have been spent establishing eileen's relationship with edmund so that the reader could more deeply feel the loss and i was left shaking my head at several points later in the book where the author chose to tell rather than show i have a feeling the author didn't quite know what he was writing when he started","922":" this book is not something i'd have chosen to read on my own but it was generally interesting also it was very long with over 100 not short chapters i know i wouldn't have kept reading if this wasn't an audiobook and misha collins hadn't made a book club for it though at times i stayed in my car to keep listening so it did draw me in it brought up a lot of emotions as it followed three generations in new york city i could relate to some of their experiences but i won't say which ones as that would spoil the surprise the main character eileen was often unlikeable but i tried to remind myself that she was every woman she wasn't doing anything that different than anyone else might so i shouldn't dislike her for it it was hard to see the bad decisions she made i could see a lot of similarities between her and people i know this new goodreads update doesn't freaking scroll up so i can't see what i'm typing anymore that's one way to stop me from writing long reviews p","923":" \"we are not ourselves\" by matthew thomas published by simon and schuster category - fiction literature publication date - august 19 2014the original publication date for this book was september i believe it has been moved up because of the quality of the book and advanced praise for its content mu suggestion is if you use the library get your name on the reservation list as soon as possible and if you are buying the book pre order the book now eileen tumulty was born in 1941 of irish parents in queens new york although she had a relatively normal childhood she was often confronted with parents that fought and drank hard she knew from a very young age that she wanted more from life then what she was surrounded with eileen wanted a family a nice house money and wanted to live in an upscale neighborhood as often is the case not everything we wish and hope for comes to being eileen falls in love and marries ed leary ed may not be everything eileen wants but does provide a good life for her eileen never loses her ambition and becomes a nurse still looking for the golden nugget her dreams are dashed again when ed is offered better jobs in teaching but refuses them because he thinks he can be of better service in the classroom ed starts having a medical problem one very much in medical news today eileen convinces ed with help from their son to move to a nicer house in a nicer neighborhood it is here that ed starts to decline rapidly and eileen finds that she must pull in all he reserves to keep her job take care of ed and help her son who seems lost in college and life a great read that spans the time line from 1951 thru 2011 a story that displays the hopes and dreams of a women who will not be deterred from her desires the book does contain some strong language and sexual content","924":"not sure what i thought of the book it certainly was an epic i know it was on several best of the year lists but it left me a little cold i never felt like i really knew the main character for example until the end when her husband has alzheimer's and the author mentions her friends she is always talking to on the phone i didn't realize she had any her depictions of being a nurse especially one in mostly administration didn't ring true i really liked the husband but was also frustrated but his lack of ambition the relationship between he and his son were so tender and beautiful the son never really made much of an impression except when he said to his mom that is the first time you hugged me ohh probably the book is 3 5 stars it made me think","925":" have you ever witnessed a brilliant mind go to waste a slow leaking sludge that muddles what once looked like a beautiful landscape have you ever seen fireworks in the deluge of rain colourful sparks lost in their watery grave i've read books about cancer i've read books about depression i've read people suffer depression brought on by cancer i've read books about deaths and suicide each one remarkably heartbreaking than the last but there is nothing sadder than witnessing a person slowly diminish into someone unrecognizable someone who was once full of life and wit and intelligence until all that's left of him is a glazed look punctuated by unknowing blinks alive but barely conscious but hardly responsive edward leary was once a brilliant scientist a man who could've taught at columbia or brown but have decided - against his wife's wishes no less - that he would rather teach at a bronx community college before his life long career of teaching he did extensive research in - ironically enough - neurology majority of this book was about his life as seen through the eyes of his wife eileen and his son connell the practical insouciant husband and the doting devoted father until he was no longer halfway through the book i started to question why i was slogging through chapters upon chapters of a woman's boring life i've even entertained stopping altogether there is nothing worse than reading long narratives about someone's nuanced life until it slowly dawned on me why thomas felt the need to divulge gratuitously because it was the only way the readers would see how a person's mind disintegrate into a wasteland what started out as a man who seemed to have lost his zest for life someone depressed or going through a mid life crisis was actually a preamble to something more permanent and incurable it is a languid account of their lives a biographical narration spanning years of banalities until the encroachment of a disease steers the novel on to darker routes aptly enough this book was told in a morosely calm manner even more so as the author show edward's slow submission to the disease it also shows eileen's hardships as she tries to anticipate all of edward's needs while financially trying to provide for the family's livelihood the readers would not be able to resist looking at connell with judgmental eyes as he failed to support his struggling mother conversely we see eileen take up a brief affair with a man she hired as ed's caregiver but you'll be hard pressed to look at her with the same judgement as you would connell because her life had become endless days of lonely wariness there will be a large part of you that couldn't help but sympathize and you will end up forgiving her no matter what because for all the sacrifices she'd done she still deserved happiness even temporary this is the type of novel that doesn't show its true goodness straightaway you have to be patient heck this book took 10 years to write it is only fair to give it a chance matthew thomas showed incredible restraints in not rushing through years of stilted narrative and it shows we are not ourselves is a labor of love one that paints a heartbreaking picture of what it's like to slowly lose the very foundation of who you are","926":"depressing and uplifting at the same time well done","927":"beautifully written and bleak it tailed off a little towards the end however","928":"kind of depressing but quite vivid great writing almost hemingway esque without flourish somewhat stark","929":" eileen tumulty grows up with alcoholic parents but with the cultural promise of the american dream work hard and make enough money to have a beautiful home nice \"things \" and enough to educate one's children so they will have to work less hard for the same dream for some it happens for others events and circumstances provide impediments galore yet that doesn't diminish the dream it just means one works around those bumps in the road sublimates them into something larger or surrenders eileen tumulty will never ever surrender eileen's journey begins in the early 1940s and continues to the present she meets a man whom she thinks is totally different from her father ed is a research scientist who seems polite and sensitive yet after they marry he becomes obsessed with his work and won't spend an extra penny unless eileen pushes and pushes and pushes here is what makes this novel unique - while eileen's resentments and frustrations accumulate she at pivotal points remembers why she loved this soft gentle man and how what is so much imperfection is actually what makes him reliable and perfect that is the key to all the disasters and shocks that follow eileen and ed have a son connell and after much struggle eileen can say she now owns the home she always dreamed of one is almost waiting for the damocles sword to fall and so it does ed the brilliant scientist research man and professor is diagnosed with alzheimer's disease the rest of the novel is about cherishing every moment as special and dealing with a devastating disease that breaks down the brain nervous system and then the body eileen is determined that connell will be educated and have a chance at that dream but this is hard to maintain when he watches his father's demise then swerves elsewhere and finally finds hope in love to continue on his own dream the author leaves nothing to the imagination and presents an issue rarely discussed about this disease the fear that it generates in children who wonder if they are carrying the same gene that will mar their future with this hideous disease we are not ourselves a novel is a long engaging story that one can't put down it's drama lies in the everyday realities where one tries to make sense of the incomprehensible where one struggles not to sink in despair at the formidable obstacles life offers and where one truly loves \"for better or worse\" while still striving for more the dream is nothing without the love and vision of the dreamers and therein lies the rub lovely matthew thomas and fine fine writing","930":"beautifully written novel that spans three generations it took me a while to finish it's long and it's a lot of story but i really enjoyed it","931":"very depressing too long","932":"this was a bit mixed for me i dove right in and the first 3rd i whipped through 2nd 3rd was ok last 3rd of the book i had to really push through to finish i was interested in eileen's childhood in the '40s but she grew up to be a woman who makes a lot of off the wall decisions and i could not relate to her so i became less and less interested in her story i think i would have been leaning towards a 4 if the last part of the book had been left out","933":"i really enjoyed this book parts of it were very depressing but overall was a very good book","934":"this was an okay read but somewhat depressing to me the message seemed to be eat drink and be merry for tomorrow we die there was no lasting meaning","935":"first off i received this book from simon and schuster free for an honest review maybe i am just not in the point of my life to appreciate this book but there were points that i wondered what is the point of the book it is supposed to be a character driven plot but eileen does little change in long periods of time","936":"one of the best books i've ever read","937":"this review has been hidden because it contains spoilers to view it click here this book is showing up on best of the year lists when i heard it was a multigenerational saga about an irish american family i was intrigued but i think this book started out strong and then went downhill a little despite the fact that i felt like i was reading it forever the fact i read it on a kindle didn't help i still felt like i didn't know the characters the way i wanted to plus the author was a little clunky writing as a female protagonist it seemed like the man's perspective this book is showing up on best of the year lists when i heard it was a multigenerational saga about an irish american family i was intrigued but i think this book started out strong and then went downhill a little despite the fact that i felt like i was reading it forever the fact i read it on a kindle didn't help i still felt like i didn't know the characters the way i wanted to plus the author was a little clunky writing as a female protagonist it seemed like the man's perspective was bleeding through into the female character however the author does thoughtfully and tragically deal with a long slow decline of one of the main characters from alzheimer's more","938":"i gave this three stars instead of the two i might have otherwise considered because i feel like i'm not being totally objective i read a couple of books lately on very similar topics by coincidence and they were so much better deeper richer more real to me that i think i dismissed this book in a way i wouldn't have if it had been the first of its type i'd read recently that said the characters were unlikeable to me and worse felt flat to me i didn't understand their motivations i didn't understand the need for quite as much backstory as we got it was slow and while i don't normally mind slow if i'm luxuriating in language or emotion i didn't feel like i was doing either here it was just ok i'm not sure i felt like i knew any of these people even when i was finished nor did i really want to","939":" this book is gritty well written and tender epic i would have rated it higher if i could say that i enjoyed reading it but i was acutely aware of reality right now as life is passing me by in this moment which gives one a deafening sense of one's mortality while simultaneously stunning one with the inexorable sweep of humanity stretching out before and after your own life it pulls every emotion possible out of you while also being a withering critique of the us healthcare system in all its aspects","940":"i was about to toss this book is the struggle to finish pile and it took off it is an amazing book that gave me a great deal of insight in the struggles of my mil in the final years of my fil's life","941":"wonderful characters with set personalities a thorough account of what it is like to live with alzigmers as a patient and caregiver a little long at times but the final letter from the father to the son was outstanding kept a copy of it","942":"there was a thoughtful well written story in here about a woman whose husband was afflicted with early onset alzheimer's unfortunately the novel was dragged down by an interesting but incomplete story about her parents and an also incomplete and deeply boring story about her son","943":"this book is a family story with epic dimensions which impressed me very much i still feel emotionally touched and some scenes come back to my mind hours after putting that book down and i feel like i'll think about this book tomorrow and next week this book wasn't perfect though i had some hard times reading the first half of the book because the author is very detailed sometimes and i never knew whether an event would be important for the further story in fact i hardly knew where the story would lead what's the point of it but after the first half and discovering the 'real issue' of the book i thought it was brilliant to invest that much time into character developement and i have to just say that the characters of this book are very very well described they came very much to life for me for instance i talked with my best friend about this book he will not read this book because he's a pure science fiction reader and every time when i talked with him about the characters it was as if i really knew that people i said oh man i hope the character 's going to be alright or do you want to know what's further happened with the character and then we talked about this people and their problems generally it doesn't happen often i talk so intensively about a book but i wanted to talk a lot about this one as i said the first half of the book wasn't that good and i think it could have been a little bit shorter but once i was through i almost couldn't stop reading although i knew what the logical conclusion of that 'inescapable darkness' that enters the life of the family must be i will not give away what that 'darkness' or 'the real issue' might be because i think it is important the reader does not know beforehand for instance while reading the book i speculated very often and i also think it would keep some potential readers from reading this touching and somewhat important book most of the story is told by eileen starting in 1950 and ending in the 2000s later in the book there are some changes in perspective the first one did disturb me a little bit the following ones very easier to read as they happened more frequently i did not always like eileen but she's still a rather strong character with a well defined will i liked his husband ed a scientist very much although i rolled my eyes when eileen met him in the book he seemed to be the perfect guy athletic intelligent good looking all the cliches but he's also modest likeable and a passionate teacher at the university i'm also into science so i could identify whith him a little bit although the book wasn't perfect in every sense i rate it 5 stars i feel like that book deserves them for touching me so immensely thanks to simon and shuster for a digital copy of that book","944":" the book was hyped i read the blurbs on the back cover wow intergenerational epic destined to be classic it was somehow supposed to summarize 20th century america or something i read it and it didn't live up to the hype for me the daughter of irish immigrants eileen tumulty spends her childhood dealing with an alcoholic mother and a charismatic and capable father who lacks ambition she's determined not to follow in their footsteps as an adult she's ambitious but her ambition takes the form of status seeking she meets a man edmund leary who is handsome and has a brilliant scientific mind unfortunately for eileen he also lacks what she defines as a worthy ambition he doesn't lack purpose he's content to do something meaningful for himself which is to teach young people at a community college status means nothing to him it means almost everything to eileen here lies the source of conflict in the marriage eileen sees and judges everything through the lens of status and status symbols big house nice car mink coat successful son etc edmund isn't on the same wave length plus he's dealing with incipient neurological issues anyway i won't spoil the rest of the story just have to say that i didn't see eileen as heroic in the least the blurbs seem to imply that she was edmund was the closest to being an admirable person as anyone in the book the story dragged it was full of too many mundane details i kept hoping that eileen would see the folly of her ambitions toward the end of the book she does to a certain extent but i was expecting the author was leading me to some kind of moral awakening for eileen but she still remained in my mind as a rather shallow status seeking typical middle class american mostly it was a waste of about 20 hours of my life i'm a slow reader have a nice day","945":"closer to a 3 5 for me","946":"beautifully and sensitively drawn characters a wonderful read","947":"oh goodness hard to know where to put this book the story of a woman a marriage a family spare and direct the underlying message seemed to be add the title says we are not who we think we are or wish we would be or appear to be and we ultimately make do and live our lives taking advantage of some opportunities and missing others so if that sounds appealing go for it i did not have to force myself to read this but in the end i felt rather forlorn about the whole thing","948":"a story about family about love and most of all how to adapt to the changes that life throws at us again and again this book is more than just a story about its characters instead it is a book that will make you think about the bigger questions that exist at least it did for me the writing is lovely the characters and dialogue convincing and the story itself is real so so great am already guessing it will be my favorite book of 2015","949":"i did not understand the hype of this book it had no major event and was very long","950":"dragged on and onpointless unlikable characters impractical people who make senseless decisions way too long and much of the story really made no sense","951":" oof this is a tough one i know a lot of people flipped out about this book and it made a lot of year end top 10 lists this novel at least the reading of it reminded me a lot of the goldfinch it started out very strong and for the first half i was very engaged there is some terrific and delicious prose but wow the last half of this was a slog it was repetitive and dour without being interesting i stopped caring about everyone i felt every one of its 620 pages especially in the back half","952":"this is quite a long read and boy did it feel like it i really wanted to like it a family saga the story of eileen the daughter of irish immigrants and her determination that her life was going to be better than that lived by her parents - she was going to leave the slum apartments behind and live a much more comfortable life pursuing the american dream i was expecting a saga to sweep me off my feet full of colourful characters with a touch of the blarney stone whose lives would twist and turn full of emotional drama but this book was much \"quieter\" than what i was expecting the story was quite complex in the telling we know everything she did and why but i never felt that i got a glimpse into her mind never really \"understood\" her things happened to her but i didn't see them happening i was only told about these events later i enjoyed some parts of it but others well just fell a little flat and the book really wasn't at all what i would call gripping and unfortunately was a little boring in places","953":"this book was just too long and wasn't able to create any compassion for the characters i was just glad when i was able to close the book for the last time","954":"well written and emotionally moving but could have used some major editing too long","955":"let me tell you that this sweeping novel narrated by mare winningham was an amazing listening experience we are able to follow all of young eileen's hopes dreams fears and losses throughout her life you can't help but want more for her as she struggles from day to day nothing will stop eileen from acquiring her american dream as a young girl living in a small apartment in queens with her immigrant family she watches her parents struggle to get by as eileen gets older she does everything she needs to find success eileen finishes nursing school but throughout her career eventually decides to pursue medical administration when eileen marries ed leary she hopes all her dreams will materialize quickly but that does not come to pass they both have good jobs but ed is comfortable with his routine renting an upstairs apartment is about all of the commitment that ed is willing to invest in after many years eileen is able to talk ed into purchasing the building they live in so they finally have something of their own it isn't until decades later that eileen decides she wants more from this life once again ed is nearing retirement and their son is in high school getting ready for college soon eileen does all she can to achieve her dreams and even though she gets everything she wants their lives start a downward spiral she realizes that everything that it has taken her whole life to achieve she could lose in just a few months although this wasn't an action packed novel i found myself looking forward to listening to it with themes of family love illness and immigrants you may enjoy this book as much as i did i don't hesitate in recommending this book for either personal leisure or as a book club discussion","956":"i liked the last third of this book the rest of it seemed full of unnecessary details and was boring","957":"the one thing i liked about this book was that the characters were believable as the book moved along the decades with the characters the author captured the way society was with each decade even though the book was lengthy i am glad to have read it","958":"i don't know what to say about the 130 ish pages i read the prose was beautiful and the story was bland two stars is generous because again the prose was so lovely to read","959":"i was conflicted throughout this book i felt the writing style left me very removed from the characters and i didn't care that much about them until the last 200 pages then i couldn't put it down and was crying it is a good book but could have been even better with a few changes i think","960":"i was so bored i thought i couldn't finish this book i found i didn't care about the characters enough to continue through to the end i really wanted to like this book as it came so highly recommended i tried really i did but i persevered and at about the two thirds mark i started to somewhat enjoy it i am glad i finished it but felt it could have been more succinct and a more enjoyable read","961":" i would like to give this book a score half way between a four and a five it's an outstanding book and merits five stars my rating system however generally pertains to my likelihood to re read the book to own it to loan it and to treasure it through all time i cannot say all that about this book because the story circles altzheimers disease and i do not love the topic in part because i'm watching it destroy my father and in part because i dread the genetic link that suggests i could be next i had only heard it was a wonderful wonderful saga and i raced to purchase it from audible com i did not realize it would make me think about what's happening to my dad when i bought it escape reading it is not but engaging satisfying honest to the core it is i finished just this morning and now need to sit with it a while before i say more","962":"i wasn't sure about this one when i started it but quickly was drawn into the characters and their lives eileen is the only child of irish immigrant parents and ed is a brilliant scientist who prefers teaching at community college as the years unfold we watch their struggles as eileen dreams of escaping to a better neighborhood and as she and ed raise their son connell eileen constantly pursues her dream life while ed remains content teaching at a local college and forgoes a brilliant career in research in the midst of it all a heart breaking calamity befalls the family and forces them to face uncertainty and ultimately grief the calamity the faced as a family was unexpected and therefore all the more real and relatable their ultimate choices and trials were almost too close to home a wonderful first by this new author looking forward to more from matthew thomas","963":"sometime this book was so hard to read i had to put it down i often saw myself and my own awful behavior in a very similar circumstance i had to forgive the characters and myself a really brilliant and beautiful book","964":" i wish i'd had a clearer picture of what this book is about before i began reading family pursing the american dream flawed father son relationship hardworking woman who holds it all together all good things but when i got halfway through this 640 page novel and discovered that the main plot centers around the husband father being diagnosed with alzheimer's at 51 years old it was not what i anticipated i have experienced alzheimer's in my own family and i have empathy for the struggles that a family dealing with early onset of the disease would face but it wasn't what i was looking for in this kind of novel notwithstanding i finished which is a testament to the author's having created excellent characters i did want to see how it would end so i stayed with it i do think that he could have said in 400 pages what he said in 600 though the anecdotes became too frequent and too focused on minutiae and my interest waned about 2 3 of the way through there were sections that i skimmed because they did not add anything that moved the story forward however the story did give me food for thought about some end of life issues that i had not considered i would recommend this book if you have a particular interest in alzheimer's or end of life family care for me i finished with an empty feeling my next book will be something more uplifting","965":"would have been better if it were only 1 2 the length","966":" we are not ourselves spans a generation of a 20th century family with all their loves their hopes their ambitions and struggles we meet ed a gifted neuroscientist who chooses teaching over a financially successful career in pharmaceutical research and eileen leary a nurse who quickly moves up the ladder of hospital administration when ed is stricken with alzheimer's at age 51 both their struggles and love deepens it's ed who becomes the novel's defining character and as a parent the one who helps their son connell mature and develop a beautifully written novel with deep and emotionally satisfying characters","967":"tough read i prefer to be entertained or educated or both when hunkering down with a book this novel struck too close to reality real life problems and real life results to be enjoyable for me","968":"excellent book about the life of a family spanning seven decades narrated mainly through the voice of eileen the irish mother wife nurse and extrovert friend and relative i was amazed by her tenacity of friendship there was no dearth of hardship and memorable moments truly touching thomas the author wrote a simple narrative about difficult topics in which we all have exposure","969":"amazing character construction this book caught me by surprize i have never felt so totally immersed in another character","970":"i couldn't believe this was a debut novel it covers so much territory emotionally and time wise yet feels focused it is long but there is nothing i would cut it is depressing but the world he created drew me back to it and i thought the end was completely gratifying impressive","971":"this book was about 300 pages too long i must say though when i was about 66% through i finally reached the point that i had the desire to find what what would finally become of the characters in this book bottom line i am glad i read it but would probably not recommend it","972":"my face is a river of tears","973":"this book was a real treat beautifully written and insightful i often think that male authors don't write with the same emotional resonance as female authors but there are exceptions this is clearly one the novel focuses on the inner life of the main characters principally eileen and later her son while a lot of ground is covered over many years it is not a plot driven novel you may not always like eileen or approve of her choices but you get a clear understanding of her motivations she is a relentlessly strong woman her life has forced her to be this and she rises to the occasion she wonders at one point if she will ever be able to be weak and frivolous but that is not her fate two of my favorite points in the novel one when she has finally achieved her lifelong dream of a home in the suburbs eileen has a sudden realization that the very act of placing her furniture in the house will make it less ideal also late in the book she returns to her old house and wishes she could turn back the clock just for a few moments to experience the life that she had in the past a life that she was constantly striving to improve upon she realizes in retrospect how warm and satisfying it was i hate it when people talk about themselves in reviews but who has not looked back on a past that didn't seem spectacular at the time and realized it was one of the best times of your life lots of beautiful insights about humanity in this novel i loved it","974":" alzheimer's sucks that's the biggest take away from this epic 620 page novel in all seriousness this was an epic novel it swept the course of the life of one character her childhood marriage raising of her own child and watching her husband deteriorate from the disease it was an honest interesting portrayal of the hopes and dreams of american people i appreciated the ways in which thomas swept over entire years of the main characters' lives in a sentence and then dropped in on vignettes that explicate motivations and desires it had a fascinating attention to the micro lives we live but it was sort of bleak","975":"first off this is a long read there were times i loved this book and others where it could not hold my interest i would rate it between 3 4 stars","976":"the book starts with a promise to discuss the aspirations and struggles in as well as the societal pressures to the chase of the american dream however it slowly dissolves and is taken over by a very different struggle alzheimer's while this might be a metaphor it is unclear what the metaphor is in reference to thomas fails to connect the story lines beyond the obvious day to day obstacles which he goes into with unneeded detail leaving me wonder what the book was actually about","977":"wow there's a slow build but it builds up to something truly beautiful and unforgettable","978":"devastating on many levels joyful in certain moments blisteringly painful in others i'm a bit angry with myself because i realize these human frailties i've been excusing as a natural part of life and of who i am are actually things that can be changed if i wanted to put forth the effort that's how'll you'll feel by the end wondering if it's time to put forth a little more effort to be content with the hand you've been dealt and to change the crap you've been complaining about for years","979":"the plot is an excuse to enter into the author's reflection of what it is to live the prose has a patina of nostalgia to it","980":" a well written and endearing story about an irish girl named eileen and her family she grows up wanting more from life and meets edmund a scientist it's an epic book over 600 pages long describing her early life her married life the choices she and her husband make along the way and we discover the reasons for some of those choices as the story moves along i thought the author captured the challenges of family life and relationships in a sensitive and compelling manner i felt deeply for the characters and the challenges and conflicts life brought their way i found parts of the book long and depressing however it was truthful in a raw sort of way life sometimes is difficult and challenging i just found it hard to read right before i went to bed i don't recommend this book for bedtime reading however it is a really good and compelling story well worth reading i understand why it was nominated for several book awards","981":"wow this book packs quite a punch i am actually still trying to separate myself from this novel as it really does envelop you into the world of the o'leary tumultys on such an emotional level those looking for great numbers of exciting things to happen might be disappointed but for those looking for a keen examination of everyday existence and the obstacles suddenly and inexplicably put in front of our 'normal' lives it certainly delivers i can't say there were times i wasn't frustrated by the characters or at times found them easy to root for but i suppose most of us if held up to this kind of microscope would have others saying the same thing about us certainly one is reminded during reading this book that we all have flaws and are all of the flesh with the inevitability of death only varied by how it happens recommended but with the provision for the reader to be prepared to read about things that may potentially happen in the future which are both real and unsettling at the same time","982":"some of this book was really very good some of it was flawed it was brutally honest and the characters were well drawn i'd give it a 3 5","983":"oh how could so many readers whose opinions i value have liked this book so much well written but i could not finish it since it made me want to stick my head in the oven luckily mine is electric but you know otoh rarely does a book affect me so intensely so i suppose the author got something right","984":"this review has been hidden because it contains spoilers to view it click here i am amazed that this is a first novel the painful portrait of alzheimer's and what it does to the victim and caregivers was so accurate that i can only surmise the author has had this experience in his own life or at the very least worked with someone who had i had the privilege and i mean that without any irony or sarcasm of taking care of my grandfather as he succumbed to this disease many years ago when so little was known as our roles reversed and he became the one in need of guidanc i am amazed that this is a first novel the painful portrait of alzheimer's and what it does to the victim and caregivers was so accurate that i can only surmise the author has had this experience in his own life or at the very least worked with someone who had i had the privilege and i mean that without any irony or sarcasm of taking care of my grandfather as he succumbed to this disease many years ago when so little was known as our roles reversed and he became the one in need of guidance and care our bond increased to the point where others faded away but we remained attached mentally and emotionally this book captured the frustration the anger the hope the despair and the eventual acceptance of what's really important and what lies ahead for all of us a wonderful book not always easy to read but well worth it more","985":"the entire first half of the book is incredibly slow and i think a lot of the childhood portion of eileen's life could have been cut out there were named characters that were only mentioned once and never again that served no real purpose which is me being nitpicky that said i really enjoyed this book and i cared enough for the characters that the ending left me in tears i never truly lost interest while reading which is also a good thing","986":"excellent writing but bit of a depressing tale so be forewarned","987":"long slow at first better at mid point","988":"not every novel needs to be epic in scope in the first hundred pages or so matthew thomas had already successfully covered a few decades in the life of eileen the ambitious protagonist of his first novel why not keep going i read it until the end but it would probably have been a stronger novel if it had been 200 or 300 pages shorter there were some heartwrenching moments in the depiction of alzheimer's but i take my hat off to the author for never yielding to sentimentalism","989":"3 stars in need of some editing","990":"i'll write a longer review soon but if any of my friends are actually reading this please know this is one of the best books i've read listened to in years i did both the writing is stunning and you should put this at the very top of your list don't wait it's one i will be rereading and rereading","991":"min kamp but i finished it anyway","992":"powerful multi generational story about family american aspirations and identity and the loss thereof beautifully written with parts that will make you sigh cringe or cry always a good sign when i get emotionally invested in a book and its characters","993":"i would have no reservations in buying this as a gift for many it would be well received","994":"not gripping but still interesting i found myself wanting it to be done long before the end still i wanted to finish it glad for the generational perspective but found it hard to swing back and forth between perspectives of mother and son it felt like looking at a photograph with more than one possible subject i kept asking what is this book about","995":" i read this book because misha collins told me to and i pretty much do whatever castiel says however though i tried valiantly to enjoy it i did not frankly it isn't a subject i would have been drawn to on my own in the first place so perhaps my review of it will not be the most fair this book is about relationships mostly familial relationships but also that point at which your spouse or partner becomes your family it is also about what happens to a family with the passing of time and the physical and emotional tole of mental illness it is a sad story that left me feeling rather depressed not because i was personally invested in the characters per se but because the subject matter was depressing","996":"i thoroughly enjoyed this look into a family struggling to survive and get ahead while alzheimer's disease creeps into their family","997":"i highly recommend this book there were times where it was difficult to read because parts of it were incredibly said but it was also impossible to put down","998":"awful i gave up on it","999":" beautifully written but just like life at times much of the time quite sad i kept coming back to the title and thinking of the various ways in which is can be interpreted often we are never who we think we are simply b c it's what we think and not what we live the eagerness to become something or think of oneself differently because of the possession of something else in life a wife husband children job home car riches etc sets us up to believe we are something or will become something that ultimately simply does not happen","1000":" this was so weird i was just reading jana's review and my phone rang and guess who was on the other end i really really loved this book it's long yes nothing monumental happens at least compared to most of my reading experiences but often the ordinary can be monumental to those who are experiencing it i listened to the book narrated by mare winningham and the narration was as quiet and subtle as the writer the entire experience was similar to finding a penny on the ground then another and another and after a while you have an amount that will buy something the story of a woman from teenage years to widowhood is filled with strength and emotion often mine even my husband who doesn't read fiction accidentally listened to this book and loved it i look forward to the next work by mr thomas","1001":"very rich excellent book matthew thomas writes so intimately of love marriage parenting challenges family dynamic and more i'm left feeling a hug from his message and a reminder of what is important in life","1002":"i'm torn on how many stars to give this book i did feel it was too long it definitely isn't a plot driven book and it did drag in parts it's a story about a life and a marriage and it touched me but mostly because of the parallels to events that have occurred in my own life and in my parents' marriage specifically with my father's alzheimer's diagnosis i wouldn't necessarily recommend this book as one everyone should read but it touched me on a personal level and for that reason it was worth reading also the main character's name is eileen","1003":"this review has been hidden because it contains spoilers to view it click here i think this is going to be one of those books that i didn't particularly like directly after i read it but that has some interesting ideas that slosh around in my head long after it's over my book group will discuss it and i think the discussion will be interesting because the book deals with a family groping to come to terms with alzheimer's disease the family dynamics are fairly normal workaholic dad socially obsessed mom and spoiled brat son i found this book to be fairly tedious while i think this is going to be one of those books that i didn't particularly like directly after i read it but that has some interesting ideas that slosh around in my head long after it's over my book group will discuss it and i think the discussion will be interesting because the book deals with a family groping to come to terms with alzheimer's disease the family dynamics are fairly normal workaholic dad socially obsessed mom and spoiled brat son i found this book to be fairly tedious while i was living through the dad's decline with every step of his decline and of his wife's range of emotions disgust guilt regret embarrassment shame all the usual feelings associated with terminal illness the son is a teenager when his father begins to exhibit signs of illness and he is shielded from the truth until it is too late to deny he lives through his own progression of feelings but mostly he's a selfish self centered twerp we see less of the internal workings of the father but his outward behavior is described brilliantly this is a complex plot wrapped in a simple story i'm still not entirely sure that i loved it or hated it more","1004":"it was ok not the best writing but the story needed an ending so i finished it","1005":"loved the first part of this book kind of slogged through the last 400 pages parts that would have been interesting were passed over and other information dragged out a bit depressing","1006":"i had really high hopes for this book the character development was excellent but it should be since it was 600 pages long none of the characters were very likable the book lacked joy in any capacity but i will say i thought the development of the alzheimer's disease storyline was interesting and somewhat educational","1007":"a small book that reads large there are so many astonishing passages the rare man who writes in a resonant female voice perhaps books are all about the timing in ones' life but this is one of the best discoveries i've made in years","1008":"while i thought the book was overwritten it was still deeply engaging poignant u0026amp a multi generational family saga the characters are well drawn believable with family dynamics that are touching wrenching u0026amp both tragic and compassionate","1009":" this was a tough read but so worth it what i admire most about the book is how thomas makes the reader experience eileen's entire life beginning to end most books only provide a snap shot into a character's life but the scope of we are not ourselves is truly remarkable it takes the reader through 60 years of history and shows not only how eileen grows and matures over time but also how middle class america changed during that time period the novel also examines spousal and parental relationships in interesting ways and makes you feel for this family and everything they go through beware the heaviness of this book though before you decide to take it on it provides an unflinching look at how alcoholism and illness can destroy lives and the hardships these characters endure are crushing in other words this is a masterpiece worth reading but it's not an easy one to get through it made me feel all tha emotions","1010":"fantastic in almost every way however there were sections that dragged a bit and some moments that seemed unnecessary almost like the author was trying too hard to be poetic or reflective and it ended up kind of rambling but gratefully those were few overall an excellent read","1011":" somehow i lasted through the 20 hours of this audiobook mostly commuting to work so i'm going to waste a bit more time venting a little about this thing since it appeared on several lists from reputable book reviewers who described how authentic it is i completely disagree the first few hours are interesting enough and the writing is fine then the story starts to slow to a crawl and the author is detailing day to day minutia but no interesting events are happening any more for hours and more hours once in a while you think something is about to happen and take the bait to continue listening - but then it doesn't i honestly couldn't follow whether months or years were supposed to be passing - sometimes the year was stated at the beginning of chapters but the timing of the story is really hard to follow on audio i just know it felt like we were slogging through miles of molasses many of the reviewers here note the book is not plot driven but character driven fine but that implies the characters actually think or say interesting things these don't much of the descriptions are repetitious the words are different but they say the same sorts of things over and over at some point you realize the main character's eileen's husband ed has dementia eileen is a nurse yet she remains utterly clueless - for so long that it completely passes the point of absurdity at one point after she's ignored smaller clues she realizes ed an accomplished ph d can no longer perform basic addition or transcribe grades to his gradebook - and still doesn't clue in that something might be wrong - you honestly can't help but wonder if this might signal an odd plot twist where eileen has some sort of mental deficiency or illness herself but nope...it never even gets addressed and even in retrospect when ed finally gets diagnosed with alzheimer's eileen never even thinks about how nuts it was that she didn't see the signs or was in denial or whatever that was supposed to be ed and eileen take turns vying for who is least likeable before ed gets sick before they're even married he clearly wins the author perhaps intended to describe him as having high standards standards of what i'm not sure but instead he just comes across as unbendingly and illogically stubborn and totally unlikeable but eileen quickly catches up with her idiocy as well as her rigid inability to express herself she seems like a crabby old lady long before she actually is old she often narrates about her inability to express her emotions or communicate with her husband in fact i thought though the whole beginning of the book that she'd leave him but woven thoughout the whole book we're supposed to buy that these two have hot sex and are totally free in the bedroom despite the totally wooden coldness between them the rest of the time there's no passion not even anger but inexplicably magic sex utterly completely unbelievable having not noted the author's name this is when i realized it must be a man writing the voice of the woman character indeed one of the merits of the book is supposed to be its realistic description of taking care of someone with alzeimer's which is particularly hard long with early onset alzheimer's this is the most annoyingly inaccurate part of the book we hear in detail about the thousands a month eileen pays in costs yet we're supposed to believe that she pays for all this out of her nursing salary savings after her husband is forced to retire in his early 50s along with expensive private college tuition for her son and the mortgage for a house she sprang for that was even on two salaries well above her means magically everything turns out ok and she even gets to keep - and fix up - her house the math does not add up at all not even close i don't mind lack of attention to details like this if a book is entertaining but when you make the focus of the book watching the grass grow minutia of the characters' unchanging daily lives and spend hours on the boring and depressing hardships of this at least make it somewhat believable at least get it in the ballpark i could go on for pages about similar issues with this book but will stop now oddly enough the last 45 minutes it was as if the author woke up from some sort of coma and remembered he was telling a story and i remembered that he could actually be interesting only about 18 hours too late","1012":"loved it and hated it a but sad for me","1013":" i really liked this book it is a story of how to deal with change with lost dreams with real life be sure and have a dictionary handy when you read it the author seems to subscribe to the roget's thesaurus writing school why use the word gleam when the word coruscate is available if it was just once i would not have commented but i used a dictionary for this book more often than the last time i read hawthornes the house of the seven gables if not for that i probably would have given this book five stars","1014":"well written just didn't really like any of the characters","1015":"for me this book didn't live up to its reviews most importantly it is waaay too long the author's editor did him a disservice by not insisting he shorten it by at least a third","1016":"i slowly got into this book and then it had me great writing made me think about how simple yet so complex and frail our lives are","1017":"i loved the epic view of this story sweeping in its account of full lifetimes and the concerns and values people hold at every stage of their changing lives through the span of 2nd half 20th century all within the nyc confines i could not help but relate it to the non fiction being mortal not a stylistic masterpiece but very insightful well developed and well written it is a love story and a touching sad one","1018":"well written and not at all what i expected from the cover description i will be thinking about this one for a while","1019":"this was a long book a long long long book well written definitely compelling in parts but also mind numbingly boring in others particularly the second half ultimately just not for me","1020":" matthew thomas' debut novel we are not ourselves gripped me from page one through to the end and it has had me thinking about it and talking about it ever since the book tells the story of eileen from the time she is in the fourth grade in 1951 through her teenage years education career and into her marriage and motherhood exploring love loss disappointment joy prejudice fear motivation and duty along her journey you meet her husband ed and son connell whom you also get to know intimately as a reader you are offered the opportunity to view the world through both eileen and connell through the compelling and reflection provoking narrative it is easy to appreciate why eileen is so incapable of openly expressing her feelings and love for her family and you understand and empathize with connell's apparent disregard for the \"perfect\" life and need to get away in some ways i find myself struggling to write a summary of this book for fear of revealing even the smallest plot detail for me everything about this book felt like home and i don't want to take that feeling of familiarity surprise or family away from any future readers and i hope everyone who reads this review becomes one the life lesson oft quoted \"you never know what you have until it's gone\" is likely the most poignant that i've ever heard that specific lesson causes the deepest reflections for me and i'm sure that i'm not alone in taking things for granted from time to time matthew thomas reminds us that the constant struggle to achieve the life that we deem perfect will eventually lead us to the heartbreaking realization that everything we had was always perfect and we should have spent more time appreciating it all while we had it the author welcomes you into the minds of his characters with an unflinching portrayal of their innermost fears thoughts and emotions the title we are not ourselves is beautifully aware as we go through life we find that our emotions and circumstances lead us to decisions and behaviours that we do not recognize in ourselves everyone in the world has moments where they feel unlike themselves and thus the tittle is not only beautifully aware but beautifully real the pacing of the book spans decades and the chapters are strung together in what appears a seamless transition i found this style of writing to be inspiring and compelling both as a writer and a reader i feel like i've known these families since before i was born this book has both inspired and terrified me on my own journey as i write my first novel at times i am inspired with new ways to arrange the pace and the narrative within my own novel at other times i am so taken by the incredible flow and use of language that i feel inadequate yet compelled to continue reaching chapters that were included in we are not ourselves remind me that i need to include scenes and chapters that simply bring the reader into the characters and their stories i have been writing with the intent of having every chapter be wrought with deep meaning and direct links to the climatic portion of the book reading we are not ourselves reminded me of the importance of slowing down to allow readers to get to know the characters and the reasons for their existence in the story that makes twice that matthew thomas has reminded me that it's about the journey not the destination","1021":"mixed feelings about this one at times thought it dragged sometimes sounded like a how to prepare for old age mixed feelings about eileen was surprised that she stayed with ed but glad and how did she manage to pull everything off financially always seemed like she was going into major debt","1022":"kept reading and waiting for something of significance to happen read to the end no deep meaning or inspiring thoughts just a depressing story disappointed","1023":" this book was brilliant at times i felt myself wondering how we'd gotten to a certain point in time so fast but then with more detail this book could easily have ended up thousands of pages i still would have read them all it was very character driven and included much detail you knew exactly what everyone was thinking and feeling all the time with the exception of ed for people who have experience with someone like him it's easy to figure out early on what it happening i don't want to spoil anything i highly recommend this book","1024":" reading is such a subjective and individually psychological process this book is extremely well written and i admire the historical details and the breadth of this family saga however i never cared enough for the protagonist to be completely swept away i gave it 100 pages but did not get pulled in as i struggle to write my first novel it makes me think hard about how to write characters that readers want to read about i think this is where the subjectivity comes in and readers' individual psychologies if the book is good and this one definitely is the author has done her his job then it's up to the reader whether he she is in the right frame of mind or place in her his own life to appreciate the story i might give this one another try sometime","1025":"thumbs up tough subject","1026":"for this matthew thomas provided a unique view of a family facing huge hurdles in life including all the personal successes and failures while a book of fiction it equated a vision of how many families deal with this major issue impacting lives throughout the world while i wondered where the book was leading me during it's early chapters it quickly grew on me as lives of the leary's lived on through the years","1027":"an epic achievement for a first novel which kept me heart stoppingly engrossed throughout except for the baseball bits would definitely want to read matthew's next book he has the knack of revealing the enormous eventfulness of ordinary lives and loves","1028":" this book was very grueling at the start as it is 620 pages long i was determined to see it through and found myself caught up in the story about eileen born of irish immigrants and living in new york city eileen is very ambitious but transfers that ambition to her husband who shows signs of a mental disorder midway through their life together her son collum also has a viewpoint in some parts of the book i was uneasy following their lives and felt their loneliness it surprised me when close friends and family that loved them showed up occasionally is the title of the book the justification for not letting us truly inside their lives we are only given bits and pieces of points in their lives before the book moves on i found that very disconcerting","1029":"i didn't like it as much as i expected to and don't know if i'd recommend it despite the strong writing and complex characters i had a bit of a hard time with the pacing which sped along in the first part of the book and then gradually slowed and ground to a halt near the end the adult characters were so frustrating yet interesting and convincing but i found the long sections focused on the son to be much less convincing unbelievable and overly pompous despite that i found the contrast interesting between the immigrants and their children vs the entitled generation s to follow there were times in this long book where i was definitely moved and i thought these characters would stay with me but as i kept on going those feelings mostly faded and my impatience grew i really think it could should have been significantly shorter i know authors love using lists of things in their descriptions i see it constantly but there were so many super super long lists i had to laugh when there was yet another some more ruthless editing and a bit less pomposity and it could have been a book i'd have enjoyed quite a lot","1030":" i was fortunate enough to get this as a first read book in its simplest terms it is a tale of one woman's lifetime how each phase of her life prepared her for the next how things didn't always go as planned but how the power of love sometimes so subtly can pull you through thomas is able to draw you in to be able to feel her pain and triumph then he changes character and tells the story from connell's point of view and as a child to young man it is a different perspective i enjoyed the trip through the family's life","1031":"this is the first book i've been able to read in a long while and maybe i'm out of practice or something but the entire last third of the book brutalized my heart i read the last 200 pages or so on the amtrak to chicago to visit a friend for spring break and what with the slowly setting sun and the sadness that's been coming back the last couple weeks and the constant in between ness that i've been feeling i was hunched over in my seat sobbing when i got to the letter ed wrote to his son that kind of articulate parental love took something in me and snapped it in half i also loved the portrayal of the after effects of growing up poor and how that can manifest in different ways eg ed's inability to let go of penny pinching and eileen's romanticization of big clean houses and nice cars and minks and the inclusion of eileen's racism on a side note eileen as a child made me think of francie a lot","1032":"i really enjoyed this i don't know how i first learned of it but i so enjoyed reading about irish immigrants to nyc brought back many memories of my mother's stories growing up also enjoyed reading about the story of eileen and edmund don't want to give anything away","1033":"this review has been hidden because it contains spoilers to view it click here my disclaimer upfront matthew thomas taught my son english in 11th grade regardless i loved this book and would have loved it even if i had never met him and had no connection to him this is a debut novel and is the story of eileen leary nee tumulty born in queens of immigrant irish parents she is a dreamer and hopes for a better life than her parents lived she becomes a nurse and marries a science professor and has enough ambition for both of them as they both work in their careers she my disclaimer upfront matthew thomas taught my son english in 11th grade regardless i loved this book and would have loved it even if i had never met him and had no connection to him this is a debut novel and is the story of eileen leary nee tumulty born in queens of immigrant irish parents she is a dreamer and hopes for a better life than her parents lived she becomes a nurse and marries a science professor and has enough ambition for both of them as they both work in their careers she dreams of leaving queens for a town in westchester and having a family there is joy with disappointment along the way but in thomas' deft hands the story is new and fresh he writes beautifully and i was touched by parts of this book in unexpected ways i highly recommend this memorable debut novel more","1034":"this review has been hidden because it contains spoilers to view it click here i wish that there had been something in the synopsis about alzheimer's i felt like i lived it all again with my dad if you haven't dealt with this disease this book tells it like it really is","1035":"i don't usually do reviews but i felt i must for this book i had a hard time getting through it so many times i wanted to stop but i kept reading it is really worth it to keep reading the end justifies the entire book my advise is to keep reading you will not be disappointed","1036":"it seemed slow at first but once i got passed the middle it moved quickly i don't think it is an award winner but i cared enough about the characters to follow them with some anticipation","1037":"this is such a beautiful book about american life the story was so real and heart breaking but also inspiring","1038":"i listened to this book it was narrated by the amazing mare winningham excellent","1039":"an exceptional debut novel the la times called it an epic of small events it is a starkly realistic depiction of a marriage that endures despite the devastation of early onset alzheimer's eileen was plagued with understandable yearnings for a life different from and better than the one she had growing up this led to some serious misunderstandings between her and her husband but her relentless determination and her love for her husband gave her the strength to persevere","1040":" you know how that one couple put a camera in their owl box and live streamed it on the internet sharing every single moment with millions of enthralled viewers around the world i never understood why all the fascination to me watching owls sit around in a box having babies feeding them flying out flying in day after day sounds tedious and horribly mundane why would anyone want to watch an owl this book was my owl box i couldn't put it down like the millions of people who watched the owls i kept thinking something miraculous was bound to happen i became absorbed with these people stuck in the tidy little box of their uneventful lives when the smallest thing happened like when they finally moved to the suburbs i was joyous but apprehensive i magnified the event making it into something it wasn't what if the house fell down around them and they ended up homeless what if they went bankrupt instead eileen got a new kitchen counter i was so happy for her but still worried about the rest of the house and of course their finances i'm baffled by a book that must be as long as war and peace about nothing i'm even more perplexed by the fact that i spent my entire sunday in bed racing to finish it what power did it hold over me i'm exceedingly ambivalent about every character in this book i cannot even remember their names i had to reference the book in order to mention eileen the author was brilliant at creating suspense the same kind of suspense we create in our own lives like the show seinfeld where nothing really happened made that fact a joke this same kind suspense pervades the entire book but it's not funny what is on the author's side is the reader's expectation to be entertained this is a novel for crying out loud and something extraordinary is supposed to happen we paid for it right if that weren't the case then every single person living in a nursing home would publish their memoirs tomorrow but thankfully publishers try to save the public from being bored to death so that doesn't happen except in the case of this book it just did i pray they don't read this book aloud to anyone in assisted living or the market will become saturated with these lengthy owl box books which amount to little more than a rambling conversation over the backyard fence about that neighbor eileen or edith and did you know she moved her family to the suburbs well she always was a little bit stage whisper racist and she didn't like where the neighborhood was going if you know what i mean oh sorry am i boring you maybe your just not into ordinary everyday things like most people's lives and owl boxes","1041":" good overall good book overall got a little slow in the middle eileen is a loving woman who allows her self to be define by her parents marriage and relationship when she marries ed she has a perceive idea of where life can take them she learns to make her peace with the good man she married but not until it's almost too late their son in turn will be saved from his mothers ambitions by his father who loves him deeply and completely the characters portrayed real emotions even when the reader may wish they were kinder or less selfish i like the honesty in which they dealt with what life gave them","1042":"in the description of the book the word hilarity is used i don't feel there is any hilarity in this book it is a sober and brutally honest look at the life of a family because of the honesty there were times i was not fond of the characters or their actions if anyone you know is suffering from alzheimer's it may be too difficult to read","1043":"this book is not easy to rate i almost gave up on it as it looks like many other readers did or nearly did the first third of the book is slow moving the characters aren't likable and there wasn't much to keep my interest eileen leary is cold blunt controlling easily embarrassed materialistic and isn't anyone i'd want to spend time with which makes it seem implausible that she should have so many friends ed is just plain weird even when he's young connell is awkward and ungrateful which i suppose makes him a normal child but i couldn't find anything to like about him when they're together as a family their conversations are uncomfortable and dysfunctional as i reached the middle of the book though the characters became somewhat more sympathetic the things that made ed so odd and unrelatable become redeeming qualities his disdain for american consumerism and social phoniness for example there's a lot of description in this book much of it unnecessary and i agree with other readers that this novel could've been edited by at least 100 pages do we really need all the details about connell's various short term romances despite the amount of description there were some things i couldn't picture in my head we learn that eileen is beautiful but in what way i have no idea what she looks like there are pages devoted to describing what the new house looks like but i can't get a feel for what ed and eileen's friends look like i don't really know which couple is which connell is described as a bit of a fat kid but then also as athletic and muscular by the time he gets to college is he introverted and nerdy or a confident good looking guy i was never really sure the last half of the book was much more enjoyable to read but there were still parts that seemed inconsistent or unnecessary where did bethany come from what's this about a family trip to italy when did that happen why is it in several parts of the book that the family regularly attends mass but eileen never once seems to lean on her catholic faith and turn to her church when life throws her some serious curve balls instead she uncharacteristically invests emotionally and financially in bethany's voodoo scheme it doesn't make sense despite the problems of this novel it was still thought provoking and ultimately heartbreaking i'd be more inclined to recommend it if it were 400 500 pages in length it's a good story but i'm not sure it's epic enough in scope to justify the 620 pages","1044":"this review has been hidden because it contains spoilers to view it click here eileen tumulty is the nora webster of queens or anyway it sort of feels that way the remove of the heroine the mix of dreams and pragmatism a woman had to take on board in the 60s 70s if the father figure died or otherwise failed anyway","1045":"this novel was billed as a multigenerational irish immigrant family saga completely misbilled it is an intelligently written brilliant novel of one woman's life it is heartbreaking and painful but also breathtakingly beautiful a realistic gut wrenching love story of ordinary people in extraordinary circumstances almost impossible to believe this is a freshman effort","1046":"i don't feel guilty about not finishing this one the writing is completely flat as i say to my fourth grade students you need to show not tell","1047":" thomas's long long long novel about a small middle class american family just didn't do it for me a psychological portrait of family members should evoke at least a little empathy for the characters but i didn't feel a thing for any of the learys ed was strangely inaccessible his wife eileen a little more fully realized but their son connell didn't seem real to me until the story's epilogue the best part of the book i can buy the idea that some scientists are workaholic emotionally repressed and too proud to admit weakness and i accept that some nurses are controlling practical minded and seem hard but i never got a sense of how ed and eileen feel about themselves their marriage and their social environment we understand that eileen is very social and spends much of her limited spare time entertaining and talking for hours to her friends but with few exceptions we don't know who these people are what they have in common with eileen and what they might talk about nor do we get a sense of how she feels about her career is she proud of what she does every day and the advancements she's made over the years if thomas wants us to know that the most important thing in the world is to love and be loved there's not enough love in his fictional family to spill outside the doors of their suburban home as a result this story portrays a narrow self interested definition of love i had to struggle to work up the enthusiasm to finish","1048":"i had a hard time deciding how to rate this book there were times when i was really annoyed and kind of bored with the book and then times when it was so beautiful and moving ultimately my book group had a really excellent discussion about it and it made me settle on a fairly high rating by the way i love my book group this is not the first time our discussion has been so rich it has made my rating of a book go up my main beef with the book is that i can't stand eileen i mean she is not the kind of person i would ever choose to spend so much time with and i just spent over a month with her ugh she is mostly believable and that what what was so hard she is the epitome of middle class woman striving after the american dream in such a blind pursuit that they lose themselves to their humanity she is racist conniving and materialistic i really wanted to smack her i could have done with about 100 pages fewer of her and her mean petty thoughts i feel a lot of love and sympathy for ed but connell is basically a non entity in the book for a long time toward the end of the book i really relate to him and feel love and sympathy for his situation but for the first 5 6 of the book he is a caricature it is like matthew thomas said to himself what are the stereotypes of a middle class white kid with a hard ish life well first he will get bullied then he will become a bully himself i won't actually let the readers into his brain that much so they won't really understand why he is such an asshole but i will make him into an asshole who mysteriously throws a baseball through the window of his favorite store then he will be a pompous debater on his high school debate team then he will go to college where he will not be able to find himself and have an existential crisis none of his personality changes will be explained or have a context or make sense but as long as i perpetually draw on different caricatures maybe no one will notice how flat and undeveloped he is after all that you'd think i would really hate the book but despite all the short comings it is poetic and beautifully written the last hundred pages are really moving and had me sobbing also i think the book did some interesting things with questions of identity and who we are what makes us us on one hand we are a collection of our experiences what we experience from our family and our culture of course eileen is racist and classist that is how everyone in her community in the 70s and 80s was on the other hand we are what we have been given in our genes we are also a collection of neural impulses that direct our brain in a certain way so who is ed eventually he is not himself and while we exist for ourselves exclusively how we are in our own brains or at least what bits of information we have stored in our brains since there's more that's happened than what's in your memory page 502 we are for others only what we allow them to see and how they interpret what they see we know eileen is a nurse and a good one at that but we never get a window into her professional life at all conversely her colleagues would never know who she is at home dealing with ed struggling through the pain and heartbreak of having him fall apart who are we in the world if we are only that for ourselves and everyone else has to fill in the blanks when they are away from us is it real are we real if no one else sees it trying to imagine that this is part of why we get so little detail on connell that thomas is trying to make a point about our limited ability to really truly know someone i feel a bit more sympathy for the book and that is why i ended up giving it 4 stars though at times i thought about 2 5","1049":"as i read this i was often overcome with a familiar feeling a feeling that i knew the leary family that somehow they are my own family rearranged there was implicit tension a quiet push and pull of thomas' prose that served as a reminder average lives are extraordinary family is extraordinary thomas captures the emotional coast upward and downward faced by all of us reminds us of the ways we ourselves have failed our loved ones learned from our regrets thomas writes about family as it shapes us and he does it so simply that you will forget how enthralling his language is he's injected beauty into every day joys and heartbreaks and captured the essence of love","1050":" this is an admirable well written book that i wanted to but could not enjoy the first section was especially interesting due to the familial similarities my grandmother called herself eileen her name was ellen but she thought that too plain my parents lived in woodside when i was two they moved to east meadow irish ness and alcohol ran in the family but the inexorable slide of hard working eileen toward bad things are gonna happen was not fun i disliked connell and groaned with each poor choice i don't think ed's original personality was well enough established for the reader to have had as much understanding of what was lost as we might have we hardly know ed any other way than declining when eileen had a moment of enlightenment over some indian food it's too little too late for me as i said it's all well done in a minutely detailed and agonizing way but i just felt so bad for eileen that it tainted my enjoyment of the book i didn't want to spend so much time with this family i would however recommend it to appropriate library patrons and bookclubs due the solid writing and its general popularity","1051":"poignant touching novel of love caregiving grief and hopes and dreams and reality","1052":"this book is for you if if you like epic family sagas...if you've got a penchant for a touch of the tragic irish...and if you're willing to slow down for prose http booksforherreviews com 2014 08","1053":"this book absolutely gutted me what an accomplishment i felt so connected to all of the characters no spoilers but the last half hit especially close to home this book made me cry and really stop and think about how every day is the best day of your life","1054":"very tough read about a brilliant scientist facing and suffering through early onset alzhiemers his wife is a great example for everyone do as she does or go in the opposite direction","1055":"had potential was really tedious","1056":"beautiful novel about the mundane moments that make up a life the theme of shifting and imagined identities was compelling who are we outside of the things we own the work we do who are we but a collection on memories and relationships","1057":" it took me a long time to get through this book i stayed with it and i was glad i did it felt like i meandering through character's lives which if intentional was effective because that is how life can be eileen leary an irish girl from a working class background who was able to get out of the neighborhood she became a nurse and married a brilliant underachieving science professor they have an adored son named connell the story spans the lifetime of eileen her husband ed who contracts early onset alzheimer's dementia and well into connell's life i did have a favorite line in the book attributed to eileen she comes in contact with a woman in starbucks who is weeping incessantly eileen's first reaction was to comfort the stranger but she waited with the uncertainty of not being sure how and if it was the right thing to do the woman left abruptly and eileen followed her for a long time and just when she caught up with her decided to leave and go home whatever it was the woman was going to have to work it out herself that was just the way life was sometimes you had to handle your own grief there wasn't any sense pretending otherwise i won't give away any more but this line sums up eileen as she navigates the demanding and thankless caregiving of her husband the story is woven with love love that builds character and makes us our very best and the love of life itself which calls us to be present to our lives","1058":" listening to the audio the narrator is flat but the story is riveting good book group book but might be long for some readers the most powerful book i've read in a long time this is the story of one family mostly one woman eileen and her husband ed and son connell eileen has a lower middle class upbringing and a strong desire for so much more headstrong and determined to rise above and have all the things she feels money will buy her she is unwilling or unable to clearly see the true cost of these things as she strives forward there were times when the story became a little predictable and it was obvious tragedy was on its way there were many parts of this story that were difficult to read and yet it was impossible for me to put aside it was in total a story of love a real story of how people navigate life and all its up and downs and learn primarily from mistakes it was heartening to see no murders child abuse or the like in order to put weight behind the writing i could not quite believe the power of the story and how much i grew to care about these characters at times i wanted to shake them but could understand how the facts of life what is actually going on or happening all around us are sometimes hidden in daily living striving forward with heads down and blinders on i would highly recommend this book to a book club there is much here to discuss and to think about and i know i will be continuing to do that myself for a long time one of those books i will be recommending to all my serious reading friends not an easy or casual read but well worth the time","1059":"this book was recommended on the today show and i was intrigued the story is epic in scope telling the story of irish american eileen leary from her childhood through late adulthood which spans the mid to late 20th century in ny city long book that doesn't read like one","1060":"this was a doozy of a novel 620 pages that begins with the start of a romantic relationship and ends with one what a beautiful testament to the trials and tribulations of a marriage and the needs and desires that one brings to the table the reader really gets sucked into this family's life and i truly felt as if i was part of this family therefore when illness strikes it hurts a beautifully well written book of lessons about wanting needing and compromising not only with a partner but with life","1061":" while beautifully written this book contains a vein of sadness running through it that left me aching it's scope is admirable and relatable the tale of eileen leary starts in her childhood in nyc in the 50s and follows her through marriage motherhood and a successful career i appreciated a lot about this book it was difficult to overlook the fact that i simply did not like eileen i don't think she's meant to be unlikable and perhaps you wouldn't find her so but her constant striving for the next thing the best house more money a nicer car it wore on me i couldn't muster sympathy for her when she was so clearly perpetually unsatisfied with all that she already had there was a lot i did appreciate the way eileen husband and her son couldn't seem to communicate on the same wavelength eileen's refusal to walk away from her marriage even when encouraged to the portrait of her son who was generationally analogous to me i don't want to give away too much about the plot so i'll just say that this book explores marriage with an honesty and depth rarely seen but in doing so sadness is both center stage and background music while i ended the book with some hope for the main characters i didn't like them enough to imagine their lives continuing beyond the bounds of the book if you are in the mood for a comprehensive look at one family's transition from recent immigrant to middle class and you don't mind a depth of sadness give this book a try otherwise you might consider something a touch more uplifting","1062":"i was bored the only character that i really liked was the husband ed","1063":"this book is so beautifully written and never flags despite the length and its coverage of an ordinary life what amazingly lifelike characters","1064":"epic story covering decades with one family simply beautiful storytelling u0026amp character development but i found myself skimming some parts too many minute details a few episodes that i wasn't invested in cried laughed i've never read a book this long in such a short time","1065":"this review has been hidden because it contains spoilers to view it click here while the last third of this book was emotionally challenging to read given the subject matter of alzheimer's disease and its cruel theft of ed's personality before eileen's very eyes i did appreciate the observation of normal lives lived over a fifty plus year period i enjoyed this book the way i remember enjoying the northern clemency or even franzen's earlier works","1066":"3 75 at 600 pages a little longer than necessary","1067":" 4 75eileen tumulty believes that marrying ed leary will take her away from her broken home and that his career as a scientist will place her in a new social strata ed is content to teach in a community college turning away from more lucrative opportunities eileen does everything she can to leave her old life behind often working behind ed's back this ultimately heartbreaking story found me wanting to read on 600 pages but oddly i never felt empathy for the characters particularly eileen thomas does a wonderful job telling their story and creating the atmosphere of the time the book spans from 1941 to the present day i was very impressed with this first novel","1068":" this one was difficult due to the content suburbia marriage alzeimer's and i found the prose itself boring and needlessly slow paced i did enjoy the very beginning first 100 pages depicting eileen's childhood growing up in 1950s new york to 1st generation irish immigrant parents while adult eileen is mostly realistic there is little to like about her while likability doesn't usually 't stop me from enjoying a work of fiction eileen simply got on my nerves she seemed more like a symbol of the dissatisfied american consumer than an actual individual human being her husband ed and son connell are more sympathetic characters and their father son relationship has more bits of truth and humanity probably one of the best aspects of this novel is that it deals with the evolution of the american dream and while these themes are important albeit obvious the story itself was difficult to invest in","1069":"this was good i kind of couldn't put it down but it never really lived up to what i was hoping for","1070":"this is a really great book the only reason i didn't give it 5 stars is that i know i will not read it again it was just too heavy such an intense subject matter but this author nailed it i don't want to give anything away so i won't elaborate i had no idea what it was about and that really enhanced the reading experience i think everyone should read this it will enhance your human experience and grow your compassion empathy and understanding whew i have to read some lighthearted fun books now though","1071":" well it was a bit of an effort to get through all 620 pages of this sllloooowwwwwww moving novel what kept me going all along was matthew thomas's downright beautiful prose whenever i got bored and thought about giving up i'd encounter something like this she was in the middle of the sort of reverie that invented the future by imagining it i stared at that sentence contemplated it for a while and decided to write it down so i wouldn't forget it here's another these little quality of life infractions added up to a diminishment of her happiness on the planet i agree with other reviewers in that the second half of the book was easier to get through than the first and packed more of an emotional wollop which kept you invested in the outcome i thought one of my issues with the story was how much i disliked the main character eileen but learned in the end that i wasn't supposed to like her she was a depiction of a certain reality and i think i am meant to learn from her but not necessarily like or relate to her i'll end my review by sharing one of the most powerful passages of the story as it gave some sense of closure to both eileen and the reader it's on page 574 so thomas essentially makes us earn this closure spoiler alert included as time passed she came to believe that she had been fated to be there for him at the end that being there for him was what everything in her life her care of her mother her career in nursing had prepared her for that it was in a sense her life's great work in this way she was able to sleep soundly again this was his final gift to her to silence her regrets about the paths she hadn't taken that my fellow readers is some damn fine writing","1072":"the subject matter of this book made it very difficult to get through at times but thomas' exquisite writing was sufficient compensation","1073":"tremendous heartbreaking everyone should read this book","1074":"i could not get into this book now matter how hard i tried i read more than half and didn't like it at all was very slow","1075":"great book spanning the life of one woman from childhood through marriage u0026amp adult years great character evolution engaging entertaining and moving all at the same time","1076":"fabulous book very deep portrayal of the main character eileen from her childhood years until her child himself is an adult thorough depiction of living in new york city and surrounding areas it is a very sad story but the story and the characters seem so real it is worth reading","1077":"incredibly well written novel that was sometimes difficult to read because of how honest the story was the characters are so real you really feel they exist sometimes they let you down other times they are inspiring much like people you are close to in real life would highly recommend","1078":"great character development but somewhat long winded eileen is never happy with what she has she is always thinking about what she thinks she should have material items status etc","1079":"i took me a while to get into this book but it got better as it went along i think it is probably a realistic look at what it's like for the family when someone is diagnosed with alzheimers at an early age","1080":"the writing wasn't bad but there was no emotional connection with any of the characters or worry about the plot i just didn't care it took me forever to work my way through it and i kept hoping it'd get better but it just fizzled out meh","1081":"i really need a 3 1 2 on this one i was engrossed and admired much of this book but it's strangely old fashioned and felt like something that should have been set mid 20th century the main character had not one iota of modernity and this worked against a moving story as her motivations emotions and actions all seemed misplaced in a contemporary novel","1082":"this book is many things but for me it was mostly a very moving character study of a person i didn't like very much eileen was so materialistic and concerned with appearances but matthew thomas's beautifully detailed writing made me understand why she was that way as her world collapsed i felt her sadness and horror a very honest book about america family dynamics and physical decline","1083":"this was hard going very well written but uber depressing not one single character could i relate to just glad to be done","1084":"at times when i was reading this it felt like i was living the life of the characters in this novel in real time with them it was so slow moving for me at least for the first two hundred pages or so then i took a break and read a terrible debut novel the good girl came back and so appreciated the pace the writing the characters just everything about the story i loved it i'm giving it four stars because of the slow going pace of the first third of the book ~~oh my gosh i loved this book so much i loved the characters of ed and eileen leary i was especially drawn to the wonderful brave strong female main character of eileen side note what a wonderful film role this would make for someone i can't say too much about her without giving away a major plot point but suffice to say she is an amazing character fully formed and deeply drawn kudos to for creating such an interesting woman i feel like i really knew her and understood her motives and her feelings oh my heart i can't stop thinking about this book that letter at the end i have copied it out and will read it again and again it is that amazing it is truly one of the best books i've read in awhile although it took awhile to draw me in it was worth the time and the effort","1085":"i shouldn't really give this any stars because i gave up on it i can review the first two hundred pages though they were filled with nicely written characters that were neither likable nor unlikable and they went nowhere this book has been hyped as a modern classic maybe that's true i'll never know because there's just no way i can bring myself to slog through to the end i'm 42 my life is too short for a dull story no matter how well written","1086":" i stopped and started reading this book ultimately i wanted to know how things ended it's a long book 600 pages and it probably could be shorter it's about a woman's life from when she was a child through her adulthood she marries a man who she hopes will have the potential for earning a large salary which will put her into the town and the home she's always wanted her parents were not wealthy he's a teacher and he keeps turning down raises and promotions because he loves teaching this doesn't please her but eventually they are able to move into the city she desires and they buy a nice home they have one son the husband develops alzheimer's disease and of course her whole life changes it's an interesting story especially when she's dealing with alzheimer's i can't say i loved it but it did resonate with me in a lot of ways just be prepared for a long read","1087":"this novel moved me deeply inspired me bored me impressed me made me cry and always stunned me with the immediacy of its prose and the honesty sharpness of its characters and their collective story i just finished and i can't quite put my finger on what the investment in time has meant it's a long book but i do know that i'm in awe of matthew thomas's skill as a writer and the spell he wove with the threads of the mundanity and fierceness of life i think this one is going to haunt me for a long while","1088":"i understood why some didn't like the book it's not a happy book there are no heroes and villains those are precisely the reasons i enjoyed it for me this was a thoroughly engaging thought provoking book with well drawn albeit flawed characters not an easy book to review but i guess i would say it's for mature readers who enjoy getting involved with real characters and appreciate wonderful writing i loved it and found it hard to put down","1089":" a painful but ultimately fulfilling read eileen is a frustrating protagonist likely because she is drawn so well she behaves as people do too often with petty motivations that serve either her moment or her grand scheme and this reader as often squirmed with discomfort as her grand plan seemed unreachable in its scope and both eileen and those she loves stand to be seriously damaged by some of her choices well the reality is that as the stones taught us you can't always get what you want but you get what you need and ain't it grand that that achievement will bring us remarkably close to what we'd envisioned if yes we simply tilt our heads and squint up our eyes just a tad i have a feeling that this is one of those books that would like ethan frome for instance hit the reader on different but equally compelling levels if read at different ages kinda makes me wish i could drag it back a few decades and crack it open at oh 23 and then again at 47 maybe we should form up a 23 47 60 book club and have a discussion","1090":" there were times in the early stages of reading this book that i was certain it would only get 3 stars from me it wasn't badly written but not beautifully written it felt at times as though chunks of the story were missing or skipped over and story characters were a little confusing in their thoughts and actions not the kind of writing i wanted to devote 600 pages to but it was for a book club assignment so i needed to persevere but then eileen her husband ed and their son connell are dealt a blow from life and their efforts to cope with this thing are so achingly rendered by this author that my heart broke into pieces they are good people hard working people trying to live the american dream but life happens and the dream has to take a backseat to reality or as one character states their former future life the ghost of the life they almost had this book was a difficult read because of the subject matter which i won't state here because it's a spoiler but it is something that can happen to any of us and which thousands of people are dealing with right now that also makes it scary and illuminating and all the more heart breaking but as ed writes to his son connell in a letter it is worth something to be a good man it cannot be worth nothing to do the right thing yes to all of us men and women who try to do the right thing even when it's hard even when we're tired even when it's impossible this book celebrates that effort recommended only to readers able to take a blow to the guts but worth the time and effort in my case","1091":"i read an advance on this book and bought it because of the hype took me a long time to get to it but i thoroughly enjoyed it i didn't realize how long it was when i bought it honestly would have likely not bought it because of that glad i did though was great for a long international trip","1092":"very very well written excellent plot i thought i was not going to like it so i was pleasantly surprised by this piece it is well worth the time if you love literary fiction please check this work out it is beautiful and thought provoking","1093":"620 pages was way to looooooooong the author described everything and i do mean every thing the only part of this book i thought interesting was the part about alzheimers i guess that why i didn't toss the book the rest of it i kept reading hoping something would happen it never did i skimmed lots of pages and still i felt like i was walking in knee deep mud it is a slow moving life story that you feel like is taking a lifetime to read","1094":"there is so much life between these covers beautiful simple triumphant","1095":"give the book and story a chance to develop the start is very very slow but still beautifully written","1096":"we are not ourselves is the story of a family they are not happy people or likeable people but they are ordinary people they live a very sad life the novel is well written a bit too long but it is full of emotion the characters are well developed","1097":"for me this is the kind of book that seems to illuminate what it means to be human the drama is pulled from ordinary life but is drawn with such intimacy that it's almost emotionally draining to read so real that it hurts a little masterfully written","1098":"i just finished this book we are not ourselves was such a delight i am not sure how i can continue on without these characters it was so good good good this story is primarily about eileen eileen is being raised by alcoholic immigrants in queens new york her childhood is tough as she is primarily a caretaker to her mother when she meets ed a scientist she falls in love gets married and has a child she wants more out of life and he seems content to teach for lower pay then he would get if he were more motivated as a hard working nurse eileen wants a big house a nice car and a better neighborhood they start off in an apt in jackson heights as time passes they are finally able to afford the home of eileen's dreams that is where everything starts to fall apart for the family i am really sorry i can't give more of a synopsis to tell you more would be to give away the story this book will probably not be received by you the same way as me anyways this story was more an epic about a family but it really could be about anyone the things we are willing to settle for to keep it together the way a career can take over the face you put on when you are losing the things you love most the legacy that we hope to leave behind when we are gone this is a debut novel but it feels like it was written by an old hand at no point did the pacing feel off for me it was written without feeling hurried along it is entirely in third person but the subjects fluctuate a bit i got a few different perspectives i am not gonna lie or sugar coat this this was a long story 620 pages and this book spans almost whole lifetime it is brutally honest this book was not sparing in the important details that made me feel as if i was right there i got to see smell feel and taste what the characters do these are not perfect people and their thoughts betray their motivations we are not ourselves had so many good feels i grew very attached to each person without even realizing it so seeing them struggle i cried a lot a lot like i am still weepy now and i have headache from crying so hard this book broke my heart and then it gave me hope again this was an excellent work of fiction if you enjoy a good story about real life and family you should definitely check this out","1099":"impressive for a book without a plot it really hooked me i found myself reading until the wee hours tough to put down without finishing","1100":"let's see if i say it was depressingly good will you still read it read this 500 page book over 3 nights it is heartbreaking and hope sustaining my takeaway was how we allow the little annoyances to build up to a toxic level in our relationships to the point of ruining them but also how we can surprise ourselves and maybe our loved ones when wemanage to step up to the plate for the big events","1101":"the author apparently spent ten years on this work which is too bad the characters especially the husband ed are barely likable he is selfish from the start and exhibits enough quirks that the alzheimer's which ultimately afflicts him is no surprise a side note this novel details the disease in graphic detail i'd suggest avoiding it if a loved one has suffered through it as for eileen i think that's her name she is relatively forgettable and not a full character more of an outline of one without any real heart or soul to her an interesting premise about how the experiences reflect america and are a testimony to resilience really doesn't pan out it just peters to an end and i for one was grateful to reach that page my daughter asked me why i kept reading and i mumbled something about how you can't ignore a car wreck i did like the somewhat episodic aspect of the novel though the section titles made only partial sense","1102":"i fell in love with this story in the beginning i actually said that in my head i'm going to love this book and already love the characters and then slowly slowly felt out of love i wish i could explain what exactly didn't work for me but i really don't know we just didn't click and will have to get through this breakup one day at a time","1103":" 2 5 i don't mind a book being long 620 pages in this case if it doesn't feel long this book felt long i don't mind a character being unlikable if it's fun not to like them eileen tumulty leary was not fun to not like she was selfish greedy unempathetic unsympathetic racist stuck up and generally horrible i found her character to be very needy whether it involved attention living up to her standards of pride or materialistic needs she was also selfish about putting her wants ahead of her family's goals playing mind games and making horrible financial decisions while her circumstances especially later in the novel were difficult and some of her behavior could've been understood at that point her actions and behavior had been so awful and unfeeling all along that i found it impossible to cut her any slack or even believe she was sincere when expressing concern or sadness each time i felt the book was redeeming itself and taking a turn toward better i realized that it was because it was a scene focused more on her husband edmund or son connell and their relationship two of the most touching scenes in the entire book involve a letter from father to son after which eileen gives connell a hard time in a completely contradictory manner and the epilogue which is only from connell's perspective that epilogue by the way is kind of terrifying and heart stopping connell and edmund aren't portrayed as saints either but as the book title implies their reasons for not being themselves seem more understandable connell was faced with a lot given his age edmund was faced with a lot as well not to say eileen didn't also face an awful situation but her character seemed to have been determined far before then i think a minimum of 100 pages could've been cut with subplots that didn't go anywhere or were just repetitive showing once again how eileen put herself first or didn't mind humiliating her husband in the course of writing this review i've downgraded my rating 3 times i can't remember the last time that happened i just wanted the book to be over because i couldn't stand being around the character of eileen anymore goodbye horrible woman note i came back a few hours later and downgraded it again some of the scenes with edmund were written really well and gave me a lot to think about but that woman","1104":"ugh this book just dragged on and on someone recommended it so i kept thinking it would get better not the case at all","1105":"this felt about 400 pages too long to me it never grabbed me and i gave up trying to get into it did not finish","1106":"i can't believe i read the whole thing","1107":"this books felt similar to all the light we cannot see in that it had a somewhat dark theme to it it was a simple story of a woman's life of disappointment of goals not reached but it was a great read nothing earth shattering happens but the read is satisfying","1108":"this book was vivid and poignant though i didn't find the characters terribly likeable they were pitiable and so i found myself invested in their story while not particularly hoping for good things for them","1109":" a well written painfully honest story of the american dream desperately sought and the realities that kept it always slightly out of reach written in a rather curt hemingway type style that could use a few more transitions the book is a bit too long to retain casual readers but is hauntingly memorable as eileen prods and struggles to live the dream she has always envisioned but then must compromise as a result of life's unfair hits the ending is especially beautiful and her devotion to her husband is touching worth reading but only for those willing to hang on through 620 pages of life in its hardships and painful vulnerabilities","1110":"although it took a bit to get into this turned out to be a wonderful book it follows a family throughout their ups and downs in life there were so many lovely moments and so many terrible ones it was an honest portrait of a not so perfect family i would definitely recommend this book","1111":"matthew thomas's book is a heartbreaking and powerful read that strengthens the reader by providing memorable characters who cope with the pain of losing a loved one to dementia eileen her husband and son are each vividly drawn grittily real and their love for each other beautiful to see even as it is not romanticized matt keep writing your use of language is a gift to your readers","1112":"so depressing nicely written but i think that's the only reason i finished it","1113":" in matthew thomas' debut novel we are not ourselves the central character eileen tumulty born in 1941 is first introduced as the nine year old daughter of irish immigrants growing up in queens ny her father \"big mike\" is a hard drinking well liked larger than life figure in their community her mother always felt inferior and was hospitalized for a breakdown after suffering a miscarriage she is never the same when she returns home she drinks too much smokes to much and poor little eileen is more like the grownup as a result she learns early on that it's important to have goals in life and strive to achieve them she chooses the nursing profession and a very bright man ed leary for herself they marry buy a multi family home in jackson heights and have a son that they name connell although ed is a good man and a college professor he remains content teaching at a local community college instead of pursuing a more prestigious job at another college or university he doesn't have the drive that eileen was hoping for she is disappointed in her husband but yet she is also committed to him and their life together she focuses her energy one searching for another house bigger in bronxville a much better area ed does not share her enthusiasm about moving and does not want to move but eileen gets her way the next home is a bigger albeit run down house in her dream neighborhood it isn't long before eileen's brief house high takes a back seat to a life changing event that begins explains her husband's secretiveness and his odd behavior of late i really enjoyed this 600 novel described as a sprawling saga it's the story of a marriage and family eileen ed and connell a family affected by heartbreak it's about how their life is torn apart and how they move on it's a story about life about longing for more than we have but accepting the hand you were dealt it's a beautiful story although there were many instances where i did not care for eileen the central character i did respect her and feel for her situation especially in the last half of the novel son connell's story and his struggle to please his parents was also good although a little less compelling the writing is really good and although a long novel i never lost interest i alternated between the print version and the audio version which was fantastic read by mare winningham this was a terrific novel worth the time spent and a story i will not forget read it 4 5 5 stars","1114":"i need time to get my brain around this book will report in a bit a lot of sad work at a hard time in my life will need to marinate in it to discern my long lasting affection or detachment","1115":"i had a hard time choosing a rating for this one parts were predictable others fascinating some so slow and others i couldn't stop reading overall a good book but an average rating","1116":" i approached this book with some hesitation as the reviews spoke of an instant classic which is high praise to live by i found my apprehension to be misplaced as this book more than lives up to the billing it brought to mind my feelings from when i read years ago of human bondage in its ability to describe the human experience throughout its triumphs and defeats the book is a bit daunting in length but well worth the effort spanning about 60 years of america's post wwii experience it paints through three generations of an irish immigrant family the evolution of the american dream and its current state at times heartbreaking it never takes advantage of the situation by placing an easy tragic development but has the sense of doing the work to bring the scene to a logical conclusion this in the end ends up being an even stronger statement i loved this book and it has gained a place in my list of books you should read before you die","1117":"an absolutely massive accomplishment i felt like i was aging with the characters in real time very compassionate very complicated just a huge book in every sense of the word the missing star is there----this is very immature and selfish----but the book made me quite sad sad in a way that is still lingering once it passes i'll get back up there and add the 5th star to this book","1118":" the books title is a quote from king lear \"we are not ourselves when nature being oppressed commands the mind to suffer with the body \"it seems people either loved or hated this book and i have mixed feelings the book is over 600 pages and parts seem tedious on the other hand it's a very moving story a sweeping saga of an ordinary family and the decline of the father from early onset alzheimer's and many of the events that occur earlier in the book may seem like unnecessary details but in the second half of the story those events become meaningful the story is very personal for the author like ed the father in the book the author's father was also a professor who suffered early onset dementia","1119":"hm not my type of book but it was very well written","1120":"i didn't really anticipate what this book was about from the blurb which for a while made it quite a hard read when it became obvious what the second half of the book was going to be like but it was well written and i am glad i finished it","1121":"one of my new favorite books thanks for the recommendation susan i thoroughly enjoyed it and even though it was over 600 pages on my ipad i hated to see it end","1122":" we are not ourselves by matthew thomasan exquisite multi generational novel set in queens ny spanning post wwii to the present the family is irish but it could be any family with desires expectations and a growing sense of what is important the novel touches a subject close to my heart that i was unaware of until midway through the book so that's best left as a surprise the main character eileen tumulty is a strong woman a nurse who has a bit of an edge she always stays true to herself and also grows in compassion i went from being irritated by her to really loving and admiring her go to the authors web page after you read the book very revealing but don't peak before","1123":"i enjoyed the characters but the story was too long i felt it could have been cut in half","1124":"i really loved this book a long story about a family coping with social changes and their own changes as time passes very moving and honest i really related to the characters as they struggled with the challenges dealt them by life i miss the family since completing the book and find myself wondering how they are doing","1125":"a heartbreaking and hopeful look at living through the eyes and mind of eileen the story follows her from age 10 into her 60s and is almost entirely centered around her life a child of irish immigrants she learns early the value of hard work and the devastation of alcoholism as she grows up she finds success in school and her work and eventually marries ed and has a son connell since the story is the events of their lives i don't want to give anything else away the best part for me was the consistency of the characters they are so real flaws and all that you became very invested in them and care about what happens to them i broke down and sobbed several times while reading this book the author spent ten years working on this book and you can tell from the quality of writing and story that it was a labour of love in a lot of ways a great read","1126":"4 5 we are not ourselves deals with several themes and tells of three generation of an irish american family living in queens the book is mainly character driven and deals with both alcoholism and alzheimer's and how these diseases have long lasting effects on families the characters were at times admirable and likable and at other times you wondered how they could behave so insensitively and perhaps stupidly i will remember this work as an engrossing and overall wonderful u0026amp worthwhile 'read' even though at times found it both depressing and distressing i'm putting this book on my to be read again list primarily as it's the best description of the progression of alzeimer's i've encountered and all the while telling an on going thoroughly engrossing story recommend","1127":"this book has been called epic and it is an epic waste of time characters i don't feel i know at all after 620 pages story lines that go nowhere and actions that make me say what i couldn't care less what happened to these people the reviewers who raved about this book must have been on acid","1128":"this review has been hidden because it contains spoilers to view it click here i'm kind of meh about this book partly mainly because it turned into a story about alzheimer's which i didn't expect and didn't appreciate having two grandmother's have it means i don't need to relive it in print i found it depressing","1129":" 4 5 5 stars reading this novel didn't feel like simply reading it felt like an experience and completely embodied some of the essential reasons why we read to be drawn into the lives of others and share in their triumphs or be moved by their tragedies or frustrated by their flaws which are only too human and recognizable i've seen the novel described as a multi generational saga and it is to some extent but the driving force for nearly the entire 600 pages is the main character eileen she is crafted with complete depth and complexity and the reader never tires of her own inexhaustible desire for betterment a contemporary take on the american dream as she strives to leave a changing queens for the leafy suburbs of westchester ensuring security and stability for her family and a better future for her son even while making some questionable moral choices the devastating and unexpected event no spoilers that happens to her husband and the overwhelming challenges it poses to her must have been thoroughly researched as it feels like you are witnessing it happen to a real family some passages were so moving that i had to read them twice one aloud to my partner my only qualm was that some chapters which explored her son especially toward the end of the novel seemed a little superfluous details about a summer job that mom perceived beneath him meeting a potential girlfriend on a critical flight back home although he was certainly an essential character","1130":"this was beautiful it provoked a new thinking for me letting go of those dreams you think are real and true for you and embracing the reality of your already perfectly imperfect life sometimes what you strive for only exists because you have been chasing an idea for so long that it became a part of you the characters are so real and vivid that you can't even dislike them when they make mistakes or have unpopular thoughts i haven't cried real tears over a book before now this was a jewel","1131":"this review has been hidden because it contains spoilers to view it click here really mixed feelings did not like the protagonist eileen throughput the entire book just too striving and strange wanting to talk to the coffee shop crying lady going after her three times and then skipping it buying a house that had water damage needed a roof and drainage she just irked me the alzheimers story was sad and she was heroic there too long too slow but the last third was better","1132":"http cdnbookworm blogspot ca 2015 0","1133":"heartbreakingly beautiful","1134":" i hate that it took me months to finish this book the cd version is 18 discs and i had to return it to the library after nine then i got the book out of the library i was number 56 on the reserve list and it took forever then i realized i had 100 pages left and it was due the next day at the library and i just sat and read until i finished i loved this book but it is long and i didn't pick a good time to read it it was a great slice of life in a family living in the city around the time of most of my cousins could relate and loved the crazy family dynamics read it and enjoy it","1135":"this is not a fast paced thrill a minute sort of book what it is a look at the wispy threads that connect family members and as a result generations forward it's a thoughtful study of the subtle desires and failings that shape our lives i enjoyed it","1136":" about three months ago i read in many sites and social network updates about this novel i was really intrigued about the title that it just isn't a title it is a statement that it is reminded along the entire story perhaps reading the story of a conventional irish family leaving in new york in the mid fifties could be boring and sometimes frustrating but that is the whole point you should with a lot of patience and tenaciousness let matthew thomas drag you to this incredible journey called family that is why i considered this is the most emotional and captivating story i've ever read we are not ourselves is a reminder of who we are as humans the things we hide from our soul mates our ambitions and our true nature the real feelings that we can leverage and share with others and the darkest emotions that can make us feel unworthy of love","1137":"well this time i didn't suffer through a whole book about an emotionally stunted middle aged woman of irish descent i put it down at page 57 while the book was technically well constructed it seemed to have rather a flat affect something that seems to be a trend in modern day saga books i do appreciate that this book has and will resonate with many it just simply wasn't for me","1138":"sprawling uncomfortable book about pasts families and forgetting kept repeating its title over and over as characters came undone and put their pieces back together","1139":"i thought it was depressing i could not get thru it i only read half of it i found the main character to be snobbish i would not recommend this book to anyone","1140":"a tragically beautiful life","1141":"this is a story of a young woman who grows up and lives her life in ways it's too realistic because her life is kind of a struggle yet nothing too dramatic happens to her until it does i ended up fearing that she had led a too constricted life which triggers a fear of my own that i'm leading a too constricted life yet a very well told tale","1142":"at page 300 i was thinking this was good but noting really special suddenly the books comes alive when ed the father and husband starts to show signs of early alzheimer's from that point on the story just takes off it's sad and painful but just beautiful fans of wally lamb and jonathan franzen should love this one can't believe this is a first novel","1143":" my favorite book of 2014 it didn't grab me right away but it builds with a quiet intensity a beautiful and touching story of what it means to be a family there is nothing sentimental or sappy about it all the characters are shown with all their flaws intact it almost sounds boring if you try to describe what happens because nothing much does just read it one of the few books i've read recently that still lingers in my thoughts it's even more poignant when you do a little research on the author and discover that it was based on events in his own life loved it","1144":"has to be the best book i read this year and i read a lot of great ones ten stars","1145":" wish there was a way to give books 5 stars this book was long not just because it was a large print over 800 pages it seemed hard for me to maintain enthusiastic interest because the story seemed slow to me even though eileen and ed's life was a love story of sorts i almost didn't see or feel this until much later in the book was it worth the wait yes i suppose it was as throughout so much of the book i saw eileen as somewhat selfish without much of a softer side even at the beginning of her husband ed's illness she seemed so but at last you see something more in eileen after his death as she takes stock in her life and choices she made in the end i would give this book 3 5 stars","1146":"long and depressing","1147":"bittersweeta touching story that exemplifies how responses to life's events both good and bad shape the future a sad but hopeful novel","1148":"mixed emotions about this book the most emotionally wrenching entry was the letter written to connell from his father almost 600 pages into the book and the potential revelation at the end of the novel i found the story a little disorganized for as long as it was and i think an interesting angle would have been from the perspective of ed not just eileen and connell","1149":"i finished this book a few days ago and i can't stop thinking about it the more i think about it the more i understand it on a deeper level hard to believe it is a first novel thomas is a master storyteller though i didn't always like eileen the main character or her choices i was invested in her life story i found the characters active and complex yes it is a long book and at times i felt like i couldn't take anymore sadness but then i thought that if eileen could stick it out then i could too it was well worth it the ending was beautiful and devastating at the same time i will be thinking about this book for a long time","1150":" it is very very hard for me to review this book it is tied for first with harry potter in place of my all time favorite book which is very rare harry potter has been my unquestioned unrivaled favorite since grade school they are of course two entirely different stories however i believe that is probably why i've made room for this book alongside rowling's hp i needed something was waiting for something like this book to take the place where rowling writes adventure and builds places so real you are struck with nostalgia every time you hear of them even though you've never been thomas writes the simple sequence of life the story follows eileen the somewhat materialistic and very very human protagonist the characters that surround her are what drive the story i as a teenager was in shock of how amazingly rendered connel was i began the story hating him at moments then liking him but never once did i not understand him it annoyed me at first how real the characters were i could see bits of myself in their flaws in their strengths and that unbridled recognition as a third party was hard to accept there's a moment in the book were connel wavers between selfish hatred and a scared love of his dad that is so human such a teenage thing to do just because that line between adulthood and innocence is confusing enough as it is thomas pinpointing that despite being 30 something provides example enough of his skills in character rendering this and many other moments made me feel so connected to the characters it was more than love it was understanding i think truly understanding them despite their flaws was what made me love them in the end after wavering between 'ugh' and a contented like throughout the novel even the minor characters are brilliant you don't understand them as fully as eileen and her family but that's because you aren't reading their life due to the lack of exposure you end up loving them easily which is what contributes and leads to the later disruption of my favorite haunting and simplistic scene following eileen and her family's life was satisfying in itself but it is not what made the book the genius and incredible work of literature that it is near the end there's a moment so simplistic and haunting that i broke down in tears and couldn't finish the book for half an hour because i was so shell shocked by this unprecedented work of art moment the event basically brings everything together and is absolutely genius watching her life go by only to be presented with such a simplistic happenstance that somehow removes you further as a third party and yet you still feel so connected is incredible five stars amazing book","1151":" it was a long time since i had to cry so hard over a book beautiful family portrait of conflicting needs and loves and all the lacking communication misunderstanding and at the same time the need and wish to connect towards the ending i was sitting on a terrace my tears poored out i simply had to put it away for a bit but couldn't resist finishing it soon after i don't like comparing writers but i so much enjoyed this beautiful and very emotional novel that i have to admit it's comparable in a way to jonathan franzen i hope rhis helps in getting this book over to many many readers beautiful and very touching portrait of a family and finding means to reach each other","1152":"thanks to the beauty of reading on the kindle i can say with accuracy that i skim read the last 16% of this book it was waaaaaaayyyyyyyy too long the word saga doesn't cover it the author was spot on with the alzheimer's depictions but there was toooo much before and after that story it was as if the alzheimer's story came first and then all this padding was pasted on on either side of it as a whole it felt very unbalanced","1153":" when i picked up matthew thomas's we are not ourselves i already knew what i was getting into my cousin had already read the majority of it and warned me about the triggers it contained keeping that in mind this review will entail a rather large spoiler that may help you decide whether or not you want to read this book to be perfectly honest approximately the first half of the book isn't terribly plot driven it is however beautiful the strength and honesty within the sentences themselves is what kept me turning pages what plot there is follows the adolescence and young adulthood of eileen tumulty a girl born to irish immigrants in new york city her life is not easy--her parents' marriage is deteriorating although they do not separate her mother falls prey to alcoholism due to that and various other circumstances eileen has to grow up very quickly and take on responsibilities not meant for young girls this drives her to do well in school so that she can support herself and move up in the world later the reader realizes that her urge to live a better lifestyle and her lack of contentment with her current situations is a theme carried by eileen into her marriage with edmund leary their married life is normal they have a baby named connell both eileen and ed are working hard and saving money they are a typical american family all seems well until the beautiful sentences begin to give way to realistic hints as a typical american family they are prey to the same things that affect typical people and this is where the true beauty of the book shines through after several difficult years ed is diagnosed with early onset alzheimer's disease but how can that be beautiful i asked myself the same thing even as i kept turning pages unable to stop reading why am i doing this to myself i thought as i wept discreetly during uni orientation after living a particularly emotional moment with eileen ed and connell and that is where the secret of ourselves lies--the reader lives each moment with this family enjoys the victories and endures the sadness i became a part of the leary family and their losses were my own if you want to feel something real something deep then this is a book you should read and in reading you will experience something beyond yourself--a connection to humanity in all its wonderful frailty for more on ourselves and other book reviews please visit an american in london","1154":"very well written but i sometimes felt that it dragged and that occasionally its attempts at a poetic description of a deeper meaning fell short it dragged in some places as well good read very emotional family dynamics realistic i felt","1155":"the beginning and end were very good but overall it was too long and tedious especially through the middle for me","1156":"a big american story keeping in mind the title we are not ourselves as an adult there were two times eileen felt at peace or at home both were with families who embraced their cultures and their histories she saw their success but couldn't keep from running from her own history or was she afraid of her own story","1157":"i was nearly put off by some reviews of this book that stated it was long and boring but i loved it really loved it it covers a very difficult subject but it was written beautifully definitely worth reading though some might find the subject difficult i think probably the best novel i've read in a long time","1158":"i took a day off work to finish this book i didn't want to hurry through to find out what happens i wanted to linger on every word and paragraph it is so truthful in its characters' emotions so raw and so accurate about caring for those you love and how the afflicted feel and try to carry on my heart was so full when i finished full of love and sadness the book also does an amazing job exposing how the health insurance system deals with those with long term diseases very few books are a prism with so many beautiful sides to absorb this review doesn't do the book justice let these characters show you humanity in all it's flawed forms","1159":"did not care for the main character eileen at all and i felt like the story was about 200 pages too long","1160":"this is the 2nd book in a row that turned out to be a completely different book than i thought it was going to be thankfully this was a better surprise than the last one","1161":"i think i want to give this 3 5 stars in some ways it was really good it was a great exploration of human experience over time within relationships and i loved the complexity and vibrancy of the characters flaws included but it was too long the novel could benefit from slimming and tightening do i really want to read the baseball statistics the narrator rehearses to himself as a mental exercise to ward off alzheimer's no i do not please stop mr thomas but also good job","1162":"parts of we are not ourselves were great insightful and well written and the book could stimulate interesting conversations however several portions of the story dragged and i had to force myself to keep reading its more than 600 pages","1163":"this is a beautifully written book albeit a difficult one to read if like me you have personal experience with the disease no spoiler around which the novel is centered it is clear that thomas' own experience as a bystander to the disease has had an enormous impact on him and it is likewise clear he did a great deal of soul searching to produce this work this is a brave novel honest and heartbreaking yet heartwarming","1164":"this review has been hidden because it contains spoilers to view it click here this book was a surprise for me every once in awhile i pick up a book at random a book that i don't feel particularly excited about but for whatever reason i start in on it it's popular a lot of people are reading it etc and then am pleasantly surprised by it that happened with we are not ourselves i was initially attracted to the concept that the back cover blurb let on would be a central theme the desire for a life above one's own station the longing for material and social fortune i t this book was a surprise for me every once in awhile i pick up a book at random a book that i don't feel particularly excited about but for whatever reason i start in on it it's popular a lot of people are reading it etc and then am pleasantly surprised by it that happened with we are not ourselves i was initially attracted to the concept that the back cover blurb let on would be a central theme the desire for a life above one's own station the longing for material and social fortune i think everybody can relate to that who of us hasn't at one point or another wished for that fancy car envied the lives of those traveling in private jets and wearing couture and being that i have been witness to all kinds of fortunes have seen friends marry for money and friends marry for love and seen unhappiness and happiness in both it's a topic i find myself grappling with and often pondering the meaning behind why we choose the things we do being a young unmarried woman i've always known that seeking out a man based solely on material worldly success is an option but yet i've never been the kind of person who could choose a partner based on anything other than genuine attraction and chemistry but i've seen friends who have and it's always lead me to ponder their reasoning behind it i grew up amazingly blessed with parents who were madly in love who can't go to bed without each other and who still kiss in doorways u0026amp hold hands on walks i wanted for nothing and was spoiled rotten with a father who loved to shower me with gifts and who always came to my rescue when i did stupid things like let parking tickets go unpaid for months on end or take out credit cards when i still didn't understand anything about what credit even was and so that being the case i often compare my method of choosing a mate with other less fortunate friends of mine one girlfriend was emancipated from her parents at 16 and has supported herself since another was raised by a single mom who left her their family home to and her brother at age 14 so that she could move up to la with her new restauranteur boyfriend every once in awhile remembering to leave them $40 or so that was to last them weeks on end these friends of mine would beg to sleep over at my home suck up to my parents and eat ravenously when my mom served dinner it wasn't until later in life that i began to see the affects that our completely different upbringings would have on our lives on the way we saw the world and in the things we sought out when it came time to search for a partner for a mate i looked for the man who made me feel the way i knew my parents felt about each other a man who treated me like a queen the way my dad treats my mother somebody basically exactly like my father honest and kind forgiving and affectionate but then i look around and see that some of my girlfriends have a different approach they search out wealth and success stability and security and the truth is that knowing what i know about their upbringings their childhoods that lacked all the things they now sought after in a man i find it impossible to judge i can't say that i wouldn't be doing the very same thing if i had spent my entire childhood feeling insecure unsafe hungry and alone it's a topic that's been of interest to me lately as i watch my friends get married left and right to the men of their choosing and their choosing for entirely different reasons than one another and myself so that when i heard what this book was about it appealed to me for the reason that it is relatable in my own life and in the life of those around me and that's basically what the first half of this book is about although almost half way thru it delves off and becomes a book about an illness and the gradual decline of a body and mind but for the first half we watch the main character eileen as a child and as a young woman a victim of her circumstances who spends her childhood dreaming of a time when she will better these circumstances i was fascinated by her story how she suffered such unspeakable sadnesses and so many responsibilities beyond her young age and the way in which this shaped the future desires of her heart and formed the criteria by which she would judge all future potential mates her lack of structure and stability that caused her to spend her days watching the wealthy the people who lived in beautiful houses with manicured lawns on the outside looking in and imagining that things must've been perfect for these people because they had all the things she didn't eileen's childhood was spent lacking and so in turn she resolved to do whatever it took to higher her position and thus all her decisions onward were made in order to get her one step closer to her goal of material success including her search for a husband i loved reading about this because even tho it was fiction it helped me to further understand the way that our experiences and childhoods mold who we are as adults that was the first half the second half took me by surprise as i had no clue this was a book about alzheimer's the back cover blurb certainly never lets that on but being that i have read a couple books on the subject i caught on pretty quickly when the first hints were dropped and had been expecting it when the actual blow was dealt then it becomes a very touching painful story about the gradual decline of a beautiful mind and healthy body it was slow and agonizing but so moving and for a book that was almost 700 pages and not particularly plot driven or action packed it was a solid read completely readable and engaging throughout without any bouts of slowness it's a revealing character study and peek into the world of not only the people who actually have alzheimers but all the other people in their lives that the illness affects as well i'm giving this book 4 stars for several reasons first the subject matter fascinated me simply because i related to it secondly it was just well written it was smooth and enjoyable the story just flowed to be honest none of the characters were particularly likable throughout most of the book but they were real and solid and thomas's skillful writing kept me reading at a pretty good pace and i was able to see the character development through to the end i watched characters who annoyed me initially grow and change and become characters that i could like more what i liked most tho was the ending the way the story played out and eileen's final thought on not only the disease but the way the disease had changed her how her loss of the man she loved to alzheimers granted her the most beautiful gift the realization that she had loved her husband wholly and that love was worth all the things she had sacrificed and given up she may have otherwise spent her lifetime feeling regret over all the missed opportunities to climb the social power success ladder been always envious of the people who had more nicer homes and nicer cars but in her husband's death she was granted absolution she could stop beating herself up over missed chances or regret and instead she was able to free herself from regret and appreciate the life she'd been given it was very sweet and a perfect way to tie up the little story of their little lives more","1165":" lately i can't seem to get into family sagas there was a time when i loved reading tomes about the dreams hopes and angst that families go through i just finished some luck by jane smiley the first book in her new trilogy and i did not like it that much books i once loved such as stegner's angle of respose robbins' a stone for danny fisher or rand's atlas shrugged don't appeal to me right now perhaps it's a phase but we are not ourselves falls into the family saga genre and it did not interest me very much i loved possession by byatt and yes it is a family saga and a thousand acres by smiley i could read those over and over again but they are the exception eileen tumulty is the protagonist of matthew thomas's novel which i heard sparked a bidding war between publishing houses i found the novel uninteresting eileen's childhood is covered in a few very short chapters and her adolescence is barely touched upon she goes from child to married woman in a about 75 pages of this 610 page book one could argue that the gist of the book is eileen as an adult but i feel like her family issues are very important and her early character could have been much more well developed eileen has aspirations to be more than she is as a child her irish immigrant background doesn't appeal to her she wants a waspish last name a big house and material possessions she thinks she has found this in her scientist husband ed despite the fact that his last name is irish however he appears to be more of an introvert and less interested in the things that eileen desires than she had hoped naturally they have challenges to overcome especially one extraordinary one i never really cared about eileen i didn't understand how she could manage to go to nyu graduate school for nursing yet feel like her only option in life was to become a nurse the time was the early 60's and other avenues were open to her even with her coming from woodside queens the book often takes the easy way out by stating something as a fact when it is the author's opinion an example is that eileen could either become a nurse or a secretary that's it additionally things occurred in the novel without much explanation or context eileen's father for instance is the charismatic leader of his peers yet his own actions are not congruent with the advice he gives to others a debut novel of this scope is quite an undertaking and i found some of the sentences rich and evocative as a whole however i couldn't relate to the book emotionally","1166":"this book had good writing i guess but to me there was too much of it i got impatient and wanted to get on with the story altho the story is more about the journey than getting to the end i just didn't care about the characters that much and got annoyed with the mother","1167":"although this was a great story with excellent writing i found it could have been edited some more as there was just so much in the book that didn't need to be","1168":"slow moving and melancholy i did not feel invested in the characters until the final half and still found most unlikeable however the ending held a solid if depressing truth full review http theinsomniacbibliophile blogsp","1169":"3and 1 2 starsthe language in the novel is perfect every sentence is crafted with words that make the situation come alive the very best is the letter written by ed to connell the story takes place in new york beginning the the 1950s and it continues to the early 2000s eileen is the main voice she is a very determined woman that disregards people and their feelings and all in her path she falls in love with ed leary one new years eve he is an unambitious brain scientiest they marry and move to a flat in brooklyn they have one child connell these are very unlikeable characters irene made me crazy throughout ed and connell are very dull the story line is tirelessly sad","1170":"this review has been hidden because it contains spoilers to view it click here this book was intense the writing is sparse but excellent thomas captures the scenes and characters magnificently i was bored for quite some time though it doesn't say it on the back of the book but this novel is largely about alzheimer's it was handled masterfully as far as i can tell having never met anyone with it the reactions and decline were described so well and it reminded me of still alice the movie version since i haven't read the novel these are characters you live and this book was intense the writing is sparse but excellent thomas captures the scenes and

grow old with more","1171":"i'm not exactly sure i would call this a beach read i just read it on the beach and liked it it's about the lives of two irish people who marry and share their lives together in various parts of nyc","1172":"i received this book as a galley copy early reviewer book from the publisher i had heard good things about it in various journals so was very excited to read it although it was a good book and quite well written it just didn't hit a chord with me as much as i'd hoped it would i'm not sure why actually it might have been that i found it about 200 pages too long it also might have been that i have read barney's version by mordecai richler and this book suffers somewhat by comparison i truly loved barney's version and it remains one of my special favourites in this book mr thomas takes on the very difficult task of depicting a family trying to cope with a family member who has alzheimer's disease the leary family consists of the husband ed who is a college science professor his wife eileen who is a nurse and their son connell they live in new york city the book covers the years from mid to the end of the 20 century mr thomas is very skilled at character development so much so that he allows you to see his characters with all their flaws exposed that sometimes makes for uncomfortable reading as i found myself sometimes getting exasperated with eileen this character craftsmanship is why i have given this book 4 out of 5 stars because it's quite remarkable how well mr thomas does this considering this is a debut novel for him he also writes as if he is someone who is very familiar with alzheimer's disease and the terrible toll it takes on families and sufferers alike this book is heartbreaking in so many ways as we watch eileen trying to keep her family together while this disease begins to take it's appalling and inexorable toll on her her son and her friends no one is left unscathed while alzheimer's wreaks havoc in a family a difficult book to read but one that is worth the journey because of the craftsmanship of the writing","1173":"it was a fine book had trouble getting really involved with the characters found myself skimming through the fluff","1174":"this book hit very close to home for me intimate raw portrait of the inner workings of a family and a great reminder of why we shouldn't be so quick to judge others without walking in their shoes","1175":"i don't think i'm qualified to declare this book a great american novel so i'll just call it a great american story one whose quiet power i will long remember","1176":"to find a book like this is why i read it's a big story with effortless prose the characters are perfectly flawed i was hooked from the first page and devoured it in three days i absolutely loved it","1177":"so disappointing i'd hoped that after suffering through this slow paced story there would be a pay off in the end nope while i appreciated the raw honesty of the characters and their relationships i would say don't waste your time with this one","1178":"the topic is incredibly sad but i really enjoyed this book","1179":" this book badly needed a good editor the writing was awkward even strange at times the characters were mostly unlikable their motivations undiscoverable and unexplained it's painfully obvious that ed is suffering from alzheimers fairly early in the book but eileen seems blind to it even though she is a nurse the most believable character was the son he seemed to want to escape his parents as much as i did at times i wanted to quit reading the book altogether but struggled on to the unsatisfying end","1180":"this was a story of a girl who grows up in jackson heights and goes on to marry and have a child it relates how she copes with the various dufficulties of her life culminating in the diagnosis of early onset alzheimers for her husband i enjoed the story especially since i am alsofrom queens and couls relate to some of the locations in the book","1181":"i had an emotional connection to this beautifully written book \"you are not in this life to count up victories and defeats you are in it to love and be loved you are loved with your head down you will be loved whether you finish or not \" -- matthew thomas we are not ourselves","1182":"i truly wanted to like this book and i realize that others have given it 3 and 4 stars it is well written but too slow moving and it was difficult to like the main characters in the story perhaps the 620 pages could have been reduced to 300 pages i continued reading the book in hopes that i could say i was happy that i finished it but that didn't happen the author's research and writing about alzheimer's was very thorough","1183":"we meet the lead character in this book eileen when she's a girl growing up in her irish family in new york that part of the story held my interest as did her courtship and the early days of her marriage to ed along with the addition of a child connell while residing in a three family house and working as a nurse however her husband's diagnosis of a grave illness and his decline and its impact on everyone was a bit much for me i also felt the book was too long","1184":"wow what a great family saga another first time author too this is a big book 620 pages and i loved it so much i binge read it in 2 days it is a family saga of irish immigrants and mostly told through the eyes of their daughter eileen but at times her parents and then her child it is rich and detailed staying basically in a few miles in the bronx area i really enjoyed it and hope that there are more from this author","1185":"i agree this book needed a better editor the story was great the characters flat and annoying chapters would go by and nothing would happen please propel me forward through your stories with semblance of motion instead of letting me stagnant in your pond of babble blah blah blah","1186":"heartbreaking tragic insightful beautifully written i cried at the end","1187":"it was very well written but how long can you live with such an unhappy woman 9 days was enough for me","1188":"this was a loooooong book a good strong story that covered a lot of great every day everyman topics alzheimer's alcoholism parenting bullying marriage the need to please keeping up with the jones' mentality career progression ellen was a rich protagonist i identified with her as a mother wife and nurse a lot of her weaknesses are my weaknesses a lot of her strengths i share as well but it wasn't a book i raced back to reading i think i renewed it from the library three times i'm glad i read it prior to recommending it to bookclub because although it was nice writing the story line had too much breadth to keep me fully engaged","1189":"this book went from 3 4 stars as i read it's 600 pages but i think the author deserves 4 stars because of his ability to jump ahead and not make the reader feel like they have whiplash this was a good read to make yourself reflect on how you see your present life and the value you place on your future","1190":" a little tough for me took a bit to capture my interest the blurbs seemed to convey a somewhat different book than i was reading and the subject matter was a little personal but in the end i was moved and impressed at one point connell leary thinks sometimes he thought his real goal wasn't to teach them to write better essays but to get them to think more about what it meant to be human to that i would add that the purpose applies to authorship as well and to that end matthew thomas has accomplished much with we are not ourselves","1191":"very well written thought provoking story","1192":"keenly observed told with poignancy and restraint a bit too long but not in a the goldfinch hey look how much research i did guys love the sound of my own prose way not perfect but a fine thing","1193":"a very engrossing story i thought it would just be the tale of the daughter of immigrant parents who strives for more turned into something much deeper the last 30 or so pages the story drags didn't feel necessary overall a great read","1194":"i got halfway through to the big reveal which i won't reveal here i read another book recently with the same topic and didn't want to read another so i stopped","1195":"really can't see what is the big deal about this book sad depressing characters every problem imaginable no one is happy ever and the writing overblown also this books seems very very semi autobiographical only redeeming quality realistic depiction of alzheimer's","1196":"i got a little frustrated with the characters sometimes and i wish there had been some perspective from ed but overall this was a pretty good book since i read a galley i hope they edited out a few chapters especially towards the end when you think it's going to end and then it continues without adding any extra value","1197":" this was a really well written and thought provoking story of a family who deal with many issues families face today it tells the story of the dreams of making a better life than their parents gave them and showing the world that they have made it as eileen and her husband ed cope with their differences and raise a son connell it becomes clear that ed is struggling with some problems of his own eventually he is diagnosed with early onset alzheimer's and the family has to learn to cope with their greatest challenges the story is told through eileen primarily until the last few chapters when it changes focus to connell who has become an adult it is touching thoughtful and compelling to read a real triumph for a first novel i highly recommend it for all who enjoy good characters and family centered fiction","1198":"this was a really sad story and a really long book i enjoyed reading about eileen's life but didn't really care for the other main characters and it was just too long","1199":"i started reading this book two months ago and stopped reading it because of summer and being busy and also it got a bit boring which is why i give it four stars but oh my god when i read the rest of this book i loved it i didn't like eileen for some reasons but i understood it the ending was very good and the whole thing was really written i really loved the ending and was in tears on page on the last chapter before the epilogue","1200":"i enjoyed this book but i don't think it was consistent the characters were really fascinating and well thought out but the story didn't flow at all times so i found there were times i couldn't put it down and time i didn't want to pick it up i'm glad i read it though","1201":"what a book","1202":"very interesting characters but connell would have liked him better developed amazing debut novel by author","1203":" i normally wouldn't have picked this book up might have glanced at it in the bookstore and then put it back down but misha collins gave this book such high praises that i had to know why well he was right and it was amazing the premise is simple an immigrant family chasing the american dream following the journey of the protagonist from a young age til her old age but it's what happens in between that makes it so amazing a little bit spoilerish here i think what made this book so amazing for me is that her journey with her husband and the deterioration of the character's health and the feelings and emotions that were conveyed was so similar to what i went through with my dad and taking care of him on my own and watching him fall apart that it became a very emotional journey for me it brought back all the emotions that i had felt at that time and it broke me heart end of spoilers pretty much the whole last part of the book i could not stop crying the last time i cried this hard in a novel was when i was reading harry potter and the deathly hallows i would say that even if this is not the type of book you usually read give it a try it's a little slow at first but then it really picks up and it's amazingly well written","1204":"it took me a little while to get into it as it's more character driven than plot driven but beyond the heartbreaking story thomas explored ideas about the things we think that will make us happy the ways we feel our time should be spent and how much of ourselves do we owe to others the way all of these ideas are interwoven throughout the book is just genius loved it","1205":"i simply could not finish this book their life was miserable i wanted to like it for awhile it was a page turner but it was just too depressing for me","1206":"i slogged through this one a good story but about 150 pages could have been deleted and it would have been just as good does make the reader think about life and how we sometimes think we should be in a better place only to understand that we are right were we needed to be all along","1207":"big time investment beautifully written","1208":"well we all know i am a bit of a sucker for character development over plot and this book packs a punch in that department at a glance it is a third person narrative following three generations of family pivoting around eileen leary first as a young girl and her parent's contentious marriage next as she ages as a married middle aged mother and finally in her son connell this book is so much more than this simple narrative to say otherwise is to thoroughly gloss over what it is about this book that makes it so special this book captures the melancholy monotony and pain of life marriage parenthood success love expectation and desire all merging into the great and terrible journey of life the sadness was palpable the defeat heavy and the triumph seeded with the small plague of human doubt thomas uses simple elegant prose to convey a complexity that few books i have read can seem to identify let alone extrapolate i acutely felt each emotion eileen ed and connell experienced each fear elicited thoughts of similar anxieties and fears in my own heart each small moment of beauty accentuated by its melancholic context if you are looking for a book that describes the human condition without ever setting out to do so thomas has accomplished the feat with subtle mastery","1209":" wow we are not ourselves is a kind of book i haven't read in a long long time it is purely character driven and while the beginning 250 pages or so moved fairly slowly it moved at a believable pace for a true to life story as events with ed began to decline the story picked up pace in a way that in real life you wish it would slow down which really helped set the tone and mood of the book matthew thomas writes extraordinarily well and really nailed what it is like to deal with a tough situation with someone you love that you can't control it's been a long time since i was moved to tears by a book but i was a moved throughout the ending of the book highly recommended stick with it through the beginning once things get rolling it all comes together and the beginning adds so much and means so much in the end","1210":"i'm having a really hard time rating this book none of the characters were very likeable which is definitely not a prerequisite for good fiction but really i wanted to punch all of them in the face and the writing was inconsistent with some of its plot points for instance the protagonist supposedly had a lot of money problems but then she would all the sudden be able to renovate her house without any explanation of how she got the money and then next she would be worrying about how to afford putting her husband in a retirement home so she wanted to put off her retirement so she could keep the health benefits but then she all the sudden got a new boss and it wasn't a concern any longer maybe my brain is just tired and i missed some things but it happened often enough that i don't think that's the case so i'm giving it a two","1211":"the reader gets to know the leary family intimately from eileen's difficult childhood through her marriage to ed who becomeds increasingly strange until he is taken from her by altzheimer's to their son connell's struggle to find himself the characters become people we know and care about as we see their hopes and dreams altered crushed or realized a wonderful read","1212":"i liked this book a lot at first and it was interesting and heartbreaking to read about alzheimer's and how it robs a person of their mind and family it spans 1950 2011 and i liked 1950 to about 1970 but it's over 600 pages and while i finished it i didn't think it was worth reading for you at least jamie","1213":"i almost stopped reading one hundred pages in due to a lack of interest but i'm glad i persisted once the story of ed's decent into alzheimers begins the story picks up as does the writing his wife elaine is not a sympathetic character but she grows on you the son comes into better focus in the second half of the novel the final fifty pages are as weak as the first one hundred but by then the story has been told","1214":"i wish i could give it a bazillion stars","1215":"not sure i can finish this well written observation of a train wreck family i don't care for eileen so at page 234 of 620 it may be too much to ask of me i can garner little emotional support for eileen as little as she does for her family ps she's awful to her husband and i don't give her a bye on that no matter her upbringing or the 1950s","1216":" book description born in 1941 eileen tumulty is raised by her irish immigrant parents in woodside queens in an apartment where the mood swings between heartbreak and hilarity depending on whether guests are over and how much alcohol has been consumed when eileen meets ed leary a scientist whose bearing is nothing like those of the men she grew up with she thinks she's found the perfect partner to deliver her to the cosmopolitan world she longs to inhabit they marry and eileen quickly discovers ed doesn't aspire to the same ever bigger stakes in the american dream eileen encourages her husband to want more a better job better friends a better house but as years pass it becomes clear that his growing reluctance is part of a deeper psychological shift an inescapable darkness enters their lives and eileen and ed and their son connell try desperately to hold together a semblance of the reality they have known and to preserve against long odds an idea they have cherished of the future through the learys novelist matthew thomas charts the story of the american century particularly the promise of domestic bliss and economic prosperity that captured hearts and minds after wwii the result is a riveting and affecting work of art one that reminds us that life is more than a tally of victories and defeats that we live to love and be loved and that we should tell each other so before the moment slips away epic in scope heroic in character masterful in prose we are not ourselves heralds the arrival of a major new talent in contemporary fiction review first of all he is your son not the boy u0026amp you actually gave him a name ok now that i have that out of my system i recall my own dad calling me girl child u0026amp it was actually meant as a term of endearment in a not so huggy touchy lovie family so i can get that i was given this book free for an honest review u0026amp i honestly did not think the book would ever end at first once i began getting close to the end i dreaded it at times i strongly disliked the main character eileen but understood and admired her at other times she was a very realistic character after all who is actually perfect do we not all have faults and sort comings weaknesses and strengths i think the hardest things to digest about the book is the fact that i could relate to quite a bit of it good and bad how the characters sometimes felt behaved u0026amp later regretted their behavior i absolutely loved eileen's husband ed but how could i not love his loyalty humor and later hopelessness the struggles faced with an alzheimer's family member is something i have never personally been through my family dies of cancer long before their brain deteriorates like the man i this book in places i would be in tears from what the mother wife u0026amp son were going through as well as ed's struggle with losing control of his life yet still being aware enough to feel like a burden there are several situations where ed is at himself enough to be humorous when they are trying to calm him by telling him things that aren't exactly accurate i loved eileen's determination to work herself into a better situation in life and despite getting a lot of hard hits i still respected her at the end even mores since she did not just send ed away when things got hard she did not take the easy way out and that still gains respect from some people at first their teen son is a snot not dealing well with losing his father eventhough his father is physically still there but he grows too as the story years go on i have actually gotten a little teary recalling this long story there is a lot of detail about eileen's childhood her adulthood even her son's maturity into adulthood generations span ideas change and evolve as life goes on the story just would not have been the same nor had the same effect without what at times seems like a lot of pointless detil as i was reading i wished it would move on but if it had passed more quickly with less detail the experience would not have been as meaningful in the end not a quick read but i will never forget it so many feelings and understandings brought to life i hope this book is around for many generations to enjoy","1217":" thanks to netgalley and publisher for allowing me to reread this one there is a great deal to love about this novel yet i think it is also a bit of a tedious read the scope of this book is both an asset and a detriment simply because it covers such an expanse in such depth i love the reality of characterization that thomas brings to the table and his writing is straightforward which is quite fitting for this novel i appreciate his dedication to this work and his commitment to harsh realities that so many of us face it is at once sad hopeful and real a complex and rich read again the own downfall to this novel is the sheer extent of time covered i found my interest waning from time to time which saddens me since the novel is quite well done perhaps a little less would have been more","1218":"we are not ourselves is matthew thomas' first novel but definitely does not come across as a debut it follows the character of eileen tumulty through much of her life focussing also on her husband and son this is a character rather than a plot driven story and explores consequences of life decisions how the characters deal with happenings out of their control how these circumstances and choices change them as people as well as an examination of personal values while the characters were not always likeable they were very real this was a beautifully written thought provoking novel thank you so much goodreads and simon and schuster canada","1219":"the story pulled me in right away and all in all it was a pretty good book none of the three main characters was terribly likable and the main problem they had to deal with was fairly predictable i enjoyed most of the story but it could probably have been shortened by 200 pages and been just as compelling","1220":"interesting novel about a family and how try grow and change and deal with hope and loss i liked the characters but thought the book was a little long on detail in a lot of places 600 pages was a lot for a book that probably could have been 300 or 400 though i did enjoy the details about queens and about the mets those kept me in it at times","1221":"the plot of \"we are not ourselves\" follows the path of a human life and just as in life it wanders twists and turns fast and slow it starts off fairly slowly but stick with it for at least the first hundred pages or so the writing is so good and the author's insights about human emotions are so spot on that you just get caught up in it all you feel you have to follow along you become invested in eileen's tale one of the best things about this book is how well the author has captured small moments of an individual's life that really equates to all of us the realization that alzheimer's had a part to play in this story seemed to creep up on me just as it comes upon ed's wife eileen and son even though there is nothing spared about the cruelty of this illness the writing doesn't seem cold or unfeeling you really get to understand ed's personal struggle pay attention the king lear quote at the beginning of the book is prophetic even though the subject is depressing and there are areas where i was tearful the book isn't ultimately depressing it's full of love and life and caring it's even funny in places and i was surprised how much i enjoyed it","1222":"right up front i'm going to say this book is long and has a leisurely pace it is not an action packed novel is what i'm saying here it ranges over the life often in great detail and sometimes in more sweeping views of the life of an irish american woman in new york city it's definitely one of those story of a life books looking at the main character in her roles as daughter wife mother employee landlord neighbor and friend it's a very contemplative book it's always interesting when we as readers come across things in fiction that we can relate to our own lives and experiences but this was even a bit uncanny to see my own preoccupation with savings and spendings as markers of security play out in a novel it almost crossed into creepy i hope this isn't a bizarre irish pathology i was absolutely convinced though that the author must be an nyu alum because who else would care that much about the bcc campus and especially have a character view nyu as a more prestigious choice in 1975 he is not as it turns out although he is a native new yorker","1223":"ehh i did not love this book or the characters i just never felt vested in their story definitely flawed characters dealing with difficult situations but i had a hard time caring about them","1224":"the writing was good but honestly i don't understand the hype around this book","1225":" i found myself angry with eileen leary i would slap to another page toss the book on the bed all the while saying why don't you see are you crazy think of your future why would anyone say that to her child and keep reading and reading my blood boiling over this woman i had good reason to be angry but sometimes it was because i was being made to feel so sad it was familiar territory that place where you are weighed down by circumstances and suddenly lifted by them too matthew thomas has written an insightful and compassionate book about family i never liked eileen but i kept rooting for her as if her life were my own","1226":"i met the author last night and he gave some insight to this long saga of family and emotional need this was an interesting read though i think it could have been 100 pages shorter the story seemed to go in too many directions and any one of those tangents could have been explored more deeply to make a point instead though i liked the story of eileen ed u0026amp connel i was left with many unanswered questions","1227":"this was an outstanding book if you are looking for a feel good book then you will be disappointed if you are looking for an outstanding piece of literature then you need to read this book this story will make you think about what you would do in this situation the characters are so real so sad so hateful full of turmoil but you still care deeply for them i was given the pleasure of reading this book prior to release date i think this will be one of the best books of the year","1228":"a bit disappointed after hearing such great reviews there were parts i enjoyed but most were long and drawn out and difficult to connect with emotionally i did feel compelled to finish it hoping that it would pay off in the end it feel short for me","1229":"the scope of the character development in this novel is epic i was emotionally engaged from page one until i closed the book with a sigh 600 pages later it was an intimate family portrait excellent writing fabulous reading","1230":"the first half of this book was enjoyable thomas tells a lot with summary and backstory understandable he covers a lot of ground but it never dragged try as i might though i just couldn't make the leap to the second half","1231":"had to give up halfway through the main characters were so unlikeable materialistic shallow racist it was really hard to care about them","1232":"i did not like it as much as i thought i would the writing and language were wonderful but i think the topic was just a little too sad for me since i already lived through that","1233":"this has got to be one of the most depressing books i have ever read there isn't much plot it's mostly a character driven story i had to force myself to continue reading this book the writing is strong and it is beautifully written but i just hated the entire story it was depressing from beginning to end i feel there are stories that can be depressing but still worth reading but i don't think this is one of them i really don't think i would recommend this book to anyone i know","1234":"i love a book that follows a person family through all the stages of life this one was a bit frustrating to find sympathy with the main character she never seemed to find a way to embrace any joy in her situation an interesting look at what happens when we are driven by duty and our ideas of what a successful life should look like","1235":" it was the thoroughgoing irishness of tumulty that bothered her the redolence of peat bogs and sloppy rebel songs and an uproar in the blood of a defeat that ran so deep it reemerged as a treacherous conviviality this is a heartbreaking novel full of lyrical passages and well observed characters there are no sudden plot twists no gimics just a beautiful interpretation of the 'american dream' in the character of eileen we see the downside of the constant striving and reaching to be and have better than the generation before i","1236":"i can't say that this was the most enjoyable book to read or that the lead character was entirely loveable but i do think it was very wise and insightful and that the lead character is very human kudos to the author for understanding the complexities within all of us and for letting the main characters find experience redemption in spite of their flaws","1237":"this is an almost perfect novel the simple yet complicated story of the leary family trying to attain a slice of the american dream eileen ed and connell leary will live on through their heartbreaking somber journey into dark territory that will threaten their very livelihoods eileen's story will especially break your heart but she keeps up appearances and her pragmatism and iron will is definitely something that is incredibly human and maddeningly annoying at the same time mr thomas's treatment of alzheimer's disease is also incredibly sensitive and straightforward which packs a punch especially in the later half of his extremely ambitious and gripping work of art","1238":" decent book hard to judge it's powerful but kind of a slog the prose can be beautiful but the pacing can be agonizing the characterization and plot can be piercing and heartbreaking but then i feel like there could have been so much more done with connell or perhaps eileen's parents or ed himself in the beginning to make it a truly multi generational story with equal development for all there were times where i felt like i could read 100 pages so easily and quickly and then there were times where i could barely get through 20 pages in a sitting the best thing about this book - and i don't know if it's a spoiler to say what the \"main subject\" of the book is really about as a centerpiece - is the honestly and unflinching portrayal of ed and his life as he struggles it's something you don't see or hear a lot about in real life though it's starting to move more to the mainstream with an oscar worthy performance in a major movie this year a number of articles in time and so forth and an actor's push forward with his testimony in front of congress and his own foundation and i thought the scenes where you see connell and eileen with ed were very touching heartbreaking and honest the way the epilogue read i kind of wish that was expanded into a greater third act - but then the book would have been 700 pages maybe scale back some of the description on houses and eileen's worry with her house desire for another house and the projects tied in with the houses i know they are supposed to contribute to the whole \"striving class\" theme in the novel but man there are probably 100 pages of cuts in there somewhere it's too slow to be a five star and probably even a four but it is well written and could be above a three though that's where i'll settle because there are no halves","1239":"long but wonderful debut novel","1240":"i am still enjoying the thrill of reading this book it is very long but i could read it over and over for each sentence is worth enjoying it is not a happy book but it warmed my heart a very difficult thing to explain when i can't say there was any lightness at all at its heart thomas has written a new york irish american story but i think mothers fathers and children will see themselves no matter what the background kudos to the author a remarkable debut novel","1241":"wow i loved this book it is quite long but i simultaneously couldn't wait to see where the characters lives went while at the same time dreading the book finishing i could have read about this family forever with that said the epilogue is beautifully written if you like strong characters that will make their way into your subconscious this book is for you if you are looking for a fast paced action plot driven story you might want to reconsider","1242":"this summers best novel","1243":" it takes a certain alchemy to make a novel that is mostly about the mundane engrossing unfortunately wano does not possess this alchemy it very nearly ended up on my dnf shelf but i pushed through i found almost all of the characters unlikable and prone to selfish ridiculous decisions that did nothing for the story overall its 600 pages could have easily been pared down by eliminating many of the tangents the author wandered off on i still have no idea what the blurb at the beginning about the frog had to do with anything or who it was probably connell and his father but that was never made clear i'm not taking anything away from this book other than relief to be finished not one i'd recommend","1244":"it took me awhile to get into this book and for half the book i really disliked one of the characters i plodded through because i had heard good things about the book and the story began to pull me in by the end of the book i was truly sad i had finished the book the author had successfully made me care about these characters and it was an extremely touching book","1245":"this is one of those books where i didn't particularly like nor could i identify with the characters this is not necessary for my enjoyment or appreciation of a novel i felt the characters were fundamentally one dimensional and self centered i wanted to see more general compassion from every character the whole book was just odd from a family dynamic perspective idk i just couldn't relate","1246":"not for the reader looking for happy ever afteri really liked this book but so much of life's trials are sad or unhappy that you begin to wish for a happier life for this family it is a love story and what can happen to keep a marriage and family together people aren't perfect but are protective of family","1247":"interesting story at times i was quite engaged while at other times the narrative moved at a slow pace and i was a little bored and wanted to jump ahead it is certainly a topical book about how families manage in difficult times and the author shows this in a raw and honest way","1248":"despite my rating i am hard pressed to recommend this book it was so incredibly depressing and ver well written and interesting","1249":"this is the story of a family with all their warts faults and sadness no sugar coating no happy endings my only complaint was that at 600 pages this book was too long","1250":"what a remarkable first novel this is over 600 pages but not once does it drag or feel overly long this highly acclaimed debut follows an american family over 60 years it's a powerful and compelling family drama that centres on the learys in particular on eileen tumulty born to irish immigrants in 1941 in woodside queens and who pursues her own american dream by marrying neuroscientist ed leary he is nothing like the men she has grown up with and she thinks he will be her passport to a better life but nothing works out quite as she hopes and once ed is diagnosed with early onset alzheimer's things go from bad to worse the novel's devastating description of the remorseless progress of the disease and the effect it has on the sufferer and those around him is deeply moving eileen is the driving force of this well constructed and expertly paced novel and she is an unforgettable character like her or loathe her she is as real as anyone you are likely to meet in real life thomas' gift for characterisation is impressive the emotional truth at the heart of the book is conveyed in an unsentimental but always empathetic manner the history of post war america is told through the story of this one family the pursuit of a better life the opportunities newly available education and health care systems material prosperity and its precariousness - it's all here in this wonderful novel which is certainly one of my reading highlights of 2014","1251":"this is excellent storytelling the writing is brilliant and the story is epic i found some of this novel very difficult to get through due to some things ongoing in my own life i kept going and i am very glad i did as the novel tells the story of a multi generational irish american family it is both heart breaking and life affirming and i am glad i read it the novel is one that should not be missed in we are not ourselves we find ourselves on these very pages 4 5 stars out of 5","1252":"i was glad to have finished this i would not have called it a 'sweeping saga'","1253":"okay how does a first time author come so close to writing what might have been the novel of the year for me the title sort of sums it all up the book moves along a quite a nice clip and then deflates a bit can decide if the writing is a casualty or symbolic of what is going on at the home front would be a great book for book club don't want to spoil it worth the read","1254":"boy this is a tough one i alternated between not being able to put the book down and skimming whole sections i started listening to it 18 disks in my car and because i had the paperback in my house when it got interesting i would pick up the book at home and keep reading but at other times when i thought this book would just never end i would pick up the book at home so i could skim along to where the narrative caught my interest again i was alternately really pleased with the book and really disappointed with the book so three stars thomas starts with the story of big mike tumulty and his wife but the story quickly shifts to mike's daughter eileen and proceeds from there to be the story of her life it almost seems like thomas is a real estate agent as the story seems focus on how where one lives impacts who they are eileen grew up in a rental apartment rented an apartment in a house in an neighborhood a little more upscale bought that house and fled to the suburbs when the neighborhood became more ethnically diverse a long time ago i took a film course in which the instructor discussed that in a really good film the director does not give you information which is not needed for plot or character development sort of the chekov's gun principle this book violated that principle so often that it became the largest source of my disappointment for example why do we need to go into how much connell was bullied boy those sections ran on forever when there was no real impact on connell's character and it did not move the story forward at all it is not like the bullying made connell support his mother's desire to move to yonkers one incident of the bullying would have made the point another example of this is the sergei thing i am not really sure what the point of that was and thomas does like to beat his expired horses for example look at the whole episode with ed and the grades by the time thomas gets to this chapter well chapters since this also runs on seemingly forever he has already made the reader see ed's behavior in the classroom and at home and the reader understands there is something on thomas does not need to beat the reader over the head with the level of dysfunction because the reader already sees where this is heading finally i found the ending a little messy are we supposed to think that eileen regrets the move to yonkers well that was covered several chapters back and the epilogue was a real annoyance was that some editor's idea but on the other hand the overall eileen ed story really worked for me and it was handled so beautifully there were other moments that thomas made unforgettable or that had the clarity of truth in them i wish i could have given this one 3 5 stars i will read matthew thomas' work again and hope that he will learn to tighten up his narrative","1255":"this book was a tear jerker this epic story 610 pages was the story of a family a lot of the struggles they encountered are the struggles many encounter the pivotal point is when the father is diagnosed with early onset alzheimer's when he is only in his early 50's any reader who has experienced alzheimer's will relate to how the family struggles to deal with the changes this brings very moving","1256":" despite having been recommended by a friend with great literary taste i found this novel strangely unsatisfying the writing was elegiac and the empathy shown by author matthew thomas for his characters was far greater than i could summon ironically the father in this very long book the length of which was essential was not only the afflicted but the most fascinating i loved his commitment to his son who was in many ways unworthy of such a deep love i loved his commitment to an underserved student population i loved his need for an ordered life for the traditions of baseball of the academic year of mass and of friendship and love and how he fought to preserve them as they slipped away to write of a protagonist who must be stripped of all vanities through the horror of alzheimer's speaks to a nobility and a compassion most unusual i look forward to reading whatever may come next in thomas's oeuvre","1257":"i liked this book very much it was very interesting watching eileen 'grow up' and marry and navigate her way through her original family's disfunction and remain as sane as she did i admired her claim on her sanity in living with 'crazy' ed as well i would have been long gone having to put up with him way before he began exhibiting more recognizable symptoms of dementia he was a difficult man even before the disease she was a saint as far as i'm concerned this was a very 'real' story real characters real problems real solutions very sad for all involved i had one red flag and that would be that a woman with eileen's past would probably not be as equipped to deal with all the stress that her character dealt with and remain mentally and emotionally intact as she does in the novel that was the one rather 'unbelievable' bit of writing that i did not find truthful p s i found myself rooting for the russian i was sad to see him make an exit","1258":" slow and heavy excellent character study this book is one that will take awhile the characters are so very flawed yet you understand these shortcomings as they don't know better at times it feels like the author is hitting the reader over the head with the message enjoy each moment i've read that despite being his debut novel there was a great bidding war for publication and there is a movie in the works in today's world of quick and pithy it was nice to read something that took time","1259":"irish american set in ny queens lots of local references family saga dense first book by this author empathetic depiction of impact of alzheimer's on a family felt realistic to me","1260":"this was not what i expected but it a very good way when i started reading this novel i had just finished a struggle session with the bone clocks david mitchell's latest and i was ready for something lighter a nice irish american family saga sounded like just the thing until it became a much darker and richer reading experience i am guessing this book is somewhat autobiographical because i don't think the author could have tackled his subject as sensitively and perceptively as he did without some personal experience a remarkable read","1261":"a powerful read about marriage illness and the day to day struggles of life it definitely deserved its place in the nyt top 100 books for this year","1262":"beautifully written but needs editing as much too long and drawn out in parts","1263":"read this on a whim because an actor i like suggested it it's a little slow at first and it's a longer read but definitely worth it one of my favorite books engaging surprising and heartbreaking","1264":"whether or not you read this novel i recommend you pick it up at a bookstore or library and read page one it stands alone before part i and is one of the most engaging openings i have ever read it takes a long time to see where this scene might fit into the rest of the novel but it makes an excellent short short story on its own 5 stars for that page few books have made me feel more intensely that i'm living in the story and know the characters they are believable and real like your own family you'll get angry with them but love them just the same the reason i can't recommend this novel wholeheartedly is that it was so painful for me to read the family's tragedy is too common a reality too universal a fear some readers may see that as the story's strength and find it cathartic others will feel they need a vacation","1265":"i can't remember the last book i gave 5 stars to but i'm pretty sure it didn't leave me feeling as emotionally wretched as this one did the story follows the lives of eileen and ed leary and their son connell through from eileen and ed's childhoods to their final days as a family the spine of the story may be about ed's alzheimer's and how it affects him and those around him but really this is a story about love every single page is sad and yet mostly uplifting it may be 620 pages long but i read it in 2 days because i just couldn't leave those characters behind i don't actually have the words to do this book justice so let me just say that it is beautiful and heartbreaking and epic and domestic and so so affecting","1266":"what a miserable slog and maybe miserable slogs are your jam but i'm too busy living through my own miserable slog to enjoy 600 pages of someone else's bleak and hopeless","1267":"so incredibly depressing i made it to page 251 before i quit i kept waiting for something great to happen but this book just padded along in it's ordinary ness i didn't like any of the characters which didn't help the setting wasn't spectacular there were very small happy points' in this book to break out of the dismal life these characters lived the book did keep calling to me and i think that is why i stayed with it so long and nothing happy happened no great wisdom no great event i finally realized i was depressed for the last week because of this book life is too short i gave my self permission to quit this should have done it sooner","1268":"a tad too long","1269":"i loved loved this book the sweeping scope covered in the lifetime of a little irish girl growing up in nyc the emotional connection i felt to the characters the investment i felt in the novel and the constant interest i had to read on","1270":"it was well written good character development the lives seemed dusty and sad and then alzheimer's and death i enjoyed reading this book but might not recommend it as it is a long book about a slow deterioration","1271":"epic in scope heroic in character masterful in prose hmmmm not my usual read i won a copy of this book and thought 'oh no now i have to read it ' i found myself picking it up at night and reading way to late i did like it a lot i would have given it a 3 5 had it been possible the characters were interesting and the dynamics between the family members felt real it did drag in parts and the overall story is depressing i'm glad i stuck with it","1272":"an amazing story told in such a way that by the end i realized i had just been taught how to live fully present and appreciate each moment as it arrives","1273":"alzheimer's and the effect it has not only on the one with the disease but also on those aroung him or her i cried and i laughed felt empathy and compassion well written and informative particularly with early onset alzheimer's great to listen to","1274":" very well done it starts a bit slowly and i think it could have been a bit shorter i don't know if we needed 600 pages to tell this story but once i started it i couldn't put it down spoilers ahead having read still alice years ago and getting the point of view of someone going through the early onset alzheimer's diagnosis first hand this was interesting though no less devastating to see the impact such a diagnosis has on immediate family members looking forward to more great things from this author","1275":"this was a real emotional challenge it is a massive book that covers many years in the life of a family from the 40's through 2011 the characters are real and transparent the bulk of the book deals with the experiences of each of family that develop their characters and motivate and shape their personalities and responses to each other they are complex individuals who form a family that is both flawed yet committed another key focus is the love story between eileen and ed they make all the usual mistakes and fail in so many ways to understand and appreciate each other yet their love story is both poignant and eternal for me it was one of the most beautiful parts of the book eileen's dedication to ed proves extraordinary but it was actually painful to see how it plays out it tugged at my heart as did the relationship between connell and both of his parents the feelings that this book brought out in me were similar to those i experienced while watching several of my favorite movies ordinary people kramer vs kramer and steel magnolias if you found any connection to these movies you will also enjoy we are not ourselves rather than action mystery or humor this book focuses on a family and its dynamics it is quite beautiful and will certainly leave a lasting impression on me thanks to netgalley and the publisher for the opportunity to read and review this book","1276":"very long and uneventful nothing happens in my opinion in the first 300 pages","1277":"i can't believe i actually read this entire book it was long boring and had no plot","1278":"just really didn't get into it","1279":" this is a book of two halves it is a huge book upwards of 600 pages and in all honesty i feel it could have been delivered in 3oo 400 pages i was weary from it by the middle and was advised to stick with it by a friend who had read it lo and behold it suddenly took off and the second half of the book was heartbreakingly good on that basis i'm not sure whether to recommend it or not all i can say was that at i was glad i had read it by the closing page but i must stress that the first half of the book is slow and tedious","1280":" this book had so much potential but fell far short where was his editor it was about 200 pages too long and what was with naming nearly every store in bronxville it got so distracting i began to wonder if the author was getting ad revenue from every store mentioned and yet he neglected womrath's the great indy bookstore of my youth and many of the alzheimer's scenes just did not ring true for me that is a sensitive subject matter and if an author is going to write about it he'd best have either first hand knowledge or rely on a someone else who does to make sure he's getting the nuances correct everyone's experience w the disease if different but i personally did not feel he got much of it right which led to an overall skeptical feeling as i continued to read finally let me just say whether in bronxville proper or the surrounding yonkers neighborhoods no 50 year old woman was wearing a housecoat in 1994","1281":" yes this is a long book that some will find boring it is not action packed but neither is real life the story is about eileen and her family she is born in 1941 and takes us to 2011 as for eileen and her family like all people they have flaws i liked them sometimes and disliked them other times it really started to hold my interest when her husband's personality started changing it turns out he has early onset alzheimer's from then on the book takes you thorough the everyday of having and living with someone who has alzheimer's it was enlightening and heartbreaking at the same time it also showed one woman's strength and the love she has for her husband it was a very good read","1282":" at first this book was hard to get into i would start and then stop never making much progress then as i started to get to know the characters and understand their motivations i wanted to see the outcome honestly i felt this could have been a factual story of lots of families it was heartbreaking to see ed diminish and i felt the loss when he died i didn't like eileen at first but i could understand her i could understand the need to not want to struggle and to aspire to greater things in reality she wanted and needed control because then she knew she wouldn't be disappointed this was a great read and i feared up at the end as connell struggled to find himself","1283":"if you are irish or know anyone with early or other alzheimer's this book is so very true about the irish thomas has got all the traits of my growing up life about the alzheimer's he's clearly got that covered beautifully i couldn't put it down","1284":"quite a saga my favorite part is the letter from the father to the son very touching","1285":"well written but bleak as hell","1286":"beautifully written and insightful on so many levels i couldn't put down this seemingly simple story of a family because it resonated as realistic and compelling this books shows that its not necessarily the twists and turns of plot but the feelings within the characters that make a book great","1287":"the story of an irish american woman who comes from a difficult background and makes her way through the years when i read other reviews of this and saw it was really depressing i thought about not reading it but decided to anyway i didn't know why it was depressing until i was in the middle of it but early onset alzheimers is such a difficult topic however i am very glad i read it though it is indeed depressing in fact i realized yesterday that it really affected my mood all day as i was reading it most of the day before so if a book can do that if it actually affect one's mood and if it's hard to put down i would say that is a good read i would say that is a very good read indeed if i look at the components of it the style the length the story part i don't know that i would say that it goes on way too long way too descriptive and the author tries a little too hard to be philosophical and say brilliant things i didn't think it ended particularly well but i'm not sure it could have ended any other way it is in part just about an ordinary life","1288":"interesting read","1289":" i was very excited for this book when it was released due to a few factors 1 i work at barnes u0026amp noble and it was flying off of the shelves 2 it was reviewed well by the new yorker and the ny times and 3 i usually enjoy irish authors' tales of family drama as so many of the tales are as such yet this book just did not live up to its expectations and i was thoroughly disappointed i found myself skimming and flipping the pages more often than even trying to get into the story it was well written i guess but nothing appealed to me about the writing style it just seemed like a very easily written book about a family of three dealing with the father's alzheimer's disease deterioration the most interesting parts of the book were the beginning segments where the main character eileen's parents were depicted though i barely knew why that information was even presented at all as the novel went on eileen is not a likeable character and i was surprised how materialistic and greedy she is just because she didn't have much growing up with her immigrant family status i can't imagine that that was how it was for a majority of irish american families in the late twentieth century this one was a real bummer for me and i wish i would've liked it more because i was so excited to read it","1290":"at some points this book was a solid five stars at others it was a three but the overall feeling i had once i finished was that this is a book i will never forget one of those stories that makes you think about your own life and those in it it was honest brutally in some scenes but this could be any family in any city this could be the story of someone you know or yourself","1291":"this review has been hidden because it contains spoilers to view it click here very tedious reading until the last few chapters there were so many details that i felt had no relevance in either the character development or the storyline the protagonist eileen was unlikeable the son connell was the only character that i could empathize with as he was treated so badly by his mother it was frustrating to me as a nurse that eileen didn't realize much sooner what was going on with her husband's health the only redeeming feature in this book was the maturation of connell an very tedious reading until the last few chapters there were so many details that i felt had no relevance in either the character development or the storyline the protagonist eileen was unlikeable the son connell was the only character that i could empathize with as he was treated so badly by his mother it was frustrating to me as a nurse that eileen didn't realize much sooner what was going on with her husband's health the only redeeming feature in this book was the maturation of connell and how his love for his father was portrayed in the last few chapters wouldn't waste my time on this one though seems it has many good reviews more","1292":"a very long book i've seen it described as epic though i feel it lacks the grandeur of a truly epic novel it is always engaging and extremely well written the characters are sometimes somewhat tough to love but still always empathetic which makes them feel particularly real much of the story is like intimately observing a family and the end is truly worth the effort it made me ugly cry and want to call my family take that as you will","1293":" this was such a heartbreaking and well told story i loved the writing and the exquisite details of the characters' lives really almost make you feel like you're part of the family and experiencing everything they are going through you really get a sense of what it's like to be ed and eileen and connell and how the situation with which they are faced affects each of them i felt bogged down by all the attention to detail at times but in retrospect it really helps you observe ed's deterioration over time","1294":"i really loved this book it is about life and how we have lived it in america in the last forty years or so the characters are so vivid and easy to love it's about hopes and dreams amazing don't miss it","1295":"i registered a book at bookcrossing com http www bookcrossing com journal 12707209a book about the trials and tribulations of despicable people","1296":" i'm not sure if i can explain my attraction to this book it's infused with disappointment and i really didn't like the protagonist on the other hand i understood and believed her desire to move up in the world the author exhaustively chronicled her marriage and relationship with her family then in midstream the plot tipped over into another realm when her husband suddenly seems to begin to unravel i suspected an affair but i was completely wrong although in some places i felt it dragged on too long i realize that the author took pains to reveal every aspect of a lengthy marriage and the kinds of strains that are placed on it i came to admire the cranky protagonist though i still found her abrasive i don't want to spoil this by divulging what happens to the husband so i will just say that i thought the author did an amazing job and i look forward to seeing more from him in the future","1297":"i did it i finished this behemoth i thought the book was ok but i had exactly the same reaction as everybody else somewhere around the middle of the book when will it end i had it on e book so i didn't realize it was so long i thought for sure i was nearing the end of the book then to check the pages and realize i wasn't even halfway i wasn't glad i was disappointed not exactly the mark of a great book the summary is misleading born in 1941 story about irish immigrants etc the physical book had about 15 20% to do with her upbringing by irish immigrants and the culture and way of life and within those physical pages only about 25% of the words were actually about that topic a more accurate summary would be 60 years of a regular family life in ny written over 600 pages with the most exciting parts removed apparently they went to italy and disneyworld but those only merited a passing mention but the longest most minute dissection of the couch was given multiple pages the characters weren't that interesting a lot of it was just depressing it was way too wordy boring in quite a few places and then the most superficial characters would suddenly have the deepest most poignant realizations which seemed way out of place and things that really would never have occurred to these kinds of people it seemed possibly more of a soapbox even if the intended messages were generally benevolent there is a scene near the end where the author did away with trying to imply the message of the book and just used a certain mechanism to just say the darn message i guess he figured he better bring this book to a point so he just put it in yes there were parts that i enjoyed but much of it was just cringeworthy and unenjoyable as well bullying psychic type helpers etc is that what the author intended perhaps but for it to work as a lesson i need to enjoy being taught it unfortunately the lessons weren't worth the investment in this book","1298":"this is one of those life stories that you can sort of relate to and get lost in you feel for the characters and you learn from them i love the lessons found in the book mine is now all highlighted up one of those that makes you ponder and appreciate you existence","1299":"it was heavy and if i had known more of the storyline i probably would have skipped it but it was a well written story and an honest portrayal of a family","1300":"we started reading this book as an audio book on a road trip we got about 1 5 the way through sometimes when this happens i'll pick up a paper copy of the book and finish it well it's now been three weeks and i have absolutely no interest in picking up this book so put this one on the dnf shelf in a word it's the most depressing book i've ever read it's also pretty much a book about normal people leading normal lives not my favorite genre and it's so slow but the main problem is that all the characters are so unlikeable particularly the matriarch who comes across as never satisfied and always wanting more just because she does and she pretty much hates everybody since i only read 1 5 of the pages i don't think it's a spoiler to say that in addition her wimpy kid is bullied in school and the dad is losing his mind or didn't have one to start it's unclear at 20% and his mental illness just comes across as weird and depressing like nothing you've ever seen or read about in real life","1301":"having had a family member pass due to alzheimer this book was very special to me for a first novel it was very good","1302":"perhaps it was because of circumstances in my own life i was unable to see or feel all of the hope that the reviewers claimed this book to have i finished and now i don't want to sleep because i will have bad dreams i had hope that this book would end differently","1303":"i was so impressed with the level of detail in this book i felt like i was left hanging because there were many aspects in my opinion of the character that were not developed i was almost left feeling confused especially when it came to elaine very confused about her at any rate if anyone else reads this i would love to process it if given the choice i would pick 2 5 but am bumping it up to 3","1304":" we are not ourselves is a touching family saga born in

that we should tell each other before the moment is past it took matthews ten years to write the novel his is a new powerful voice in contemporary fiction","1305":"great insight into everyday lives and problems of ordinary people how different people deal with adversity follows the life of one character from childhood to old age deeply moving story of how our history affects and molds us","1306":"i've heard complaints that the story moves too slowly although i did not find it so the language is beautiful and sets the tone perfectly the story is well constructed and the characters are believable and distinct this is one of those rare books to fall into during a lazy weekend definitely not for fast read brain candy","1307":"straight narrative omnipotent 3rd person trough the eyes of eillen until chapter 60 when change perspective to son connell reads like a james michner novel which there is nothing wrong with but are there no longer editors who suggest or demand modification connell is not an admirable character brillant perhaps but shallow if you've not experienced the day to day of alzheimer then this book is an excellent guide","1308":"very moving could have been shorter","1309":"this was a difficult book to rate it's very well written and an important novel but it's a very frank truthful account of a family and is painful to read i got a lot out of it and was pretty glad i read it though","1310":"this is a really great book nothing like what i normally read and i enjoyed it thoroughly","1311":" an amazing book although it takes a couple of chapters to figure this out for me it was well worth the effort of 600 pages the main character eileen is so finely drawn i doubt that i will ever forget her lovely evocative prose profoundly moving and absolutely heartbreaking at times not for readers in the mood for action plot twists or excitement it's drama is in the everyday realities and the struggles of life and marriage especially what it really takes to love someone \"for better or for worse \"","1312":"beautifully written book but so sad","1313":" fell a little flat for me but perhaps that's because i expected too much somehow i was so excited to read about an irish family i didn't know it was an view spoiler alzheimer's hide spoiler book and this came on the heels of another irish family saga that knocked my socks off the edge of sadness the descriptive parts were boring i'd rather have extra words be used to develop character or setting rather than give a play by play of a ball game or some other frivolous anecdote making the book feel wordy the plot also covered more years than i thought was necessary for the story and included so many inconsequential thoughts and actions mostly though this was one of the very rare times that my dislike for a character ruined the book for me i'm so glad that i don't have to hang out with eileen anymore","1314":"this review has been hidden because it contains spoilers to view it

support and how you can have some kind of peace in such a stressful situation is told wonderfully characters here are to good or saintly connell the son is at times indifferent and careless but this is actual life and the realities are harsh in this scenario despite the heavy tone of overwhelming burdens the book was refreshing to read more","1315":"overall the story was engaging but there seemed to be an overflow of daily family monotony it took me a very long time to read it and i wasn't really hooked until i was about 3 4 of the way through the novel overall this book gets an eh from me","1316":"a fabulous read such great characters i could not put it down","1317":" i absolutely loved every page of this book its span of time and events is so broad the subject matter so raw the ending so inevitable it was a slow burn fueled by awesome writing and real characters that made me angry and amused and sad by turns the experiences of lifting yourself and your family up in the world and of caring for a failing family member are rendered so tenderly but also with grim realism i recognized my own success and failure in many scenes i gasped laughed and cried my way through this fantastic","1318":"finishing this long slow heartbreaking book felt like a real commitment to me and i did not fully commit to it until nearly halfway through as others have said below this is a character driven plot that evolves slowly over several decades and the first half really dragged for me and the story of this family of three was so unrelentingly sad it was difficult to listen to at times but slowly and ultimately i fell in love with the book i am still processing it and intend to come back in a few days to expand on this review for now i am sitting with it","1319":"next to the goldfinch my favorite book of the year","1320":"ahhh what can i say that hasn't already been said it's an all american love story it's soft yet strong gentle yet fierce tender yet tough sweet and bittersweet heartbreaking and heartwarming all at once i couldn't help but hear neil diamond's america or is it coming to america over and over in my head as i read this this is an immigrant's story a simple story of hope the american dream infinite ambition acceptance and moving forward against all odds we learn that nothing is certain except the whims of chance and change unfortunately before even starting this book i stumbled across an article which prematurely revealed the twist or painful revelation upon which the story hinges regardless i found the story enjoyable at over 600 pages wano requires commitment and a bit of time investment there's more baseball than i would've liked but i can see how baseball fits in with the all americanness of this story i also didn't like how mt referred to a girl's cunt as her sex touched her sex or something similar i'm not bothering to look it up somewhere towards the beginning of the book just the heartfelt letter from father to son made it worth reading this entire book this story is an exploration in family dynamics the complex yet fundamental relationship negotiations and compromises between mother and son father and son husband and wife there's no shortage of drama there's enough old person traditional sex but not enough or any at all old person oral does that stop at a certain age sometimes felt sluggish bloated and overly sentimental somehow the pacing still works as it mimics how astoundingly slow life unfolds at times in summation this is a sprawling and scenic sojourn of a family's joys and sorrows solid five stars \"you are not in this life to count up victories and defeats you are in it to love and be loved you are loved with your head down you will be loved whether you finish or not say 'i'm a pussy ass pussy motherfucker '","1321":"hard going and at times i didn't think i'd be able to finish it but ultimately beautiful honest and completely devastating","1322":"good family sagai love a novel about families and the dynamics that occur within this book is long but it will make you examine your own family experience and appreciate what you have when i completed the book i wanted to kiss my husband and my children and tell them how much they have blessed my life","1323":"this book swept me along on a journey that was inexorable u0026amp poignant i loved it","1324":" had i known what this book was really about and it seems disingenuous that the publishers seem to have gone to great lengths to conceal that spoiler alert it's about early onset alzheimer's i probably wouldn't have read it the book isn't a total downer but i did find it a bit of a slog getting through the book's 620 pages although many individual scenes were quite lovely ultimately i'm glad i prevailed but found it hard to relate to the three lead characters especially son connell who seems like an utter sh thead one moment and then just a conflicted 'normal' teen the next","1325":"wow i loved this book so much reminds you to appreciate those you care about the salk things that make you happy and not to take any of it for granted in my very humble opinion a beautifully articulated novel about the human condition that deserves to be read","1326":"well written first novel by the author thomas tells the story of one family's rise from poverty and the pride and heartbreak that come as a result at first i felt that the author took too long to drive home many of his points but then i realized he took the time he needed to in order to present a clear picture of the characters' lives i saw myself in the story of the learys and grew to fear the darkness that crept into their lives great book","1327":"it took about 100 pages to get into the book all this was to set up the characters but it dragged a bit after that the tempo picks up and its becoming a great read i keep wanting to turn the page to find out what is next love the characters at one point and then start hating them then love them again this book is just real life","1328":"4 5 stars this book was not particularly exciting or suspenseful it felt so ordinary yet it was its ordinaryness that really captivated me tragedy strikes ordinary people ordinary people can't catch a break ordinary people make really bad decisions etc i'm not really one for long drawn out stories without a lot of action but this book just struck me it was equal parts frustrating enlightening and heartbreaking i felt like the novel depicted consumerism really well too well as i just wanted to shake the main character at times and tell her to appreciate her life but i was really captivated by the details depicting illness and what it's like for an entire family to experience the lengthy illness of one family member i think people are impacted differently by particular novels depending on their life experience current life events and this one just clicked for me i loved it my very favorite line in the book this was life you went down with the ship who was to say that wasn't a love story","1329":" had i realised the book was about alzheimer's i wouldn't have started reading it's about a very normal life of a woman born in late 40s could be my mother basically so you know something dramatic will happen because it can't just be about the day to day which tediously a lot of it is about 30% in i figured out the alzheimer's but still takes another 20% for the characters in the book to work it out then there is the slow sad humiliating decline to an identity lost and finally death which mercifully in this book didn't take too many years a process i've seen with my grandparents and expect to see with my parents i'm not interested in fiction about it i finished the book so it can't have been all bad but i didn't enjoy it sad and meaningless yeah next time i'll check reviews before buying to not be fooled again edit thinking more on why i read the whole book it offered a view of a rather mundane normal uneventful life where despite some hardship everything will be fine and that's a comforting read","1330":"this is a great book it has great characters and deals with a serious and heartbreaking subject thomas also works in some baseball which is always a plus i heartily recommend this book","1331":"this book started off slow and i thought several times reading that it would be a slow dull read however this book kept me reading and towards the end had me so emotional i had to take breaks so i wouldn't cry it's a long read but worth every page","1332":"really terrific character study of a family primarily focused on an irish catholic working class woman who grows up marries and raises her own son in new york the final third of the book is devastating as she weathers a family tragedy in an utterly realistic and moving way i couldn't put it down","1333":"a 600 page character driven novel about eileen the daughter of irish alcoholics edmund her researcher husband and connell their son as they each travel through the triumphs and challenges of life we come understand each character at a deep psychological level sometimes the reader laughs with them and at other times we are frustrated by the limitations they place on themselves the story is epic in nature taking place over 60 years i enjoyed reading we are not ourselves taken from king lear and became engrossed in the characters' lives but felt that some of the episodes did not move my understanding of the protagonists further along and could have been excised making the novel more tightly scripted","1334":"i thought this book was ok i was not particularly drawn to the characters especially the main character eileen who was a child of irish immigrants who you would think would have a higher tolerance for other nationalities but she was actually quite racist that aspect of the book was a little unsettling for me this book has alot going on in it it touches on alcoholism fertility miscarriages gambling and a lot on dementia and the affect it has on the family but if that doesn't sound like enough most of the story was about eileen trying to get the one thing a house in bronxville that would make her happy or so she thought she was chasing the happiness on the outside instead of looking on the inside the writing style was different it took a little bit to get use too it and the pacing of the story was up and down there was long stretches where it was boring sadly this is not a book that i will be recommending to anyone","1335":"thank you net galley for advance copy i really enjoyed this book its about a coup e eileen and ed whom seem to want the same things in the beginning but everything ed did was wrong to eileen she was upset he didn't want a better home car and job she whined so much about poor me ughh it was most likely more annoying for ed they had a son named connell ed was a wonderful father to connell i thought eileen was a little cold but the more i read into her background an own family life she was pretty much a replica of her own mother she really didn't know how to be any other way them an illness strikes which changes eileen drastically not saying who but this is highly recommended to read very thought provoking into what you may think is important but really is not i think matthew thomas is going to have great success with this book","1336":"i hesitated in giving this book a low rating as the author deserves more for his inarguable writing ability i just was not in the right frame of mind for a long drawn out tale about how life can be simultaneously ordinary hard tragic and disappointing","1337":"way too long the book is about a middle class family that just seems to fall on hard times the want for more makes eileen a sad character she loves her husband ed but is often troubled by his mundane approach to life when he develops alzheimer's in his fifties her life spirals out of control with taking care of him money issues stress of her nursing job the health care system and the ups and downs of raising their son connell really a depressing book","1338":"this was one of the worst books i ever read it was too long and drawn out the story never went anywhere do not waste your time reading this book i kept thinking something was going to happen but it never did this book was filled with too many mundane details of life that didn't allow me to escape the way a good book should","1339":"encapsulates experience of life the ups and downs losses expectations and disappointments beautiful writing","1340":"immersed myself in the lives of this family very thought provoking what does life have in store for any of us and our families this story will stay with me for quite some time will definitely lend this to family and friends","1341":"a little too long but i enjoyed it nothing seems to be happening in these people's lives but it was easy to get emotionally involved with them the ending is perfect","1342":"i'll start my review with a few of the quotes that touched me on some level \"when life seems too cruel and there seems too little love in it when you feel you have failed when you don't know what the point is when you cannot go on i want you to draw strength from me then i want you to remember how much i cherished you how i lived for you when the world seems full of giants who dwarf you when it feels like a struggle just to keep your head up i want you to remember there is more to live for than mere achievement it is worth something to be a good man it cannot be worth nothing to do the right thing \" she saw that there was something perfect about the imperfection of her husband her mortal living husband with his excessive vigilance about the effects of capitalism and his unmistakable pair of bowed legs that she watched carry him forward she kept her eyes on his shoes hitting the pavement and let him guide her wherever he was going she could tell he felt guilty but his guilt wasn't just about not being there it was also about not feeling more guilty about not being there i want my presence in your life when i am gone to be a hand on the shoulder not one around the throat but if these things are important to you then they are important to me to precisely that extent i want you to remember me but only if you want to remember me if the kid didn't handle it well well that was what kids did they went out too often they stayed out too late they said things that cut to the quick they forgot responsibilities they broke your heart years later they thought about it all and what did parents do they saw more clearly than their kids did they forgave their kids even if they didn't say so even if they couldn't say so they did whew this is one of those rare books that truly surprised me even taking my breath away in places the first half i found myself reading through at a fairly leisurely pace enjoyable and keeping my interest with some amazingly well written passages throughout i was glad to be reading on my kindle because there were so many passages i wanted to highlight for later and also because i actually had to periodically look up the meaning of some of the words i want to point out that in the latter case it wasn't at all a matter of the writer use stultifying vocabulary on the contrary his word choice was in every case contextual perfection and i am always open to finding a book that's not only entertaining but challenging and has the added bonus of increasing my very average vocabulary we are not ourselves seemed at first to be a period novel that read somewhat like a family saga memoir it's divided into parts based on ranges of years in the main character's eileen childhood through adulthood it's mainly told form eileen's perspective but then it morphs into an engaging story of a marriage with all its everyday situations but mixed in throughout with brutally honest descriptions of eileen's her husband's and her son's points of view with lengthy meaty expressions of each person's thoughts and feelings in multiple scenarios over a long time period as the story wound its way through the years it became for me an absolute page turner and one of those stories that despite its already impressive length and breadth i did not want to end i found myself in complete empathy and sympathy even physically in tears in many places the characters in every single situation and scene were so honestly and realistically and most importantly humanly developed and engaging that i felt i knew each one intimately in the last third of the novel the plot became a type of love story almost scarily realistic sad and completely relateable and true to life between a mother and son a father and son but most of all between a husband and wife working through one of the most difficult and heartbreaking trials i think families ever have to face the novel was so beautifully and so thoughtfully detailed and written vividly illustrating so many of the feelings whether lovely everyday or incredibly ugly that we all have in our family life and relationships but that we also all too often keep to ourselves until sometimes it's too late i came away with the reminder that there isn't always a happy ending but love always remains this is one that left me with much to think about and a reminder that life is indeed fleeting","1343":"i love the first section of this book but struggled to finished it the characters were so unappealing u0026amp the view of them was really one dimensional at times some parts if the books felt like a series of events unconnected in the sense that you got little sense of there impact on the character or their choices for me it was overrated","1344":"didn't like the characters especially eileen it's hard to find sympathy for someone who makes such bad selfish decisions when there is obviously something seriously wrong with her husband her concern with material things and impressing others really annoyed me","1345":"heartbreaking","1346":"gut wrenching in parts an honest look at a life lived a long read but i recommend it","1347":"a truly perfect book that oozes humanity and is a sheer delight to read it is a page turner it has been a long while since this mom of two has been able to read 250 pages in one sitting but once thomas draws you into eileen's world it is hard to escape thomas' incredible command of language is awe inspiring it is rare that a writer with such skill and mastery can produce a work that is also so accessible it almost wouldn't matter what subject thomas wrote about as he has such talent but lucky for us he writes what we pine to read about love loss heritage family aspiration intimacy identity he covers it all he elevates the everyday and gives us insight into such an assortment of characters and experiences with such depth and warmth the intimate and raw look into alzheimer's and the ramifications for family and friends is brutally honest and eye opening the book is as heartbreaking as it is inspiring it is an honor and a pure joy to read this work get ready for an epic journey","1348":"i really wanted to love this book but it seemed to drag on in places especially the middle of the book the majority of the story takes place after eileen marries ed eileen wasn't always happy with ed because he was never there always at the lab working on research or later on teaching she wanted more a bigger better house to travel i can't say too much without giving the ending away but eileen soon finds out how little all the material things matter would i recommend this book maybe i didn't hate it the epic description on the book jacket should be changed to 200 pages too long","1349":"this review has been hidden because it contains spoilers to view it click here this book was incredibly well

falls in love with a scientist who is quite different from the boys she has ever known we are not ourselves tells the story of their relationship over the next few decades -- a recurring theme in my 2015 favourites more than that though it's a chronicle of a changing country and of that often elusive american dream thomas's novel is slow moving at times but thoughtful beautiful and sad","1351":" pg 88 asking myself what is the book about the only quote i noted as memorable \"negative thoughts back you into a corner they multiply and surround you don't think of what you don't have try to focus on the simple pleasures \"600 pages is a lot of book for just three characters and for the first 100 pages i continually asked myself what is the point however i continued on and found myself becoming emotionally invested in eileen ed and connell i got angry with them i laughed at them i rooted for them and felt sorry for them i want to say they define dysfunctional family but self absorbed may be a better definition of each of them in the end i was glad i finished the book","1352":" really 3 5 an epic story of an irish family though it spans the last five decades of the twentieth century there is very little mention of momentous events from those years save a brief mention of john f kennedy's assassination an important event in this irish catholic family instead we see the day to day life of eileen and ed leary and their son connell the striving of eileen for the betterment of her family the passion of ed for science and teaching connell's troubles as an adolescent and young adult a move from queens to the suburbs money worries the novel bogs down in places especially at the beginning about a third into the book we begin to see events taking place that lead to momentous changes in all their lives it's a story of an ordinary family grappling with forces beyond their control but it's also a poignant love story","1353":"it was a bit longer than it needed to be but i couldn't put it down","1354":"a family saga grounded characters dealing with everything from the mundane and everyday to the worst possible problems","1355":"i'm not sure why i felt the need to finish this book it was a drag i kept thinking it would get better but it never did the epilogue contained entire paragraphs yes several that were nothing but lists of baseball statistics we are not ourselves is an appropriate title the characters aren't even real people and we certainly don't care anything about them","1356":"i found myself getting irritated and losing patience with the main character during the first part of the book but it ended up being a good read","1357":"this book was a tough one for me it was long and at times felt as if it was going nowhere so why did i give it 4 stars despite my struggles with the novel it was extremely well written and the story had me questioning my goals and dreams as well as how i would handle certain situations in my own marriage to me that's the mark of a great book","1358":"spoiler alert i didn't know the husband in the story was suffering from alzheimer's my mom just died and likewise she had been suffering for a few years so this story was very relatable to me","1359":"yawn frank mccourt has done this story better","1360":"this review has been hidden because it contains spoilers to view it click here having watched and experienced the sadness of watching two people i love die from the curse that is alzheimer's this book was raw emotion but truly handled in honesty and love the ending good connor good","1361":"while the subject matter was heart wrenching the fact that i ran through over 600 pages in 6 days speaks to how riveting and well written this book is","1362":"this book started out strong for me interesting characters interesting dialogue but somewhere along the way it failed to hold my interest it seemed to take so long to develop and i became somewhat bored","1363":"a heartbreaking wonderfully written story about escaping your past and then finding the strength to deal with an unexpected turn in the road","1364":"best book i've read this year hands down it reminds me of all of those great sprawling books from about ten years ago like the fortress of solitude and middlesex p s it would be much better to go into this not knowing anything about the plot","1365":"it was excellently written but i hated the characters and therefore thought it was about 200 pages too long i'm not sure what was more depressing the subject matter or knowing that thomas so accurately depicted how people act in emotionally trying situations","1366":"so beautifully written it is hard to believe it is a first novel heartbreakingly detailed depiction of the effects on the diseased and others in his life of early onset alzheimer's disease characters are flawed yet sympathetic","1367":"very very long wordy and depressing","1368":"disappointed with this book although beautifully written from a lexical point of view the plot line was erratic and slow i had to force myself through the first 51% of the book to only really enjoy the last half although there were a few interesting parts in the first half it was entirely too wordy and unnecessary i would have been much happier with just the latter part of the novel overall i would not recommend","1369":"matthew thomas writes beautifully some passages in this book expressed brilliant insights into human nature and relationships that were positively heart squeezing i can't quite give it 5 stars because i think it might have been better if it was a little shorter it felt a bit bogged down and repetetive in places","1370":" slice of life literary fiction thomas's first novel follows the life of eileen tumulty leary from her childhood in queens ny to her early widowhood the book opens in the 1951 eileen is 10 years old and the only child of irish immigrant parents the family is working class and both of her parents have problems with alcohol eileen takes care of her parents from an early age and while this makes her a dedicated work it also inspires her dream of leaving the city behind and one day owning a beautiful house in the suburbs she marries ed leary a fellow irish american of working class parents and they settle into married life in jackson heights ed is a scientist and professor but he doesn't have any greater ambitions that teaching at community college and working on government research grants after several years of childlessness the learys have a son in their late 30s which makes eileen yearn even more for luxury in the suburbs after ed's initial resistence the learys move to bronxville in the early 1990s shortly afterwards ed is diagnosed with early alzheimer's and begins a sad decline initially i wasn't very impressed with the novel but after about a third of the way through i couldn't wait to keep reading thomas's style is very similar to alice mcdermott in fact the beginning was too similar for me or jonathan franzen and his book will appeal to readers who enjoy those authors the sense of place jackson heights bronxville is masterful and the prose is simple direct and moving the slow decline of ed from alzheimer's and eileen's efforts to care for her husband are heartbreaking the story is told from the third person perspectives of both eileen and her son connell and it is through the two people who love him the most that the reader discovers the character of ed at slightly over 600 pages this is a long novel the first part seemed to drag a bit and there could have been some judicious editing the chapters are relatively short and the pacing never stagnates the characters are realistic and eileen is a tough resilient every woman while still being a very specific individual i found the character of connell petulant and self involved which was the point and could have done with less time spent with him this book has gotten a lot of buzz and i can envision it becoming a modest hit","1371":"this review has been hidden because it contains spoilers to view it click here it is difficult to believe that we are not ourselves is matthew thomas' first the story centers around

see glimpses of something coming apart within ed as connell readies for high school and eileen insists on a move to suburbia ed becomes unable to function as a teacher and eileen insists they see a doctor i was unprepared for the diagnosis of early onset alzheimer's thinking it was mental illness not good but not a death sentence from this point on the book deals with ed's deterioration and how eileen and connell cope in the end it is a love story the love between husband and wife father and son the varied emotions they feel toward are expressed realistically and moved me on several occasions it's difficult not to compare this book to lisa genova's still alice i found we are not ourselves delves more into the economic realities and burden of caring for someone long term a beautiful and heart breaking novel more","1372":"this review has been hidden because it contains spoilers to view it click here for a book i wasn't even sure i would finish this ended up being better than i expected in the second half the touching depiction of alzheimer's brought me to tears","1373":"phenomenal book about the immigrant experience in ny loved it","1374":"a disturbing but very credible account of early onset alzheimer's unfortunately eileen the wife is not clear cut her persona seems to shift and the narrator's summary of her and her feelings doesn't seem consistent with what we previously learned about her","1375":" with only hours left on the non renewable library loan i managed to finish this epic family saga spanning from the 1940s to around 2000 and an epilogue set in 2011 the slow quiet pace of the non emotive story telling of the first half of the book reminded me a lot of stoner a small nuclear family descendants of irish immigrants and their life in post war new york are described in everyday details with a fraught sometimes loveless marital relationship at the core that gets repeated in the next generation eileen leary nee tumulty has aspirations to move upwards socially and financially whereas her husband ed is modest and content without m any ambitions and simply tries to do what is right in his academic profession and by his family their son connell is caught in the middle the second half of the novel reminded me inevitably of view spoiler still alice as we learn of eileen's husband's early onset alzheimer's his curtailed academic career and the effect this horribly cruel disease has on his family hide spoiler and other books of that ilk family dynamics and circumstances change dramatically and the story becomes much more emotional even heart breaking at times whilst i am a sucker for details and well written dialogue i did feel that the book would have benefitted from losing at least a hundred pages cut from drawn out descriptions superfluous scenes too much baseball for starters and repetitive conversations however for a more patient reader than myself this may not be an issue at all overall i thoroughly enjoyed the story and the writing and i believe that the characters their choices and fates as well as flaws and qualities will stay with me for a long time the sign of a very good read","1376":"original source of my reviewwe are not ourselves is an epic of small events david l ulin of the la times writes by that i don't mean its story is insignificant but quotidian the particular struggles of the day to day this book in short is a middle class assimilation story eileen tumulty has had an unfortunate childhood forced into the role of caretaker by her alcoholic parents all she wants is to get out get married and leave all that behind her soon she meets ed and they settle down together but eileen's hunger for the good life is not satisfied she finds herself always yearning for a more lavish lifestyle while ed insists on a modest one warning this book is sad it is very sad it was difficult to read the last 33% of the pages but the plot was just engaging enough that i couldn't just give up i owed it to the full characters the decadent but somehow concise prose the overall craftsmanship of the novel to finish and i'm glad i did i came away with the feeling that we are not ourselves is more than just a powerful story it's an important story that needed to be told no matter how sad if reading it made me uncomfortable then i was supposed to be there are different types of sad though there's good sad which leaves the reader with a happy aftertaste and there's sad sad which is kind of depressing and kind of beautiful at the same time this is the second kind of sad thomas switches between narratives to tell the story but uses mostly eileen's voice and never ed's which was a small bit frustrating because we never get to see what's going on in his mind what he's thinking his rationalization behind certain actions that is how eileen was feeling as well so the choice adds a layer of sympathy it also takes place over the course of an entire generation the pacing is unconventional though and skims over years at a time to focus on key moments in eileen's family life i was happy to find that it takes place in and around manhattan looking back i can see the events in the novel with more clarity while i was reading everything seemed like the worst thing ever i do have a tip for readers who want to take on thomas go back and read the one page prologue after you finish the book things i didn't like i'm not going to be all praise i had some deeply fundamental problems with we are not ourselves one of them is eileen poor ignorant eileen she seems to be under the impression that if she can just have a nice picket fence house that she will be happy why does she think this i do not know sure she worked her way up from a working class home eyes on the american dream but once she breaks through into the middle class and finds a partner who actually lives up to her impossibly high standards she is never content the more eileen reached for a nice home and stable job the more frustrated i got to the point where in the last few sections i could not sympathize with her anymore the other bigger problem i have is with thomas's depiction of the younger generation alright time to crack my knuckles and get down to it i am 20 years old i am in college and heavily reliant on my family for monetary support yeah i said it want to know why i am entirely 100% sure that at the level of quality education my university offers i cannot hold down a job in addition to being a full time student student life is hard enough and i barely find a way to get by as it is my mental health is a very fragile thing as several of my professors can attest to now here's how matthew thomas describes young adolescents the group as a whole ungrateful entitled this younger generation has no respect irresponsible unable to give anything up for what is morally right especially connell who knows that what he's doing is the wrong thing but he's just too damn stubborn to stoop down and help out this frankly is utter crap considering just last weekend was the project for awesome where hundreds of young adults advocated for and participated in activist movements i know that there is so much good in my peers we can we have made a difference for the positive it makes me so sad to see this book filled with so much condescension yeah we're pretentious little shits i get that but we're not bad people and we do know right from wrong it's not like after the age of 30 you suddenly stop making mistakes it's just that the mistakes you make in your 20s have a greater impact for some reason","1377":"could have been done in half the chapters but very well written","1378":"tried to get into this depressing story but finally gave up","1379":"oh my goodness i don't understand how this book hasn't created more buzz absolutely loved it and it will stay with me for years to come such beautiful writing","1380":"this book made me create a did not finish shelf","1381":"this book was a tough read because of the subject matter it also went on about 50 pages too long if you are looking for happy and uplifting this is not the book","1382":"it reminded me of a tree grows in brooklyn but with much less likable characters","1383":"the characters seem real liked it doesn't really explain it's a beautifully written heartbreaking book that had me completely absorbed when i was hoping for some light ya fluff","1384":"a character driven story of a life lived it is so real that at times it is painful in the tides of a lifetime the ebbs and flows move us not always in the direction we want to go this novel paints that journey beautifully","1385":"well for most of this book i would have given it 3 stars i just so intensely disliked most of the characters but in the end the quality of the writing won me over if not the characters i found myself tearing up toward the end it's a pretty impressive debut novel i look forward to his second","1386":"a book about a whole lot of nothing i kept wondering what's the point here well maybe if your life is afflicted by alzheimer's you can relate to this book towards the beginning i wanted to slap that neurotic ed upside the head many a times and then that woman eileen all she did was buy things and spend money the whole time and here i am 9 years onto my new house still trying to afford a new bedroom set that and putting up with that mess ed letting his quirks boss her around","1387":"this review has been hidden because it contains spoilers to view it click here a long story the life of eileen leary irish american new

throughout to see in ed a man who was worthy of the love and commitment he inspires in both his wife and son but eileen is a complex everywoman who carries this american tale more","1388":"i liked this more and more as i read stylistically it doesn't dazzle you but it captures the essence of things which is that life involves suffering that people are not perfect and that it is better to love them despite their imperfections thomas does an excellent job with his characters they are flawed but still deeply sympathetic","1389":"it's a gorgeous book the details and the pain of relating to ones parent s as an adult so vivid and true i loved so much of it though it didn't affect me in the same visceral way as still alice did i drew a lot from my own personal experience my mothers mother has alzheimer's and its a wicked dreadful disease a lovely book would recommend","1390":"this was an incredibly powerful yet quiet book i didn't always like the main character eileen but i applaud how deeply i felt i knew her and the rest of her family this was a beautifully written novel","1391":"brilliant i rarely give five stars but this one is definitely that rare book worthy i didn't hesitate to rate this wonderful book five stars","1392":"the story is great albeit sad i have it three stars because the description was just too thick and detailed that what could have been said in one sentence was described in a long paragraph","1393":"thomas delivers a straight foward review of one american family growing through life's dreams u0026amp adversities the characters depict the emotional dramas within us all yet individually face one of the most daunting challenges of life alzheimers disease","1394":"great book and a must read for those of us who have witnessed the devastation caused by dementia or alzheimers it is a story of love loss loyalty and strength","1395":"beautifully written heartfelt description of yearning for a better different life and how life comes full circle","1396":" i did not really know much about this book when i purchased this book in chicago but it appeared to have some interesting story about how an ailment can change things a relationship life indeed the first part was quite engrossing as i did not really know where it was going but the second half or so after the diagnosis the story focused more on the hardships and care taking sacrifices etc which was a bit less engrossing but of course very real life the female character is very materialistic and status seeking so a bit off putting to me i could tell that this book was written by a man based upon certain details a fine read but not one of my favorites","1397":"interesting story absorbing quick read","1398":"i found this book to be dark and disturbing it is well written seemed as if the author had lived through the destruction of alzheimer's i can't say i liked any of the characters but had some hope at the end","1399":" we are not ourselves is the most depressing book i have ever read it makes the road by cormac mccarthy look like a fun light read i guess it is an accurate portrayal of the lives 90% of all americans lead we long for things we do not currently have and once we finally achieve receive them they do not bring us the happiness we have longed for mare winningham is the perfect voice of eeyore i mean eileen enveloping the listener in a fog of disappointment the fact that matthew thomas could evoke such a state of depression in me as i listened to the book should warrant a higher rating but i just detested eileen and her son connell there are events in the book that are not fully fleshed out unless the intent was to provide another x100 example of complete futility all i can say is throw the damn knife away","1400":"this book is wonderful you truly feel that you are a part of the characters lives and do not want it to end i'm glad i picked up this boom as recommended by buzz read feed in one of the 30 books to read when you've lost all hope on humanity you must read this book well worth the almost 700 pages","1401":"i really liked this book more after reflecting on it after i finished it than as i was reading it great character development","1402":"i am somewhat conflicted about this book the writing was enjoyable and characters well written it is a family saga and eileen the main character is from working class nyc irish roots she is a striver and really wants to make something of herself the book has a point to make about you don't know what you have got until it is gone which is very true but i did find her and her son connell somewhat obtuse regarding the family situation and how they responded to it all in i enjoyed but also the middle to latter half can be somewhat depressing but am glad i read it","1403":"this is a close look at an irish immigrant family living in new york it begins in the 1940s and focuses mainly on the daughter in the family at a young age she takes on the responsibility of caretaker of her alcoholic dysfunctional parents and though she tries to make a better life for herself she spends most of her life taking care of others she works as a nurse and ends up as her husbands primary caretaker when his health deteriorates while i felt the story was overly long and dragged in some places it was interesting in the way it was told from all three perspectives of the wife the husband and their son their reflections and actions gave great glimpses in to the character and the emotional life of each one as they faced life struggles there were also a lot of interesting social references that brought to life each time period from the 40s through the 2000s it was definitely an interesting read","1404":"an absolutely superb read","1405":" i'm waffling between three and four stars the author is definitely a talented writer and the characters well developed but it took me two months to finish this novel finishing eight other books during that time this one just dragged on and on as it is a family saga with no real plot and i just kept putting it down for a while to take a break from the dull tedious lives of the family that said i do believe the author really creates an honest portrayal of this small family as it meanders through life the main character eileen is not especially endearing but she felt very real to me even if i didn't necessarily like her much her devotion to her husband was admirable given the circumstances i would like to give this one 3 5 stars but b c goodreads doesn't allow me that 1 2 star i will settle on 3 mainly because i don't see this book as one i would go out of my way to recommend to any of my friends as most just don't have so much time to devote to a single book my mother enjoyed it but being retired she has a lot more time on her hands than my friends who are knee deep in parenting and working had it been more engrossing the length of the book wouldn't be a turn off i will however keep an eye out more books from this author as i would like to give him another try in the future","1406":"the poignancy of the story is memorable in a way that lifts your spirits while at the same time smacks you in the face as to life's harsh realities the simplicity in thomas's writing brings out the raw nature of the experiences of the leary family thomas does not dwell in sympathy nor overly dramatize the emotions of the main characters which makes this story so believable","1407":"very good a little too long but like it","1408":" this was a fantastic novel it is honest heartbreaking and evocative i have found myself putting it down just to mull over what i have read it is the kind of novel that puts your life into perspective in a different way it says that we are all going to make choices we are all going to make mistakes and most importantly we are all going to face things we never expected and most of us come out the other side i couldn't give it a five because there were many moments i felt sad and i didn't want to feel sad","1409":"it's a long book but the second half is brilliant and worth getting to i could not put it down excellent character development no punches pulled emotionally loved it","1410":" www shelfnotes com3 5 5dear reader this book was good but not excellent not life changing or world revealing or anything just a good solid family history some tough but important parts about alzheimer's it was interesting how the story began from eileen's pov way early but perhaps the author needed to explain why she became a nurse how her life turned out as it did and why she had such aspirations for her son the theme of the book seemed very generational it was very much story based rather than point based this was the story of eileen and her legacy and that was pretty much it no lessons to be learned except maybe to love what you have while you still have it and no real takeaway although it is also a story i know i will remember for quite a while this book recalled to me something more along the lines of an irving or franzen novel with its sweeping storylines that didn't focus too tightly on any one time of anyone's life for too long i enjoy those books but i never know what i am taking away from them it feels often to me more like i am a voyeur in someone else's life than i am learning from the experience of standing in their shoes for a while i think i prefer the latter sorts of books for the most part but the author wrote his characters' inner thoughts and motivations beautifully and so effortlessly which i think won my heart in the long run mare winningham narrated the audiobook surprisingly that was a nice bonus and i think her voice fit eileen's story and personality really well excellent casting overall i think i would recommend this book but i doubt i could vocalize why i think it was a worthwhile way to spend my reading time is all i can say yours ariannap s i also really do love the cover art the way it throw suburbia and the american dream on its side literally much like the book","1411":"there is so much to gain from reading this book the relationships of husband and wife during illness the onset and progression of a horrific disease the challenge of youth to get through adolescence and young adulthood i enjoyed it all i have copied ed's letter to his son priceless sentiments life is more than a tally of victories and defeats","1412":"a very powerful story of a family of irish immigrants who settled in queens ny during the 40s it is the story of the young daughter eileen tumulty it is the story of her passage through life her marriage to edmund leary and the growth of their son connell i was a little wary of reading this book at this time because i was aware that alzeimers would play a significant role in the story recently i had finished reading lisa genova's two books still alice and inside the o'briens and yet i was fascinated that this was the first published novel by matthew thomas and because i understood that it took him 10 years to write this book although the book is over 600 pages you will find it difficult to put down all of us will at one time or another face the life altering decisions that the leary's will face many of you may have already had to make some of the same responses to these situations","1413":"almost a four star book but boy oh boy this book needed some judicious editing it could have been so much better even engrossing if it were tighter i understood eileen maybe not liked her maybe don't identify with her but i got her dreams and pretensions never really got her son full of local to queens references","1414":"i'm surprised at how well reviewed this one is structurally it was a mess which is something i only really notice when a book is truly unbalanced some of the writing was effective the descent of alzheimer's was truly painful but i didn't enjoy it overall","1415":" it took me longer than any other book to finish this one but i am in the middle of a move and a super stressful time in life which is kind of funny because otherwise i'd probably find the story incredibly depressing but instead i enjoyed coming back to a chapter or two every time i had a chance maybe it was for the better that i couldn't finish large parts of it one sitting it felt more like episodes i got to know this family and i am glad i was finally able to finish it i loved the writing style from the start","1416":"very real and flawed characters wordy but really came together in the end in a subtle and beautiful way","1417":"an interesting thought provoking story an honest almost sparse writing style that at times slowed the pace of the story a bit but it picked up as the characters evolved i didn't love any of the characters particularly but i did enjoy following them through life's challenges a story of a family but also of each individual and how each individual deals with life good read i really like the layer of meaning added by the title it has multiple meanings here it certainly relates to each of the main characters but in different ways and in different ways at different stages of their lives it also relates to the choices they make and how they reflect their selves or desires to appear a certain way","1418":" i vacillated between loving and being bored with this book eileen's life seemed to drag on with so much description of every little thing i put it down for a while and afterward it took on so much more meaning for me matthew thomas gets deep into the mind of each character and you find yourself relating to them and recalling stages of your own life so very impacting for me life is beautiful we are all so complicated unique yet the same and we would all do better if we could remember this","1419":"i had a hard time getting into this book at first but soon found that i could not put it down","1420":"so well done similar memories of my fathers battle with alzheimer's made for a read that helped with some peace on decisions made at the time","1421":"this book makes you examine your own life it focuses on the essential elements of life that matter","1422":"well written story of a family's life and struggles i read it in 2 days i loved the characters","1423":"this book was wonderful i loved every second of the detail and the specificity of language created pure feelings of disgust unease and hopelessness while also providing pure forms of contentment naivete and warmth the sinking feeling that filled me as we learned more and more of ed's symptoms made me almost relieved to hear his diagnosis and the beautiful narrative made it so easy to sympathize with eileen throughout the entire book all 612 pages brought me closer to her perspective and strengths and flaws and delights and i wanted her to triumph so freaking badly in short this book is worth the time if being surrounded in another person's complete and imperfect world for a while is worth the time it is it so is","1424":"beautifully written story with very interesting character development","1425":"not perfect but very very good","1426":"giving this four stars because it was incredibly well done but i wouldn't exactly recommend it because the subject matter was so sad and a bit excruciating","1427":"i listened to the audio cd read by mare winningham and really enjoyed this story i like long character driven stories and this is certainly more of a character study there were a few spots i found silly or that dragged but overall worth the read definitely chronicles the struggles of being human and making your way in this world","1428":"this book had potential to be good i seemed like a first draft which if the author kept working would turn into a good book the characters are not fully developed the plot is not really engaging if i had checked it out from the library i probably would not have finished it","1429":"the story was interesting but it could have been a 300 page book i don't like to not finish a book but boy was i tempted couldn't wait to finish it","1430":" this is a difficult novel to review given the varying degrees of interest i experienced at times i was thoroughly engrossed convinced this would live up to the hype other times the plot plodded along and i was left wondering why i needed to spend another second reading the novel but i trudged forward as i cannot stomach quitting this attitude has worked in my favor many times when as the last page is turned i sigh with a sense of not only perseverance but appreciation this happened here although i did not particularly like eileen tumulty leary i tried to stay in her head determined to understand her the novel character driven runs short on plot at times as others have pointed out characters introduced once or twice reappear hundreds of pages later it took me awhile to remember who virginia was for example yet the author's use of virginia as well as the development of eileen who at times appeared shallow and cold was to underscore the central question do we really ever know who we are or want out of life eileen's envy and slight obsession with virginia shows how eileen focused not on the riches in her own life but in what she appeared to lack as compared to others she never truly lived the life that she felt entitled to not being totally present in her life created a sympathy for her that i didn't expect to feel how sad to never be truly satisfied in the life you have and to feel 'we are not ourselves' but living another person's life eileen also raised ire in me when it was clear ed with his bursts of anger had alzheimer's well before she a nurse recognized it overall i felt pity for this character who was so wrapped up in her own needs that she failed i think to appreciate the life she did have overall i think the novel was interesting tragic plodding and at times overdone but i'm glad i read it","1431":" a trip through hell but well worth it as someone who has cared for the elderly particularly those with alzheimer's for 14 years this book really hit home just a few random observations parts of the book felt very tedious and sometimes repetitive i could be wrong but i think thomas was portraying what it feels like to care for someone with alzheimer's it is a hard and frustrating experience i really loved all the very small references each of the three main characters shared with one another i didn't really start to pick up on this until later and i'm sure there are tons i missed an example being the time ed goes to the museum and looks at a painting later in the book another character has a print of it in his room that's a basic example but there are tons of these instances among the protagonists","1432":" i have very mixed feelings about this one because there are so many books i want to read i have an arbitrary 100 page rule where if i'm not intrigued i stop and move on to a new book i was away on a business trio and did not have another book with me so i persevered through 300 pages nearly 50% before it really got my attention and even then the pace was too slow for my liking i think there are enough hopes and disappointments across the generations of my own family that i would rather escape into something else when i'm reading that said one part was incredibly moving so much that i was sobbing and its a rare book that can bring me to tears in public","1433":"the brilliant climax and emotional conclusion more than make up for a clunky first third centers on a very cold baby boom character struggling with real estate envy and race class tension but somehow becomes quite impossible to put down so smoothly and perceptively written with enough oddball twists in the second half that it is easy to forgive the author's annoying habit of explaining his own metaphors and occasionally trying a little too hard with some franzen esque inventories or stuff like the trees were bereft of leaves","1434":" this i just since most of what i say is sarcastic let me specify that i mean this sincerely in a more just and equal world a book that details the racism and materialism of white upwardly mobile 20th century new yorkers cum suburbanites might prove to be a really important cultural artifact but we're just not there yet i hate hating books for unlikeable characters but eileen is the worst fix your basement eileen for greater context i am a person who has a lot of sympathy for betty draper some of my best friends are white suburbanites they keep their basements in order though for comparison this is a good book for fans of stoner maybe if you thought stoner should be four times longer and that the character of stoner should have been replaced by the people in that dirtbag boomer meme now for the positives the earliest years of the book are bang on and mare winningham does a superb job of the audio narration four for you mare winningham and two for matthew thomas bye","1435":"for a debut novel this is quite good but there are several sections that would have benefited from a decent editor overall i enjoyed the book but i think it changed its mind mid way about what it wanted to be the first half is a textbook story about young people with big dreams living their lives and slowing changing expectations viewing the world through the eyes of an adult the second half however is a frank telling of living with a spouse father with a debilitating brain illness and what it does i lived through this and i would be shocked if the author did not if not well damn captured it perfectly all in not sorry i read it and i look forward to reading more from thomas but i truly believe his future works will be much better","1436":"i have wanted to read this book for a while and finally sat down to it over the holiday break the story follows one woman eileen and her family during the course of her entire life it deals with parents marriage career illness parenting and every important issue one manages within the course of a lifetime the characters and their actions are so real that i absolutely believed in them and the decisions that they made as a fan of escapism in literature i did find this stressful at times because the writing was entirely authentic and it was hard to separate the experiences of these characters from possibilities in my own life i recommend this book whole heartedly i received this from netgalley in exchange for an honest review","1437":"this book is beautiful pure poetry i wish i could write a better review but i'm too emotionally compromised at the moment","1438":"what i thought was going to be a saga of an irish american family in late 20th century nyc turned out to be a chronicle of a family struggling with alzheimer's disease the characters are few in number and reasonably well developed but there is no plot per se the events ensue nevertheless interspersed in the book are moments of poetic power and insight but much is written in pedestrian prose the book already too long was extended by the fullness and needlessness of some descriptions better editing might have made for a tighter piece it still moves along easily and somewhat predictably may be the reason the summaries that i read before i opened it made no mention of the alzheimer's so much for advertising","1439":"i found eileen and connell extremely unlikeable now that i am finished acting out my anger with eiileen and connell i am upgrading my review of this book that obviously gave me strong feelings to a 4","1440":"the scope of this book is so large it needs more than one rating sometimes i liked it sometimes i hated it but by the end i loved it so that is what i am going with if i reviewed it at different parts of the book it would be a 2 or 3 in the beginning a 1 or 2 in part 3 almost gave up on it it was so slow and irritating at times but it picks up and starts to come together and by the end i couldn't stop the writing and emotion so perfect as the story of this family is realized you can find plot summaries elsewhere so these are just my own thoughts opinions the book seemed more about love and relationships than anything else exploring the bonds between parents and children friends lovers community home the relationships between siblings strikingly are not addressed 2 of the 3 main characters are only children and ed's brother is barely mentioned upon consideration this must be deliberate and the absence of these relationships perhaps an important part of the story as well i am surprised that i enjoyed this book as much as i did considering i did not really find any of the characters particularly likable i could identify with the setting and the background of the characters nyc white irish catholic middle class but i found it hard to connect with the characters themselves and considering this novel is more about the characters than the plot this is huge the writing is so well done though that by the end i was able to see their strengths along with their flaws and like a family member accept them for who they were and to love them for it i am very glad i did not give up on this book it was a slow start well written but seemingly pointless for a good portion of the beginning after the diagnosis and the characters start dealing with what is going on you start to appreciate the nuance eileen's superficial materialism is balanced by her loving devotion ed's cold intellectualism is balanced by his loss of control and increased dependence and poor connell the heartbreak of his situation balanced by how selfish he can be at times though who can blame him life can be heartbreaking death is inevitable but love love makes it all worthwhile love always wins","1441":" this is one of the best books i've ever read in the beginning it kind of reminded me of a tree grows in brooklyn if you're old enough to remember that one you'll get what i mean but it grew into a modern day account of living with a man whose quirky personality morphs into alzheimer's and all of the attendant frustration confusion mishaps and heartache that that would entail there were times in my reading when i just had to put the book down not because it was boring as one reviewer said but because it was just too real i commend matthew thomas on writing an outstanding and unforgettable novel bravo","1442":"emotionally devastating but satisfying book can't believe it's his first published novel","1443":" this book requires patience and openness for entering deeply into the lives of a family it is a debut narrative fiction by the author matthew thomas it is not plot driven instead it is character driven completely out of my comfort zone as a read i decided to stick with it until the end and i am glad i did because the subtle changes that occur throughout the book draw you in and create almost a cocoon like experience for the reader at times a bit too much detail for my liking but still so brilliantly crafted i can now say that it was truly a masterpiece of dialogue and psychological insight","1444":"book club sheila","1445":"i found this heavy going i think this was because it was character driven as opposed to plot driven equally it was very gloomy reading as there seems to be little sense of hope or achievement throughout the entire novel you are led from alcoholism to drudgery miscarriage illness failed investments and so the list goes on and on yes i felt it was well written and think i only kept reading in the hope that something positive would eventually arise but unfortunately it never did","1446":"this book was recommended to me by two of my goodreads friends thanks bruno and thanks michael what a fantastic read the story was at times heartbreaking i'm not one to cry when reading but my eyes welled up a bit matthew thomas is a gifted writer and i look forward to reading his next novel i select this book as the best book of 2014","1447":" too long waaaay too long we are not ourselves a family saga of irish immigrants to queens nyc revolves around eileen leary put upon daughter of borderline poor alkie emotionally distant parents eileen who becomes a nurse believes movin' on up is the cure for all that ails her big surprise it isn't she's complex our eileen we'll give her that at times we can't stand her rigidity others we admire her steadfast compassion povs of hubby and son might've made this more compelling only not so much a roller coaster of yawn bo ring and oh wait this is interesting i'll stick with it to the very end 600 pages later probably shoulda put it down by the 400 page point","1448":"the end oh the end u0026lt 3","1449":"this review has been hidden because it contains spoilers to view it click here this book read like the sword of damocles literally every page was saturated with a sense of impending doom even before ed's diagnosis i think i'm probably hypersensitive the things i read always affect my mood and outlook so this was overkill for me 620 pages of just waiting for some kind of relief too much","1450":" i listened to this book on audio about 30 minutes each time i took the dog for a walk it's 22 hours in length i listened through the snowy days of april on in to the rainy days of may and june this is not a book with a deep plot and that lands somewhere satisfying at the end no this is a character driven book about eileen tumulty daughter of irish immigrants it's also the story of her parents her husband and her son you will walk with her through her childhood and end up in her old age you will discover as she did the power of love and what it can cause you to do you'll learn what matters and what doesn't i'm going to miss this family","1451":"very long but was intrigued from the first sentence and never lost my interest","1452":"this review has been hidden because it contains spoilers to view it click here i liked this book i did not love it i liked it i thought it was a bit long a bit too normal i get that was what the author wanted to convey but i thought it was a little over the top i know over the top in normalcy is an oxymoron but there you have it i really didn't like eileen i really really really really didn't like her i mean come on your husband has a mental illness and you are a nurse and you can't see that and you act like a total hag nope not realistic which grated i liked this book i did not love it i liked it i thought it was a bit long a bit too normal i get that was what the author wanted to convey but i thought it was a little over the top i know over the top in normalcy is an oxymoron but there you have it i really didn't like eileen i really really really really didn't like her i mean come on your husband has a mental illness and you are a nurse and you can't see that and you act like a total hag nope not realistic which grated me because the rest of the novel was so realistic more","1453":"as someone who has given up maybe ten books without finishing them ever in my entire life i feel like i'm getting better at it i abandoned the luminaries and now at 69% i'm abandoning this one it's not that i didn't like it that's not why i am abandoning it at least it's that i just can't think of anything that could happen in the last third of the book that would make me want to finish it there's just no rest of the book that i can imagine that would be something i want to read this book is long i don't object to long books on principle not in the least but this book feels long it's a slog and it's laden with totally unnecessary detail and i like detail i like backstory and small observations i'm not a particularly plot driven reader i don't think but this was just boring and even though there's this whole long epic life laid out i still felt like i don't really understand eileen at all this is all told in the third person and it's very tell y if that makes sense this happened and so eileen felt like this then this happened and so then eileen felt like that it never brought eileen alive for me so i never really cared much about her or for her for that matter she's kind of awful but despite all this detail the weird thing is that there's also all this stuff that gets mentioned sort of in passing and it seems really contrary to the experience i thought eileen was having eileen to me comes across as this really petty jealous grasping kind of woman who wants everything everyone else has and is really terribly bitter about the lot in life she's been stuck with she doesn't like her husband and all she seems to care about is getting this house to look good enough that she can show it off to other people and they will think she is rich off putting no but then there are all these little things that get dropped into the narrative like the fact that she works full time as a nurse and we never hear about it except in the most lightly touched on ways you'd think that would be a pretty formative part of one's identity but not here conceptually she would have to be a very capable and tough woman to have the professional position that she has in this book but she never ever comes across that way it's irritiating another example there's this random line at some point about how eileen ed and connell went to this beach house belonging to her old friend bethany a lot um ok that seems significant as for most of the book eileen seems terribly terribly lonely with no real friends at all and going off to visit a friend's beach house seems like exactly the kind of experience that she would want to have also after we find out what's going on with ed his mom dies what why have we not heard about her at all until this point when apparently he was making regular visits that also seems kind of important also i think it would be pretty hard to argue that there is any evidence that eileen likes ed he's presented as just one disappointment after another so lines like 'half of you is better than ninety percent of people with a whole brain' she said and was surprised to find she believed it i just didn't buy it it rang false there was also a lot of repetition in the book including this idea that ed gives into whatever she wants earlier than she expects i feel like this came up like six times and every time it was supposed to be revelatory and it just never felt that way or the idea that once she got x she could finally begin to really live her life that came up again and again and again and i get what the author was going for but it was just too heavy handed heavy handed was kind of the overarching problem for me there were a lot of grand pronouncements about people's lives and the things they carry and it just all was a little over the top huh i guess i liked this book less than i thought as i was reading it i really didn't stop because i disliked it so much i stopped because i just didn't care any more","1454":"this is a quiet thought provocing introverted book it took me a while to feel invested in it in the beginning which provides a lot of back story but once the main character became an adult i couldn't put it down it truly feels like you're dwelling in another person's mind","1455":"very well written it reminded me of colm toibin's writing style but i found the middle section was too slow and the son's story seemed to travel alongside the story of eileen and ed and ed's demise instead of intertwining with it the pace picked up in the end though overall an unsentimental and often touching portrayal of dementia","1456":" eileen tumulty grows up in a very dysfunctional household both parents are alcoholics and she dreams of the day she meets and marries the man that will take her out of the wrong side of town to the place with a white picket fence when she meets ed leary a scientist in grad school she thinks she has met the prince but ed has no ambition to get farther than he is and is very tight with money the first part of the book is all the first 25 years of their life together and goes quickly unfortunately i was not completely enthralled with this book as it seems everyone else is i thought it was ok but nothing special to me as i've said in past reviews it obviously is me because everyone else seems to have liked it i just didn't connect with the book but i am alone on that","1457":"this book was good well written but i expected a lot more more generational stories it really focused on one woman from her childhood to her middle age she was developed but i didn't think the other two main characters were it took me a while to get through it","1458":" eileen tumulty is a caretaker even as a child she takes care of her alcoholic parents when she is older she finds a man whom she believes will take care of her she is a realistic character who wants to better her situation unfortunately her husband ed is not as upwardly mobile as she is does he have a foreboding of what will happen to him that causes him not to go along with her plans she finally gets the house that she wants but things intervene and she is unable to attain all of her wishes","1459":"i had heard good things about this novel but i just couldn't get into it so i stopped reading i got frustrated with each of the characters for different reasons and the pace of the book was very slow","1460":"the core and most accomplished part of this novel lies in its second half the depiction of the onset progression and impact of a case of early onset alzheimer's disease on a family the first half tries to set up the character of the wife of the unfortunate man with dementia but is rather clumsily done hence the low rating the second half is reasonably well executed","1461":" i can see why many people ask that a reviewer not spoil the read by going into a lengthy review at best start the review with this is a spoiler i had a really hard time giving this a rating the audio version read by mare winningham is very good i don't think i could have stuck with the print the beginning history of eileen was interesting u0026amp encouraging since i knew someone who grew up in that very neighborhood u0026amp was curious if it would help me understand the culture u0026amp dynamics at some point i began to greatly dislike the woman u0026amp never gained respect for her yes it plods in minute detail often enlightening u0026amp sometimes one could see how she became the person she became she represented all the characteristics of bias typical of the era u0026amp culture i ended up loathing the woman u0026amp all she believed in by the 85th chapter i wondered how i could possibly see it to the end i'll give the author great credit for developing each character u0026amp writing about a living death everyone associated with it lives for me the best argument for compassionate death choices","1462":"this was a very good book about a family that spans generations it is a book about aspirations and about loss and about day to day life while coping","1463":"about 100 pages into this book i almost decided not to finish it i wasn't connecting with the characters and there isn't much plot to speak of i decided to give it one more chance though and glad i did the book has a lot of flaws it's very slow reading at times there are several events that don't really seem to be important or relevant to the book or the characters and eileen is just pitiable after ed develops alzheimer's though it gets much better having witnessed my own father's battle with this horrific disease i found the portrayal to be one of the most accurate i've experienced not only ed's experience but the experience of his caregivers i developed some empathy for eileen and some insight into what my mother must have experienced as she tried so hard to take care of this person she loved but who wasn't really there or was he anyway glad i finished the book in spite of its flaws","1464":" a very moving upsetting book about a family nearly broken by a personal tragedy as one of the characters says men react to personal loss differently from women men such as i do not want to know about pain suffering and loss i was made very uncomfortable by the story especially since it has the unmistakable characteristics of a true story not a purely fictional work of art that is some events are random some characters are too humanly weak or evade confronting their situations and some parts of the story have too many details i forced myself to continue reading because the characters are very real and their lives matter to me i understand the father the mother and their son and i feel their emotions and fear quite keenly the fact that both the father and mother are second generation irish immigrants initially drew my attention to this book but that fact fades into the background as the novel develops","1465":"my reaction to this book is has been overhyped as an epic about an irish american family the story centers on eileen tumulty who marries edmund leary they live in woodside queens and eventually have a son connell eileen is a nurse and ed is a scientist who teaches at bronx community college ed has few ambitions except to do his research eileen is upwardly mobile and this leads to conflict between the two although this is described as a novel about an irish american family the only thing irish about the learys are their catholicism and their surname it is a pretty ordinary story although later there are developments i won't detail that make it a sad story there was no reason in my opinion this had to be a 620 pages novel i really dislike this trend in publishing some may consider it a lack of editing i started listening to the audio which was well done by mare winningham but at 21 hours had to speed it up to 1 25 i had the whispersync feature and got through the second half by reading which went much much faster despite the quality narrative i started to enjoy the book more as a read book for that reason i upped my rating from 2 stars to 3 if you want to read something that is inexplicably long go for it this is not a novel with literary merit nor does it reveal much of anything about american life in the 20th century","1466":"i have to review this book before i go on to the next and have a hard time remembering what took place in this one mom brain gotta love it i am very sad to be finished with this book because i always feel like the characters become my good friend so anyway despite the fact that i know not how to properly review a book i'll make my best attempt at it i absolutely fell in love with all of these characters eileen ed and connell i connected with and even empathized with eileen and connell throughout different points in the story we all want to be successful we all want to be loved and we all wonder what if my life were different i loved reading each of their struggles and how they dealt with them and to quote forrest gump life is like a box of chocolates you never know what you're gonna get so true ed is an incredibly intelligent and successful man but alas he ends up with a crippling disease and is unable to continue on the path of his choosing eileen is a woman who is trying to break out of the life she was raised in like ed she attends college finishes and is a successful nurse but there's a feeling of what if that still haunts her everyday life she's a hard working loving mother and wife she leads a life that most people would envy yet she still longs for a different life she longs for more that is until her life is turned upside down by news of her husband's illness and connell dear sweet connell he is an awkward kid living within a forever changing and rough neighborhood he is like us all trying his best to fit in and find himself while trudging his way through school awkwardness finds us all at some point throughout adolescence connell is an honest and loving boy who tries his best to make good choices and please his parents i just loved this boy i guess what i loved the most about this book is how raw and real it is life isn't all about smelling the flowers and pretty pictures life is hard and life requires hard work the author did a tremendous job with this first book well done","1467":"this book went on for about 50 pages too long perhaps because i have to return it to the library tomorrow regardless it's a work of art sad funny frustrating and hit close to home the story of eileen who wants something better in her life and a marriage which sadly ends with alzheimer's disease third person limited perspective between eileen and her son","1468":"as singular complex and astonishing as the budding of a flower i read it and wept","1469":"i loved this book so much the characters the storyline it was all perfect wonderful book","1470":"i recently reviewed this book for wkar's current state you can listen to my review online here http wkar org post book review we a you can also read my book review below what makes a story engrossing is it a surprising plot a new twist or is it about the characters maybe a little quirk in their personalities that we find amusing is it an ability to see a bit of ourselves in the pages these are some of the questions i've been asking myself since reading we are not ourselves by matthew thomas this stunning first novel is very engrossing but i'm not sure exactly why truthfully based on just the description of we are not ourselves i wasn't certain how i'd feel about the book or if i even wanted to pick it up it sounded emotionally difficult and sad not exactly the best recipe for an evening's entertainment i love when i am proven wrong by an author and this was one of those magical moments ed leery has been diagnosed with alzheimer's disease over the course of this expansive novel we watch his struggles and decline through the eyes of his small family you see how it impacts his wife eileen and their son connell as he moves through his teenage and college years as his father's health deteriorates connell turns to bosses and teachers for advice and support instead of his dad during college he even avoids trips home to visit his father finding it just too hard like eileen you may be disappointed with connell and also completely understand every day in the leery household is a challenge and eileen who also works full time as a nurse won't truly get a moment to rest until ed's battle is finally lost we are not ourselves is a lesson in detailed character development and one i wish other authors would take the time to study these are not perfect people but they are true thomas has the patience to not just get in their heads but also to capture each and every little moment they experience during this difficult time in their lives most writers and editors would probably have skipped a few hundred of these pages but not thomas and his characters are richer for it it is a form of literary honesty and in today's publishing world it is rare and it is a gift we are not ourselves is not surprising we all know how a story like this is going to end but we are drawn along not for a desire to reach the conclusion but for the experience along the way and thomas makes this experience so very real that we feel every heartbreaking and fleeting day in its pages these are not just ed's last moments with his family but also his last moments with us so maybe the answer to my original question is something more elusive something less explainable heart it's obvious that thomas cares deeply for his characters in we are not ourselves and he wants us to feel that way too and maybe that is what a reader is feeling as he turns each page of this wonderful novel a bit of the lingering affection of the author himself","1471":"4 5 stars a very interesting character novel that spans such a time range that you can see how the values of the main character were created in her childhood i see elements of the story that i can empathize with from my own life one of my repeated memories from being a child and teenager is my mom driving around ritzy neighborhoods and commenting how can they afford these houses my grandfather had alzheimer's like ed and shared a name with him too i was surprised by eileen's reaction to her husband's disease for so long she was in denial and focused on getting that bigger house but when push came to shove i expected a different reaction than the one she ultimately took i liked how the book was a case study of this small family it could be just based on comparison but it seems like i have been reading books that rotate perspectives and don't really explore characters as deeply as this one i enjoyed that aspect but it might not be everyone's cup of tea particularly readers who must like the characters to read about them on the bright side it seemed like the three characters all experienced growth of some sort i enjoyed the epilogue the writing was very good beautiful but not pretentious what's holding me back from giving this one 5 stars i felt the story was too insular over 600 pages that focused on just three people with little regard for the other people in their lives was not realistic the novel named friends it stated that eileen had nightly conversations with friends but we didn't hear much in the way of that dialogue or even the impact those friendships had on her one would think that decades long friendships would have made some impact","1472":"beautifully written book","1473":"i wanted to like this book more than i did it felt like two separate books actually one the sweeping story of generations and the other a family dealing with alzheimers really felt like it could have been edited considerably and been a much better book","1474":"good story but way too long","1475":" so i have attempted to write a review on this book twice now i think my major problem with what to say about this book and why i found myself forcing myself to finish it is because of all those accolades on the back cover i need to stop reading them i read the words destined to be a literary american classic and i immediately feel like i am back in school i know that if i truly am one of the smart ones i will not only get but love this book and so i delved into we are not ourselves like dissecting a passage on a state test what is the author really saying which of course ruins the natural experience and gift of reading fiction the theme of the illusion of the american dream was something i was eager to read in the form of fiction however i just did not care for the author's distant story telling approach i love novels from a child's perspective i love novels that dig into the relationship of marriage eileen the main character is grown up and been married for quite the while by about page 150 i believe giving only short little glimpses into her childhood and courtship with her husband yet her marriage and childhood is what makes eileen eileen her husband ed is the virtuous character he strives to do things better live a purer valuable life over climbing society's ladder to get more money and status yet it never produces anything in a tangible sense i loved this the most it is why i read all 600 plus pages eileen and their one son connell over the course of the novel that spans six decades lose who they really are are not themselves as the title says because they so desperately try to be part of what society says is success edward the better man who never quite fit in becomes not himself because of something out of his control it is edward who stays the most aloof during the story because the author never gives the reader his perspective in the end both wife and son see the treasure and great man that he is and try to be better people for it these facts are what made this novel a great literary read however in my personal opinion it fast forward so much in the beginning and became tediously slow in the middle and a bit dragged out at the end","1476":"i enjoyed the book but it definitely could have been shortened","1477":"this review has been hidden because it contains spoilers to view it click here overall i ended up enjoying reading the book but the first 250 300 pages feel monotonous which if you take a pretty pessimistic or arguably realistic view of daily life that's what daily life is the first part of the book is far more focused on the characters rather than an in depth plot this bothered me a bit because i will admit that i need a lot of entertainment when i'm reading a book or watching a movie i am a fantasy adventure type of book reader but something about the char overall i ended up enjoying reading the book but the first 250 300 pages feel monotonous which if you take a pretty pessimistic or arguably realistic view of daily life that's what daily life is the first part of the book is far more focused on the characters rather than an in depth plot this bothered me a bit because i will admit that i need a lot of entertainment when i'm reading a book or watching a movie i am a fantasy adventure type of book reader but something about the characters kept me reading despite me wondering where the hell it was going and if anything exciting was going to eventually happen something does happen around page 300 and you do or at least i did have a hunch that is where it was going to lead with the early signs having dealt with that with family members before and currently might have given me an advantage in guessing at it the changes with the characters not only themselves but also with their relationships with other characters after this turning point in the book was what really spoke to me through this story how different people deal with tragedy seems like it would be easy to describe and execute in writing but i have found other books where it seemed contrived thomas writes it in a very realistic way one part near the end that i found very emotional was eileen sleeping on ed's side of the bed you sometimes change routines after people die to avoid having to think about things you did together having those memories and emotions sneak up on you can either be fond or catching you at the wrong time make you feel heartbroken her sleeping on his side of the bed to avoid perhaps turning over expecting to see him and then not see him because he's gone is one of those memories that will cause some heartbreak and asking for even one more night where she could be on her side and facing the wall but know he's on the other side of the bed i have felt similar feelings about things i used to do with my mum even if it's something that is normal and boring like that just having another day would mean the world like i said i'm usually not the type of person that would pick up a book about daily life like this but i am going to recommend it to people more","1478":"this book just sort of destroyed me does that make sense in a good way in a crazy way in a way that makes me grateful for the millionth time in my life deep down in my soul for authors thank you matthew thomas for writing this book and for giving words and life to people who aren't able to express themselves anymore","1479":"liked it didn't love it well done family study but heavy going between the dysfunction and the dealing with impact of alzheimers and a month after reading i had a hard time recalling it so it didn't exactly stay with me but sometimes that's okay","1480":"really hard to get into perhaps a little too realistic of a portrait of the disappointments and lack of communication in any average american family but as a result i found it even more depressing than it was probably intended to be it's a long book but it felt longer than it was and seriously slowed me down on my 25 books year trajectory","1481":"intense and a slog at the same time disturbing subject matter for sure a book i sort of made myself finish because it seemed disrespectful not to not sue i can recommend exactly but it stays with you","1482":" i came full circle with my emotions and opinions of this book in the beginning i was completely absorbed in the relationship between the main character eileen and her flawed parents her father was a well respected laborer who eileen respected despite his gambling and other short comings eileen's mother was a cold and emotionless alcoholic i admired eileen for her strength and determination to pull herself out of this life she focused on a better future without shirking from her responsibilities as a daughter the next section of the book dragged for me at times hence the 4 star rating i became frustrated and impatient with eileen's constant desire and obsession for material things she could never be happy or content even with a husband who adored her when her son was born she treated him in the cool detached manner in which she had been treated as a child i found myself feeling restless during this part and wanted the story to move forward the book picked up quickly however when eileen's family was forced to face extreme circumstances i once again found myself admiring eileen for her strength i really respected how she dealt with hardships head on with honesty grace and determination for me her ability to put her family above all else exemplifies the true meaning of unconditional love i really enjoyed this book immensely","1483":"i loved this book what is it with feckin' irish stories so great one of my favorite things about a good book is the specificity of situations and character traits that make everything come to life that make you feel like you're not the only one with voices in her head and boy does thomas have plenty of room to be specific over 600 pages it was truly epic and gripping and you care so much for all the main characters immediately and i loved the new york references","1484":"this review has been hidden because it contains spoilers to view it click here i'd rate this a 3 5 if i could the first half of the book flew for me and then the second bit took me several weeks to dig through maybe that's an intentional shift as eileen's years drag post diagnosis i'll read his next book enjoy his writing style","1485":"powerful book with wonderful writing a tragic story hard to read about alzheimers in such a graphic way","1486":"i'm not sure what made this long novel so compelling it's not action packed it may be that the author so totally u0026amp convincingly conveys what's going on in his main characters' there are two of them minds over the years of this family's life","1487":"it apparently took ten years to write and at times it felt like ten years to read i had to take a break halfway through in order to read something more dynamic and exciting but i went back it wasn't that it wasn't good or interesting but it was about characters rather than plot and not exactly a page turner","1488":" thanks to the publisher and goodreads for providing me with a free copy i've been procrastinating on reviewing this book because honestly i'm still processing it more than a week later we are not ourselves follows eileen from childhood through to her old age and it is heartbreaking first of all i have to commend matthew thomas on how three dimensional he made his characters eileen honestly drove me up the wall half the time she was fixated on being glamorous she had a lot of racist opinions and she lacked the self awareness to acknowledge this it takes a lot of good writing to keep me interested in a character like that and thomas managed that he managed that with all of the characters in fact who were fascinating sympathetic and dislikable at the same time without spoiling anything too much this novel also deals with a devastating disease and its portrayal is beautiful horrible and so accurate i will say and this is the only reason i'm not giving the book five stars that the writing style didn't exactly do it for me there's a lot of exposition it's dense and there are scenes that are glossed over that i would love to read more in depth and that's fine it's actually quite effective in spots and the degree of exposition definitely goes down as the story progresses but still this book is more than 600 pages long that's a lot of exposition to get through but the story itself is fantastic and heartbreaking the characters are realistic and i did enjoy the book overall","1489":"usually i enjoy generational fiction but this was so depressing it's 600 pages long and most of the story is negativity and complaints just a couple spots of fun","1490":"i had high hopes for this book but was greatly disappointed eileen leary is in catholic elementary school in queens when the story begins we learn about her life with her alcoholic irish father who still has the brogue he had when he landed in ny as well as a gambling habit that he also brought with him not too stereotypical and her mother who can't cope and who also becomes an alcoholic eileen's smart earns her bachelor's degree in 3 years and earns a master's in nursing administration from nyu but marries a man who even before they were married appeared to have some mental health issues he's an expert on the brain and his field is neuroscience psycho pharmacology eileen wants a better life her version of the american dream a husband with an important job at merck or professorship at nyu and a big house bronxville will do nicely the husband is happy teaching at bronx community college has no interest in anything but his research and teaching they have nothing in common no interests no friends but eileen has her dream of a big house somewhere far from the jackson heights neighborhood they live she has a vision that their son will win a scholarship to regis all students at regis are brilliant and on scholarship she never considers what anyone else wants even at the end of the book when their son is grown she is still trying to control him and make his life decisions this was a very long boring story where nothing happened i kept reading hoping something would eventually it didn't this book was promoted as the irish american story of the twentieth century this may be the story of a strange disconnected family in queens but it doesn't represent the average irish american story from the mid twentieth century neither does it represent how a family lives and copes with mental health issues","1491":"disappointed in the uneven handling of the story and characters","1492":"almost five stars wonderfully drawn characters not much of a plot but then you didn't need it when you were so engrossed in the characters oh how some of them let others down and aren't the best they can be so true to reality we want to do our best but let each other down time and time again it made me cry on numerous occasions and although it was clear what was happening to ed you can see why eileen put her head in the sand for so long can fully understand how why the son bailed out","1493":"this review has been hidden because it contains spoilers to view it click here i know some complained that a little life was at times to absurdly over the top to be realistically devastating though it didn't feel that way for me i get the critique this book on the other hand is completely realistic in its emotional bleakness spoilers ahead because there's no way to discuss the depressing nature of the book without getting into the details of the plot this book follows the life of eileen among the things she deals with along the way alcoholic parents blocked ambi i know some complained that a little life was at times to absurdly over the top to be realistically devastating though it didn't feel that way for me i get the critique this book on the other hand is completely realistic in its emotional bleakness spoilers ahead because there's no way to discuss the depressing nature of the book without getting into the details of the plot this book follows the life of eileen among the things she deals with along the way alcoholic parents blocked ambition frustration with limited financial means the inability to get pregnant for over a year her husband's early onset alzheimer's and the taxing physical emotional and financial strain of caring for him through the end of his days here's where the really devastating stuff begins i won't get into all the details but alzheimer's is a disease that's cruel not just to the person suffering from it but also the people who love that person eileen seems to singularly shoulder that burden her son is there sometimes but he can't deal with the humiliation of seeing his father in this state and he's young and wants to have a normal young person's life i didn't know the subject matter of this book when i started and i'm not sure i would've started it right now had i known but this was definitely the kind of book i was both very into and had to keep stopping because the scenes of emotional hardship were too much to bear admittedly it's not necessarily a bad thing to be reminded of one's own mortality and the deep discomfort of aging and illness but it is something that can really get you down to say i enjoyed it would be a stretch but i think this book will probably stick with me for some time more","1494":"loved this book about generations of a family making it through life in new york very sad at times","1495":"i was never really sure what it was about","1496":" i was excited to read this book because 2 friends rated it quite well and i think highly of their opinions when it comes to novels i'll admit that i did not get very far in this book but that what i did read i was not impressed with some novels draw you in and you know the characters in a way that you feel you can complete their sentences and you are walking with them and experiencing what they are experiencing this novel was written more in the detached manner of looking at a scene in a macy's display window for example eileen's mother goes to the hospital for 8 months for a hysterectomy and a bladder infection 8 months really but i as the reader don't know anything about how this little girl emotionally processed the absence of her mother it seems everything is presented in this way detached facts that i can't process along with eileen i read sarah and danielle's reviews again and they loved how spot on the author was with the setting while i respect that perspective i feel that i could get that in a woody allen movie and i was not as wow ed as they were by the author's knowledge of ny and li or at least it was not enough to overcome what i feel is very detached writing","1497":"in a sweeping story of post wwii to the recent past second generation irish new york author matthew thomas has brilliantly rendered the emotional and existential journeys of eileen tumulty as well as the fascinating ethos of a specific time place and demographic group authentically told with the clean sparse language illustrative of a life lived entirely with little outward emotion we are not ourselves tells in a linear fashion the life journey eileen makes from her mid 1950s girlhood to a sort of spiritual rebirth in her early 60s full of boundless wisdom and heart we are not ourselves fearlessly tackles timely subjects such as early onset alzheimer's and the millennial generation's lack of career focus as well as many timeless themes this is a book about the impact of one's parents on one's future how the choices we make have much different outcomes than ever imagined how emotional growth is possible at any age and most of all about how the immeasurable bonds of love surprise us eileen's complicated relationships to both parents especially to her alcoholic mother her sometimes disappointing but ultimately gratifying marriage to ed and her deep evolving love for her son connell make this a quietly compelling page turner eileen is an amazing unique and moving heroine this is a book which will stay with me for a long time","1498":"a very touching novel about the trials of life having experienced some of the events in the book i really felt as if the author was writing with the same knowledge of experience that i had beautifully written with a haunting reality","1499":"i may try to come back to this later but i should note that it has taken me nearly a month to read the first 200 pages of this novel when i normally go through 2 3 books a week honestly i think it's very well written i'm just bored","1500":"read this quickly perhaps i should have spent more time with it while i enjoyed the book there was a point where i was not sure i wanted to finish it the family was interesting especially ed but i somehow felt that the author never got eileen quite right i would recommend it though","1501":"as bored with this book as eileen was with her life 100 pages in i figured something needed to change and if it wasn't going to be her it had to be me","1502":"despite the many favorable reviews this book has earned i found it to be strangely remote the emotional pull i always look for in a good novel just wasn't there for me i felt that the writer was reciting details of the story without making us care for about the characters and that the writing itself was dull so after about 150 pages i gave up","1503":" when a debut book sparks a bidding war on both sides of the atlantic the inevitable question is \"is it worth all the hype \"the answer i'm pleased to say is mostly \"yes \"oh sure there are some quibbles the opening 100 pages - the background information that fleshes out the characters - could be edited down a bit a very minor character appears in the second half of the book and i had to wade back through pages to remind myself who she was another minor character's part could easily have been written out and so on but in general this is a page turning novel that will easily appeal to both literary and mass readers because it's so darn good the focal character is eileen leary - wife mother nurse and striver upwardly mobile she marries ed a man who is in many ways her opposite a reliably knowledgeable man who lacked the tolerance for superficial interaction a scientist and professor together they welcome a son connell who becomes the center of their lives but - to paraphrase george bernard shaw - men dream and the gods laugh and make other plans the family is tested in an unforeseen way each of them must strive to figure out what's important and what's authentic in a life where the future is shady and the rules have been turned upside down this is a book that poses questions that each of us have mulled over in our minds how do we claim our own lives and live by our own inner radar...as opposed to what we think we want what makes a life worth livable how do we survive when the odds are long what endures when little else remains matthew thomas creates an authenticity in this story and breathes life into his characters without giving anything away the epilogue is beautifully written and encapsulates the book's meaning and purpose my best guess is that we are not ourselves will be leading the best seller list when autumn comes around 4 75","1504":" the topic of this story is early onset alzheimers it was a scary look into the lives of others who have their world turned upside down due to this illness it felt as if the story dragged and could easily have been cut in several places but the topic was dealt with in an open and multi layered way eileen and ed are children of irish immigrants and are both driven to prove themselves as american successes ed is a professor at a city college in ny and eileen a nurse their son connell plays the crucial role of spoiled self absorbed son who time and again lets his mother down as she juggles job and nursemaid at home the honest side effects such as loneliness confusion exhaustion and just feeling overwhelmed by the reality of living with a loved one who continues to lose his grasp on a life he loved and lived well several times towards the end of the story i was moved to tears in this very real portrayal of a very difficult subject and life experience","1505":" if i had known more of what this was about i probably would have said i shouldn't read it ugly cried through the last 10% sorry fellow metro riders a great deal of this hit very close to home the loss the unfortunate practical financial byproducts and frustrations that accompany that loss guilt fears of parenting and baseball it was also pretty wonderful that this epic length novel was written about a normal family that being a good husband and a father is a worthy and laudable accomplishment for ones life is something i was happy to read reminded me of the best parts of middlesex and a tree grows in brooklyn this will stick with me","1506":"it was really really good at the start but it kind of lost steam in the last hundred pages plot was a little cliche towards the end i didn't like how this book degenerated into some sort of love story i think the ending was a waste and connell's character could have been done up better some reviewers seem to dislike eileen but she was very real and very human which kept me reading not recommended for readers who like plot driven books this book is almost biographical","1507":"thomas's story is readable and very practically told but moves along without gathering much meaning along the way even with a history of alzheimer's disease in my family the novel never touched below the surface for me","1508":" i was well into this book before i realized just how long it is but i was determined to finish it i read it via the kindle app it is truly an epic tome covering decades in the life of eileen tumulty her life as a child a teen a young college student her marriage and the life of her son it is written in great detail and some of it can be skimmed i e i really don't need for the author to describe every historical nuance in american baseball from the 1940s to 1960s to understand that the game of baseball is important to one of the main characters a health crisis strikes the family which of course makes for great drama sadness and lessons learned and not learned that said the family is nothing out of the ordinary here which makes it a good read their experiences could happen in almost any family and several people will be able to relate good writing and story telling here just too much of a good thing","1509":"i am always amazed at writers whose first novel is just so good matthew thomas does a great job here understated but real the people their thoughts their feelings their humanity a compelling portrayal of early onset alzheimers and the havoc it wreaks on those who suffer from the disease and on those who love them i am looking forward to this writer's next book","1510":" it was a long and tedious read i nearly gave up on it at least 5 times and i felt the urge to quit after each chapter i kept reading hoping something would actually happen but nothing actually did it was just a very long rambling i didn't like eileen ed or connell i'm proud that i persevered and finished but overall this felt like an enormous waste of my time that being said i can see how those readers who enjoy character driven novels might actually like this book i'm a reader who enjoys plot driven books and since this one is so so heavy on character i felt bored if you're a character driven reader give it a chance b c there are plenty out there who loved it i am not one of those people","1511":"ok so here is what i figured out bothered me about this book thomas missed something in writing from eileen's point of view i don't what exactly he missed warmth empathy intuition but it was something essential in my view to a woman's character that made me feel the whole time that a man was writing about what he thinks a woman feels and thinks like it irritated me the entire time despite the fact that i loved the story and wanted to find out what was next for the family as it rose out of queens and fell in bronxville","1512":"a heartbreaking yet wonderful story this novel is epic in size spanning many decades and beautifully written although i found it sluggish at times i'm glad that didn't deter me a quotation from king lear prefaces this novel and gives its title setting the tone right from the beginning it foreshadows how one's mind will be stripped naked identity crumbled and language blown out of him leaving behind only the memory of the last words","1513":"i think this novel is brilliantly written despite the fact the it was slow at the beginning and hard to get into i was tempted to abandon it and it is too wordy and too long i am glad i stuck with it a lot of speed reading going on it is not a pretty story and i found all the characters quite unlikeable so why the 4 stars we are not ourselves tells the story of eileen a woman who grew up as an only child with troubled parents she ended up taking care of her mother who was an alcoholic it was a pretty pathetic childhood so later eileen marries ed leary he is an intelligent researcher teacher i think he gets numerous job offers that would increase his status and income eileen is always pushing him to accept these offers which he continually refuses eileen has always seemed like an odd socially inadequate character and so does her husband they really don't seem to get along very well eileen is desperately wanting to move out of their decripid neighbourhood she wants to be able to buy a big house in a popular area of nyc she wants to wear a fur coat ed just doesn't seem to want any of these things then they have a child connell again he grows up to be socially awkward and just not a likeable kid at all then ed is diagnosed with early onset alzheimer's at the age of 54 in the ensuing year eileen is able to understand some of ed's strange behaviour's early on as the beginnings of this horrible disease it is incredibly heartbreaking to see ed's mental and physical health deteriorate the author skillfully draws the reader into the lives of this leary family and we are forced to live this life with them my feelings for eileen do change in the latter part of this book some may call her a martyr the way she took care of her husband but i don't think she was a martyr at all she did what she thought she needed to do for ed out of a sense of love and loyalty i just think the author was able to paint such a real life picture of what taking care of a terminally ill spouse can be like","1514":"i admire the strength of eileen the main character in this story the book is powerful but also heartbreaking i would have given it 4 stars but for me it dragged in sports","1515":"i know these people we all know these people fantastic a bit heavy on the metaphors in the first 30 chapters or so but otherwise couldn't put it down","1516":"this book is so amazing thank you to misha collins for recommending it to us on twitter this book broke my heart made me laugh cry and smile i love this book","1517":"fantastic book","1518":"it's hard to fault a novel so wonderfully written however it felt to me that each chapter was an exercise in style the focus being on the writing and making every sentence just perfect accomplished but at a cost i was painfully aware of the author behind the scenes at times and could almost feel how he obsessed over every sentence instead of being engulfed in the story i felt the author's focus on his writing i see now why it is advised to just write and worry about perfection later it allows for flow a magical place where you forget yourself and you just create yes you must come back and polish it over and over again but flow makes or breaks a novel wouldn't you say i was a bit disappointed in the description on the jacket of the book it gives too much away you already know what is going to happen after eileen falls in love this is not a spoiler folks it's already there on the book cover for all to see it made me question if i would bother trudging through hundreds of pages when i already know what the outcome is i would compare this novel to a great painting you can spend hours examining it and admiring it's beauty you can marvel at how the artist capture the essence of a time and it's people the painting comes alive and the more you look at it the more you see this novel is a gem and i wish i could have appreciated it more however instead of the grand painting i saw brushstrokes on canvas trying a bit too hard to be epic","1519":"this was a painful book to read eileen yearned for more ed just couldn't give it to her u0026amp in the end his decline was almost too much i mean isn't this what we all fear not to be ourselves anymore the letter ed wrote to connel made me cry i wished for a letter from one of my parents especially from my mother who died too young over 50 years ago what do i remember u0026amp what have i forgotten","1520":"intriguing read about an irish american family","1521":" the mark of a good book at least to me is if the characters stay in your head long after you turn the last page eileen is still with me this is a book that can be read and re read the subtleties and nuances of the story make for a very rich reading experience at times i found myself talking to the book or reacting to it verbally something i seldom do this is a character driven novel and i believe it it is the first book from this author if so i look forward to reading more of his very talented writing in the future","1522":"good writing in fact very good writing but almost unrelentingly depressing in my view","1523":"occasionally frustrating but ultimately beautiful sniffle","1524":" eileen tumulty's childhood was rough her parents drank too much and didn't understand why she spent so much time studying eileen figured education was her ticket into a better life and ultimately she did move into a lovely home in a fine neighborhood with her reliable husband yet despite her determination and fierce drive she had no real control over the other people in her life and was never quite happy and then real tragedy strikes and eileen must figure out how to manage under her new circumstances i thought this was a sad book and although i finished reading it i can't say i really enjoyed it","1525":"i'd been meaning to read this for a while but finally got round to it after it was picked by my book club what starts as a seemingly conventional story of a family eventually becomes something quite different a difficult powerful devastating read","1526":"the characters drove me mad and eileen and connell just annoyed the crap out of me between her materialist obsessions and his teenage attitude and it was entirely too long see sidenote below she was already 50 years old halfway into the book i was left wondering where it was going to go from there i am sympathetic to people in these situations truly as my family has experienced some of the same stuff but the pace was off in my opinion i was ready to be done with it about 350 pages in sidenote this was for a book club and a terrible pick not much to discuss unless you're talking real life depressing truths and it was too long for a book club pick in the middle of the summer when everyone is busier than normal not that i like rainbows and butterflies brainless chick lit which i don't but this was just too heavy a book to discuss in a timely manner half of us couldn't get through it by the day that we decided to meet and it just wasn't the type of conversation i wanted to have with basically strangers over cheese and crackers in the park","1527":"brilliant writing at times seemed too long but always engaging","1528":"a terrific read though it made me cry towards the end the early part reminded me of a tree grows in brooklyn but it became something richer and darker and all its own","1529":"keeps you reading until the end a deep thoughtful examination of family and love","1530":"only 59 pages in but the writing is phenomenal one to be savored while reading i'm digging in for the ride there was still between this moment and the one of his dying the interval allotted to him and there was so much to live for","1531":" such an interesting and diverse read this book is an in depth look at characters both extremely up close and universal there is less a story going on than a following of a family's very personal tale at times this is a chronology of the members of the family and current events outlining the backdrop of those lives other times this is a history of a late 20th century family over the couse of lives lived very truthfully recounted warts and all my biggest take away is the contrast between what you envision how your life will be lived and the reality of the live actually lead and how you reconcile those two different illusions","1532":"the very best kind of novel in my mind a multi generational family saga set in new york told mostly from the viewpoint of the complicated sometimes difficult but incredibly real and believable main character eileen leary the books spans several decades of a life full of huge love and loss beautifully written never sentimental but devastatingly emotional it brought me to tears at several points best novel of the year in my opinion","1533":"i wish that i could give this epic book more stars probably in the top ten character driven books i've ever read and by a debut author unbelievable thomas manages to be inside the head of eileen tumulty from 1941 through her adulthood eileen marries someone very different from herself which creates a good deal of angst and squabbling what i liked the best was the larger picture of america that emerges during this time this book would appeal most to baby boomers","1534":"this is a very accomplished book that reminded me of death of a salesman in its subject matter tone universalism and perceptive look at the american middle class in the changing world of the latter half of the 20th century for six decades we follow the life of eileen tumulty leary and her irish american family the saga begins in queens new york but as the neighborhood becomes increasingly global in nature it feels threatening and less prestigious to eileen she aspires to move with her husband ed and son connell to the more affluent neighborhood of bronxville surrounded by people who looked like her family \"like willy loman eileen is fixated on external markers of success with a warped understanding of internal value in fact a major theme of the book is about how we judge ourselves and judge others ranging from guilt and self castigation over unexpressed thoughts to an assessment of worth founded on what sort of car we drive or clothes we wear or even the way we smell ed eccentric and nerdy has no interest in accumulating wealth rather he is dedicated to continuing his research on rats in a second rate college moreover he has the quixotic idea as eileen would identify it that what counted in life was not \"victories and defeats\" but \"to love and be loved \"in spite of ed's recalcitrance eileen doesn't give up and keeps pushing herself ed and connell even if she has to scale back her aspirations when ed is stricken by early onset alzheimer's disease eileen transfers her relentless dedication to the care and preservation of her husband and to a fierce determination that connell succeed in the way she never could it is up to connell then as the story draws to a close to decide whether he will pursue the dreams of his mother or honor the lessons from his father and always hanging over him is the frightening specter of genetic possibilities early onset alzheimer's disease runs in families and is incurable discussion the theme of the title is played out in several ways in this story most obviously with the onset of alzheimer's disease ed leary becomes someone else like gregor samsa in kafka's the metamorphosis a story ed's son connell teaches to his students ed's thought processes gradually get truncated and more bizarre and he becomes increasingly burdensome to his family but ed's family never stops loving him even as he becomes less and less like himself in fact both eileen and connell insist on thinking of ed as he used to be rather than the shell of himself he has become but there are other less obvious manifestations of not being \"ourselves \" from the adoption of social conventions to the facades put on for social interactions and even to the \"potemkin village\" of a house that eileen finally buys beautiful on the outside but falling apart in its bones evaluation this is a moving often heart breaking and well crafted story with a scope and thematic depth that make it seem like the kind of book taught in schools or at least that should be taught in schools it goes without saying that this would make an excellent choice for book clubs highly recommended","1535":"other than it took me forever to read this book it's 620 pages in the final analysis i really did like it and feel it is worthy of all of the praise which is why it got onto my list in the first place it is long and sometimes i think it bogs down a bit so stay with it in many ways it was so much more satisfying than books authors write which are what i term aerobic novels zip from plot devices from here to there lickity split plot wise and wrap it up in a neat little bow in the last seven pages voila on to the next best seller regardless of the length of time it took me to read it because there would be times i'd put it down and pick it back up a week later it's so well written that you remember exactly where you are it is a substantial well written novel you do get caught up in the characters and you want to find out how it ends we are not ourselves is a well written journey eileen was born eight years before i was and thus i relate much to the time period in which this fictional character lives all through the decades we get to know her parents through the early part of the book we learn of eileen's longings and dreams of how she expects her life to turn out and she works hard to be the success she believes her parents sacrificed so much to give her the opportunity to become she's not a flighty inconsequential person looking for someone to latch on to she's willing to wait and to be a full partner for the success she believes is her destiny eileen is thoughtful patient more patient that i feel i am and hard working we get to know the third generation of her family and so you will learn of eileen's life and the trials and tribulations and in the in the end you'll realize that though her tough times might be different than your own you'll feel a kindred spirit to her character you'll remember eileen ed and connell for a long time after you close this book","1536":"voyeuristic epic novel about american lifelife can change quickly appreciate the minutiae i loved the relatable female lead character who reminds us to take a breath and live in the moment","1537":"hard to say what i thought of this book there were parts i found very honest and interesting specifically living with alzheimer's but i really did not like the characters i suppose that's truly the way most people are likable one day making mistakes the next but i kept wanting them to evolve into better people the son was so selfish and the mother was so austere everything was depressing to me i can't say i'd recommend it to anyone","1538":" i decided to read this after seeing it feature on our library's website i'm so glad i did and am looking forward to this man's next novel this is one of those really good stories it's written beautifully and simply and very vividly we meet eileen tulmulty at the age of 9 in 1950 as she does things in the home that her mother should be doing she vows to have a better life than her parents were able to give her she graduates from high school goes on to college and becomes first a nurse then an administrator however what she really wants yearns for is to be a wife and mother she meets ed leary a smart and funny man who is a college teacher and researcher she thinks she's met a man who as ambitious as she is however she soon finds that she is butting up against a wall ed is ambitious in a different way he wants to be totally independent when he does his research so he refuses a lucrative offer from merck he wants to teach young working class students so he stays with a community college and turns down an offer from nyu he turns down an offer to be an administrator at his community college in order to stay with teaching meanwhile eileen chafes at his refusal to better himself which would by extension better their family they are living in a three apartment building which they eventually purchase when the owner has financial difficulties ed drags his feet at the opportunity when eileen starts talking about a house in the suburbs he refuses but finally gives in after suffering a miscarriage she gives birth to a son connell her hopes for a better life are pinned on him at the age of 51 ed is diagnosed with alzheimer's a devastating diagnosis it does explain his erratic behavior that seemed to have started a few years before the shortcomings of the american medical system are outlined as eileen struggles with taking care of ed trying to get help juggling credit cards taking on a second mortgage squaring her shoulders and making sure that she swallows whatever crap is thrown at her by her boss so she can work the last two years and keep her healthcare benefits and more despite ed's deterioration eileen loves him and finds sweetness and even passion meanwhile connell goes as far away from his parents as he can when it's time to go to college leaving his mother to deal with his father alone when she insists that he come home for the summer he agrees then leaves his father alone he can't handle him he tells her connell finds someone who helps to set him straight eileen finally puts ed in a nursing home this book is sad in so many ways but it is not a downer reviews have called it a triumph of the human spirit yes that's a cliche but it is i really loved this book","1539":"if this is matthew thomas' first novel i can't wait to see what he writes next i thoroughly enjoyed this book his main character eileen takes us through a snippet of what it is like to be of immigrant descent in america in the mid twentieth through early twenty first centuries she pursues her dreams lives her life with determination in the face of numerous obstacles we follow her from girlhood to womanhood it was as though i could feel eileen's pulse she seemed so real without giving anything away i can safely quote the omniscient narrator presenting her view it was time now to be smart smart and strong she wondered whether she'd ever have a chance to be foolish and weak eileen holds her family together through tragedy her strength seems boundless her heart wide and deep her drive limitless don't think she is perfect by my assessment she has numerous flaws making her all the more human and i love her reaction to indian food while we learn about the rest of her family and the omniscient narrator takes us into some of their heads at various times this is primarily eileen's story and the story of striving in america take a walk through her life and check out thomas' first novel we are not ourselves","1540":" i am a pushover for books about irish families set in the new york city area having irish heritage myself this 620 page novel was in some ways gruelingly realistic and for my taste a little overwritten yet not without moments of brilliance starting with eileen tumulty's youth we see her as a girl who worships her father and feels abandoned by her mother both her parents have trouble with alcohol and thus young eileen becomes a caretaker and later on becomes a nurse she dreams of finding a fine husband who will lift her out of her dreary queens surroundings marry she does a fine young college professor named ed leary he adores eileen ed is more pragmatic than eileen and does not buy into her middle class suburban dreams they have one child connell a boy both parents love deeply ed is less social than eileen and at times prone to periods of introverted isolation yet he is a fine father and shares his love of baseball with connell as the years move on eileen starts secretly shopping for a homes in better neighborhoods making good money as a nursing administrator she finally convinces ed they should move they buy a fixer upper that poor ed struggles to renovate eileen is consumed by the need to move on up in the world via their move connell is entering high school at this junction and sadly ed starts showing signs of spoiler alert early alzheimer's disease though it takes many chapters more before it is diagnosed this is where i grew a little frustrated as it was so obvious to me ed was displaying symptoms of memory loss yet my mother had some dementia in her 90s and we did not immediately recognize it for what it was immediately either eventually diagnosed with the early onset form of alzheimer's the family's future is jeopardized eileen must help ed with his academic paperwork especially the grade books they try to hide his condition from the college administrators but eventually ed must leave academia he becomes increasingly prone to bursts of anger and paranoia eileen hires a series of caretakers to help keep ed safe while she works desperate not to lose their middle class lifestyle connell breaks away from the heartache of his father's demise to go to college the rest of the novel progresses through ed's move to a nursing home and eventual death matthew thomas does an outstanding job of portraying the cruelty of alzheimer's and how it can destroy a family so even though at times i found the novel to be a bit of a slog i am glad i stayed with it most touching a long letter ed writes to connell once he realizes his life will be drastically demolished connell reads it after his father dies a difficult time for him as he grapples to deal with the loss of his father and the guilt he fears for not trying harder to connect with ed in the end as the novel progressed the learys could have been just about any american family their irishness became much less of a fictional factor and perhaps i expected more of that irish flavor in any case especially for a first novel we are not ourselves is a very accomplished piece of writing","1541":"achingly beautiful devastating uplifting","1542":"it took me a long long time to get into the book while i appreciated the details especially about the familiar neighborhoods of my home borough of queens i had a hard time keeping my interest however i'm glad i stuck with it because the second half of the book was tender and devastating ed and eileen leary will be in my thoughts for quite some time","1543":"for anyone fearful of dementia this is a very scary book it follows a woman with expectations for her life upon which she follows through until her husband a very intellectual college professor begins acting unreasonably she first considers divorcing him then realizes there is something terribly wrong with him kudos to mr thomas for his extremely credible story of this woman and her family i wanted to stop reading and yet could not","1544":" i have opted not to finish this i've made it half way through the audiobook's 21 hours the author takes wa a ay too long to get to the crux of main themes in the story semi spoiler alert what happens with ed the husband is pretty obvious about one quarter of the way into the book by the time the author comes out with it at about the half way point i was ready to scream this might be an engaging story at half its length where was the editor on this lazy at best only the son connell is a sympathetic character i am reminded of anne tyler's book noah's compass in which all the characters are so negative and grim that they succeed in aggravating all the other characters and the reader maybe i will save this book on my mp3 player in case i am stranded someday without something else to read for now i am going to look for something with at least one character that i can cheer for in a story that moves along at something snappier than a snail's pace there was some good prose in the narrative but eclipsed by the sluggish pace and the grimness of the main characters","1545":"i really liked the story this book told but i felt like it was way too long and parts of it dragged on for me i could have done with a lot less of eileen's childhood and i'd have enjoyed the book a lot more","1546":"over long the characters dealt with their hardships reasonably well but there were no components which lead you to love them a lot about alzheimers which the reviews certainly didn't tell you","1547":"i just read that it took matthew thomas ten years to write this book i don't always read other reviews but i was curious there were times i felt some editing was required because it was a little slow going in places but this was a minor issue the investment thomas has made has given readers a challenging but very worthwhile read the plot was well structured and the characters skillfully developed the main character eileen daughter wife mother caregiver can be frustrating and sometimes i felt little empathy then as the story develops i shared her daily challenges and felt her loss the relationships are truthful and very emotional especially the father son relationship between ed and connell the result is a riveting and affecting work of art one that reminds us that life is more than a tally of victories and defeats that we live to love and be loved and that we should tell each other so before the moment slips away","1548":"this is a novel about the leary family the main character is eileen her relationships with her parents and then her husband ed and son connell it is always absorbing i couldn't wait to get back to their stories the only part i found less than believable was eileen's relationship with a new age y seer the letter from ed to his son was so moving i wept","1549":" i thought when i started this book that i was going to love it and i should have it has everything i love about a novel a family saga an irish american family to boot that spanned decades but i did not love it i liked it but mostly i just wanted it to be done it was depressing it was for sure unpretentious emotional u0026amp even epic but it was more depressing than anything for me i must say that at the end the letter to connell from ed his dad was wonderful that letter was the best part of the book for me maybe i wasn't in the right frame of mind for this book i don't know all i know is that i am glad i am done with it","1550":"finally finished this one and i must say it was a drag talk about a downer of a book eileen really is one of those glass half empty or possibly fully empty type characters she really needed to stop looking in other people's windows for that will never make you happy all in all a low lifting read that one needs to take zoloft after finishing","1551":"beautifully written hard to believe that this is a debut novel full of insights that are plainly true to life my favorite novel since the orphan master's son","1552":"beautifully written","1553":"i had a hard time to get into at first put it down several times then it started getting interesting it is not hard to identify with characters i like writing s make me think and this is that kind of book what is life is all about i do recommend strongly","1554":"i didn't enjoy the flow of this book at all by the time i read the first two hundred pages i couldn't understand how i could possible have 400 more to read when the the first quarter of the book took up the first half of eileen's life then time seems to slow down inexorably so i couldn't finish this book fast enough just to be done with it","1555":" some parts of this book was really good but i just couldn't get passed the fact that it was trying way too hard to be metaphorical especially the ending i just didn't understand that it was way too corny the book on a whole could have been a good three hundred pages shorter because some parts we just really didn't need i also really disliked the protagonist she never got any better for me with all that said it was still a decent book i enjoyed lot's of it and some of the writing was really beautiful i would recommend reading it because it is not that bad and you can tell that the author really put a lot of work into that","1556":"this review has been hidden because it contains spoilers to view it click here i want to put this on one of my shelves death and the human condition but it that in itself would be considered a spoiler here's another one this is a very true accounting of a family dealing with the vicious onslaught of early onset alzheimer's no spoiler for me once he started showing signs though the author was ambiguous at first allowing for the potential diagnosis of other mental health issues having been through this with my dad this is very realistic as was the remainder of the i want to put this on one of my shelves death and the human condition but it that in itself would be considered a spoiler here's another one this is a very true accounting of a family dealing with the vicious onslaught of early onset alzheimer's no spoiler for me once he started showing signs though the author was ambiguous at first allowing for the potential diagnosis of other mental health issues having been through this with my dad this is very realistic as was the remainder of the novel this family's relationships both suffered and strengthened also very realistic tough read but very rewarding an author to watch more","1557":"a slow and thoughtful account of alzheimer's and the impact it has on a family this book felt authentic and real but the pace was sometimes ponderous","1558":"i just finished this book and wanted to simply write this ed's letter the book is only getting 4 stars because there were parts that were really emotionally frustrating to get through but it is a really good read just sort of settle in to it when you have the time but once again all i really want to say is ed's letter so moving so inspiring","1559":" at first i was not enjoying this book i was bored and not even half way through the book however i stuck with it and i'm glad i did the second half was way better and made the book worth reading i was not a big fan of the main character eileen but you learn to feel empathy for her and you respect the decisions she makes alzheimer's is a terrible disease and i think this book does a good job of highlighting how devastating it can be overall it was a well written book and worth sticking through to the end","1560":"what did i think not much a bit of a snooze as read by mare winningham i didn't really like any of the characters couldn't have cared less about eileen's journey there needed to be a little more drama as a slice of life it is about as beige a life as i could imagine i felt badly for edmund for his challenges but i didn't feel as though i knew him that well before it became apparent that he was struggling i was glad when it was over and i don't understand why this has become so popular i see it everywhere","1561":" we are not ourselves is a book i neither love nor like but one i respect and admire to the fullest the characters are not likeable and whether they redeem themselves by novel's end is up for great debate it is this aspect of the novel the debate i kept with myself throughout the reading that makes it an extraordinary work of fiction it is epic in scope as well as emotions it examines the truths and secrets too often locked behind the facade of daily living there were moments i actually loathed these characters but it was the empathy which was forever present that kept me glued to their lives empathy is the theme matthew thomas sets his opus upon the foundation that forms the question in the readers mind as to whether or not they can empathize with those who are so unsympathetic it took thomas 10 years to complete this massive and painstaking novel painstaking because of the depressive tone on almost every page straight out the gate you know this will not be a fun ride but it is a ride worth taking in addition to the weighty subject of alzheimer's thomas pays equal attention to the question of not just the american dream but who has the right to call themselves american it is here where i struggle with the lines drawn between characters and author eileen's overt racism is clearly part of her character flaw and giving thomas the respect he rightfully deserves as an author the racism is somewhat a personification for the fear of change a fear i'd argue embedded in the human dna but it is the character of bethany which gives me great pause while up to then eileen's mistrust for the \"other\" had seemed flawed even her encounter with the young male cashier at the supermarket bethany eventually affirms the mistrust and thereby causing me to have one of my own by novels end the \"other\" is redeemed by eileen's willingness to finally accept her ignorance and overcome her fears yet i wondered at what \"truth\" thomas was exploring through eileen and bethany's relationship it's when her young son connell and big brawny sergei come to her rescue against two women that takes me out of the story wondering as to the choices an author makes this would lend hours of discussion in a women studies class with all that being said i believe this book should be read in high schools it raises a lot of questions while giving teenagers more authentic characters than the ones usually assigned for required readings this would also make a great book for college courses in sociology race gender studies and maybe even public policy","1562":"hmmm where do i begin short and sweet will do this is a difficult book to read emotionally it is draining a family closed to outward emotion mom is a nurse dad a professor with one son he develops alzheimer's at an early age so the family suffers through the illness in an unbending fashion until there is no choice left","1563":" a fascinating look at a life full of promise but irrevocably changed due to early onset alzheimer's disease the epic story of emily's life from a family of irish immigrants living in new york city her aspiration to get out of the city to live life in the suburbs is a sub text to the peculiar behaviors of her husband who apparently lacks ambition apparently this book was rather long winded and did not seem to know when to end i gained new insight into life on the other side of progressive dementia","1564":"the story of a family living in new york city in the late twentieth century it's interesting to me how in novels it seems like so much more time is spent on a decline whether it's a decline in a life or a relationship rather than the opposite or maybe this is a quality of literary fiction","1565":"it took about 300 long pages to get into this book i considered giving up several times however once i was hooked i sped through the last 300 pages","1566":"long and boring i forced my self to get about three quarters though and then gave up because i really didn't care what happened at the end","1567":"i listened to this one and believe i enjoyed it more as storytelling than i would have reading a paper copy for me the main theme of this story which spans 60ish years was the opposite pulls of advancement u0026amp growth u0026amp increased independence vs contentment u0026amp familiarity u0026amp reliance on others this theme is centered with eileen who learns from a young age that a life of romance is a delusion and that the only person she can depend on is herself i found myself wanting to applaud her efforts to build a life better than the one her parents had and simultaneously cringing as she made decisions that isolated her from simple friendships with genuine people that cared in the quest for a little more respect u0026amp security u0026amp upward mobility don't we all relate to this at some level the most heartbreaking moment for me was when she realized the 30 years of backbreaking work and frugal living for the sake of providing more financial security for her own child than she had experienced growing up would be eaten up by the financial realities of her husband's alzheimer's and that had she worked less and saved less and enjoyed more along the way she would have qualified for programs that would have taken care of him what a difficult decision this is daily the balance if you will between using the fine china so often that it becomes routine and saving it for something so special that in the end it is never actually used as children likely are prone to her son connell experiences her pragmatism and devotion to hard work and saving negatively he wants her around more distracted less more often carefree and unattached and enjoying the moment i loved seeing his perspective as a grown man reflecting on his upbringing as he starts to see that he would have done things in more similar ways to his parents than he ever thought maybe i connected to this because i'm at that stage of life where i'm starting to comprehend life's complexities more and more and my eyes are being opened to the reality of people doing their best given their circumstances and seeing that i would not do it much differently or better were i in their shoes at the same time i am getting more feedback from my own kids about the amount of time i work the reality that they would rather have me playing with them than doing laundry or making lunches for tomorrow but who does that if not me yet if their favorite shirt is dirty or the lunch they wanted isn't packed it's kind of traumatic sometimes being a parent is just viewing yourself in a damned if you do damned if you don't light we are not ourselves captured that juxtaposition beautifully the short chapter format worked well for me i could read a quick chapter before bed or listen on the way to work the pace of the book was definitely slow but because of that it didn't beg to be finished quickly it seemed to lend itself to leisurely reading and didn't keep me up at night which was nice this is one of those books that impacted the way i view life and others positively not one i would read more than once but one i'm very glad i stumbled across","1568":"after reading 200 pages and thoroughly not enjoying we are not ourselves i abandon the novel i thought the characters were flat the plot was mundane and the book's pacing was tedious","1569":"the writing was beautiful and the characters vividly drawn but it seemed to get dragged down in the middle and i had a tough time soldiering through","1570":"loved itcould not put it down it was all there all the ups and downs of alzheimer's it was an amazing story to tell","1571":"an incredibly well written book that was satisfying even if its purpose was a little hazy it's the story of an irish family in queens whose many travails ends in alzheimer's for the father although a good portion of the book details his steady decline the disease is merely a backdrop for a detailed and insightful look at a typical family and while the book was probably 150 pages too long i'd be very eager to read the author's next novel","1572":"compelling at 600 pages did not think i would want to read initially characters are real and though i did not want to like eileen main character and there were some unlikable traits about her she was a stronger and more dedicated wife than i think i could have been in same situation but then we never know what we can do until we are confronted with our challenges","1573":"this book was way too long and it just plodded along i stuck with it and it only got mildly interesting towards the last quarter i don't understand all the fuss about it","1574":" if asked while i was in the midst of reading we are not ourselves i would have said that i did not like it only after finishing it did i change my mind two of the main characters eileen and connell were pretty unlikable however the story covers a lot of years and as in real life the events of people's lives can change their characters reflecting on the story i can appreciate how the characters just like real people are changed drastically by their histories ed's story was heartbreaking and difficult for me to read while reading i would have said that the book was way too long but life is long and although the stories could have been told at a brisker pace perhaps the author's intention was to make the reader slow down and live the story year by year with the characters i found it interesting that the author was male as he really seemed to be in the mind and heart of eileen tumulty","1575":"don't even think of putting this book down during the first 20 per cent this is a slow build excellent writing some books just take snapshots photos from my generation of family life and these books are little gems that's what thomas does here with this modern classic you enter these characters' lives they become a part of you and then the story that people wait for savor each part of this fantastic read you will not stop thinking about it long after you have read the last page","1576":"the first hundred pages or so as i got to know the main characters as they settled as irish immigrants in america had me enthralled and obsessed with reading more of the book as i got further in it became an exercise in tedium and then the most depressing book i've ever read at times it moved so slowly it was as if i was reading it in real time the author has such a gift for language i almost feel bad that i disliked the book so much","1577":"a perfect novel everything ran true the characters are intricate and developed it made me laugh and it made me cry and it made me think and learn and i didn't want it to end","1578":"can't remember when a book evoked such a deep response from me have to admit that i shed a tear or two in one instance i didn't particularly like the characters that much this is sadness and love especially love and along the way life happens","1579":"too long and depressing","1580":"overall it was just a depressing book but i didn't even like any of the characters so i didn't feel too invested in the storyline anyway","1581":"this is a great book about family and relationships faced with an insidious disease which will rob ed of his memory the story relates how his wife eileen young son connell and ed himself cope the story is moving yet isn't melancholy or depressing matthew thomas' writing seems honest and deft one of the things that struck me was the unforgiving nature of the us healthcare system as compared to universal healthcare in countries like my own australia this novel is perhaps a touch too long but is otherwise a very worthwhile read","1582":"boring nothing much happens nice coincidence with still alice and early onset alzheimers now i know too much","1583":"very interesting story about a couple and the struggles they encounter throughout their marriage eileen always wants more bigger house more social life just more ed is content with what he knows there is also a shift in what their future holds and looks like","1584":"original review posted at worn pages and ink i received this book from netgalley in exchange for an honest review this was a story of unparalleled sadness the dream of a better life unfulfilled by the inescapable challenges of aging and a breaking of the mind it's a story of a lost future or a changed future although the leary family strives for one life it is not in their hands for them to end up the way that they dream they are a family out of sink with one another a divide that grows greater as they struggle to cope with incurable illness and mental deterioration i found the son connell to be the most interesting character his thoughts and perceptions through childhood adolescence and early adulthood are extraordinarily complex as a teen he struggles between his love of learning and his desire to fit in he struggles mentally and physically under the weight of peer pressure he is exposed to drugs and sexuality neither of which he is ready for or comfortable with but he craves belonging and so he doesn't run from it he drifts further and further from his parents feeling shame at close familial contact and affection but unable to find affection in romantic relationships as connell develops his perception of relationships continues to skew he doesn't understand how to relate to his struggling family and he can't bridge the barrier to demonstrate his love for them the same goes for his romantic relationships he proposes to one of his first serious girlfriends at the age of nineteen not fully comprehending the normal if such a thing can be said progression of a romantic relationship he suffers from a lack of intimacy and cannot fathom a way to demonstrate his feelings of love and attachment the story of these characters swept me away completely thomas' style opens the leary's lives raw for the reader exposing the ugly truths of family relationships the contemplations of love and the devastation of disease the story itself does run long after a while i felt as though there were some issues with pacing the early parts of the story take us through eileen's childhood and her first interactions with her husband ed i felt so rushed during these chapters although it's important to know about where these characters come from in order to know why they want what they want later in life these earlier chapters didn't really affect the overall plot because of this rushed feeling i could never understand why eileen and ed loved one another their relationship in the beginning felt quite glossed over and so their marriage to me didn't fully make sense the pacing evens out later on as the characters reach middle age and it was smooth sailing from there in terms of plot and character development a very moving story overall it tackles difficult and depressing topics so be forewarned it's left me feeling pretty melancholic for the moment but i thoroughly enjoyed it overall we are not ourselves is an honest and open story with compelling and complex characters i definitely recommend it","1585":"this book was a wonderful read so much more than the story of a wife dealing with her husband's alheimer's demise each character was rich and moving in their own right and the author kept it from being a women's lit predictable saga the language was crisp and the plot tight a very worthwhile read","1586":"once again i was astonished that this was another first time book author i know folks practice and practice and deal with rejection up to a first publishing but even still the enormity of his storyline development the way in which the characters react don't react with one another and those small comedic moments that pop up in life that he managed to describe with such depth were incredibly moving","1587":"there's so much simple beauty in thomas' prose i like how character focused it is eileen is a wonderful creation a mrs bridge with sharper edges the emotional honesty of the story of dealing with a loved one's illness and decline was very well done too","1588":"very well writen but sad","1589":"seem to drag a lot and somewhat predictable","1590":"the middle third sparkled but it is weighted down by overly long bookends there's a great story here but at 600 pages it gets lost among occasionally pedantic narrative and unnecessary diversions here's hoping mr thomas gets paired with a strong editor for his next book","1591":" i know i'm in the minority of goodreads reviewers but i thought this book was really bad it was as if the author spent a few years holed up with a computer and a bunch of vivid childhood memories and stories his parents told him spewed them out with no editing emerged with a huge manuscript and somehow got it published the dialogue is stilted the plot jumps all over the place the amount of weird unnecessary detail is jarring i will say that the depiction of a person with alzheimer's was exceptionally well done otherwise eesh what a disappointment","1592":" perspective is everything and in my opinion that is what makes we are not ourselves an excellent read time and again this story reminded me that no one can ever climb into our skin and completely know who we really are or why we behave the way we do the omniscient point of view keeps the reader balanced and able to fight the prejudices against each character based solely on the character's behavior well written thought provoking enlightening and touching are just a few words to describe why this novel is worth reading","1593":"it was a poignant story with life lessons however the fact i finished it surprises me because i almost put it down several times way too long","1594":"long family saga featuring a struggle with early onset alzheimer's i wanted to like this one more than i did the author's prose is excellent but the story drags and is rather predictable","1595":"we are not ourselves is an exacting read it is filled with so much life real life ups and downs that i was captivated the story spans the life of eileen tumulty born in 1941 having been born in 1946 these are the years of my life attention to detail is wonderful the story tragic the characters realistically flawed","1596":"an irish girl growing up in queens and dreaming the american dream she never quite gets there but it's a small but resilient life chronicled with a great deal of compassion and the description of a person's slow but sure slide into alzheimer's and its effect on his family is powerful terribly moving","1597":"i thought this was excellent i know some people thought it was too long or slow but i felt that it helped us to understand eileen and be a part of her life this was beautifully written and i highly recommend it","1598":"this novel excels in its seeming simplicity it merely follows the family of eileen tumulty leary through several decades but as it often happens with family there are many layers beneath the veneer presented to the populace i found the book to encapsulate what it is to be family quite well there are times when you hate the people within it times when you celebrate and love them times when they break your heart so utterly and completely the characters are well developed and i thought it very easy to settle into their mindspaces throughout the story of their lives it's a very rich narrative told very simply and it's all the more effective for it","1599":"i started off loving this book but the second half disappointed me maybe it was too honest and when i read i am looking for more of an escape","1600":"this was one of the saddest books i have ever read in places it was also one of the most real it is a story of one woman's life hopes and dreams and how those things seldom match the reality of life it is also a very honest look at a frightening disease alzheimer's like several other reviewers i would give it 2 stars in places and 4 or 5 in others but finally settled on 3","1601":"slow and you know ed's problem much much sooner than the narrator but i did like it","1602":"i had no expectations for this novel outside of knowing the author received a record setting deal for writing it so i guess i expected it to be better than average i didn't know the plot when i sat down to read i'm still processing my reaction i sympathized with eileen but didn't really like her definitely didn't like the son though i feel bad about that at times the story was slow and agonizing yes agonizing but i feel like it had to be to convey what was happening with the leary family as a whole i looked forward to reading every night even through the most difficult parts and it was certainly better than average you should see for yourself","1603":" i went back and forth between the audible and kindle formats of this book the narrator was very good this is a difficult book to review on one hand i wish everyone i know would read this book just because i want to talk about it on the other hand this book was solely character driven not plot driven which doesn't appeal to a lot of readers just witness all the negative reviews it was also very long for a character driven novel celeste ng's everything i never told you accomplished a lot of what this one did for literary familial tales but with much fewer pages i found the main character eileen fascinating though she was so self centered and shallow in many ways she was devoted to her husband through sickness and health richer and poorer and all the other ways so many of us fall short however she was not a warm person at all i simultaneously disliked her yet respected her for 600 pages the other two main characters in the book were her husband ed and her son connell though ed might not have been as fully developed as the other two he was such a compelling character connell was such a sympathetic character yet also as he got older and started making more selfish decisions i felt my emotions torn toward repulsion and pity by then end of the book i was so moved by what the author did he just simply wrote a book about one woman's unremarkable life yet made me care about every facet i can see why so many people are tempted to quit if i had just depended on the kindle format i might not have had the patience as there is no action or forward momentum but when i listened i just could not stop i wanted to get to the end to see how it all turns out i learned so much about a disease i realized i knew so little about i hope to have more empathy than i did before for families touched by this ailment this book took the ordinary and made it so poetic the biggest takeaway for me is that i want to be more of a parent like ed with the steadfastness and determination of eileen highly recommend this book","1604":"here's a question should any book that made you shed tears automatically get five stars maybe this is one of those books i couldn't put down but i'm hesitant to cross into the magic five star rating realm it's generating a lot of buzz and not just from misha collins fans so a thorough review seems redundant i'll just add that the best thing about this book is that you don't really like the characters at first but before you know it you've adopted them as family","1605":" this book was on a lot of 2014 best of lists and it's also a debut by the author there were so many things i liked about this book and the characters were so well drawn i wished there had been a slightly better transition from eileen being young w parents to being married but that's a small quibble she was a very complex and well drawn character her relationship with ed and his illness was heartbreaking i found myself wondering why it took so long to take him to a doctor but who knows what you would do if it were you","1606":"i absolutely loved this book a complex fascinating not always likable female lead unlike anything i've read in literature for years a definite must read","1607":" eileen tumulty is raised in modest circumstances in queens ny during the 1940's she is driven by a need for more a hunger for a grander home a nicer car a sophisticated and wealthy husband impressive friends and she is overly concerned with what others think with trying to impress everyone around her we follow her her husband and son through 5 decades at the heart of the novel is a secret an unexpected circumstance that will change the family sadly as a reader i knew the secret chapters and chapters before it was revealed how could eileen be so blind but of course she was blind blind to everything but her very shallow ambitions the story is told in the third person and that left me at a distance from the characters not that i cared as the main character eileen was so unlikeable so the story was okay but the characters and the manner of the telling were disappointing i'm surprised i slogged through the whole 619 pages the meant to be uplifting epilogue might have been inspiring read in isolation but was too little too late for this novel","1608":"this is a solemn serious and relatively heavy book despite this or because of it it's wonderful i would recommend that you read this book when you are in a good head space there are a lot of instances while reading where i saw reflections of myself in any or all of the characters and these people like real people aren't always likable this fact can make this novel often uncomfortable we are not ourselves spans the life of eileen and ed and their son connell books that span a lifetime can be either too descriptive and drone on or are not descriptive enough and seem lacking this novel manages to find the happy medium like real life time flies in this book and is punctuated with those important 'snapshots' that seem to linger in our memories over a lifetime none of the characters seem particularly happy and contented especially eileen who suffers from a common ailment of reaching for an internal picture of perfection that can never truly be fulfilled i won't bother with any other details as this book is best wallowed in yourself read this book for an unscathed look at the internal workings of an american marriage with all the foibles joys and discontent that fill it","1609":"this was a good book but so unbelievably long could have picked up halfway through u0026amp felt that i hadn't missed much felt like you were witness to a family train wreck","1610":"i can't recommend this highly enough it has a relatively small set of characters for its length and the author developed them well while at times it felt unnecessarily long that leant an air of completeness to the sad but very true feeling story","1611":" an affecting saga of an average american family with eileen leary the epicenter eileen is clearly the cog of her family eileen has always desired the american dream she finds as time passes her dream is tempered by her husband's lack of alignment with her ambitions determined to see her dream to fruition eileen propels ahead and finds her dream a reality the dynamics of her family shifts and she finds through a chain of events wishing for a snippet of her old life back we witness the recesses of a family exposed as tragedy strikes clearly not part of the dream an emotional journey ensues and the reader is hurtled in to the agonizing heartbreak of alzheimer's every emotion this family feels is felt with every turn of a page i found myself profoundly moved by this story it paints a true portrait of what an unexpected illness causes the person as well as the family amazing detail of a family dealing with an intruder an interloper most unkind as a family they do the best they can and with eileen at the helm rest assured she will be the guiding force a compelling epic you will not be able to put down a story of love loss family change acceptance and a realization of priorities inspiring and touching a story penetrating the perusers emotional depths this is a disease where you never win it doesn't just take down the sufferer it takes down the spouse the children the friends it can feel tremendously isolating savage glimpse into the expanse of alzheimer's what about the bad news he turned to her the bad news is your husband likely has alzheimer's she gasped ed's hand in her seized into a fist i take no pleasure in saying this but from now on it might be best to think as every day as the best of the rest of your life if i were you i'd try to make the most of every day while you can matthew thomas creates a chef d'oeuvre unbelievable this is his debut beautifully crafted and clearly the beginning of an amazing literary career a destined classic not to be unnoticed is there going to be a time when you don't know who i am he asked ed's face took on fierce expression as though the question had angered him she thought to intervene but then he rose from his seat and leaned down and put his arm around the boy i will always know who you are ed said kissing the top of his head even if you think i don't know even if i seem not to i will always know who you are you are my son don't you ever forget that you neither he said rising to hug his father a copy was provided in exchange for an honest review","1612":" don't be intimidated by the thickness of matthew thomas' we are not ourselves it is very readable and when you're done odds are you'll wish it was even longer so you could spend a bit more time with eileen leary in a plain straightforward yet poignant style i would compare to alice mcdermott's readers catch glimpses of eileen's life thomas treats his characters with a quiet sort of dignity they are not perfect not all of them are even likable but they all seem unequivocally real not good not bad just human the story was different than i expected based on the blurbs i'd read to help others with the should i read it question i'll try to help with clarification rather than recapitulating the plot which one can undoubtedly find elsewhere what this novel is about families generational differences the american dream treated realistically it is character driven but has a good story too i was tempted to peek at the last page a few times as i read it is not an epic historical novel the modern sort of whiny over emotional relationship novel that literary critics seem to love an epic historical family saga a book just for women thomas does write very well about a female protagonist but ultimately it is just a human story i have already recommended this novel to several friends and will continue to do so it would be a good choice for book clubs","1613":"cried and cried just beautiful a rendition of the truth","1614":"an outstanding accomplishment how a family's normal life turns into struggling with caring for a family member diagnosed with early onset of alzheimer's a story of much love u0026amp courage","1615":"i considered quitting this book so many times for being too mundane or too depressing or lacking any relatable characters the end justified the effort put into continuing however this is not an easy or fun read but it is extremely thought provoking and worth the time invested","1616":"book group selection for november 2015","1617":"would have rated this higher but it was unnecessarily long like 200 pages too long","1618":" honestly generally boring the story is certainly compelling a family just on the edge of making it at least in the wife's eyes but a terrible burden appears i thought the characters were generally unsympathetic except for ed i never felt that eileen really loved her husband except in a few spots and yet the author seemed to want you to believe she grieved his loss i guess i felt the book was mostly about the characters but they all seemed pretty adrift i did finish the book but how bad is it when you finish every reading session thinking when is this going to be over maybe it was the writing style i just thought the book was devoid of any emotion","1619":"this is a big book which could almost be in the manner of a \"family saga \" but it is more introspective and less populated than many books of that genre it tells the story of eileen and ed leary and their in some ways very typical post ww ii american experience eileen the child of irish immigrants is raised in new york and takes care of herself and her family in the midst of alcoholism and mental illness when she marries kind and conservative ed leary a scientist she sees the possibility of a bigger and better life with the material trappings that affluent suburbia can offer but ed is curiously unambitious and resists her prodding to move up the academic ladder eileen is flawed flinty and completely believable i sympathized with her frustration in the face of ed's passivity and i really wanted to shake ed sometimes until at a certain point in the narrative - i didn't that turn in the narrative was a surprise to me so i'll leave it alone here i believe this is matthew thomas's first novel in the depth and realism of the characters and in the keenly observed mores of the various decades the book spans it is quite an achievement","1620":"caveat i only read half this book the reason why is too boring to explain but the half i did read the second half was superb","1621":"this book covers decades and for the most part it does it well there are a few minor characters we don't need and if the first 100 pages had been better edited i think some of the negative reviews would be eliminated he writes about the period referred to as the american dream the reader is left to decide who if anyone actually lived it in this story it is thought provoking it can be sad it can be maddening it was well worth my time","1622":"long book never really liked the main character but the alzheimers part was heartwarming because as quirky as her husband was i liked him","1623":"thank you to netgalley for the arc i was totally surprised that i came out of this book and gave it 5 stars probably more like 4 1 2 but i'm not quibbling over a half star normally i stay away from epic family sagas or spanning decades or anything similar in the descriptions i'm more of a fast paced thriller type of reader but i pulled it to the top of the to read stack to show as a reviewer that i can move to a different genre and i was never disappointed i'm not going to recap the plot for you others have done that as well as the overall description here's the short version though eileen is a daughter of irish immigrants growing up in a section of queens she wants better she wants more she goes to nursing school she meets ed a brilliant scientist and someone she believes can give her that more they marry they have a son she eventually gets the more but it's not as perfect as she always thought it would be as others have stated this is not a plot driven novel but it is very much character driven eileen was so many things at different times sarcastic caustic mean u0026amp petty greedy self involved but i believe that she believes whatever she does to get ahead she is doing it for her family when an unexpected health crisis arises for her husband ed we see her at her most determined and several of those adjectives i used before most of the story is told from eileen's pov with a chapter here and there devoted to ed or their son connell the author is brilliant in his storytelling without being wordy or rambling i think his talent kept me going through this hefty tome when i would have given up on something similar the descriptions through the decades are spot on for the most part i'm really still trying to find more words to describe this journey that i went on and was completely surprised at much i enjoyed it","1624":"excellently told in a very realistic way giving insight into dementia author wrote in a way to share how this disease affects all family and friends","1625":"there were parts of this book that were very good but the book was overly long and i had a hard time forcing myself to finish it i do believe the best of the book was the thought imparted in the end that definitized the role of parent summarizing everything the book was about i wished i had liked the journey to get to the gems a little more","1626":"good life story emotion filled great book bringing to light the struggle of class and disease relatable from many angles great characters built over the whole book's length highly recommend","1627":"an excellent book really really enjoyed this one traces the quiet lives of eileen and ed leary from the 1940s to present time as they try to move up the socio economic ladder and still keep their stoic irish american catholic integrity after they move into their new home in westchester county they face a family crisis together with son connell and the way they weather its ups and downs is heartwarming and inspiring almost feels like a family epic this writer is clearly very talented","1628":"an excellent book beautifully and sensitively written story of life i loved eileen ed and all the characters who appear in and out of eileen's life i won't soon forget them couldn't wait to sit down and read it every spare moment made me cry so much in parts one of my all time favorite books worth the ten years it took the author to write it","1629":" reading this book took me back to a time in my life when i had unlimited time for reading those days when i would dive into long multi layered books and stay with them for hours and sometimes days on end we are not ourselves is the kind of book that makes you want to do that simply joyously read and read and read without allowing anything to cause your eyes to stray from the pages the story is full and evocative generous in details character development and plot i was caught up in eileen's plight as well as connell's desire to make it all go away by attempting to ignore it having personal experience seeing a relative struggle with alzheimer's i felt that ed's illness was accurately though heartbreakingly portrayed this novel is well worth the reader's time highly recommended one of the best books of 2014","1630":"one of my very favorite books of the year perhaps the last few years this is a sprawling profound study of a woman karen tumulty and her family from her early years through courtship marriage and all that encompasses family and life it's unsentimental but touching complicated and while not always spot on it feels true as hemingway would demand it's a long read but it holds the reader's attention from the first page on not once did i wonder why an editor hadn't stepped in and cut highly highly recommend","1631":"only read this book if you want to sob but also a great read","1632":"i liked the first 150 pages then i got to around 400 pages and thought why am i still reading this i did finish only because i felt like i already invested enough time in it there would be some sort of reward at the end over all very disappointing if you want to read a book that profiles an average american family living an ordinary american life check out after this by alice mcdermott it is a fraction of the length and written much more eloquently","1633":"beautifully written but plot anemic","1634":"coming up as a 10 hour read there's plenty of time to cover everything a story about a family personal relationships grief and loss friendship and loneliness sacrifice and compassion thomas plays with his themes beautifully following the life of eileen from childhood to maturity we see her innate desire to aspire for greater while settling for less this one has left me with plenty to think about","1635":" at times this book got really long 600 pages all about the day to day living of one family but through that it illustrates a detailed portrait of the too familiar pains and tenderness of family life if you're willing to stick through it the characters are so believable complex and vivid it will be worth it not 5 stars because i found some parts to be dragging and it is a little slow paced for me but more than 3 stars because matthew thomas' writing is beautiful and the themes are stirring","1636":"i confess i read 63% of this book then skipped till the end this book is about the one subject i don't like reading about i am giving it 3 stars because this isn't a bad book i read over half of it but once i really got into it i just decided it was hitting too close to home","1637":"4 5 picture yourself in one of your cross country races it's a hard pace this day everyone's outrunning you you're tired you didn't sleep enough you're hungry your head is down you're preparing for defeat you want much from life and life will give you much but there are things it won't give you and victory today is one of them this will be one defeat more will follow victories will follow too you are not in this life to count up victories and defeats you are in it to love and to be loved you are loved with your head down you will be loved whether you finish or not i've read many fiction stories i've written a few fiction stories myself when i'm reading i'm often conscious of the fact that these characters are mere creations of people's imaginations when the writing is done well you can forget that this is a fact and learn to love these fictional characters as you would any other living breathing human being what matthew thomas has done in we are not ourselves is create by far the most realistic set of characters i have ever come across in the entirety of my life i don't read a lot of literary fiction i'm often intimidated by it so when going into this book i had a very open mind i had no idea what i was getting myself into halfway through the book though i realized how much this story had and would still affect me there were many reasons for this the novel follows eileen tumulty an irish girl living in queens she's very young when the story opens up the reader is able to learn about her childhood and growing up with alcoholic parents who sleep in separate bedrooms eileen later marries ed leary a rather odd scientist with a promising future eileen narrates six decades of her life filled with all too real struggles eileen is human entirely too human i was able to see her grow and change and think every step of the way she is by no means perfect or even close to it but that is her charm she is a materialistic woman with a vault full of dreams and expectations she wants to squeeze the world dry of everything it has to offer eileen is selfish and prideful and close minded but she is real patience the best word to describe this book is patience it took the author a decade to write this book by hand i assume patience was the key part in that endeavor while reading i had patience as i lived every moment alongside the three main characters every character had to be patient at one point or another because life wasn't patient with them life didn't wait for them so they had to learn to be patient on their own furthermore i related to this book on a personal level mental illness is one of the main focuses in the story and i have more than enough experience in my life to know how messy it can be when a family member suffers from them as i read i reflected on my childhood on my grandparents on my achievements and my disappointments i also considered the future far more than i'm comfortable with i allowed myself to think of the future without putting up any mental walls and i was afraid terrified this life is short and unexpected and my deepest fear is to build relationships with those around me any type of relationship i build adds to a stress pile but i am grateful for the ones that i have with my friends and my family that is the point of this books human relationships partnerships love we are not ourselves we are organisms capable of loving and supporting one another through adversity a little cliche but i like to believe in this i like to think that life matters not because we achieve financial success or accumulate goods life matters because we leave a trace after we leave this world on the people that we love","1638":"i wanted to love this book and while i did not love it i have a feeling it will stay with me for a while eileen is the same age as my dad but reminds me of my grandmother","1639":" i owned this book for a quite a long time before i started it but i always paused and looked at it considering my mood and what i was looking for in my next read once i began bearing witness to eileen's story i couldn't shake how closely my ambivalence about starting the book complimented my relationship with the characters there was a quiet familiarity in each of them eileen and her father ed connell they could have been neighbors the book read like i was peeking into their windows this is my favorite type of story not busting at the seams with plot twists and action sequences but demanding your consideration be given to the characters themselves realistic slow moving with emotional punches that hit you without seeming like they should have even the slightest impact when the smallest bit of chipped tooth stays with you for days the author has certainly done his job","1640":"i enjoyed the book altho the main people were either not very likable or sort of annoying the wife mother only wanted to upgrade their place in life but even after she mostly succeeded life interferred she was her own worst enemy and i'm not sure her dreams would've come true in any case","1641":"i would've given this five stars but it was excruciatingly long and several points very slow other than that it was a beautifully written tale of generations and the heartbreak that occurs at stages in life matthew thomas had me loving characters one minute then intensely disliking them the next a really good book that might be better read throughout a long cold winter","1642":"4 5 5reading certain books are so easy you get to live in an imaginative world with all those characters and when the book ends you move on to a different book and get immersed in another world then there are those books which leave you disturbed and thoughtful occupying a space in your mind long after you finished reading that last page we are not ourselves by matthew thomas is one of such kind when i started reading this one i did enjoy eileen's early life and its details but after a few pages of reading i honestly had to push myself to read through the pages i had even thoughts about abandoning the book but i kept on after all this book came with a lot of recommendations and i just had to know what all the hype was about it then came the second half and everything changed when learys' life seems to be doing ok with enough of their own complexities darkness enters their lives - slowly at first and then with full force threatening to take over their lives completely that is all i will say about the second half of the story the story picked up momentum and then you realize what kind of ride matthew thomas is taking you for you are awed and scared you are scared for eileen and connell because you what know what is going to happen but then they don't know what their future is going to be imagine you as a reader knowing something and you just want to cry out to eileen and make her see what is happening you see eileen's ambitions from early on and then you see some of them being lost on the way the way she pushes herself ed and her son towards a path which she thought was the path to happiness but ed has his own ambitions and aspirations which might not be aligned with eileen's many a times what happens then does they take the middle ground or does someone give up on their ambitions for the sake of love i think everyone calls this an epic story because of the way you live the life with eileen ed and connell you are not a passive observer you are an active but invisible character in the story itself seeing everything and feeling everything that the family is going through you just have to read this book and experience it i hope i was able to convince you all to pick up this amazing book for the characters and the writing","1643":"beginning was three stars middle was two stars at best at points i referred to it as this goddamn book last 100 pages were four stars","1644":"the author brings you into this family and shows you all of the parts of them and theirs that they wish to share and hide with the world in them you can find yourself and your fears and dreams the story was true for all and beautifully written","1645":"excellent novel with memorable characters in what seemed like an ordinary story only to evolve as a thoughtful and heartbreaking tale of s family beset by alzheimer's a great read for book lovers","1646":" this is not a book i would have read if i had known what the plot twist was but i enjoyed it nonetheless i really fell in love with the characters ed and his dedication to family and teaching eileen and her strength of character connell and his authentic trials of growing up the author does a good job in taking what could be considered a boring subject in a way long book and making it into a window into the soul he accomplishes this by slowly drawing you into their lives with lively and beautiful prose they are not perfect by any means but even with their failings they are just as heroic as any character in an epic poem the subject matter is tough but if you give this book a shot you won't be disappointed","1647":"so boring you could see ed's plot line coming a mile away and why would eileen marry someone who wasn't ambitious when she clearly wanted that in life and held out for a partner who would be did she project her own ambitions on ed because she wanted more stability than she grew up with because brilliance does not equal ambition and seeking out a higher station in life","1648":"well written and moving three generations of an irish american family with eileen tumulty as protagonist starts in woodside queens where part of my irish american family still resides the early part of the book is a bit slow and i thought it might be a long slog to get through 600 pages but then the story took off beautiful descriptions of father son relationship between ed and connell","1649":"this is a really long book about irish people in modern america i stopped caring about the characters with 200 pages to go","1650":"boring quit reading about 25% of the way through took me nearly a week to get that far left out main points leaving the reader confused plodded along i could not figure out the point the book is over 600 pages and i just couldnt see a reason to keep reading it if after 25% i was clueless and not that interested in returning to it","1651":"this was the first book i read after i reached my 2015 goal of 70 books and it took me ten days to get through this one at times it was difficult to read the realness was sometimes unbearable and sometimes beautiful chapter 88 is something i hope i never forget","1652":"i wasn't sure how i felt about this book until almost the end when there were moments of beauty that made sense of all that had come before sometimes you cannot see what is closest to you you can strive for more without enjoying what you have you can be imperfect and yet so beautifully human","1653":"this was the best book i've read in a while it's a poignant look at how life doesn't always quite meet your expectations but you adapt and make do and just do your best well worth the read","1654":"i have mixed feelings about this book i loved the characters and the story takes you through their entire lives which i find very satisfying but the amount of detail is overwhelming and tedious at times so i hesitate to recommend it you will feel like you are living every day with them eileen is the main character and is introduced as a young child to alcoholic irish parents you will follow her through her childhood her courtship and wedding to ed the birth of her child and ed's eventual struggles with early onset alzheimers the story is quite depressing for a large part but so is life you will see glimpses of yourself and those you love in all these characters pick this novel up if you love long books with flawed believable characters avoid it if you want light entertainment with a big sexy finish","1655":"really slow first half but a great second half nice well written story the challenges of alzheimer's was portrayed very well","1656":"i read this for a book club knowing nothing about the story or that this was the author's debut novel it was a long book but after awhile i got caught up in the lives of the characters i sometimes did not like any of them but at other times i could intensely identify with them and felt empathy if not affection this is one of those books like olive kitteridge mrs bridges or mr bridges it sneaks up on you and while it doesn't grab you with tense plot twists it nevertheless digs into you and doesn't let go you will remember this one and appreciate the very subtle ways the author shows us our lives","1657":"beautiful and heartbreaking","1658":"whoa this was amazing","1659":"super long took me months to finish good description of caring for someone with dementia well written","1660":" i've been unlucky recently with new york set books this book began to upset and annoy me at around page 100 when it was clear that the father was suffering from some kind of neurological issue it took another 100 pages for the reveal and then another 400 bloody pages to finish exhausting mawkish uneven with stretches of genuine badness i'm actually annoyed that this got published this way it's clearly from the susie salmon school of novel writing instead of therapy and there's even a section where the main character goes to visit a therapist and then explains why therapy won't do her any good there are bizarre shifts in points of view and dreadful cliches dragged out over pages and pages the son connell is as unpleasant a fictional construct as i've ever come across the live in russian handyman is super odd the ridiculous subplot about a cult that takes eileen to meetings once a week for a hundred bucks a time is too nutty the blurb claims that this book was written over 10 years that explains a lot because the author clearly forgot what his characters' were like from one section to the next except connell presumably the author's own stand in he's consistently wooden and unbelievable i read the last 500 pages of this book in the last 24 hours as i was so desperate to be done with it i don't enjoy hating on a book but this was miserable and awful my heart goes out to anyone who struggles with degenerative neurological conditions and to the people that support and care for them this book is a bitter and unpleasant look at the difficulties involved the author has a lot to get off his chest writing this novel was not the way to go about it he reveals himself to be angry unforgiving casually racist and a bit of a self indulgent asshole","1661":"i loved every page of this glorious book no plot really just lives lived ups and downs sickness and health kids and dinner parties the usual riveting","1662":"i started out liking this book but after awhile the misery of it was just too much one depressing melancholy situation after another just wanted it to end when i was half way through","1663":"i don't know if i really liked it or not but it was compelling enough for me to make it through the 700 or so pages but then again i tend to enjoy family dramas not that this is one but sort of and period pieces not entirely much of that either but i just sort of enjoyed its meanderings through the childhood adolescence adult life of one and those she cared about","1664":"couldn't finish it so i stopped","1665":"one of the most depressing books i've ever read","1666":"not at all what i thought this book would be it's a sad story with 3 very sad individuals at one point i thought i'd just quit reading it the author to his credit keeps the story moving and soon i was intrigued it's well written but a downer i think oprah would love it ordinarily i stay away from this type of novel but it was worth my time","1667":"matthew thomas is bound for glory review closer to pub date","1668":"enjoyed but not as good as i thought it would be per reviews storyline heavy and depressing at times well written","1669":"wow i just loved this book there were parts that seemed to move along a bit sluggishly but the sheer beauty of language u0026amp depth of insight into the complexity of family life childhood scars love marriage u0026amp parenting more than made up for it","1670":" this novel follows the life of eileen the child or irish immigrants who grows up in queens and aspires to greater things although she succeeds in some ways she does not achieve the contentedness she imagined she would gain as she rose in status she may live in a larger house in the suburbs but her life grows increasingly more complicated in other ways that wreak havoc on her family as well as her dreams and desires the story also focuses on origins and the legacies we pass on some for better and others for worse","1671":"very well written starts slow then becomes addicting hard realities to swallow","1672":" spoiler alert i liked this book at the beginning felt frustrated in the middle and loved it at the end personally i felt like the build up to ed's diagnosis with alzheimer's was about 100 pages too long i saw it coming immediately and trudged through until everyone figured out what was going on i mean eileen was a nurse how could it have taken her so long i digress a well written book if somewhat formal and occasionally dry also if the letter towards the end doesn't make you cry like a baby it's entirely possible you are heartless soulless or both","1673":"a young woman marries and has high hopes for the future her husband lives by his own code she works hard to achieve her own goals but sacrifices much to support him as he sinks into alzheimer's i admire thomas' straightforward sometimes spare style and his letting the unraveling of the story line and his loyalty to his characters take prominence over any desire to bombard us with over luscious prose the details of watching a loved one sink into dementia are at times excruciatingly painful to read yet so realistic that one wonders how thomas came by his sad knowledge in the novel's final pages the couple's much loved son makes a decision for life and love i couldn't put this one down thomas makes his literary debut here i wonder what will follow we are not ourselves","1674":"this was a 4 5 for me it got a little slow about three quarters of the way through otherwise it would've been a 5","1675":"i liked this book but i didn't love it i would probably give it more of a 3 5 star rating if that was an option it was long and that was both good and bad it gave me time to get to know the characters and to feel like i was part of their family i felt like it was an honestly written book about a family and about how we become the people we are because of our experiences but it really droned on at times and there were many parts that just seemed oddly out of place or without a point overall it was a nice story","1676":"i couldn't finish this book i got about a quarter of the way through and was so impatient with the main character i just wanted to shake her and tell her to grow up i couldn't like her enough to slog through her whole adult life of whining and trying to control and wanting things her own way","1677":"this book delivered on the promise of its hype i have a feeling the story will stay with me for some time complex characters good writing with some beautifully lyrical passages and an amazing story at the heart i know this is fiction but it was very convincing of the effects of living with a loved one afflicted with alzheimer's and what a heartbreaking appalling disease that is well done","1678":"i gave this a 3 based on the first 100 pages and the work the author did for 10 years hiwever it was too long and despite the content i could not feel with the characters","1679":"this was a slog interesting at first then just plodded once ed began his descent skimmed skipped the last 300 pages just to see how it ended","1680":"i thought the writing was good but the story just seemed to go on and on felt it was just too long a slice of life type story with few ups and many downs or so it seemed to me","1681":"this book won't be what you expect yes epic as it's often described but the story it seems to start from the first part of the book ends up not being the story it tells i found it somewhat uneven the author tells us so much about some characters and some sections are too long too detailed with others like connell we only get odd glimpses of him for most of the book overall worth sticking with","1682":" i wish there were half stars this reads like 3 different books the first part which describes eileen' childhood is beautifully written and engaged me entirely the second section filled eileen through the next part of her life it is in this section where the book fell short for me eileen's character has become a coveting discontented and at times cruel wife and mother the derivation of this evolution of character needed further exploration this section also includes characters and events which neither provide insight to character nor motivate the plot and as such only serve to belabor the pace however i continued reading i honestly couldn't put it down the final section of the book is touching insightful and seeks to redeem the characters in a realistic manner tear jerking and page turning in its rhythm and resolution in summary i loved thus book passionately in the first and third sections and i was disgruntled with it in the second but not at all unhappy enough to put it down the prose is beautiful the description of family and marital dynamics in a time of stress is heart wrenching","1683":"this story of a family its death and death and continuation was very hard for me to read and i suspect it will feel the same way to anyone whose parents have died but thomas's book is so closely observed that it doesn't feel like fiction it's fierce and relentless and loving i feel as if i've lived the story too","1684":"it took me a long time to finish this book much longer than typical for me it was very honest and if i'm honest depressing it was pretty boring through a good portion and didn't keep my interest i wanted to like it i read so many good reviews and with the pre release promises of 'the next great american epic novel' i thought i couldn't lose on this one the book started out very interesting and then about a 1 4 of the way through it lost me","1685":"a little wordy but well written","1686":"not a bad story but just not sure why this is a bestseller","1687":"can a 600 page book that is totally character driven keep your interest yes eileen ed and connell become people you know at times i disliked each of them but their thoughts dreams and fears stay with you i still remember the house hunting scenes so vividly both as a slice of suburbia and eileen's tortured need to succeed worth the hype","1688":"lovely prose and anthropology but am i crazy for finding eileen 40% irritating still an incredible first novel bravo","1689":"this book generated a lot of buzz but didn't live up to the hype it was a nice a story about a woman who grew up in an irish immigrant home and managed a family after her husband became ill","1690":" i enjoyed picking this book up each and every time and read through the 600 pages quickly the beginning of the book i liked best but as the story continued i found myself not taking to any of the characters i'm not sure if the main character herself lacked depth of feeling if her feelings or lack thereof weren't believable if i was biased against a male author's portrayal of a woman or if i just have different feelings than her i kept hoping to empathize to see a turn of character a rush of feelings but it never happened but that said it was a well written and compelling novel","1691":"this review has been hidden because it contains spoilers to view it click here i know everyone loved this book but i thought it was a big slog through uninteresting characters' daily lives i kept slogging though thinking something interesting must be coming and then smack realizing this is a book about alzheimer's too close to home for me and just too obvious way before the characters realize it not adding any insights if you have been through it i've been at that neurologists' office seeing those tests being given but i can't speak for those who haven't maybe i know everyone loved this book but i thought it was a big slog through uninteresting characters' daily lives i kept slogging though thinking something interesting must be coming and then smack realizing this is a book about alzheimer's too close to home for me and just too obvious way before the characters realize it not adding any insights if you have been through it i've been at that neurologists' office seeing those tests being given but i can't speak for those who haven't maybe very insightful for those lucky enough to have no personal experience and that's why it's so popular i don't know i can only say i threw the book on the floor about halfway through and just forced myself to pick it up and finish why i don't know more","1692":"it'll be a while before i stop thinking about this book","1693":"i'm in a quandary because don't know how to rate this i stopped reading after 170 pgs as it was depressing with no end in sight but being this author's 1st novel the writing is terrific plus it's set in same borough of nyc where i grew up so hit a chord and really wanted to see how the story ends but didn't want to wade thru the misery with no light in between","1694":"interesting story worth reading but quite sad","1695":"growing up in queens in the 1940s and 50s to irish immigrant parents eileen is determined to make a better life for herself but the man she marries ed turns out not to share her dream of a house in the suburbs over the decades of their marriage the reader watches the trajectory of their lives together mostly from eileen's perspective but gradually also from their son's perspective as they both observe the growing oddities of ed's behavior although it feels a bit bizarre that eileen a nurse by professional and good at her job fails to see the signs that ed has alzheimer's disease but then again eileen often succumbs to denial of reality a perfect example is her the way she goes about house hunting when she finally decides she will no longer wait for ed's approval to find the house of her dreams the gruesome realities of alzheimers and its impact on the entire family are painfully riveting neither eileen nor her son connell are particularly likeable characters eileen's childhood experiences alcoholic parents have made her emotionally stunted unable to easily show affection and connell's moral failures rarely seem to lead to regret or better understanding yet they all find their way through it and despite a rather depressingly vivid look at this terrible disease that almost led me to stop reading about half way through the book there is a glimmer of hopefulness at the end that made me glad i read it to the end this is the author's first novel and he is a gifted writer and storyteller","1696":"could barely get through the end because it was so sad but really worth it such a great read","1697":"another great book reminds me of the corrections a bit more upbeat and not as well written but very good","1698":"the first two thirds were at best two stars i couldn't figure out why my mom was so adamant i should read this meandering book with so little feeling and characters that weren't likable and then the last third bordered on four stars but never quite made it so at least i was glad i pushed through i never really liked anyone though shrug","1699":"enjoyed this book about a woman who always strives to improve her situation in life but encounters many roadblocks along the way","1700":"i can't really find a single fault here except that after 600 pages i think it should have been harder for me to say goodbye","1701":"it's really very good u0026amp i probably should have given it 4 stars but it was so hard to want to read the last 3 4 of the book once i picked it up i wouldn't want to stop reading but i kept putting it off because i didn't want to be witness to the inevitable deterioration of ed i need a light read after this one","1702":"fantastic character development and the story line rang exceptionally true to the time period in which it took place while not a case study the information presented with regard to alzheimer's disease medicaid etc was spot on at 600 pages this is not a book for a casual beach read however it's characters are complex and unforgettable i enjoyed it immensely","1703":"this review has been hidden because it contains spoilers to view it click here i won this book in a goodreads giveaway and will be recommending it to my reading friends the characters were real people with real issues and the writing was terrific as the daughter of a father who had alzheimer's that part of the book really affected me ed's letter to connell brought more tears yes it is a long book but well worth reading","1704":" thank you to netgalley and simon and schuster publishing for gifting me with an advanced readers copy of we are not ourselves by matthew thomas below is my honest review i wish i was able to adequately find the perfect words to do this outstanding novel justice we are not ourselves is a rare treasure a gem of a story that focuses around eileen tumulty leary an only child born to irish immigrant parents the story spans sixty years from 1951 - 2011 and the author does an incredible job detailing each decade with its subtle nuances and tones this is a character driven novel where the reader becomes fully intimate with each protagonist and finds themselves attached in a familiar way eileen endures a complex childhood and grows up determined to live out the american dream she meets and marries ed an intellectual scientist who captivates her heart but often disappoints eileen with his lack of ambition and aspiration the story navigates their marriage as they go from a young hardworking middle class couple to parents and eventually a more financially successful family along the way the family will deal with heartbreak illness deceit and triumph matthew thomas is a talented artist who creates a compelling poignant read that will leave you both emotionally spent yet satisfied and fulfilled i highly recommend this book as a must read","1705":" this is a huge read sweeping across the lives of the learys and capturing the love and loss under the shadow of alzheimer's in the early stages i kept anticipating a turn of good fortune and note of cheer and i did ask myself if i could manage 600 pages of a life less lived the early years seemed somehow out of kilter with the weight of the book which focuses on a handful of years and the progress post diagnoses the narrative just holds the reader through and ever word of about the second two thirds of the book is worth it thomas's little trick of reflection at the end of chapters was one i particularly liked to take away and think about especially eileen the ghost of the life i almost had alzheimer's is such a challenging subject i simply can't fathom how family and friends go on as they witness a loved one's 'presence' dwindle away if you got something from elizabeth is missing then this might also bring some further understanding","1706":"i wanted to like this book a lot more than i did i just found myself thinking that this story just went around in circles and never really held my interest it got great reviews so maybe it's me another odd thing is that there is no way this book could ever be a movie too much goes on inside the characters' heads and for that reason it was hard to see them as real people in the real world if that makes sense disappointed","1707":" an impressive first novel that chronicles the irish american leary family eileen ed and son connell first of queens then bronxville through the second half of the 20th century long on pages 620 very readable and short on characters mainly the three family members and plot developments mostly concerning issues like work family illness adolescence and education it provides an unusually well focused and penetrating portrait of a particular family in a particular time and place occasional inconsistencies or to me implausible developments and character responses are forgivable in such an ambitious first effort","1708":"wow i have never been so happy for a book to end there is absolutely no reason why this is as long as it is i couldn't connect with a single character and the fact that the mother in the story called her son the boy throughout the entire book literally almost drove me insane i tried this for an audiobooks com free trial and i chose poorly i found the main character the mother to be extremely whiny and ungrateful i really just did not enjoy this read","1709":"a beautifully character driven book about the nuances of life and love i can't say too much without giving away a key piece of the plot but i will say i hope i love and am loved as much as eileen and ed loved one another","1710":" this is as close to perfect as you're going to get not just from a debut novel but from any novel period there's such great heart in here primarily the story focuses on eileen leary a tough as nails nurse originally from woodside queens but each member of the family--big mike eileen's father ed her husband and connell her son--gets his due you feel irretrievably drawn to all of them so that every heartbreak either minor or major becomes your heartbreak and grips you long after you've put the book down whether it's at the end of the first chapter or the last i am not ashamed to admit that this book had me in tears several times during rush hour on the long island railroad thomas pulls no punches each character endures his or her share of failure and suffering but redemption is always close by either in the form of fatherly advice on a pilgrimage to cooperstown or in the day to day selfless tasks eileen must perform for her husband in the face of tragic illness as far as the prose goes there were too many moments to count in here that left me awestruck nearly every page had something on it i wanted to highlight underline and commit to memory what you have here is a work of a genius but he's a genius with a heart as big as his brain despite thomas's obvious great gifts and talents--and they are truly astounding--it's his great love and understanding of humanity that make it such a special read","1711":"what a bleak book it's definitely a first novel and one which makes you wonder about the author's family history because it's written so vividly but the longer i read the more i was invested in it i hope his next novel stands up to this one and i hope it's a little more cheerful","1712":"i loved this book there are some wonderful books that come along and change your view of the universe and this was one of them a great epic novel of two generations this could be the female version of willy lohman the writing in beautiful quite terse actually despite the length","1713":" i don't really get the buzz on this novel i haven't yet read the professional reviews but will go check them out now that i'm done as the child of second generation irish who aspired to the suburbs and got there i found the story of eileen's upbringing and her desires to improve her lot in life interesting but i couldn't reconcile eileen's lack of understanding on what was happening in her family midway through the book i also thought the writing was mainly pedestrian with just barely enough decent sentences to keep me going there is a beautiful passage at almost the very end that made it worth finishing so i would rate it 2 5 if i could but will round up for the beginning and the very end","1714":"i sort of enjoyed this book which is a weird statement considering the subject manner the story was sweeping and followed a whole life and i enjoyed it and when her husband started showing signs of alzheimer's i should have stopped reading but i'm glad that i didn't even though even though because it was the most realistic portrayal of dealing with alzheimer's that i've ever read and for some reason i've accidentally read a bunch the feelings her son has the reasons why he doesn't come home the way she keeps working as a way of escape the guilt they both feel because of it i know those feelings i had those feelings this book really spoke to me as far as that was concerned","1715":"this book was ok it went through a lot of years and pages before the book got to anything about the illness of alzheimer's and how this family coped shows the different ways that people react to this although not a medical book it touches on that there are options of things like drugs home care or nursing homes using insurance","1716":" i feel that matthew thomas just got everything right with this book at first as the narrative follows eileen i thought a man couldn't have possibly written this it's too perfectly female but then when i got to the connell parts of the book i thought okay he got the male perspective perfectly too the most perfect of all though is queens eileen's mother clean s bathrooms and offices at the bulova plant yup that's exactly the right job for a woman in queens to have and later she took a job cleaning grammar schools in bayside she complained about being beholden to the long island rail road schedule which was just downright spooky to read as i rode the lirr to my own job i do most of my reading on the train and it was so neat to be reading about eileen's apartment in woodside and to glance out the train window to see the apartment buildings in woodside the most surreal part for me was this at the exit for northern off the whitestone expressway she took pleasure in seeing shea stadium empty at 14th street she headed over to thirty fourth avenue because she didn't like driving through corona on northern i know exactly that route i drove the same way when i worked in jackson heights while eileen takes the route because it depressed her to live next to a neighborhood that run down i used to take it to avoid the traffic on northern boulevard and when connell gets into trouble at the park i knew exactly what park it was the one the principal would warn the kids not to go to over the loudspeaker at the end of school every day just like eileen complains those streets are filled with the smells of indian foods the kids who go to catholic school go to st joan of arc having a driveway to park in is the ultimate convenience it was cool to read about a small section of a neighborhood that i know rather well from working there for three years any of my is 230 friends who bother reading my reviews you might want to pick this book up if only for its amazing and perfect intimacy with the neighborhood the setting isn't all that felt familiar however this is an irish family who adores baseball even if it's the mets but i guess i have to forgive that because it's the right team for a queens family to root for one of my family's favorite jokes the one where one egg is un oeuf is here eileen names her son after a book the parallels to zack's life are here too as connell runs track and ed studies psychopharmacology and is courted by merck this all leads me to ask if i would be as enamored by this book if it didn't have all these familiar moments i have to say yes because the latter two thirds lack all the recognizable details that are present for me in the first third and i still loved it there's so much here about the human experience that i think any reader will find overlaps with his or her own experience it's the kind of book that makes you realize the significance of everyday moments in ordinary lives it's the kind of book that makes me marvel at the craft but at the same time think i could write a book like this and when thomas writes about things with which i have no experience to list them would be to give away unnecessary spoilers i can imagine them so fully that i know it wasn't just familiarity that was helping me to call to mind familiar places and types of people but rather his skilled and masterful writing eileen is such a well crafted character because she is flawed and makes mistakes but is still sympathetic and she grows and changes in such a real and often subtle way she makes so much sense as a human that i almost can't believe she's a fictitious character mr thomas if i were you i would be reading these goodreads reviews from my real life readers so i can only hope that you're reading this so i can say thank you for writing such a great book","1717":"it is a long story some of it is not that well written i wantrd to like at least one of the three main characters but did not feel much sympathy for any i would not say it is a great novel but the story is alright pretty depressing i don't recall anyone saying the words i love you","1718":"a draggy first novel his female character was not very believable to me but it was an interesting examination of grappling with a diagnosis of alzheimers","1719":"a heart breaking story of love and loss and the short comings of people it reignited my great fear of not knowing yourself or being alone with no one to reassure you of who you are at heart","1720":"a devastating and beautiful debut that's all i'll lead with for now i went into we are not ourselves knowing next to nothing and i'll be honest i may not have pursued it had i known more without some serious recommendations so i'll be that recommendation for any readers out there like myself this book will break your heart but you won't want to stop reading spanning across three generations this novel could certainly be called epic but it's composed with the subtle turns that lead to the love hope disappointment denial and insights in daily life as time passes thomas takes these themes and composes an original and quiet tragedy of the american dream and it's a complete page turner the characters will frustrate you but you'll feel frustrated for them as well especially as the picture becomes clearer in a way only the outside perspective of a reader can see beforehand but life continues for the characters of we are not ourselves and time makes no exceptions this novel feels so realistic in it's character growth that i'm inclined to believe thomas has dealt with some of these struggles in his own life the weight of the realizations and actions of these characters moved me in such a way that i felt i knew them and i'm not exaggerating when i say page turner i stayed up way later than i should to finish this last night i just couldn't stop this is a solid debut but in some ways it feels very much like a first novel while i'm generally satisfied with the way it wrapped up some aspects did feel a little bit clean this didn't really bother me though and may have added some unnecessary stress for the reader i seriously look forward to reading more of thomas in the future we are not ourselves is one of this year's best debut novels highly recommended i received my copy free in exchange for an honest review thank you netgalley and simon u0026amp schuster","1721":"4 5 stars could have rounded up or down i loved this book it was well written a poignant character study across multiple generations","1722":"goodness i didn't realize this book is mainly about one family's struggle with early onset alzheimer it was difficult to get through it would be really helpful for any family who is beginning their journey with an alzheimer patient family member","1723":"this was a struggle for me to finish i felt is was way too long and some of the characters especially eileen were not likable or even consistent in their reaction to events","1724":"i really enjoyed this book and the characters although it was very in depth and long at times","1725":"this is a difficult to enjoy book sometimes a challenging read nevertheless a real life story the characters are memorable not always like able gritty and dramatic not for the faint hearted but gutsy and real well researched and written personally could not connect with his writing too cold and conventional for me","1726":"one critic likened this book to the work of jonathan franzen that should have warned me i found it well written dense occasionally plodding and discovered i had no little sympathy for eileen tumulty despite her sad prison","1727":"boring","1728":" this epic saga of an irish catholic family commences in queens in 1941 with eileen tumulty the mc whose story begins when she is about nine years of age through her eyes we see the effect her father has on her with his stories his drinking and his larger than life essence her remote mother also a heavy drinker stops drinking at one point but life does not seem better for her even at this early age we see eileen's yearning for a rich tapestry of love family and beautiful settings she has her eye on bigger and better things so when she meets ed leary in her college years when she is studying nursing there is a pull something about him that feels like home but as they begin their journey and even after their son is born we see the chasms growing between them as what they each want seems to differ more and more with time ed's quirks seem more and more irritating to eileen as she realizes finally how much they have grown apart and perhaps they never wanted the same things and she only saw what she wanted to see eileen's longing for what she envisions for them the house the neighborhood and the life drives her to take actions but will the changes they make contribute to other more drastic upheavals in their lives what lies beneath ed's behavior and what will eileen have to do to bring about the serenity she craves the tragedies sadness and poignant moments that linger over the rest of we are not ourselves a novel kept me going wondering and even hoping that there would be some miraculous resolution to the changes in their lives what was great to see was eileen's strength in the face of life's unexpected reversals ed's traits that seemed annoying earlier in the story are now seen for what they were a harbinger of what was to come connell the son was difficult to pin down for me in his youth he seemed on the brink of choices that could derail his life but then almost magically he seemed to turn things around what i did not like about him was his inability to see things from his parents' perspective and his obliviousness to any needs but his own but time itself corrects this and in the end we see a new and improved version of him ready to confront his legacy and carve out his own a compelling story that touches on issues with which families struggle even without the tragedies how marriages are often entered into without thought to how the individuals will manage when the early love no longer sustains them and then we see that the commitment and the early bonds step in to spotlight the deeper and lasting foundation beautiful prose that created wonderful images of a family a life and the legacies left behind 5 0 stars","1729":"the story line explores the stages of life from childhood dream to adulthood reality the characters are strong and intelligent players in a life of transition wonder and hope matthew thomas carefully weaves a story of a father son and wife from the conception of the family to the redefinition of what family life is we are not ourselves is the story of all of our lives and a read worth the time and effort","1730":" source netgalley in exchange for a reviewi must be on a 'family' book trend because my previous book also dealt with families warning this is a long book however i feel that the length of the book is appropriate considering it spans the life of eileen her father is a larger than life character he is the guiding force in his little irish immigrant community in new york he is respected and valued and eileen loves seeing him in action however her young life takes a change after her mother struggles coping with the aftermath of a miscarriage the family dynamic shifts and eileen has to carry the brunt of the family load which ultimately shapes her for the rest of her life i rallied with her as she became a nurse found a husband and finally had a child of her own however just like a real family member i became annoyed with her persistent struggle never being satisfied with her life she wanted to promote the image of a perfect life so much that at times that i wanted to slap her but she was realistic matthew thomas did a great job in making the characters believable if you have ever had a family member diagnosed with alzheimer's and have seen the toll it takes on the person and the family you will not be disappointed with this book it is soul searching and heart warming it is a realistic love story that has stayed with me since i have finished the book days ago","1731":"i cannot finish this book not because it's not good but because the subject matter is too difficult for me based on my experience with my mother's long illness i read half of it and what i read was excellent matthew thomas has written well about the life of a family in america in the last half of the 20th century","1732":"4 5 stars not quite a 5 star novel but better than 4 stars the final two thirds of the novel is 5 star a superb narrative of the novel's main characters dealing with the early onset alzheimer's disease a main character is diagnosed with it is the best depiction of a person serving as a caretaker of a loved one with alzheimer's disease that i have read despite the grim disease the novel remains sympathetic and interesting to read throughout however the first third of the novel drags in places and seemed to me to serve primarily as a lengthy introduction to the rest of the novel i look forward to future books by this author","1733":"i just finished reading this and highly recommend it beautifully written it's quite long and worth every minute of your time","1734":"this review has been hidden because it contains spoilers to view it click here cant say i disliked it but then didn't find it an exciting engaging read i did finish only to find out how the man character ended up living her life after the death of her husband","1735":" this book is both heartbreaking and joyful the straight forward story of one woman's hardworking life from her childhood in queens very tree grows in brooklyny to her nice normal marriage to her son's modest aspirations for all its quiet normality it was captivating and moving a fast read for all its thoughtful prose and prosaic plot the marriage at the heart of the book is one that i've often suspected in life but seldom seen in books well adjusted and rewarding with glaring imperfections","1736":"a bit dark and long but great character development really paints the day to day on what caring for someone with alzheimer's would be like","1737":" i won an arc from a goodreads giveaway i have no idea why i read all 620 pages of this book maybe it was the glowing letter written on the first page as an introduction by the v p editor in chief marysue rucci that she has worked in publishing for over 20 years and this is a magnificent and moving debut novel if she had to wait 20 years for another it would be worth the wait i have not worked in publishing i am merely a reader i enjoy books that move me be it to tears laughter or insight the only thing that moved me in this book was boredom it just went on and on and on and on and you get the picture i did not like the main character eileen at all in all the pages you never felt any closeness to the characters eileen was extremely superficial concerned mostly with acquiring dreams of grandeur and status she was never satisfied or content with any aspect of her life the author sited every little nuance and thought projected scenarios but failed to mention major events over half way through the book it was mentioned they went to italy what did i miss something i would think that that was pretty monumental and would have been mentioned not same with disneyland and there were other things too and who the heck was virginia way late in the book eileen went to virginia's home but didn't introduce herself she was too embarrassed this seemed to be the norm too random chapters thrown in that had no pertinence to the story or if it did i couldn't wrap my brain around the correlation i kept waiting for something momentous or some revelation nothing i kept waiting for it to be the great american novel as ms rucci stated the only recommendation i can make about this book is that i wouldn't inflict this on anyone so the book is going in the recycling bin added note i rethought the recycling bin i am going to make a craft with the book i'll post pics when i finish it","1738":"i read this in two parts because i had to return it to the library request it again and wait for it the first part is definitely better i really got caught up in eileen's ambitions for a more fulfilling life i could see where she was coming from and seeing her background how inadequate she felt in acquiring it i thought this book portrayed alzheimer's disease extremely well also the way people react to it it was a bit disjointed and sometimes i was confused maybe i have alzheimer's","1739":"finally finished this book you may have noticed that it took me longer than usual must admit that it did not engage me as the reviews had led me to believe i found it unexciting even tedious although some of the subject matter is topical the early onset alzheimer's the epilogue was the most lyrical part of the book too bad","1740":"more like a 3 5 the writing was good although there were definitely parts that felt rambly and i skipped long lists of descriptions of baseball games and baseball statistics that i neither understand nor particularly care about like there was one point where an entire page was dedicated to listing off players' statistics i guess that's to make it seem more realistic the character cares so much about baseball they talk this much about it but if your reader doesn't care that much about baseball don't force them to trudge through so much detail about it the insert of this book calls it a message of hope perfect for our times um i did not find this book hopeful whatsoever it made me absolutely terrified and depressed about the idea of aging and not just because of the whole degenerative disease thing i found myself at one point in the book where there was some anticipation about this will make my mom so happy in which i just said to myself no no it won't it will make her upset because nothing goes right in this book this book is about life not going the way you wanted it to or the way you planned it out in your young daydreams it sends the message to not have grand expectations for life because they won't happen you will live a mundane life that sure is happy well contented let's say happy seems a little strong for this book at times but also has plenty of disappointments and then you die i think it was the sense from the main character that turned this book from possibly being a decently hopeful book into a miserable one for me she marries a man she really loves and they are happy together so really that's a pretty nice life however the main character is constantly dissatisfied with her lot in life she always wants more financial security her husband to have a better job for them to live in a bigger house in a more upper class neighbourhood she's never truly content and that sends the aforementioned message overall this book is far too depressing for me to ever choose to read again and 610 pages of depression is far too much to slog through to get the maybe 10 pages of hopefulness","1741":"could not get through this book","1742":"a well written story of a family living an ordinary life with all its disappointments small and large petty resentments and hopefully at the end the wisdom and perspective to understand what it all means i teetered throughout the book between respecting eileen tumulty leary and wanting to slap her silly at the end i happily felt more of the former than the latter the audio version is expertly read by mare winningham","1743":"eileen the main character was so shallow self centered self absorbed and clueless i intensely disliked her and the book i have been a nurse and my mother had alzheimer's i diagnosed poor ed at least 100 pages before the great nurse eileen cared enough to even consider it","1744":"eileen tumulty leary wants to get out of her shared house in deteriorating jackson heights and move into the upscale bedroom community of bronxville how's that for a plot summary i wouldn't have thought 620 pages of real estate lust would have kept my interest but it did in reality the book is about more than a patch of land eileen has married a research scientist who is also a community college professor she believes that ed's the answer to her burning desire to leave her irish immigrant background behind and move up in the world but it turns out he doesn't share her striving ambition causing cracks to open up in their marriage things aren't helped along by the attitude of their son connell who also shrinks from his mother's attempts to orchestrate his life while the author could have painted eileen as an overbearing and entirely unsympathetic character he doesn't she is a finely nuanced character with her good points and her bad points she can be cold her marriage is described as the negotiated submission of her fierce independence and she can't bring herself to even hug her own son but she also is loyal to her family her career as a nurse and her friends when disaster strikes the family she embraces what needs to be done no matter how difficult the situation i'd give the book five stars if it had remained focused on eileen ed and their marriage but toward the end of the book the narrative shifts in part to connell i just had no interest in his life once he left for college and didn't feel it added anything to the story but still the author's story is wholly absorbing i remember my own mother leafing through the want ads of the local newspaper on our kitchen table in the unfashionable west side of our city circling the nice houses for sale on the east side it made me uneasy because to me it was tangible evidence that my mother was unhappy with her life no matter that it seemed a pretty good life we never moved though at least eileen has the courage to try to make her dream come true","1745":"i finished it but there were times i thought i wouldn't such a depressing life","1746":"this is an epic story of a family and how they deal with a diagnosis of alzheimer's this story show us holier can change in one moment with a few little words","1747":" i am giving matthew thomas five stars for this thoughtful rendering of an irish family over decades he patiently constructed a prodigious mountain out of the ordinary pebbles in his characters' lives we get an excellent picture of their day to day interactions dreams and expectations we see some of those aspirations finally take root though nothing really comes easily to any of them thomas takes us on a journey that circles a disease bringing us quietly closer little by little to its epicenter he does a skillful job with voice tone and character development i wish i could have 'seen' eileen one of the protagonists more clearly although he says later on that she was beautiful i never really got that sense i certainly never got the sense that she or any of the other characters considered it an asset and eileen was definitely in pursuit of whatever assets she could gather when the disease subsumes them all and their lives change thomas goes into great detail about the routines with friends etc that change as a result of it i do wish that he'd planted some of these friends and their routines earlier in the story so i could have experienced those losses with eileen but this is the only flaw i was conscious of as i arrived at the last quarter of the book in spite of it we are not ourselves is an epic achievement by a thoughtful writer i enjoyed it very much and i expect the characters will stay with me for some time","1748":"the subject of this book was heart wrenching and i felt it could have drawn me in more if it was not so long we knew how the story was going to end i think the writer could have been a bit more focused still enjoyed the book just was difficult to get through","1749":"i had heard rave reviews about this book i tried to get into it really i did i just found it too depressing i've been through a lot of things similar to the experiences in the book so i guess it was a bit too true to life i read as escapism so it just hit too close to home the writing was very good i can appreciate that the writer has talent but it just wasn't the book for me","1750":"a beautifully written highly moving book i really loved reading this one","1751":"this took me forever to read because it became such a downer the first half was good mostly the first quarter but then i gradually lost my empathy for the characters and they became tedious i guess i had hopes something would happen or i would have just quit","1752":"this family saga sucked me right in from the start audiobook note actress mare winningham does a very nice job as the reader","1753":"i really enjoyed this novel","1754":"this book is so good and so well written i could not put it down achingly sad in some parts so real i was drawn into the lives of the characters especially eileen i at times liked her despised her loved her and in the end admired her great read","1755":"i absolutely loved this novel the pace is slow but stick with it it is so incredibly rewarding it is heartbreaking at times poignant and tremendously moving i found several passages that i simply had to re read several times because i just loved them so much","1756":"following one girl's life from childhood through adulthood as daughter wife mother and widow finding out that what we think we want may not actually live up to our expectations this one kept me up at night i was so enthralled and wanting to know how each dilemma was addressed how each life event unfolded and how each person grew","1757":" i just finished we are not ourselves and i loved it so much i want to turn back to the beginning and read it again how can i leave these people eileen who fought her way through life with everything she had suffered more hardship than anyone deserves and always yearned for more connell who behaved as any teen boy would pulling away from his parents and trying to turn into a man by being distant and aloof and ed poor ed who was smart and strong and loving and saw his demise coming probably from a long way off they break my heart these people and what can i say about an author who made these people come so alive for me that i honestly forgot they were just characters he made up i felt a lifetime of emotions in these pages joy anticipation pity sorrow love frustration anger tenderness and what i came away with at the end it's all worth it all of it","1758":"i don't know how to review this book i had a hard time getting into it i didn't like or dislike the main protagonist eileen leary she story was stilted at times and it didn't seem that the characters were well developed i couldn't stop reading the book however and after a little more than half the book it becomes clear what this book is al about it's not a happy book and at times it's painful to read about this family","1759":"a bit laborious to read and it took a long time for me to like the main character read it based on a review by anna quindlen she heralded it as the book of the year i ended up making peace with the book and the time i spent reading it but it was not the stuff that a book of the year is made of","1760":"long and sad and depressing for all of which reasons i could not give it more than three stars however its portrayal of family life of aspiration in the late twentieth century and of the slow inexorable disintegration of a man it is very good but i could not say you must read this to anyone i actually like or care about","1761":"i loved this book never before have i been so drawn in by a 600 page novel the writing makes you literally feel like you have known these characters a long time and makes you root for them from the beginning getting up early taking 10 minutes before lunch to sneak in a chapter letting the kids watch one more music video on tv to read a few more pages it is that kind of book and those are rare","1762":"3 5 stars very well written but i'm still not sure if i liked the protagonists","1763":" i will be thinking about the characters in this lovely novel for some time i think it's the story of eileen the daughter of irish americans living in queens ny and we meet her for the first time as a child dealing with the dysfunctions of a mother too attached to alcohol and a father who is the neighborhood wise man but can't seem to fix what is ailing his wife eileen becomes the family caretaker much too young which is to have a profound effect on the choices she makes regarding her future when she meets ed leary she sees him as a way out of her blue collar cramped existence and into a more elite level of society with more prestige more income and more security eileen has ambition for the both of them but ed doesn't always see things through the same lens as eileen and is looking for fulfillment above a higher paycheck from his career to eileen's disappointment there is much much more to this story but to go beyond this point would give too much away this is a story of a life a marriage and a family and through the banal details of their lives we are pulled in with them and fully experience all their small happinesses but also their quiet despair while the book takes awhile to get where it's going the journey is worth the ride i highly recommend this novel","1764":" 3 1 2 and hard to rate if you're looking for a novel with hidden secrets and mysteries this is not for you it's a story of daily life for second generation immigrant family trying to ride the tide of the american dream in the latter part of the 20th century there's not a lot of action but there are many beautifully written scenes that for those of us of a certain age can certainly relate to this book was just way too long 200 pages shorter and this would have been a much more readable and powerful novel","1765":"i found this book compelling because in so many ways it is my story if you have any interest in knowing what it is like to love and care for someone with alzheimer's disease you should read this book well written could have used better editing in my opinion but a powerful story all the same","1766":"this review has been hidden because it contains spoilers to view it click here i received this book free from goodreads first readsi really enjoyed this book i read all 620 pages in three days i found myself engrossed in the story from the moment i started reading it for all i understood that eileen wanted more for her husband and family she was always trying to push him in a direction he didn't want to go ed's battle with alzheimers was truly heartbreaking and the letter he wrote to his son to read after his death made me cry all in all i found the book to be a good i received this book free from goodreads first readsi really enjoyed this book i read all 620 pages in three days i found myself engrossed in the story from the moment i started reading it for all i understood that eileen wanted more for her husband and family she was always trying to push him in a direction he didn't want to go ed's battle with alzheimers was truly heartbreaking and the letter he wrote to his son to read after his death made me cry all in all i found the book to be a good read more","1767":"this book belongs on the shelf next to mrs bridge and stoner it is a quietly moving and clear eyed look at a family growing up and coming together and apart and together again over the course of their lives the second half drew me in especially once i was given the answer i was seeking during the middle 200 pages ed and eileen's relationship puzzled me made me angry and ultimately reduced me to awe a soft oh escaping my lips as i realized the depth and complexity of their bond eileen's character is brilliantly written she is headstrong matter of fact solid and stubborn and she shines in her relationship with ed in a way that dazzled me as i turned each page this novel felt like as close a representation of real rich messy american life as i could hope to ever read i'll need to revisit this each decade","1768":" i couldn't give this book five stars because it was such a slow read early on i was about to give up one almost halfway in but i was determined to wait and find out why ed was acting so strangely and then he was diagnosed with early onset alzheimer's my dad has senile dementia clinically very similar to alzheimer's so reading the rest of the book was therapeutic for me the characters are very well realized so they aren't completely likeable all the time eileen's materialism and underlying racism really bothered me but i appreciated her growth over time overall a good book and worth reading","1769":"this book was difficult in so many ways and it was marvelous in others when you finish we are not ourselves you will know the characters so well you could point them out if they passed you on the street through the endless detail that is woven into the 102 chapters some of which you feel and some that make you flinch each on has an impact that by the end of the book is cumulative eileen the protagonist is not the most likeable person i ever read about she manages life more than lives it what i did like about her is that regardless of what life threw at her she found a way or should i say the will to accommodate it the men in her life husband ed and son connell were not everything she wanted but they were all she had and she treasured them as much as she could i started reading this book because i too grew up in queens new york i knew the streets eileen walked and the houses she and her neighbors lived in i saw the neighborhood change and i missed what it had once been fortunately i never developed eileen's hostility toward people who were not like her if i had one major complaint about the book it was the blatant racism that the author displayed through his characters he was ignorant and unfair in his portrayal of people of color any color other than white we are not ourselves is long and difficult to get through several times i put the book aside but i was always compelled to go back to it it is not a feel good book but in the reader will be better for having read it","1770":"i really liked this book it's always a treat to follow a character for as many years as this book covers i liked the complex flawed like able characters i liked how even when she is frustrated or disappointed eileen loves and remains loyal to her family there were a couple of indiscretions that i wish had been left out","1771":"story about the daughter of irish immigrants who wants a better life for herself than that her parents struggle to provide throughout her life she waits to live the life she expects she should have rather than living the life she does she's cold and distant but somehow still likeable she deals with her husband's fall into alzheimer's with courage and grace a powerful read","1772":" at first this was just another family story multi generational irish in new york city but then it turned into something more eileen dreams of escaping to a finer house in a better neighborhood with her scientist husband who will win awards and earn a large salary she works and pushes and encourages her husband ed and their only child connell to be more to go to the right parties and join the right groups her dream for her family does not turn out as expected when a debilitating illness threatens to devastate all she has worked for","1773":"i went back and forth between liking and disliking this book the characters are flawed as humans are wont to be and there were multiple instances when i wanted to ring one or another neck for making ridiculous choices holding ridiculous standards being ridiculously obtuse there were some odd transitions and a couple of unanswered questions a few times when action stopped abruptly and was never picked back up stuff i get hung up on when i want to know read more and there isn't any in the end though i was moved to tears and the wrap up was relatively satisfying so 4 stars it is well written though a plod at certain points and moving but not in a melodramatic way","1774":"i had a hard time reading this very sad storyline it was difficult to read","1775":" i'd like to give this book 6 stars i often like the books i'm reading i pretty much choose things i am likely to be a fan of my limited reading time is too precious but this book has been one i've truly loved the story covers so much ground but i won't go into the plot because it's possible to read about it elsewhere even though it seems to be billed as the book about the guy with early onset alzheimer's one of the things i found most engaging in the story was the way thomas can effectively switch from the minutiae of extraordinary moments that occur in everyday experiences to the broad brush treatment of days and weeks and months in the lives of a family there are certain passages in this book that articulate as well as anything i've ever read the feelings of love dismay frustration regret disappointment and joy that surround marriage and family and the way that parents and children communicate and mis understand each other the central character eileen is as complex a heroine as any before her and she is so fully imagined and fleshed out that sixty years of her life on the page feel weighty and 'real' to me i'd love to see a book of short stories about eileen but i think that's probably asking for too much and i'll happily take the pleasure i've had reading this very long and entirely satisfying and moving book","1776":"my comments are spoiler free i picked up an arc at bookexpo america had heard a lot of talk about it and said hello to the author at the su0026amp s booth it wasn't an official signing he was there i think simply to meet readers there was a little line of us waiting for the arc due to the aforementioned buzz and the author seemed a little surprised by this and chuffed to meet enthusiastic readers i really enjoyed we are not ourselves as others have pointed out it is a little long and it is in no rush to tell its story before beginning i studiously avoided spoiler reviews and advise you to do the same i am not unfamiliar with the topic twist in the story yet i didn't see it coming the author's handling of the story from the mid point on is sure and compassionate i sometimes found it painful to read but because the core of the story is the family's relationships and their life spun across a generation it is a very satisfying read","1777":"3 words read this book","1778":" in compliance with ftc guidelines i safina lalani herein disclose that i received the book for free through goodreads first reads to give this book stars demeans it it likens it to other works of fiction it's not powerfully captivating a masterpiece of fiction destined to bring one to one's knees the book's description on its front flap to its back flap oh how it so reminds me why i never ever read the back cover of a book before finishing the book itself i read the book because i read everything i loved this book but i don't love everything the story is about a person it's about not being any person anymore in so many ways the book captures life at its most difficult its most agonizing its most beautiful times it's not a romance story but in a way it is it's a love captured with every action through the minute things the major things between each character and the other between the characters together it's about overcoming no accepting what life has to offer and no more it's about having known something undisclosed to others but others only find out you've known it all along go back analyze your behaviour then and it makes perfect sense read this book read this book i am surprised with how much it brought me to tears disclosed the harsh realities and the triumphs of life i was sad inside of myself not externally but being sad inside yourself that a book evokes so much in you that you can't help it that that is the best kind of book read all in one sitting because i couldn't even think of eating of anything more of responding to texts calls the book made a world different than the world that i am in the book was my world during the time i was reading it all else mattered none i was not myself just as the book's title we are not ourselves","1779":"interesting story but a hard read because i disliked the two protagonists so much","1780":" 3 5 stars bumped to 4 for the fact that it was so well written not quite 4 or even 5 due to the unnecessary length of this novel it's classed as an epic but didn't feel as epic in scope as it did in sheer number of pages lengthy works seem to be my favorite so it's not that i shy away from a high page count it's just in this case it seemed to be 600 something pages just for the sake of it i found the characters pretty unlikeable but at least very believable it was a book i looked forward to picking up though aside from the subject matter it was an easy read thanks to the author's style and the way he moved the story along despite a lack of plot lovers of character driven fiction will like this one","1781":"somber poignant novel on timely but relatively unexplored topic 4 1 stars if i could make days last forever if words could make wishes come true i'd save every day like a treasure and thenagain i would spend them with you croce time in a bottle 1972an elegiac novel to a committed wife whose husband suffers early onset alzheimer's i found particularly poignant her coping with the loss of her dreams of a husband who's a dashing successful professor arriving each evening to a beautiful home in the perfect suburb transformed into a constant pain and loneliness as passion and all their past slowly slips away a pure work of artistry in development of the characters of the wife the husband and their son quite a downer though yet not nearly as depressing as a little life","1782":"i really liked this book but not sure how to describe why it is 600 pages of about a 50 year story of only a very few people it does seem to have an honesty about it and the people seem real it puts me in mind of wally lamb's writing and it supposedly also takes him about 10 years per book","1783":"interesting read but very long and the characters were not very relatable for me i dragged myself through the second half of the book","1784":"i read most of the reviews on goodreads which persuaded me to buy u0026amp read all 611 pages of this book i've now lost faith in goodreads reviews why would you inflict this ungodly slow book on me you know that sharp tingly feeling you get when soap gets inside an open wound and you press down on it trying to make it stop well that's a pleasant experience compared to reading this book what crap","1785":"this is one of the best books i've read in 2014 i think it is brilliantly written and captures the modern american dream there are universal themes around aging family mortality that will resonate with everyone i didn't know what i was missing is the best line of the book","1786":"wano tells a version of the immigrant american dream story and it charts the growth of a person and of a group with grace and clarity i cared about the characters and felt curious about their foibles and their development modest spoiler alert the novel does turn into a prolonged story of medical decline and that gloom came to feel like work it is of course unfair to compare anything to yanigahara's a little life but in that novel the gloom is utterly compelling and captivating in wano it is simply gloomy and i missed the freshness vitality and energy of the early chapters","1787":"absolutely loved this book","1788":"loved it cried like a baby but loved it","1789":"received as an arc from the publisher started 6 22 14 finished 6 30 14 excellent story of an irish family's ups and downs from 1951 to 2011 there were times when i thought of the expression if it weren't for bad luck this family would have no luck at all the author took the everyday activities of a family and turned it into remarkable reading","1790":"this is a very well written book about a 1st generation irish family with the main character having a difficult childhood and hoping for a better life as an adult with a stable marriage and economic prosperity the dream seems to be coming true until an inescapable darkness enters their lives you can see this coming for some time and it is very very sad for everyone seemed so realistic in parts that one wonders if the author experienced a similar situation in his own life","1791":"best book in a long time","1792":"the ten hours i spent reading this book are gone forever wish i had done something else with that time the first 200 pages were ok","1793":" this arc was obtained at bea14 in exchange for an honest review eileen tumulty grew up in woodside queens with her irish immigrant parents in the 1940s hard drinking loud voices and tight finances were woven through her childhood and as a young woman she was determined to rise higher than her humble background when she meets ed leary she thinks that he will be the life partner she needs to make her goals a reality the best laid plans often go awry however and readers are invited along for the ride as eileen's life is placed before them this quiet gentle and contemplative tale beautifully describes the ridiculous heartbreaking and joyous nature of a life well lived even if it's not the life you had planned on","1794":" this book is a rare find the author is so patient with the story and so nonjudgemental of his characters even as they are consumed in petty tasks like choosing counter tops and obsessing over wealth he lets the story of eileen leary unfold at its on pace with simple prose about half way through the book settles on the big theme and from there it feels a little more plot driven and less pleasurable it gets too sentimental in the end as well i preferred the meandering character driven first half","1795":" this well written novel set in the new york metropolitan area in the years spanning 1951 to 2011 drew me in and then took a turn that i wished it hadn't although i saw it coming the rest of this review is a spoiler if you want to read a very realistic account of early onset alzheimer's the victim is a college professor in his 50s and the toll it takes on a family then by all means let this be that novel it is very affectingly and credibly told from the viewpoints of the wife and son i personally would have taken a pass had i known the theme","1796":"ugh i finally finished this one i'm still trying to figure out why i wasn't crazy about it because i do not shy away from long epic novels and i expected to like this more than i did it's essentially about the pursuit of the american dream the challenges people face while trying to improve over the last generation and the changing nature of the immigrant neighborhoods in new york eileen tumulty is not particularly likable but i think i was supposed to like her more by the end of the book the only good thing you can really say about her is that she loves her husband and son otherwise i couldn't get past the fact that for someone who was so bent on climbing the social ladder and fulfilling the past generations' dream of self improvement she was utterly prejudiced against everyone else trying to do the same","1797":"loved this book bit of a slow starter but then i couldn't bear to put it down sad and scary but heart warming and full of love really makes you think about life how quickly your direction can change how it affects those around you and how you should enjoy everything you have while you've got it yes of course it made me cry but it also made me realise how much i love the people that are important to me really well written great book","1798":" i received an arc copy of this novel via netgalley in exchange for an honest reviewmatthew thomas's we are not ourselves will surely be included in the lists of great american fiction in the style of we were the mulvaneys thomas takes the reader along eileen tumulty leary's life journey from a childhood wracked with alcoholic parents and lost ambitions to an early marriage and fears of infertility through parenting aging and the loss of a partner to alzheimer's the reader cannot help but feel as if eileen is a member of their own family brilliantly written deeply moving and inherently real we are not ourselves is an instant classic","1799":"the pace of this book is slow and deliberate but gripping heartbreaking and hopeful it's so honest and profound without being loud and manic t hey gave out no manual when you got married eileen thinks no emergency kit with a flashlight for when the power went out you had to feel your way around in the dark for the box of matches","1800":"great book alzeheimers again but so well done and captured the agony of the disease not only for the sufferer but for the family and friends","1801":"beautifully written but a very sad story an alcoholic mother and a husband with early onset alzheimer's","1802":"this review has been hidden because it contains spoilers to view it click here it took me a long time to finish this book part of it was being busy part of it was discomfort with some bleak realism i have heard this book compared to 'the corrections' and i can see why the plot element of the dad's alzheimer's packs a real emotional wallop especially his letter to his son at the end the main character is a strong competent woman who strives valiantly for her idea of the american family there were times when the story was heartbreaking i was not totally surprised se it took me a long time to finish this book part of it was being busy part of it was discomfort with some bleak realism i have heard this book compared to 'the corrections' and i can see why the plot element of the dad's alzheimer's packs a real emotional wallop especially his letter to his son at the end the main character is a strong competent woman who strives valiantly for her idea of the american family there were times when the story was heartbreaking i was not totally surprised see to see jonathan ferris and chad harbach mentioned in the acknowledgments due to family dynamics and baseball references recommended more","1803":"the person who wrote the back of the book summary should have read the book first at a certain point in the book the main character is looking back at her life with her husband and remembering fondly all these activities she did with him and it seemed completely inconsistent with the story up to that point i did not like this book and would not recommend it","1804":"it's hard for me to understand all the hype simon and shuster put out about this book and to give the author a million dollar advance i want to know who he knew this is a mundane story about mediocre lives that the editors in ny see as illuminating i quote marysue rucci from an article in the sept oct issues of poets and writer's it's about one woman's dreams and hopes and how she's been a striver and epitomized the whole middle class experience of the twentieth century and just when her gold and her vision is within reach a terrible tragedy befalls her family and her life veers off course it's about the heroism with which she responds to this i'm sorry i come from that middle class group and i strived to get where i am but this woman is selfish had a lot of opportunities and there is nothing heroic about how she deals with her husband when he get alzheimer's i'm a nurse and i'm offended by her actions it's a boring and depressing book please give me something uplifting like the unlikely pilgrimage of harold fry or blind your ponies their characters had to overcome tragedies but those stories uplifted us and made me want to be a better person i didn't like any of the characters and for me that is bad","1805":"having a hard time getting into this one too gave it 3 stars for the second half of the book as the book got into the father's alzheimers and the son's relationship with him it got better it was a slow start tho","1806":" eileen tumulty was born in 1941 to irish immigrant parents they live in a small apartment in queens and things aren't easy her dad drinks too much and her mother never seems happy eileen's goal is to create a better life for herself really it is the embodiment of the american dream that she's striving for so when she marries ed she expects greatness he's a researcher and professor at a local college and eileen is a nurse but she pushes ed to reach for more however ed's aspirations are different than hers he believes in working hard and doing good she wants him to go for promotions switch to a better school make more money etc but ed is content in being the best teacher he can be for the kids in the community their personalities could simply not be more different and though they love each other going through life and raising their son connell together is a struggle ed wants connell to have a great life to live fully eileen wants connell to have a full life too but that means something different to her than it does to ed to become a lawyer or doctor or politician she knows he has potential and pushes him to meet it as the daily struggles persist things get even harder when ed starts behaving erratically he starts forgetting things his students have started complaining that their grades are wrong he finds something out of place and he snaps completely losing control of his temper he sees all the groceries eileen has bought for the week and starts ranting about them eating too much and then starts throwing everything in the garbage eileen doesn't know what is wrong with her husband but she has had enough if a doctor can't find anything wrong with him she has no choice but to divorce him unfortunately their worst fears are confirmed he has early onset alzheimer's really we are not ourselves is a simple story one of a girl growing up in new york finding love marrying and raising a family but perhaps since it's such a simple story that's why it resonates so deeply with me i cannot think of another book i've read recently where each character feels so real and true they all have their flaws and i could find myself empathizing with each of them in different ways they are not caricatures by any means i felt like i knew them and was rooting for each one of them i found myself yelling at them in my head when they were making a mistake how could eileen not realize something was seriously wrong with her husband for so long stop focusing on a new fancy house and look at what's really going on connell stop being a brat and help your mother but it was these instances that made it feel so real the denial the depression the confusion the anger the love each character had deep thoughts and emotions that read so true it was the story of a family making their way through the difficulties in life and trying to make sense of it all and it was beautiful","1807":" this book nearly ruined my holiday by virtue of being so intensely bleak nearly a third of the way in it was dragging me down so much i very nearly stopped reading it i'm glad i didn't though i don't think i've cried so much from reading a book in my life that doesn't qualify as a recommendation or criticism however as challenging a read as it was it reminded me of the fleeting nature of life and how lonely it can be it inspired me to want to change things in my own life the descriptions of the alzheimers ed falls victim to are superb i can envisage this book being made into a tear jerking oscar winning film","1808":" i wasn't sure what to expect from this book when i started essentially it was a character study about one family told from eileen's point of view and occasionally her son's the first third half of the book is tedious the amount of detail is unnecessary where are the good editors any editors banal information does not an intriguing story make however just when i was about to give up when the grading scenes were repeated we finally get a conclusion to this part of the book and another chapter of life begins if you have ever loved someone affected by the situation described in this book you will find your heart breaking every couple of pages more than once i had something in my eye it is worth struggling through to reach the end however it is overly long you could cut out a good third and it is up there as one of the most depressing books i have read","1809":"i have not read a book this good in a really long time poignant story with interesting characters and so beautifully written amazingly good first novel for this author","1810":"i enjoyed this book the writing is beautiful and the circumstances thought provoking i loved the emotional ending could have used more editing it's repetitive in parts and could have been 50 pages shorter","1811":"oh what a book not a lot of action but a great family drama i am going to miss eileen ed and connell the author created real pwoplw in these characters people that i thought of before i fell asleep and the first thing in the mroning","1812":"simply heartbreakingly beautiful one of favorite books","1813":"a long consuming read but well worth the time","1814":"excellent right up there with the goldfinch","1815":"of this book were so unnecessarily long rambling and self indulgent the mechanic tone bothered me as did the story's dreariness and i'm not even talking about the main plot but everythin the first few chapters didn't capture my attention but upon my husband's insistence i plowed through although somewhat reluctantly and veeeeery slowly it's a tough call by the end of this 620 page read i did find myself depressed crying and caring about the dislikeable characters but man the first  3\/4  of this book were so unnecessarily long rambling and self indulgent the mechanic tone bothered me as did the story's dreariness and i'm not even talking about the main plot but everything preceding it there was just no contrast between the \"good\" times and the \"bad\" ones it was all bad happy moments were alluded to nostalgically but never shown in conclusion i'm not sure if \"we are not ourselves\" was worth reading or not whether i would recommend it or not whether i even liked it or not there was much to like but it gets drowned out amidst all the fluff i guess i wish this had been more focused","1816":"this book was beautifully written but difficult to read because there were very few upbeat moments it's a great book if you're studying sat vocab but i don't see any teen enjoying this story the reviews all say that the story is about conflicting views of the american dream but to me it was about two people who try to overcome the effects of their parents' troubles both financial and mental it is about the struggle to do better than where they came from the struggle to live happier lives and the question of what makes us happy it's also about a struggle to overcome genetic predispositions such as introversion and depression the happiness when it does occur in the book does not come from any big events but is between the lines in the everyday interactions between the characters is it bad to have financial dreams and desires this author seems to think so at least in my opinion there are beautifully written insights yet the book is too discouraging for my taste","1817":" this is one of those instances when getting the arc of the book is a disadvantage i wish i'd read it with a book club so i could have face to face conversations and figure out what the heck all the buzz is about this boring 200 pages too long book although the first 100 pages the early life of the protagonist were interesting in a tree grows in brooklyn kind of way i found the whole story arc plodding every life has struggle and every life faces tragedies large and small but mining the minutiae of every regular life doesn't make a masterpiece","1818":" every now and then and not as often as i would like you start to read a book you can not put down the language is not complicated so the story just flows and even if it is over 600 pages as this one is it never feels too long because you are encapsulated eilleen leary was raised in a downtrodden area of new york to hard drinking parents as she grew up she knew she would make her own life much different then eileen met ed and they where the perfect couple chasing the american dream as the years rolled on whilst both doting on their son connell but then the degenerative disease alzheimers comes in a slowly tears everything apart this story includes such moving characters and tenderly portrays the devastating effects such a disease can have on a small intense family unit but yet it is handled so thoughtfully by the author it is hard to believe this is the authors debut novel upon finishing this story i had to wait hours before writing this review as it was so powerfully heart wrenching and emotional and i could not get it out of my head this book is going to be one of if not my favourite of the year and there was not a thing i did not like about it a full five stars from me with an urging message that if you are only going to read one book this year read this","1819":"this review has been hidden because it contains spoilers to view it click here i liked this book but i struggled with the character eileen i felt like she was never happy in her life she spent so much time planning and working for more better things that i feel like she never got much chance to actually live her life overall i think it was a great snapshot of irish american life in new york at that time","1820":"beautifully and honestly written a flawed family trudges through the challenges of the second half of the 20th century the main character eileen reminded me of olive kittridge a wonderful novel","1821":"i don't want to tell you a thing about this book other than to say to read it immediately probably the best book i've read so far in 2014","1822":"read this after a friend's recommendation for me the characters' background was somewhat familiar yet as the story progressed i felt that i was watching a train disaster unfolding eileen is ambitious and hard working but her desperation to achieve certain dreams became more and more depressing","1823":"one of the best books i read in 2014 at times funny at times heart wrenching completely entertaining the whole way through","1824":"very well written and engaging","1825":" i liked this book a lot with the glaring exception that the main character is a nurse and the author seems not to have discussed any of the characterizations he made based on that with any actual nurses that she is in management but has attended hundreds of deaths is unlikely that an experienced nurse would feel that making her terminal husband dnr was slightly shameful is even more unlikely no experienced nurse would want their loved one to die in a code other than those complaints the book was a great exploration of early onset alzheimers painful to read sometimes but very compelling","1826":" excellent book very reminiscent of the harry angstrom rabbit series by john updike in it's decades spanning scope in a few sentences it's about the daughter of irish immigrants growing up in queens from the forties through the turn of the century nothing of specific import occurs in the book but the details on the minutiae of the challenges of life and relationships and the difference between what we what and what we get and the mis alignment of desires with those we love was very compelling every life faces challenges others don't understand or even perceive this is a great telling of one woman's struggles and triumphs","1827":"i loved this book even though i didn't always love the characters themselves an honest portrayal of the evolution of the relationship between husband and wife and between a father and son congratulations to matthew thomas on a heartwarming and heartbreaking novel","1828":" it's really hard to know how to review this book it's beautifully written moving and sometimes very heartbreaking the first part of we are not ourselves introduces us to eileen and ed and how their relationship began learning about eileen's home life and childhood helps us understand her motivations and desires we see why eileen is so drawn toward ed and i really enjoyed reading about the ups and downs in their relationship the second half of the book splits between the point of view of eileen and her son connell in another author's hands this could have been jarring or clunky but matthew thomas uses it in the best possible way we see the conflicts relationships and fears of each of the characters since this book is character driven instead of plot driven it can be a little slow nothing exciting happens but we get to know these characters completely i can't stress enough how engaging and captivating this book is matthew thomas is an author to watch and just as a bonus misha collins an actor who plays castiel in supernatural fell in love with this book too he's having a twitter bookclub for september that revolves around this book so get your hands on it if you can and join in https www facebook com officialmish","1829":"the first part was brilliant and maybe the end was too but the early onset alzheimer's subject matter was just too much for my little heart to handle","1830":" bowled away that this is a first novel for matthew thomas it made me cry multiple times and i'm not one to cry the characters are incredibly rich and layered the dialogue is excellent and he constructs such a detailed world that it was impossible for me to think it didn't exist this is a wonderfully written novel that any avid reader would appreciate things it is not a plot driven book funny short experimental minor spoiler as someone who lost a parent to a chronic disease i can say that matthew thomas writes connell's relationship with his father with stunningly accuracy","1831":"a well written volume of intensity that reminds me of wally lamb's i know this much is true in that it tells the story of a family through the years and the eventual diagnosis of the father's alzheimer's disease the author does a great job bringing the characters to life and i really loved the courageous but very real mother many times their interactions or dialogue made me laugh or really hit home for me the book lags a little in the middle but then picks up speed again so is well worth the effort it is long a letter from the father to his son moved me more than anything i have ever read that kind of writing is evident throughout congrats to the author on such a great first novel","1832":"don't bother reading this book i can't figure out why it's getting accolades the writing is choppy the chapters jump all over the place with no rhyme or reason and or connection to anything else and the characters are all un likeable","1833":"hmmm very hard to rate this book at times i was ready to give up i found it tedious and way too long at times the story was honest and so real i think it could have been shorter and still been a good book","1834":"long detailed book that i wasn't sure if i would finish and wasn't sure what the point of the story was about half way through it finally hooked me and i got it i stayed until the end and was sorry to finish and leave those characters","1835":" matthew thomas' first novel is inspiring motivating and intimidating i love knowing that an english teacher carved out time to craft this beautiful novel it gives me hope but what an act to try to follow i loved this novel it had me at the stanley kunitz epigraph i found the plot entirely engaging and the characters utterly relatable a high school teacher librarian myself i was afraid i wouldn't find time to read a 600 page novel in time for the monthly faculty book club i host but i couldn't put the book down the narrator keeps the plot moving as we glimpse the family drama that unfolds from the viewpoints of each of the characters eileen tumulty the young girl later wife and then mother who is practical and loving in an olive kitteridge sort of way edmund leary the professor husband and father who i picture as played by liam neeson in the movie version in my head even though the character is described as having black hair and connell their son and only child from whose viewpoint i found the unfolding of events most heartbreaking reading this story made me weepy it is not a happy tale it is a tale with the same kind of uplifting redemption i found in one of my favorite movies american beauty just this gratitude love we can never be reminded too often","1836":"a riveting family saga that delivers a trenchant moving and funny look at the middle class american dream compared to reality","1837":"took awhile to get into but eileen was a startlingly empathetic character heartbreaking","1838":"a big fat heart breaking page turner of a family saga eileen leary the daughter of irish immigrants grows up in woodside goes to college and begins a relentless pathological pursuit of a better life which to her mind means a better zip code the great queens novel","1839":"i struggled with this book i found the characters haunting though unlikeable at times and very frustrating yet i kept reading i like dark i like dysfunctional i'm fine with unhappy endings but i just didn't 'get' this book i weeped at times but overall found it to be incredibly sad and depressing","1840":"the story chronicles three generations of a family during a period of great economic and social change in america all of the characters were dysfunctional in one way or another and it was hard to feel any connection with them the book was well written with a cohesive underlying theme but the pacing was slow this is a thought provoking story especially relating to the affects of chronic disease on a family","1841":"www justtoomanybooks wordpress comwe are not ourselvesmatthew thomaseileen tumulty is the only child of alcoholic irish parents growing up in new york in the 50s and 60s she dreams of reaching an upper middle class respectability having a comfortable suburban life eileen feels that her key to that life is to marry the right man but she falls in love with ed leary it doesn't take too many years before she realizes his dream for the future is different than hers in time eileen and ed manage to have a son connell eileen transfers many of her hopes for the future onto her son but while she hunts for houses in respectable suburbs her huband grows more and more resistant and withdrawn eileen has to face the fact that life and her choices have led her to a very different place than the future she dreamed of as a young girl the story of we are not ourselves is nothing new but the characters are drawn with an incredible insight thst makes the book irresistible this is a book that you stay up late to read and wake up early to read but every so often you have to pause and just let the words sink in this is a book that spans generations and lifetimes but no words are wasted every song every literary reference every house has been crafted by the author as part of the story we are not ourselves is a story of family of dreams and of love in all its many forms it easily leapt onto my top 10 list for this year i believe we will be talking about matthew thomas and his brilliant writing for years to come","1842":"if you are looking for that next big book in which to lose yourself this is the one a long book 600 pages about the life of eileen she is the daughter of an irish catholic family in ny she could be so much more but since her options at the time are limited she has to live her life through that of her husband and son but along the way she discovers just how strong she really is one of those books you don't want to end shows that a well lived life is often a series of small moments","1843":" i debated between 2 and 3 stars but thought the ending was strong enough to redeem some of the unevenness of the rest of the book so i rounded up i didn't like this as much as i expected to based on reviews and friends' recommendations i thought the writing varied in quality some sections were beautiful and poetic others clunky and prosaic i also found i wasn't very emotionally involved in the story or the characters even though i expected to be because my family has gone through many of the same experiences i think this emotional distance developed in part because much of the writing felt expository focused on factual details for example descriptions of health insurance plans rather than revealing the deeper emotional truth in the characters' experience i felt it picked up steam in some places and so i would keep going in the hopes that it was taking off but there were also many times i thought i wouldn't even finish it overall a middle of the road reading experience","1844":" first of all this is a big book whenever i get something on kindle i can never be sure as to how 'thick' it actually is it took me 2 days to read almost non stop which for me is fairly slow but when i looked that it was over 600 pages i could see why anyway onto the review this was a well written novel but i just found it to be too long and my interest for the characters started to fade once i'd reached the midpoint we are introduced to eileen tumulty as a young girl and we follow her throughout her life as she meets her husband ed and they have their child connell the book follows the family through some key moments such as ed's illness which unfolds slowly and is heart breaking to read this is a book essentially about the american dream as a child eileen has very little and strives to make a better life for herself it is a though provoking book but did not need to be 101 chapters in length to achieve its overall message in my opinion thanks to simon u0026amp schuster via netgalley for a copy of this in exchange for an honest review","1845":"fiction at its most realistic at certain points it was almost as tedious as real life however if you appreciate family stories that explore real world problems it is worth reading","1846":"good family saga about illness and family relationships slow in parts as this is a long book but worth the read","1847":"too long and i could never quite grasp the point sine parts were good but through most of the book i just wanted to get to the end would not recommend","1848":"well writtenwell written and heartwarming perhaps i enjoyed it so much because i'm a queens native catholic and part irish love baseball and hold an appreciation for vivid descriptions and detail the intergenerational theme is also interesting from an immigrant to a second generation american","1849":"beautiful debut novel the characters are written true to life no sugar coating their actions and reactions to what life gives them parts were very hard for me having just gone through what this family goes through very honest and true descriptions of feelings and reactions","1850":"3 1 2 stars really my indecision comes from the up and down of the story itself i loved some parts others i'm afraid bored me to death as sometimes happens with 600 page books ~ i think the same story could have been edited down to 400","1851":"too long at times i was irritated with the main character and thought she was not all that likable she was dogged determined and single minded a great study of early onset alzheimer's","1852":"the book was a good read very thought provocative in a way especially in regard to how sick americans are treated by state i loved following eileen through her life is her story unique i don't think so what's unique about it is how she handled herself and her situation i don't know anyone with alzheimer's disease but i appreciate the gentle introduction as to how it is for the person relatives and society","1853":"great characters and an in depth portrayal of their family felt like i was slogging through it sometimes though","1854":" great character driven novel it felt like a modern updated tolstoy novel thomas does an excellent job of uncovering the nuances of his characters exploring their motivations but not judging them too harshly i loved how he captured the whims of our emotions how one thing someone says or does can affect your response or action almost without thought there are a couple of clunky chapters one on euthanasia and one on medicare that seemed preachy and out of place but that is being picky overall an outstanding book","1855":"i really loved this book","1856":"a haunting epic story that stays with the reader long after the final page has been turned thomas has created a masterpiece when i saw that some goodreads reviewers had marked this book at three stars at first i wanted to grab those people shake them by the shoulders and ask \"what is wrong with you \" but eventually i came to understand or at least i believe i do what it was that bothered them our protagonist is not always a lovable one she's deeply flawed and hard to bond with those who equate a lovable character with a well written book may indeed be disappointed not only by this story but by many of the great books as for me i am impressed my measure of extraordinary literature is that i am still thinking of or even wishing i could have a conversation with the main characters after i have finished reading i've moved on to other books and yet this one remains with me aw geez poor ed we didn't know and what's up with connell anyway it speaks to me on a deeply personal level as i find myself comparing my own family and relationships with the leary family given that i am a reader who absorbs a dozen books a month and sometimes more this says a great deal our protagonist is eileen who grows up in an irish immigrant family that cuts across the typical large boisterous poor yet loving stereotype of the new york irish instead she is the only child in a chilly quiet apartment relationships are often strange and distant despite the fact that her parents love each other and her the second bedroom is taken for most of her childhood by a tenant her father is a genial man well loved among the irish workingmen's community a union man and a hard drinker her mother is lonely hardworking and bitter until she also takes to drink yet her parents don't drink together but apart the only fun time is when relatives from ireland come across the ocean and spill over into her family's wee apartment as their final pit stop before finding a place of their own eileen grows up knowing that she wants more as her hormones work their alchemy and her body grows and changes she becomes disarmingly beautiful and she understands that marriage may be her ticket to better things once she finishes college and becomes a nurse she wants to marry a man of great capability and ambition she believes she has found him when she meets ed a brilliant young scientist with a promising career ahead of him between the two of them they ought to be able to bring in the money needed to live the good life by the time children come he should have climbed far and high enough that she can stop working and be happily domestic in a magnificent home it is the dream of the 1950's though she wants something a bit finer than a suburban house with a picket fence eileen's grasping nature and her harsh behavior at times toward ed and their son are off putting when their only child brings home a test marked 95% her husband exudes praise while she asks what happened to the other five percent i cringe at times she seems to understand that she is showing no more warmth than her own mother did yet the habits are ingrained she does not reach out for the hug does not easily part with praise and as it becomes clear that her goals and ed's are not really the same the marriage begins to founder the harder she pushes the more irritated i grow with her it's like watching a relative who is bent on self ruin i want to talk her out of this i want to hit the \"escape\" key for her i want her to be more empathetic more flexible but the one thing i absolutely don't want to do is put the book down then the unthinkable happens not at all what i expected though and everything that has gone before takes on new meaning as events unfold eileen must change also to say more would be to spoil the read and you should read it happily this is one book that works just fine on a digital device and i am grateful to the publisher and net galley for letting me read it that way but if you are a reader who needs the tangible object in your hands i will tell you that this is worth investing in all you need is an attachment to excellent literature absolutely brilliant i look forward to seeing more of matthew thomas's work in the future","1857":"ugh this took forever for me it just dragged on i didn't particularly care for any of the characters","1858":"solidly written this is an empathetic and realistic portrayal of the slow degenerative spiral of alzheimer's however the protagonist is fairly unsympathetic and unrelatable for the first 2 3 of the book and the alzheimer's patient is depicted as a saint both of these portraits make the relationship between the two less viable ambitious in scope the novel is a success in addressing alzheimer's and the pain it inflicts on everyone involved","1859":"i would say the first 1 3 of this book had awesome potential the second 1 3 was okay and by the final 1 3 i was basically forcing myself to finish it because i had already invested so much time into it i had a hard time liking eileen i never cared for ed so seeing him decline wasn't even difficult for me and don't get me started on connell kids like him are the reason society is in decline that boy really disappointed me","1860":" this is a very well written book about the complexities of human nature and the relationships that people form there were times especially near the start of the book when i nearly gave up but i am glad that i didn't there were times when i wanted to shake the main characters to get them to see what was going on around them especially eileen who seemed to judge her family and the rest of the world against some kind of personal barometer where they usually came up wanting i get that she wanted her son to have the advantages that she didn't and that she was bitter about her family's circumstances that she felt robbed her of the chance to be someone but her self centredness annoyed me this book made me reflect on my parenting skills and my own belief system though i doubt i could ever be quite as focussed as eileen i'm sure i will be reflecting on parts of this book for some time to come a mark of a great book in my opinion","1861":"very good especially for a debut maybe a bit too long nice to read a truly american novel written by an american","1862":"this book was stilted and didactic and yet utterly engrossing i loved how plot points and characters would disappear and reappear and you never knew when or why i know that sounds nuts but i wanted more i wanted to keep living with eileen and her family i wanted it to keep going","1863":"a remarkable depiction of the inner workings of several minds in present day america and some who led up to it extraordinary detail life changing in its reflections a new american classic gastby esque","1864":"sweeping saga of an irish immigrant's journey to fulfill the american dream well written but but lost interest in this rather slow paced story","1865":" i read this book on the recommendation of one of my favorite priests when i told him after mass that i was adding it to my to read list because of his sermon he grabbed both my hands and said it's good but it's sad very sad i'm warning you the book wasn't what i expected at all but father was right it was mop up my face sad at times and beautifully written i can't find any flaws in this author's debut novel it gets a full 5 stars from me the story is about three generations of irish immigrants primarily centered on the life of eileen tumulty leary eileen's childhood work marriage and dreams are the heart of the novel the reader learns eileen's background and understands her determination and the reason she responds to certain situations they way she does at times i was a bit angry with her harshness but i felt i understood why she reacted the way she did the author is so good at filling in details of the leary's lives that they feel real mets baseball games new year's eve dates concern about health insurance coverage childcare for connell commuting water in the basement what they watch on television etc the characters are presented in all their humanity making mistakes and creating scenes but there is a real decency to all of them a sense of love and a pervading desire to do the right thing the most wrenching scene in the book for me was a conversation between the father and son i could truly envision one of my sons' responding the same way to his father and asking the same questions that eileen's connell did i was a mess reading that chapter and one of the final chapters at the end of the book why read a depressing book surprisingly although it is one of the saddest topics imaginable the characters while flawed exude integrity there is a brief section on the eternal question why why me at some point we all wrestle with this and whether we believe things happen in life for a reason or not and how difficult it is to move on the things we had considered so important previously hold little meaning when confronted with a life changing event immersing yourself in eileen's story makes you think it gives you a lift to think that perhaps the universal truth in life what matters most is to love one another and try to do your best the little things may matter most","1866":"this review has been hidden because it contains spoilers to view it click here how could she have made him wear that watch for eternity especially with the gold band made me wonder if she ever knew or loved him","1867":"i'm glad i didn't stop reading though i'm still not convinced the book is epic in scope heroic in character as the amazon review claims i might say it is terribly sad if i liked any of the characters the reason for the four star rating is because this is a story i think i'll think about often i actually only highlighted two passages but both are meaningful to me the rhetoric of baseball was redolent of antiquity the hushed tones the gravitas the elevation of the pedestrian into the sublime 172 and the point wasn't always to do what you want the point was to do what you did and to do it well 554 those passages alone will keep me thinking about this book","1868":"i cannot recommend this book not because it was depressing it was but because of the way the end was written a major character is facing huge life decisions while suffering emotional turmoil then poof it's years later we see the result of the decisions but how was the emotion handled how were the problems solved i felt unsatisfied and annoyed by that omission","1869":"as many many others have stated before me this book could easily have been half the number of pages i'm a pretty fast reader but this book took me two months to finally finish the first 100 pages or so kept me very interested but then i realized i had absolutely no compassion for any of the three characters the husband is totally self centered and the wife the worst of them is all woe is me why can't we have nice things the son finally redeems himself at the very end as the book drags on with such tedious and drawn out detail i begin to like them even less than i thought was ever possible without ruining where the plot is headed there is a point where a normal person would feel sorry for the characters in their situation i did not it's one of those books that if you manage to get yourself half way through you've gotten too far to turn back","1870":"the writing itself was good but i would have preferred a lot of editing for content it could have been two good books one about marriage one about growing up as one book it felt like it meandered on without purpose","1871":" i was very much looking forward to reading this book i love long family stories and i was especially excited that this one takes place in queens a fair part takes place in bronxville too but i didn't know that knowing that a book follows a family over multiple years and knowing that it's getting a lot of acclaim is generally enough to get me interested and i didn't do a lot of research into what this one was about beyond that i didn't even read the full description much less any reviews i wish i had though the description wouldn't have helped i hated this book i hated almost every moment of reading it beyond the first 100 of 600 pages or so once eileen and ed are married the reader spends the next chunk thinking ed is a stubborn jerk but the truth is much worse ed has early onset alzheimer's and if i had known that there's no way on earth i would have picked up this book no way i would have wanted to spend around 400 pages reading about someone's decline in excruciating detail it's hard for me to separate my lack of desire to read about this from the book itself and i don't dislike sad books but i found this one to be incredibly depressing","1872":" this is a long book it could have been edited to about 450 pages that said it was still wonderful and affecting this is the story of eileen who grows up in a working class family always wanting more from life than she has she marries ed a college professor for whom she has great ambitions they have a son connell who forms a strong bond with ed that eileen cannot penetrate while she presses ed to accept a more upwardly mobile job a bigger house in a more prestigious neighbourhood a more expensive lifestyle he is resistant to every push she makes in spite of that she forces him to move to the big house in a new neighbourhood a change ed never adjusts to only a few years after the move ed is diagnosed with early onset alzheimer's disease and eileen's dreams collapse the book follows this trio from 1951 to 2011 when connell is middle aged and facing some serious choices of his own eileen is a complicated woman one who at times it is hard to like she is intolerant of ed's foibles even before his disease becomes undeniable her ambition outstrips her common sense financially and ed withdraws from her to avoid her disappointment as the book progresses however eileen's vulnerabilities begin to catch up with her and she becomes a more sympathetic character although i never lost the desire to give her a shake from time to time altogether this is a worthwhile book to read the characters are complex and interesting which makes up for the length of the novel","1873":"i really liked the first 10 15% of this book when the main character was growing up u0026amp finding herself but once she found her husband and turned into a boring u0026amp unlikeable adult i gave up i couldn't imagine anything compelling would happen in the next 3 4 of the book it was a very long book with not much going on at least in the 25% that i read","1874":" it depends on why you read i suspect most people have several reasons for reading novels sometimes for escape or to transport oneself into a era or location that gives total relaxation i never read for excitement which is lucky because there is no excitement in this book it is a character driven novel which is unusual these days epic in length i enjoyed the character development immensely the second half had some issues with too much information from the character's perspective or maybe i just couldn't relate to the son character it traces three generations of the lives of an average immigrant family i had trouble putting it down thus the four stars","1875":"if i were to give it a little more time before rating this book i may be more generous i like it more now that i am done i appreciated the writing and the well developed characters but this book was way too long and the editing could have been tighter while eileen was a strong woman she wasn't particularly likable much of the time and if i am going to spend that much time with a character i would like to find her a bit worthier","1876":" oh my \"we are not ourselves\" went straight in the story is not only plausible but timely the messages are not only believable but useful and universal matthew thomas' debut novel is so broad that readers will come away with a variety of memories one strong theme is altruism we tend to place a high value on individualism everyone loves a winner we prize uniqueness our idols focus on their brands we console those who do not \"reach their true potential\" but how about those who dedicate their lives to teaching and caring for others shouldn't they be worthy of our highest praise thomas has a winning style he shows a meticulous sense of detail but a very light touch seemingly simple sentences build to bold organic wholes the narrative is not fancy but clever the plot is rich while easy to digest this is not the place to come for an uplifting read thomas' characters are all flawed in some significant manner struggling to find their way many unable to control their basest instincts but they are also seekers using their intelligence and wits to navigate an imperfect world thomas does not hesitate to take on controversial contemporary issues such as class conflict neighborhoods in transition ethnic stereotyping the broken u s health care and pension systems all topics are seamlessly woven into the narrative \"we are not ourselves\" is a lot of book however i would not at all have minded even more some characters were worth delving into more deeply some transitions felt a shade abrupt and finally there is baseball sweet","1877":"what a slog enough with unlikeable characters who don't do anything here's my new rule if a character is unreliable or unsympathetic then they need to do something interesting to compel the reader to keep going i will say that eileen's frustration with her husband and son's lack of ambition was contagious i had a similar frustration at the slow pace of the plot s and lack of action by anyone in the story that said i didn't quit it i think i might have if i'd been reading not listening but there was just enough there to keep me going to the end","1878":"my affection for the characters waxed and waned likewise my feelings about the book which is character driven","1879":"i love stories of families i also loved eileen's father with his strong moral code and the respect his friends afforded him the story is mostly about eileen u0026amp her relationship with her husband who had very different dreams from eileen's it was a good read","1880":"this is one of those books that's simple in the sense that nothing terribly dramatic happens but is sort of quietly bursting with emotion and insight about life eileen is inspiringly tenacious","1881":" i received this as an arc through a goodreads giveaway for that i am thankful and appreciative i found it to be an interesting enough story overall but 600 pages of a self centered nothing is ever good enough always looking for the greener grass central character named eileen is a lot to take the unraveling of ed her husband is well told real and gritty i felt the most for their son especially toward the end i did not feel immersed in these characters rather i felt like it was a story being told to me instead of felt again the story itself was good but i would not describe it as epic or a must read","1882":"the word i keep coming back to with this book is honest no punches pulled here these characters might let you down they might not do what you want them to do in every instance but damn if they don't feel real throughout still the second half of this book is an epic gut punch of a page turner highly recommended","1883":"the best novel i've read in years an unforgettable story told so skillfully as to make the author's skill almost disappear meet these people and let their world become yours you won't regret it","1884":"profoundly moving beware this book rips your heart out","1885":" i started off quite enjoying it although it didn't feel too new or original but it was a nicely written story of a young woman marrying for perhaps not quite the right reasons and trying to live the american dream some neat anecdotes and moments of insight and then i glanced at how much i'd read and my tablet said i was only about 30% through so yes it does drag on a bit there are perhaps just too many instances and examples and they get more and more gruelling as the husband's condition deteriorates it was going to be 3 stars but then after i finished it i did feel very moved and it felt more universal as if it was about mortality frailty parents and children dreams and how we don't quite make them work for us about everything under the sun and that's perhaps the flaw of the novel too it is too ambitious tries to tell too much but nevertheless beautifully written and with some truly touching moments","1886":" a former colleague who recommended this made the claim that thomas was the steinbeck of this generation it's quite possible i was immersed in this novel from its first pages and what hooked me quite simply was the setting the first narrator of the novel is eileen tumulty born in the 1940's to two irish immigrants living in queens as an irish american whose grandparents set down roots in the bronx i made an immediate connection to the characters in the novel eileen is a nurse and i thought of so many of my own cousins and college friends who became nurses and worked in all the different hospitals referenced in the novel einstein north central bronx and lawrence hospital when the novel's setting changed from jackson heights to bronxville and westchester county i knew exactly the locales being discussed pondfield road central avenue babe ruth's grave at gate of heaven cemetery and countless more details that helped me to feel like part of the story's landscape the character i loved and hated all at once was connell eileen's only son simply put this was a beautiful novel and i can't discuss it without multiple spoilers and give aways the reader of this novel deserves to piece together the mystery of the human condition as he or she reads it for both the characters and the reader absolutely beautiful","1887":"eileen leary grew up in an irish american home and always strived for more than her family had she meets a brilliant professor who is researching the brain marries him and constantly pushes him to more success when her son connell is born she demands the same from him life however did not always go the way eilleen planned loved this book especially the ending a good message in there for all of us","1888":" i did it 600 pages of a book that was not really a 'page turner ' the story of one family and their not too exciting lives a college professor a nurse and their son the father is content with his place in life the wife wishes for more and the son bounces off of their energy or lack of it you know something is wrong with the dad but it takes a long time for it be to be confirmed in the plot this book is getting rave reviews all over the place i have read it took 10 years to write i can see why this family struggles as the author must have in writing it","1889":"what makes this novel wonderful is all the details the characters have a way of absorbing the reader into their lives life she thought was like that sometimes for years things were a certain way and then in an instant almost without conscious thought they weren't that way any longer as if all the hidden pressure on their having been that way they'd been had found release through a necessary valve","1890":" i really hate to do this but since i'm not a critic or a professor and lack the skill and knowledge to judge this on its literary merits and as this is solely my opinion 2 stars it's a shame to come in so low especially as the writing is sometimes sublime but it does bother me that a writer is able to use a word like quiddities but unable correctly to use the verbs to lie and to lay in the simple past tense but matthew thomas has written a book in which i saw no joy and very little lightness of mood until the epilogue and if you tell me well welcome to the real world please don't bother because i'm going to go curl up in a ball in the corner of my living room and whisper is that all there is to myself all night eileen tumulty is the only child of an alcoholic mother and a father whose large personality and physical presence make him a near legendary neighborhood figure they drink they fight they break things little eileen runs the house til her mom dries out eileen's resentment and aspirations to better things grow eileen claws her way out of the neighborhood and into nursing school she has definite ideas about what she wants from her life respect financial security the material trappings of the upper middle class nurse eileen meets edmund leary and knows early on that this is the man she'll marry now i know that before you get married you can't possibly discuss everything that can happen in your life together because there are some things you can't foresee but you should probably discuss where you see your professional trajectories taking you and it seems eileen and ed never got around to this one because when he turns down opportunity after opportunity for advancement she gets angrier and angrier at what she sees as his failure to consider her and their son's needs and the family's future prospects which makes me a little surprised at their robust sex life but who knows what goes in inside a marriage just as the jacket copy promises at the same time that eileen yes it's all her doing finally manages to engineer the family's leap from jackson heights to westchester a dark cloud takes position over their heads i won't spoil the revelation but i will say that i expected some huge family secret skeletons tumbling from closets human heads rolling out of duffel bags their son involved in some criminal activity and what really happens is much more prosaic and ordinary which does make it more emotionally compelling as the reader can imagine the huge number of families who deal with like events every day and perhaps see him herself doing so in the future eileen is not a pleasant character which is fine as i often say i don't need a likeable protagonist in fact i prefer them as a bit of a hot mess she's an undemonstrative mother an unapologetic racist classist an indefatigable score keeper and i'd call her a social climber except that her climbing isn't based so much on connections as on real estate she's constantly striving for the next thing the next rung above her the next achievement and predictably she's not satisfied or happy when she gets it but sets her sights on the next thing when her husband doesn't want to move from their home in jackson heights rather than try to figure out why he's so opposed to the move she plows ahead with her plans and plots how she can outmaneuver him she has friends she spends hours with on the phone and they are supportive of her when the downturn comes but this only intrigued me i could see what eileen wanted needed from them but i had trouble seeing what she brought to the table the other viewpoint in the story is that of eileen's son connell who goes through a heightened version of adolescent struggles with bullying and fitting in and then behaves like a much more spoiled kid than he is repeatedly failing his mother with broken promises and poor judgment interestingly to me though it's connell who provides a glimmer of hope for tomorrow in the final pages of the novel offering a hint of optimism in the face of the vagaries of fate i'm out of time to write let me say that i'm not sorry i read the book and i realize that there isn't much joy or lightness in its eventual subject matter but a glimpse of those things in the characters' lives might have made them seem a bit more real and the impact of the disastrous revelation more of an emotional gut punch","1891":" given to me for an honest reviewmatthewthomas' book we are not ourselves a novel is a book everyone should read it is a story that many families live and don't want others to know about the beginning is a bit slow but as you read it does become a page turner it is about a family that outside people see as a perfect family living a perfect' life but alzhiemers is also living there and their life is really not perfect but no one wants the outside world to know this is a good book about relationships with families","1892":" sprawling novel about the life of eileen tumulty born to irish immigrants in queens new york her childhood is less than ideal as she is forced to grow up the caretaker of her alcoholic mother when she meets ed leary a mild mannered scientist she decides to marry him in the hopes that he will provide her with the stability and economic prestige she craves but then her american dream crumbles as the years go by this book is more character driven than plot driven but the sadness and yearning and disappointment and hopes permeate it throughout very good","1893":"while i liked the spare and direct writing the book could have been about 100 pages shorter with no loss to the plot the changing perspective between mother and son seemed to have no consistency and i was bothered by a page or so in ed's voice that came out of nowhere","1894":"this book was a bit inconsistent at times i felt invested in the characters then there was a turn in the plot that caused me to question how i previously felt i did like how the author showed the arc of eileen's life it made me think about how decisions we make can later prove to be the wrong choices eileen is a complex character although not a very likeable one","1895":"so glad it's over painful every step of the way","1896":"a heartbreaking emotionally powerful story of marriage through sickness and health gorgeously written the author made you feel compassion for characters that at times were unlikeable the novel was quite long but didn't seem that way","1897":"i am unsure about why i did not care for this book so much several times i felt like it was right on the edge of being really good and interesting but then it just did not happen unfortunately i found it boring and it just did not feel authentic i think it would have helped to have more from ed's point of view maybe","1898":"a gorgeous book","1899":"i think angela m's review reflects my thoughts as well i found this book difficult to read i was sometimes engaged often exasperated on occasion hopeful finally i understood such is life","1900":"i had to take my time with this update because i hated u0026amp kinda enjoyed this book sometimes simultaneously first u0026amp foremost it's too damn long it wasn't until i was 40% into the book that i started being slightly interested in the story u0026amp it's characters and even then i went from reading each day just to see what happens to avoiding reading for several days because i just couldn't bare it at times it felt like a secondary school writing assignment where the author wrote with the thesaurus next to him just to be sure that he included enough $10 words i didn't find the characters relatable or really even likeable particularly eileen's desperate need to appear successful despite her husband's credentials which apparently were not good enough for her in the end i was 40% glad i stuck with it and finished the book and 60% glad it was over","1901":"this review has been hidden because it contains spoilers to view it click here i'm not sure how to review this book without sounding like an insufferable pretentious douche but alas here we are i found this book on sale for $1 99 in a huge bin at ocean state job lot next to fifty shades of grey i should have been introduced to it my senior year at unh in my creative fiction class on character development granted the book hadn't been published yet but you get where i'm going with this this is not a book for casual readers and i say that with the deepest respect for i'm not sure how to review this book without sounding like an insufferable pretentious douche but alas here we are i found this book on sale for $1 99 in a huge bin at ocean state job lot next to fifty shades of grey i should have been introduced to it my senior year at unh in my creative fiction class on character development granted the book hadn't been published yet but you get where i'm going with this this is not a book for casual readers and i say that with the deepest respect for anyone who picks up a book at any time it doesn't matter what you read as long as you are immersing yourself in a story and learning from it somehow that said this is not a book for casual readers its sheer girth is overwhelming heh and it feels every bit of its 600 pages how did i manage to finish this book in 1 week it finished me thomas takes mundane elements of every day life and completely inverts them for our inspection who cares about the description of a rotted basement an old man's lack of control over his bowel movements a young man prank calling his friends a woman in her fifties seeking out worldly advice from a psychic hack me i care eileen is the perfect flawed heroine and the perfect representation of conservative middle class white america from 1950 to 2000 talk about a flushed out character my god it's as if matthew thomas plucked my grandma out of her living room and plopped her onto the page lord have mercy just when you think you know eileen and understand her shallow need for a bigger home nicer things status markers praise and an adoring family she comes forth with heartbreaking insight into the human condition she is at once grizzly bear and lamb she loves her husband and son with such ferocity that it speaks to her true depth of character her need for material possessions is for lack of a better word immaterial her coping systems are flawed her life has more heartache than joy she is beaten down time and time again yet she always manages to rise up to face the next challenge she survives because she must she is the one jenga piece keeping the tower together eileen's father mother cousin husband and son are integral parts of this story it's no less than a sweeping multigenerational melodrama yet it's quiet and unassuming its pace is slow and calculated yet brisk on the uptake i wanted to keep turning the pages i needed to know what happened even if nothing was too out of the ordinary ed's progression into alzheimer's was heartbreaking i cried a lot there was one point where ed stood with his teenage son and told him that even if he couldn't speak to him even if he seemed like he wasn't there he would always be connell's dad and he would always know him waterworks beside the obvious look at an incurable and progressive disease i saw a new angle of alzheimer's that i never considered how does a young father reconcile his failing brain with his adolescent son he knew he would decline to nothing yet he still sought to put his kin at ease i'm not a parent but this speaks to the unselfish and unfailing love that dads have for their sons it springs from the same well as the urge to jump in front of a moving car to save your own kid anyway i can't get too into this it's a beautiful story well written and well paced its strength lies in its characters and in the relationships that they both foster and break this isn't a zippy quick little novel that one can read process and forget it's one that ultimately affects how we interact with and perceive people it changes us it gives a shiny little pearl of wisdom and charges us with its safe keeping if you're looking for a beautiful piece of literature that challenges you and gives you something to look forward to each time you crack it open this book is for you if you want to fly through it and dive into action assessment and quick plot i'd suggest finding something else in the ocean state job lot bin just not fifty shades of grey please there is better written smut online with a quick google search i can't wait to read this one again i made notes on nearly every page i went through an entire box of tissues i'll treasure it for years to come more","1902":" nothing extraordinary happens in this book it does not contain much action and there are no exciting plot twists or big reveals then why is it that after a full night of sleep i am still on the verge of tears many of the reviews before mine with ratings of five stars have eloquently expressed it this book has been described as a \"quiet power \" \"slow boil \" \"honest \" a \"great american story \" i started reading this 620 page book about a family living their lives making choices and managing the challenges along the way as i continued to turn the pages days went by in the characters' lives as i finished chapters - years had gone by i kept waiting for something really big to happen it was when i reached the end of the novel that finally understood this was life this is \"my\" life that is the power of this incredible debut novel for those who did not like this book i get it i understand on the surface it is dull - many of our lives are but for those who let the beautiful prose permeate your body fill your head and heart well it will not be soon forgotten \"when life seems too cruel and there seems too little love in it when you feel you have failed when you don't know what the point is when you cannot go on i want you to draw strength from me then i want you to remember how much i cherished you how i lived for you when the world seems full of giants who dwarf you when it feels like a struggle just to keep your head up i want you to remember there is more to live for than mere achievement it is worth something to be a good man it cannot be worth nothing to do the right thing \" -- matthew thomas we are not ourselves","1903":"easily one of the best books i've read this year family saga that is also the american story tough as nails irish girl yearns for respectability and social status she thinks she finds her path when she marries ed a shy brilliant researcher whose dreams don't match her own as early on set alzheimer's plagues ed the reader is led to contemplate the loss of one's own self and the loss of one's life partner the love ed shows his son is so touching i don't think i have read a more beautiful letter than the one ed writes to his son before the sundown of ed's memory achingly sad book but deserving of all the praise it received","1904":"2 5 stars i received this book free in a goodreads giveaway in exchange for a review otherwise i would have let the stars speak for themselves while i was excited to read this book and the writing itself was technically excellent the story was lacking i had trouble identifying with any of the characters or understanding empathizing with their motivations situations were set up to build suspense and then just sort of petered out it felt like a this happened and then this happened and then this happened situation with very little attention given to the how why in addition bit characters were introduced left out for many chapters and then reintroduced with no clues by which time i didn't remember who they were and had to go back to try and figure out it sometimes i did sometimes i decided i didn't really care enough to figure it out and just forged ahead hoping it would come to me in a book dealing with alcoholism child abuse bullying altzheimer's disease and death so many emotions should have been present and i experienced none of them i just didn't care at all about these 1 dimensional characters","1905":"one of the most moving books i've read in a long time it will really make you stop and think about the people you are closest to","1906":"a pretty long story about a nyc irish family the book had great reviews and a long library wait list it had some wonderful descriptions of family dynamics and care giving don't want to say more and spoil it for other readers this is a first time author and i think the editors could have pulled some plot elements together more like repeated references to poor decision making on spending credit cards etc that you would expect to lead to consequences but didn't","1907":"while this book was well written it was way too long and drawn out i found the descriptions of ed's and eileen's relationship after ed develops alzheimer's disease quite real and heartbreaking but i struggled to finish the book because some of the passages seemed endless and the author felt compelled to keep the story going even after ed's death","1908":"this is a powerful book with one of the most beautiful letters i've ever read from a father to a son it doesn't move particularly fast but the character development is well done and the subtleties of familial relationships particularly as they deal with alzheimer's is well developed","1909":"this review has been hidden because it contains spoilers to view it click here they say alzheimer's is called the long good bye and this couldn't be more accurate instunning debut the struggles love and devotion that this family works through each generation processing the diagnosis and what it means to them is so brutal and raw","1910":"i didn't care for the main characters for the first half of the book but it was intriguing enough to stick with it and then the story entered really brave territory and the characters transformed in a very believable way in order to deal with it i ended up in awe of this beautiful depiction of ordinary lives that end up seeming extraordinary as all of ours would if we could think of them with such incredible compassion","1911":"i enjoyed reading this book that is character driven it has delved into the lives of eileen ed and connell written about love between each other and dealing with a degenerative disease","1912":"i liked it a bit predictable and probably longer than it needed to be but good","1913":"i found this story to be boring","1914":"excellent character study detail of living with illness letter to son head scratchers the boy and the frog never came back to that story a well trained nurse missing a diagnosis big gaps in the storyline the older eileen tumulty got the more she hardened to life it is an excellent study in how life's expectations can and do implode and what happens when you are too unwilling to regroup and change your expectations sure eileen is unlikable but aren't we all unlikable at some point in life don't we all mess up and let the negative drag us down too many reviews have focused on eileen being unlikable well that's life i like how thomas didn't give her a total make over a coming to jesus moment she wasn't completely bereft of self awareness but at times she was willfully ignorant to it books hardly ever move me to cry but this one did that says a lot i feel like i know these people once i am done reading a book i usually start another because there are only so many books you can cram into your life right but this book stuck with me these characters have stayed with me i'd love to find out how they lived out the rest of their days but the boy and the frog dude left us hanging","1915":" extremely long and drawn out depiction of one woman eileen from her childhood as the daughter of irish immigrants through her young adulthood where she meets and marries ed and starts a family the actual plot is somewhat mundane merely the retelling of a family whose worries and triumphs are no different from that of innumerable others as they slowly make their way through life where author thomas excells is in his inner dialogue of characters whom he has fleshed out as multi faceted individuals who have both flaws and attributes you simultaneously love and hate each character because they are not merely one dimensional representations of humanity overall the novel felt a little drawn out but that may have been the author's intention to represent how for most ordinary folk life does drag on with normality and is only occassionally punctuated by moments of brief brilliance worth reading but don't expect great things","1916":"i really liked this story and the characters but not sure i could have kept with it if i was reading pages mare winningham's narration of the audio version was spot on for this story it's a slow arc so unless you're a fast reader may struggle getting into it completely worth it if you have the endurance","1917":"well written but i was unable to connect with the characters","1918":"characters were all rather frustrating hard for me to relate to throughout the book but i found the changes wrought from a major plot shift really made the book work well written","1919":"after you read this book you want go and remind yourself to enjoy life to the fullest and allow human emotions hugs and kisses be part of your daily vocabulary with family good read because none of the protagonists were particularly like able","1920":" this was a good time capsule novel about a family who deals with early alzheimer's disease the character development came late in the book for the fellow who ended up with the disease so it mostly read more like a family history also thought the author portrayed the wife as a woman who loved her husband she appeared to be obsessed with moving up i empathized with her but resented her or the author for his depiction of her always wanting more just didn't seem right the son what to say a little too close to home as i wasn't as present as i should have been during my parents demise","1921":"well this was a super sad book i liked the beginning found the middle a little bit slow and pretty much cried the entire last third of the book was very emotional but well written","1922":"for me this was one of those rare books that i could have easily read from cover to cover if time permitted the story was genuinely heartbreaking one i won't forget","1923":" short answer the ending makes this book worth reading pros it's a beautifully written epic saga that chronicles the ups and downs of life in a hauntingly real way the lessons you learn from the tumulty leary family are inumerable their growth as human beings is pretty spectacular the letter the father writes to his son was brilliant and touching something that brought me comfort and reminded me of my irish forebears the ultimate conclusion that life is good and worth living u0026amp continuing was absolutely beautiful the themes of materialism consumerism missing what's in front of you by focusing on what you're lacking becoming an adult the definition of true success and the value of marriage family relationships will leave you pondering long after you've finished the book cons i'm no big hemingway fan but thomas really needs to cut the fluff i hated his constant use of hale instead of healthy torpor instead of inactivity and purchase instead of hold on to we get it you know big words good for you and get to the point it would shave off a few hundred pages speaking of which it was way too long boring and dry i've read longer books the number of pages isn't the problem it's that the story drags and drags an entire year of life is drawn out unnecessarily long to the point of absurdity and frustration whereas esp towards the end other important moments are just glossed over it seems as though even thomas was sick of continuing on and wanted to wrap it up quickly case in point observe chapter lengths in the beginning versus the end point made there are missing details that come to light way after the fact and that seem out of character and unlikely dates don't add up in certain spots eileen's preoccupation with sex at the latter end of the book irritates me to no end where was it at the beginning it just seems so out of the blue considering her refusal to do it earlier in the book besides i hate the addition of random sex scenes solo or otherwise it turns it into cheap literature there's a reason while danielle steele u0026amp e l james sell books and it's not because they're well written come on thomas you're better than that","1924":"i won't spend much time reviewing this book as you can read other reviews and get the gist i didn't love this book but neither did i hate it very good in describing alzheimer's and what it does to the family dynamics i thought there were times when the book drug on decent book but don't expect it to wow you","1925":"a beautiful understated look at love and endurance over the long life of one woman and her family on boyhood and on fathers and sons it felt achingly true to me and i imagine those who can relate first hand in other ways to the story and characters might feel the same way also while i wouldn't consider it quite a new york city novel with new york itself as a main character thomas makes wonderful use of the city its neighborhoods and its people","1926":"very powerful book that sneaks up on you made me reflect on how quickly life goes by","1927":"main char very materialistic husband professor with one son husbands gets alzheimer's half way through it was very very sad i can't wait to finish bc it made me depressed every time i read it i didn't like main woman so i didn't connect to her situation nor did i feel strong empathy didn't like son either so overall not a big pick for me","1928":"great booki don't write many reviews this might be my first but i do feel this book is going to be a classic it's like an adult version of a tree grows in brooklyn","1929":"this was a terrific albeit sort of heartbreaking book it was another in a line of books i've read that simply tell a story of a family's life and the dynamics surrounding them it had some similarities to jonathan franzen's the corrections so much so that i would like to know if franzen is an influence for thomas the story of eileen tumulty is not told in a particularly flashy way and i appreciated that its formula reminded me of a tree grown in brooklyn as it followed eileen from childhood through to her golden years and the triumphs and tribulations she experienced along the way i never felt that any of the characters were particularly likable and therefore was never really rooting for anyone but this didn't distract from my desire to know what happened to them i think this is a compliment to writing style of thomas the characters were real they had flaws their generational differences seemed well researched and they reminded me of a real family instead of a pie in the sky idea of one without giving away any spoilers the heartbreaking aspect of the book was written with such detail that i wonder if thomas has had personal experience with the subject matter it really made me think about my own relationship with my father and i found myself having a greater appreciation for everything he's done for me we are not ourselves it's true we are an amalgam of those who came before us as much as we want to create our own identity there is no escape from the influences of our ancestors","1930":"gave up on this one even though i was about 2 3rds through it wasn't bad just didn't hold my interest i found myself finding other things to do rather than pick it up and continue on even on an airplane the story of second generation immigrants focused on the woman daughter wife mother and her unrelenting goal to improve her station in life i found her extremely difficult to empathize with she seemed quite cold and unreachable her husband who appears to be a good man despite the fact that his goals aren't as lofty as his wife's is diagnosed with alzheimer's and her reaction is emotionless she fixates on how to hide his disease and then the financial ramifications tough to like the story sounds great on the book jacket but this is a lifeless tale","1931":"hmmm i struggled with this too long i wasn't interested enough in the characters one of those books that i started to dread reading","1932":"did not like anything about the book and the writing style did not match tone of book","1933":"this review has been hidden because it contains spoilers to view it click here i did not realize that alzheimer's would play such a large part in this book and must admit that i probably would not have picked up the book if i knew since it is not a plot line that particularly appeals to me however i'm so glad that i went in to reading this book a bit blind because i thoroughly enjoyed it i agree that it is slow moving but i felt that the characters were so richly developed i had to keep reading i was definitely surprised by how much i enjoyed this book","1934":"brutal engaging family epic for me the book of summer 2014","1935":"not one of th best books i have read lately i kept going because i wanted to see how it ended but i had no feelinngs for the characters i did not care one way or the other what happened to them a women who is a caretaker to her parents grows up to become a caretaker again to her husband","1936":"beautifully written not an uplifting story but so honest and powerful it is a long book over 800 pages but wished it would have gone on forever matthew thomas is a wonderful storyteller i will always remember eileen ed and connell","1937":"a sad but well written family saga of alzheimer's disease","1938":"$1 million and a blurb on page six it

services and an upwardly mobile career path for her husband though eileen truly loves ed it doesn't take long for her to realize he doesn't quantify success in the same ways she does thomas's gift is in weaving together gorgeously simple vignettes that could each stand alone as a character driven short story his insight to the domestic middle aged strife eileen feels stir feelings of conspiratorial sympathetic understanding and a selfish loathing and it is a loathing for both the character and yourself when the reader identifies with her because of these snippets are expertly

last half of the book has the reader alternating between tears and awe it's accuracy of dealing with spoiler alert early onset and aggressive alzheimer's the only fault with this novel is the editing it's lengthy at 640 pages but after finishing it deciding what sections could be cut to make it more palatable would be impossible it's all necessary and it's all beautiful personal note re spoiler alert my father's progression through the disease was spot on with ed's seeing symptoms as early as his late 40's and having similar experiences with early symptoms while still working and teaching as ed does this novel was painful both for the dormant memories it jarred and the looming future i may have with the same disease had i known going in that dealing with early onset alzheimer's would encompass nearly half the novel i might not have picked it up but i'm incredibly happy i did the reading process was cathartic and i'd recommend this to anyone with similar experiences","1939":"ten

is powerful and poignant displaying the life so man spoilers usually i try to stay spoiler free but i can't honestly review the book without them eileen grows up poor always looking for a better life she puts her mother to bed after she's drank her fill she helps her father around the house she saves and studies and meets ed leary when she's on her way to become a nurse ed is everything she wanted and they marry with big dreams they eventually have a son connell the story of this family is powerful and poignant displaying the life so many of americans fall into and stumble through i'll be honest i had a really hard time with the book for lots of reasons first off eileen and connell are really hard to stomach while they have slight glimmering moments in each of their stories for the most part i despised them both not just their characters but how awful they treated each other eileen's path into middle age has changed her into a shallow and cold woman the tone going as far to call connell \"the boy\" every time she thinks of him she's harder on him not caring or supportive sometimes it's confusing why she bothered to have a child at all connell on the other hand is equally inadequate as a son he's selfish and a coward do you know who i did love ed ed leary eileen's husband and connell's father and of course the good ones always have something bad happen to them which brings me to the big reason why i had trouble with this book through most of the marketing and many of the reviews we are not ourselves rarely states what the big secret of the family's turmoil is and that secret dear readers is alzheimer's disease ed suffers from it at a very early age and his wife and pathetic child have to come to terms with it and care for him i'll be honest if i knew it was about alzheimer's disease i wouldn't have requested it it runs on one side of my family and i have a deep sense of fear from this diabolical disease that one day someone i love will not remember me how it eats away at your brain at who the person is at their very nature i was sad and dismayed when that realization kicked in yes i could have stopped but i was already over halfway through the book having invested so much time listening to their story and i wanted to see what happened while i understand why people aren't mentioning it i wanted to say what it was about in my review because i wish i had known before i picked it up i liked how we flowed in and out of their lives but as i just said not only was i submerged in these hugely flawed characters but i was also swimming in this very uncomfortable and too realistic world i was eager to listen to the audiobook every time i was in the car but i was also heartbroken on the verge of tears towards the end unable to separate this fictional story from the great real fear i have of encountering this disease the ending was satisfying in a very raw and bittersweet sort of way the brilliance of the book is thomas's way of accurately depicting family dynamic during the trials of life and sharpening the lens on certain moments of grief guilt and love making the reader enormously uncomfortable by these intimate moments and perhaps also by how closely they resemble real life it's an intriguing book that i think people will want to read there are a lot of other themes elements tones that i should talk about but i can't i'm sorry but all i can think about is the disease and perhaps that is a reason enough to read it thomas does a very convincing job of describing ed's deterioration broke my heart the story is character driven as we go through many years with them it can be slow in times especially the beginning but it is well thought out and planned overall we are not ourselves is worth reading and digesting in a patient and thoughtful way perhaps alone and with a steeled heart more","1942":" there is no possible way to do justice to this book with my words but here i shall try debut novelist matthew thomas in his novel we are not ourselves has given this reader a gift a gift of a lifetime eileen tumulty was born in 1941 in queens new york to irish immigrant parents eileen's father was a big man with a big presence who had big dreams for his daughter eileen's mother was a distant woman who would crumble to rock bottom only to rise back up again to realize those dreams she held too for her daughter eileen also had dreams for herself she wanted a bigger life she wanted to matter eileen went to college to become a nurse when she was 25 she met ed leary a handsome man with athletic prowess and an amazing mind ed was a scientist dedicated to his field of neuroscience specializing in psychopharmacology he studied how psychotropic drugs affected the brain eileen fell in love with ed and believed that this man with this amazing mind was going to be her knight in shining armor that would be right beside her as they lived the american dream ed's vision for their life together and eileen's vision were light years apart after heartbreaking difficulty in trying to conceive ed and eileen would welcome a son connell connell would become eileen's world and just like eileen's parents had for her eileen had dreams of an amazing future for connell when connell was 16 years old there would come a devastating blow one that would reshape the entire dynamic of this family this epic tale is the story of eileen tumulty leary's lifetime from her early and difficult upbringing to her metamorphosis into a woman of strength and conviction eileen's life was not one that would ever make headlines it would never cause the town to gossip instead her life was a story that could be any one of ours her story is the story of her lifetime the author's prose is graceful and unassuming the characters that he has created are subtly affecting eileen will make you cringe cheer and cry and she'll make you look at yourself a little more closely ed will anger you and then overwhelm you connell like most children and teenagers will test you and in the end you'll remember these characters and this story because they matter i want you to remember me but only if you want to remember me an ecopy of this book was provided by the publishers via netgalley the opinions above are expressly my own","1943":"we join the tumulty's an irish american catholic family as they struggle to survive in 1940's queens from the eyes of young eileen we follow her loved ones through the twentieth century first novel by an excellent writer","1944":"i am so conflicted about this book the writing was extraordinarily good however it was a book i struggled to finish perhaps it was just too much too long too everything","1945":"this book was honest and human and heart breaking it moved a little slow at times as i find many character driven books do but the characters are so well developed and real i just wanted to find out what happened to them they aren't always likeable but they are relatable this wasn't an easy book to read there were times it felt like a punch to the gut but i couldn't put it down all the same","1946":" an incredibly realistic look at the family life of a strong woman a loving sensitive man and their son whom you see change from a unappreciative child to a man who is a combination of the two the majority of the book chronicles the mother and the way she deals with life and it's issues and the impact it has on her relationships this book is a wonderful read and i recommend it for all readers the author makes his prose flow and his characters rich his style reminds me of wally lamb a definite good read","1947":"beautifully written the best part of the novel was the characters and their complicated relationships with each other and the changing world around them i don't think the synopsis gives the book justice but of course it doesn't want to give away much of the plot but i highly recommend we are not ourselves i would not recommend reading this book on public transportation because i probably cried like 6 or 7 times","1948":"loved it a journey of self awareness and sacrifice","1949":"i'm torn about this book parts are beautifully written but it also could have used a heavier editing job it was a haunting portrayal of the descent into alzheimer's disease but i never identified with any of the characters i only really liked the secondary character of sergei so i found myself not as sympathetic as i should have been to their plight the epilogue was perfect is that because i was relieved it was over or because it tied things up well","1950":"absolutely fantastic so well written and beautiful narrative definitely one of the best fictions i have read this year","1951":"great book it seemed that it dragged some at the end i wish it was about 100 pages shorter regardless it was a well written book that i would highly recommend","1952":"600 pages of depressing ugh","1953":"beautifully written brutally honest unrelentingly sad full disclosure i read all of the first half but skipped through the last half to find out what happened i cared about the characters enough to need to know but unrelentingly sad breaks me after 350 pages outstanding work just too close and too sad for me","1954":" perhaps it was the several days shivering in the relentless air conditioning of the javits center that i reacted so strongly reading matthew thomas's debut novel we are not ourselves on the train ride home at its core the novel tells the story of one family with the mother eileen tumulty at the center of it all we read about her childhood her parents' alcoholism and her desire to leave behind the family's old apartment in irish working class woodside heights queens she falls in love and marries neuroscientist ed leary a man so unlike the men she's known her entire life and who gives her a sense of safety and of promise problems arise as she realizes ed lacks the ambition that will get them out of their working class apartment in jackson heights even after the birth of their son connell ed remains devoted to teaching turning down jobs that promise more status and more money eileen who dreams of a living in westchester county in an attempt to change their circumstances manages to buy a somewhat dilapidated home in bronxville on the southern edge of westchester after eileen ed and their son connell move a change occurs both in the story and in the tone of the novel ed for a while has appeared depressed but it begins to manifest itself with fits and bursts of anger eileen meanwhile seems determined to ignore it and pretend everything is normal when ed is finally diagnosed with early onset alzheimer's this story of an unhappy family now becomes the dark and heart wrenching story of ed's slow decline thomas's writing shines in this section and you begin to see how he carefully wove together the fabric of the family even with eileen's unhappiness and resentment of ed's lack of ambition she continues to love him and it feels real the poignant scenes as ed's mind and body broke down brought this reader to tears and yet i was also overwhelmed with the feelings of hope and respect for the family's resiliency as eileen and connell endured it all and moved forward thomas has a gift for emotional truthfulness writing characters with complex personalities and characters that you can't help falling a little in love with","1955":"not finished the story took too long to get to a certain point characters were not really interesting enough to make me able to get into their lives","1956":"read my review http utahmomslife blogspot com 2014","1957":"5 gut wrenching stars if i had been aware of the subject matter presented here i would never have picked up this book simply it is about how family members deal with a catastrophic illness one that shakes me with particular fear however this author is a master of character development if you ask me about the identity of the main character it would be difficult to answer because all of the main characters were so thoroughly fleshed out hence this was a story about a husband this was a story about a wife this was a story about a son each point of view was handled with equal focus that was awesome i still don't want to read about this subject but i have great respect for this amazing presentation","1958":"this was the first time i've cried at a book since i was 11 years old so if you are a fan of well written crippling emotional pain this is the book for you","1959":"i kind of hated this book and still wanted to keep reading it it was too long overall however there were definitely some good moments and a lot of things that made you feel for at least the main character the son was too annoying to care about","1960":"i heard matthew thomas share at a fundraising event in october that it took him ten years for him to complete we are not ourselves i believe it and i believe that he is an extraordinary writer he had lines that i wanted to mark up underline highlight he had metaphors that made me pause in awe thomas has a mighty vocabulary many words i would have likely looked up had i been using an ereader but there weren't enough of these words to slow me down reviewers rave how we are not ourselves is a book about love loss and family i say yeah that too but really it's a book about money how the attitudes we inherit from our parents toward personal finance dictate our lives for better or for worse eileen adopted mike tumulty's mantra that money was made to be spent as her own though a highly debatable statement i think it served her well to the end it's hard to say too much more without taking away from the gradual reveal of family events in we are not ourselves but i will say that i'm not sure if i can wait ten years for another book","1961":"touching sad hits home wonderful book","1962":" there is something compelling about this novel i tend to disagree with the negative rating about the pace i happened to like the slow developments and what we might consider the minor details in life i think in our face paced immediate world this was a departure that i enjoyed my criticism is around the characters someone called them wooden and i think that fits if i hadn't before known the gender of the author i would have guessed male because there were so many times that i found myself not believing eileen as a woman her character was unlike any woman let alone first generation irish woman i have even known i missed warmth in everyone there were moments of tenderness i connected with ed but for the most part i felt the characters were emotionally distant for example eileen was an involved and protective mother then her only child goes to college and she doesn't even call him she manages to call her girlfriends and reconnect with former coworkers but doesn't call connell not buying it i also agree there are times where the prose gets thick and clunky describing every store in bronxville and naming intersections on drives does not necessarily lend authenticity to your familiarity of the locale it says to me the author is trying too hard to convince you he knows the area that said i wish i wrote a story like this well done for the most part it was an enjoyable read despite the gravity of the subject matter","1963":"the book was very well written but generally depressing i had a difficult time finding the main character empathetic at times frustratingly self absorbed the book could have used some editing as it bogged down in places","1964":" hmmm this was an introspective book which didn't necessarily lend itself to the audio format the narrator had a very subdued somnolent voice and it began at the very beginning the childhood of the main character eileen leary nee tumulty and while she grew up quickly amid challenging circumstances irish immigrant parents alcoholic mother recovering parents died young ish and it gives the reader a really good understanding of eileen it still begs the question what is the book about well in chapter 46 finally some meaningful action happens eileen's husband ed you get their courtship narrative and their marriage overview and their son connell's birth and growth to age 14 or so is diagnosed with alzheimers but that still isn't quite the point of the book it is a beautiful explanation of the disease's effect on family and the individual himself but it still seems ancillary to this story where did helpfulness end and absurdity begin there's the look at what type of person you become when life throws curve balls your way but that's still a problem because eileen and connell especially are not always likeable there are several random incidents that rise and fall away eileen's dabbling with a faith healer her work conflicts as a nurse her relationship with ed's home health caregiver sergei and plenty of false starts for connell dragging and a little frustrating overall some lovely turns of phrase but a sleeper","1965":"this book was difficult to read not because it was beautifully written amazing character development and engaging story but because it was so heartbreaking the issue they are dealing with is a real fear of mine it will stick with me awhile really enjoyed the ending","1966":"this book took me forever to read seriously i don't think i've ever taken so long to read a book u0026amp in the end i'm not sure how i feel about the story i do think it is a perfect example of an adult fiction story that went on about 200 pages longer than it needed to u0026amp in a way that a young adult book could have told the story better in less words i was certainly drawn into the story at first setting the tone of an historical fiction story setting up a world of the immigrant experience in 1940s but soon the story delves into the main character eileen and her courtship wedding and settling into a career u0026amp the suburbs i kept waiting for some climactic point of the story but it never came and without giving anything away the point of the story left so many clues along the way that it was a relief when it was revealed just way tooo many pages to tell a story that i feel would have been much more powerful had it been written in a shorter version there was so much detail that had nothing to do w the times the main characters and gave the illusion that the story was actually multiple stories happening at the same time and then thinking they would all come together for the conclusion and the conclusion after slogging through waiting for the big moment when characters come together to bring closure to the story i felt that everything just went flat did the author run our of steam and story to tell was the editor tired of reading the story and just let it end i felt no emotion for the characters and their story i had no concern for their futures it was one of the stories that after i closed the book upon completion i never gave them another thought for me that's the sign of a poorly written ill conceived story if it doesn't keep me tethered to its story telling for days after finishing it then the book is a miss u0026amp certainly not a hit","1967":"best of 2015 thus far loved the characters and the writing this one just felt very familiar in a good way","1968":"what was said in 620 pages could have easily been condensed to 200 pages","1969":"i appreciated the complex portrayal of a family and of the individual members of the family lovely in moments painful often","1970":"i really liked this book it was a bit long sometimes long is necessary but in this case i don't think so the epilogue made the book","1971":"an amazing read that warns of the paralysis that comes with allowing regrets from the past or expectations for the future to overwhelm your thoughts everyone who reads this book will find something in each of the characters to relate to and to anyone who knows what it's like to lose a loved one have a box of kleenex nearby because this one will hit you where it still hurts this will be going on my favourites list for sure don't let the 600 page length scare you off it's worth the read","1972":"this review has been hidden because it contains spoilers to view it click here this was a difficult read for me as i have lived with many of the experiences outlined in the story the book describes the hardships of decisions and the painful realities of alzheimer's","1973":"wow what a powerful novel review to come but let me just say for now that this is one of 2014's very best as far as i know it hasn't even been long listed for a single prize and that baffles me","1974":"i loved this book was sad for it to end","1975":"i loved this book the characters were real and human i disliked a little of each of them felt badly for each of them and felt that i really knew them the plot was solid involved but not too complex the prose was beautiful","1976":"a well written novel about the devastating effect that alzheimer's disease has on the person afflicted and his family the effects are very graphic and the hardships for both patient and family are hard to deal with as the disease progresses i think the most touching scene in the book is when ed takes his son connell to class with him and of course acts strangely in class and connell decides not to tell tell his mother about the episode ed of course apologizes to his son and connell tells him it's all right i already know what kind of teacher you are you teach me every day the struggles that eileen goes through and how she deals with them is a strong indication of what kind of person she is and how she grows through those experiences connell has his own fears of contracting the disease when he is an adult and becomes a teacher and he has a rough experience in the classroom but he works through it and he and his wife decide to have a child life goes on","1977":" through the first half of this book i kept asking myself what this book was about i nearly stopped reading it seemed so disjointed if it was a prelude of what was to come it could have been condensed to one chapter then the tragedy this section of the book got better for me showing what an unexpected tragedy can do to a family both emotionally and financially but still there was a lot written that didn't need to be and prevented the development of the characters as they should have been developed the author said he took ten years to write the book and maybe that was the problem i would think one would lose continuity i think he tried to portray several different things a poor irish girl trying to move up in the world the tragedy the disconnected and lost son therefore doing none of them justice","1978":"a rather fantastic book that very nearly reached 5 stars but not quite i do find some american literature difficult mainly because i struggle to understand the culture u0026amp can find the materialistic world depressing there are obvious comparisons here with franzen's corrections as it is the tale of one family over a life time where life is far from easy whether it is the lyrical irish hint to the writing or whether thomas writes with more humanity im not sure there is no trip into fantasy here just gritty life u0026amp much love eileen is a complex character hardened by her upbringing at times she frustrates as she can appear harsh u0026amp unwilling to express her emotions to ed u0026amp connell i could say she has a heart of gold but i'm not sure that would be quite right maybe it is her upbringing that keeps a check on her showing of emotion but she don't half care there is the striving for materialism the incomprehensible american health system im none the wiser as to what baseball is all about glorified rounders but whereas in franzen's work i get put off by this unfathomable american culture in this i can read through it as it is intertwined with humanity i had a tear in my eye by the end although today it is my mother's birthday u0026amp i am grieving in a similar way to eileen u0026amp connell u0026amp found the end very satisfying endings are always difficult but this book ends meaningfully this book is thought provoking u0026amp the observations on alzheimers u0026amp mortality very pertinent a tremendous enlightening work","1979":"600 pages and the second half was a page turner for me the details were sometimes too much for this fast reader but the title says it all it's not a saga but an intimate family story that is painfully genuine","1980":"i couldn't finish this one far too slow for me","1981":"gifted author but found it frustrating that the wife a nurse slight spoiler could not guess at the possible diagnosis her husband might have and it was quite long though it did keep my attention as the history of the family and the way the relationships interconnected w the past u0026amp the changing times played out character development was well done","1982":"well yes this is an incredibly well written book that's completely deserving of its awards and praise i actually really enjoyed the first 3 4 of it quite a bit but then it took such an even more depressing turn i had to put it down now don't get me wrong it's incredibly realistic life is like that for many of us but i was on my honeymoon in jamaica at that point and i just couldn't bring myself to drag it onto the beach when i wanted a fun spy thriller to accompany my gin and tonics this book is real and sad and difficult especially in those last 200 pages some of my very favorite books are depressing as hell but so much is about when you read something so i've been putting off the finish and reading many other books now and yesterday i was so depressed about prince that i decided what the hell i'm very glad that i finished it even though it's more of a relief of not having the depressing story weighing on me it got even more depressing as ed descended into full blown alzheimer's and eileen never really realized her suburban home owning dream of how nice it could be once she got her house connel turns out pretty well in the end and there's a brief glimmer of hope but all in all it's a pretty brutal book i guess i'm at the point where regular life is difficult enough so i really want to escape when i have my few moments to read that being said it's worthwhile i'm giving it 3 instead of 2 stars because i liked it but i hated it all at the same time it's heavy and real so just know that going in and maybe don't pack it for your beach trip","1983":"this is not an action packed book it is a tale of a family the twists and turns life takes the way we change as we age the ways in which life seems unfair the exploration of what happens when a family member has early onset alzheimer's i enjoyed the writing style and the more i read the more involved i became it slowly but surely hooked me","1984":"some nice insights about family relationships if you can stick with it","1985":" when i selected this book all i knew of it was that the title had been on someone's recommendation list somewhere in the early parts of the book eileen's story seemed a little a tree grows in brooklyn ish which to me is a good thing i was unprepared for how this story swept me up after a slow but deliberate build i became so invested in this family 's life and found myself feeling anxious about choices they made opportunities missed and critical missteps in their relationships with one another having always been someone who likes to observe or putter around in other people's lives and homes this is the novel for me characters were honestly presented and when they did not understand their interior motivation it also was not explained to the reader ultimately over time each character gained insight needed and moved forward but not before experiencing some pain and emotional turmoil by the conclusion i could see that some of my worry was unwarranted aside from some nitpicky issues i had related to nursing home billing and health insurance practices for me this novel was deeply satisfying","1986":"i found this book depressing at times but it was so well written and by the end it left me with an appreciation of the characters and it has a beautiful ending in spite of the sad things that happen i wish i could write like him very well done it's documenting very real lives so if you need a lot of action you probably won't like it","1987":"dark epic wanting things that aren't unnavigable and playing it safe aren't always the best ways to go thru life because sometimes it bites u on the ass","1988":" i am always amazed at how some men can so beautifully capture the thoughts and feelings of a woman this is one of those books the life of eileen leary and her family are the subject of this lovely book and we follow her life from her dreams as a young girl through to her widowhood life plays her some pretty difficult hands but she is a marvellous character who holds herself and her family together no matter what she is tough and determined and she gets there i'm not saying i particularly liked her but found myself cheering her corner and getting caught up being a close observer of her family","1989":" down to earth character driven generations and changes a strong theme as well as the inevitable differences i found this a gripping account of daily life survival and the innards of a marriage the type of marriage that is good survives even though eileen our heroine wants to wrap her husband around a pole at times it reflects the fusion of growth stretching bending together and yet a novel filled with forthright characters who all have substance there are so many aspects to struggle and achievement in ordinary lives that make the ordinary majestic i found this book reflected multiple themes of tenacity generational difference what's realistic to attain as far as careers and what isn't and identities changing shifting and it reflected an embrace of change in people's lives i thought it was well done","1990":"this book is not for everyone the subject matter nor the characters are uplifting however for me matthew thomas did an excellent job developing the characters as well as opening up their every thought action and reaction to life's situations very insightful a story depicting how parental familial cultural and genetic influence all come together to make us each the person we are i enjoyed the entire book but i think it could have been 100 pages shorter","1991":"disaffected people being disaffected i felt satisfied after reading the first 100 pages but not interested enough to continue","1992":"raised in woodside queens in the 1940's eileen tumulty always planned to rise above the working class life she was born into and believes finding the right husband is key when she meets ed leary a scientist deep in research she sees their ideal future laid out ahead of her after their marriage and the birth of their son connell eileen continuously reaches for higher ranks in her nursing career while ed settles into life as a community college professor while she pushes him to pursue more eileen soon realizes that ed's stubborn personality is the result of a much deeper demon that will ultimately reroute the family's charted course in unimaginable ways the pitching of we are not ourselves as epic and sprawling at bea's speed dating event had me absolutely sold as i rarely meet a chunky family saga i don't love it's clear thomas has enormous talent and is particularly adept at crawling inside the minds of his characters but despite its moments of brilliance most of my reading experience was spent wanting to like the novel and waiting for a shift that would make the deep trudging worth it sadly that never came though eileen's childhood does have an impact on her determination and choices later in life the overlong first section detailing her early life feels slightly tacked on to the leary's story which takes some time to get moving itself thomas does an incredible job building a shadowy sense of dread around the family as ed's quirks become increasingly strange culminating in a chest tightening classroom experience that allows connell to see his father truly falling apart from there however we are not ourselves begins to feel repetitive surely repetition is a daily reality for anyone in eileen's place but it's something i began to feel in the act of reading rather than the emotions being portrayed while i love big sprawling books that allow you to dip into different corners of history with the close focus of we are not ourselves on a single family and not the society around them i would have preferred a shorter novel more at rivercityreading com","1993":"i truly enjoyed spending time with this family as i was reading i felt like a fly on the wall in their home watching their decisions feelings etc this book is not very plot driven just like anne tyler's a spool of blue thread but the characters are ones i'll remember for a while","1994":"very realistic story with somewhat dull characters makes you think about that dreaded disease","1995":"this family saga drags on for three generations and over 600 pages with less than interesting participants the first family is comprised of irish americans with the stereotyped father a driver of a beer delivery truck and a reformed alcoholic mother plus a daughter named eileen who aspires to much greater of life's accomplishments than can be found in the archie bunker type home in woodside queens instead eileen has to settle for becoming a nurse and marrying ed leary a professor at the bronx community college with no desire for advancement and content with being a highly competent teacher and researcher so eileen has to fulfill her ambitions by encouraging and failing to push ed ever onward and upward then she has to transfer these aspirations to her son whom she pretentiously names connell she has big eyes and wants more and more finally after a long arduous argument convincing ed to move to a house in bronxville from the three family home they owned in jackson heights appeasing her upward desires somewhat and life goes on and on toward the inevitable denouement from the start beginning with eileen's father the characters are wooden and unbelievable especially connell as he progresses in life the story takes place over four decades eileen's attitude toward her husband and marriage does not ring true she is satisfied or not one can't really know despite the ending which doesn't seem credible and this is supposed to represent life faithfully","1996":"the novel explores an ordinary life difficulties with differences in goals and ethics in a marriage unexpected tragedy coping and continuing on we all bring our own upbringing and background with us when we marry it can be very tricky reconciling differences this book touches on the irish american husband and the wife trying to deal with his different goals and viewpoints a good tale of an ordinary life sometimes a bit dull but overall interesting and inciteful","1997":"this is a builder took me a long time to really get into it it's rough but so real and one that will stick with me for a long time","1998":"this is the book that jonathan franzen should have written the writing is quiet and memorable the characters are imperfect but endearing it is a story not just of family but the father son relationship with all its ambivalence the unfulfilled yearning for bettering ourselves and dealing with alzheimer's in such a brutally honest way i hope that this is just the beginning for matthew thomas bravo","1999":"so long and it reminded me so much of angela's ashes especially with the irish family background they told the story from the mother and the son's pov but i wish they had done the father's too it made me wonder what would happen if i or my husband had alzheimer's later in life and how i would want to be taken care of","2000":" we are not ourselvesbymatthew thomasmy in a nutshell summary this is the story of an irish american family that begins in 1941 most of what we learn is told by following the life of eileen to its truly profound ending my thoughts after reading this book wow i am almost speechless about this book almost i actually began reading this book when we started an 8 hour car trip i truly could not put this book aside only when we were on winding country roads did i even once think about putting it down i would call eileen the pivotal character in this story her early childhood with her parents both alcoholics was different her parents' relationship was so sad so dysfunctional both drank her father gambled but she had a relatively normal abnormal childhood eileen was determined to make something of her life to go to college get a house have a normal life when she meets ed marries has her son connell gets that house that she wants everything in her life seems perfect what i loved about this book eileen always seemed not quite a normal character but not that abnormal of a character to me her upbringing was strained especially her relationship with her mother her relationship with her father was strained but i loved the way he taught her how not to drink eileen and ed omg i can't even go down this road with anyone it was unreal yet it happens it was so sad i cried my heart was so sad because what ed went through happens to so many people the letter he wrote to his son touching monumental so heartfelt final thoughts this is a big book a big bold book it's a saga that goes through generations it's about irish families and being sent to america and helping others in your family get here it's about strained relationships and working hard and frustrations it's about seeing something happening to someone you love and not really knowing why this book was like nothing i have ever read before and i loved every single word","2001":" note this is a review of an advanced reading copy from netgalley and simon and schuster the final publication may differ from the material reviewed here i'm not sure i can adequately express my thoughts on we are not ourselves the debut novel by matthew thomas in my notes i wrote that none of the characters are likeable and that the book reminds me a lot of the winter of our discontent death of a salesman and revolutionary road in tone in general an all around bleak sort of story about the gulf between expectation and reality having finished the book i would say that there's more going on than just that there's also the gulf between guilt and empathy and an underlying sense of resignation the characters are at times infuriating eileen leary nee tumulty determined come hell or high water to seize the brass ring of the american dream ed leary her husband so set in his ways that they seem to be heading for an impasse and their son connell floating through life without ambition or concern through the first part of the novel i felt not only disconnected from the learys but actively reviled by them but the devastation visited upon them in the course of the story made their transgressions against one another if not understandable then at least forgivable i don't want to spoil the book although what happens to alter the course of the leary family is foreshadowed heavily but suffice it to say that it causes a radical shift in how they perceive one another as well as the life they have created together this is not a perfect novel it can stand at times for greater flow between the perspectives told from eileen's point of view and those of her son connell still thomas' prose is strong and faithful he has created a novel of impressive depth and gravity which is all too uncomfortably real","2002":"i really tried to like this book the first part gave me hope but it failed after eileen married ed i could never relate to any of the characters i do believe he captured the disease and the effects it had on the family with realism that's the best i can say about it i am wondering if 3 stars is even too high","2003":"i really loved this book despite it's length 600 pages and the reviews comparing it to the corrections which i despised eileen is an irish schoolgirl and the novel starts around 1950 or so and follows the next fifty years through her marriage and years as a parent not much happens other than life which for eileen has more downs than ups despite the melancholy tone the book is moving and beautifully written","2004":"this is one of those books that for me ranks up there with the story of edgar sawtelle the depth and experience of the characters makes you feel like you are in the book with them the writing is fantastic i love writers who use language word choice sentence structure to create speed in a book thomas is a talented writer and i do hope to see more from him in years to come","2005":"this is epic domestic fiction we are not ourselves we are extensions of the hopes and experiences of those who came before us and are the example and support of those who will follow us this is the story of one woman and her determination through her we get to know her childhood her marriage and her family life the writing is excellent and you'll feel the characters as you read about them this is also about early onset alzhemier's our heroine is an rn so she suspects something her husband is a college science professor he realizes something as well here is the tragedy and the challenge for a couple and a family highly recommended","2006":"a long and difficult read for various reasons but it was worth sticking with i felt it could have been shorter and i wasn't interested in the baseball references i'm not sure how much of this is fiction or autobiography a lot of it must come from personal experience sadly","2007":"one of the best books i've read in a long time a bit depressing alzheimer's but spot on good conclusion i'm usually disappointed in conclusions nowadays this book did not disappoint one i plan to keep","2008":"slow and difficult at times but good story","2009":" one of the best pieces of literature i've ever read it's rare to find a novel so engrossing so well written so meaningful and so rewarding at once the characters and their plights haunted me as both other worldly from a time and a place i know of but never really knew and yet so familiar bravo matthew thomas this is a masterpiece and a real and lasting contribution to the american literary landscape readers will learn from eileen for generations to come and will be left with questions they never imagined themselves capable of asking much less even trying to answer for sure i was i could not recommend we are not ourselves more highly this is why we write and why we read read this book","2010":" in the early 60s a sitcom called father knows best enticed us to believe that the andersons were the family norm why wasn't my family like this and while face book photos sometimes suggest that all families wear a perpetual smile while basking in endless sun filled days a book like we are not ourselves comes along it is a book about a real family who reminds us that behind smiles and platitudes lurk real life joys sorrows and flaws the story begins in 1951 queens when we are introduced to eileen tumulty leary the young daughter of irish immigrants it concludes in the year 2001 as her now grown son ponders his future and his inheritance in between 1951 and 2001 is the rich story of eileen her husband edmund and their son connell for me the most compelling aspect was the frightening description of alzheimer's and how it makes its despicable descent at first you wonder is the character depressed is he just becoming more eccentric or is he just evolving into an asshole how awful it must be to realize that it's happening as you try to hide the symptoms from your family and colleagues the family's cycle of support withdrawal and guilt felt understandable logical and genuine there are so many layers to this book including eileen's attempt to come to terms with the changing neighborhood and her feelings of resentment at the evolution of the culture a perfect description of her feelings was displayed as she sits with a family partaking of a meal of indian food she had never had it but was sure she hated it it had been easier to say 'i don't like it ' instead of 'i'm too angry to try 4 5 stars for we are not ourselves only because it felt a tad long a bit like this review","2011":"this novel was lengthy involved and excellent it took some getting into but the characters are absolutely solid with inner lives and emotions that arise naturally from genuine flesh and blood humanity i'll write a longer review shortly but for now matthew thomas reads like a more grounded sincere franzen capable of actual empathy","2012":"matthew thomas has captured a women's psyche better than so many writers before him as i experienced eileen's cycle of deep love revulsion attraction pity love again of her husband and in the end her unconditional love and loyalty i kept thinking this was written by a man i can't say the characters we're lovable or even likable but the writing is wonderful and the story very fulfilling the letter ed wrote to connell made me sob i want to be like ed not so much eileen as a parent","2013":" thinking she was leaving her old life behind eileen marries ed leary a serious scientist and very different from her own irish family eileen is hard working knows what she wants and is determined to make her life more than what she grew up with but things are not exactly what she expects ed does not share the same desires as she does this is a love story filled with twists and turns eileen supports and stays with ed through difficult times they raise a son is eileen an enabler and someone who wants to make everything alright enjoyed the character and moral development of this family","2014":"maybe because i read this book in spurts but i found parts of the story uneven and long the 2nd half of the book was the best for me too long on background of the characters","2015":"don't be fooled by this book there are multiple errors current medical knowledge regarding alzheimer's medicare medicaid regulations retirement funds and multiple other facts it does however portray one version of the agony of alzheimer's victims and their families","2016":"dull at times but made me think beautifully written","2017":"this is a well written book but lacks story the characters do not strive for anything which makes the subject matter of the book even more depressing","2018":"i don't get why people think this book is so good to me it dragged on and did not keep my interest usually if a book does not hold my interest by the first 50 or so pages i do not finish but i read some reviews that said to stay with it so i did the ending was what i expected and i think the only value to it is that it does show what happens to many families when a member becomes seriously ill for that i gave it 1 star","2019":" ok maybe 4 5 stars my brother gave me this for christmas and i read through it this week while spending a lot of time home sick had a hard time putting it down it's a great story amazing character development i feel like i could walk into the leary's house and just start talking to them it was nice to read a story set in new york over such a long time period 1940s present and listen to one family's narrative of how things developed was also fascinated by the in detail story of the family dealing with the father having alzheimers i have grandparents and gparents in law getting old and having health troubles not alz but other brain challenges and seeing how the spouses and children and everyone tries their best to deal with it not easy it did make me think about the importance of friends for helping you with life challenges like those although sadly most of eileens oldest friends get distant when she is dealing with the hardest parts of helping her husband","2020":"excellent touching well written","2021":"a perfect book club type book","2022":"complex story that moves brilliantly from mundane daily details to deep and thoughtful emotions thoroughly enjoyed","2023":"wow there are some stories that are so real that you are left thinking about the characters long after you finish there are numerous themes that resonated with me the american ideal of home ownership our immigrant roots pushing each generation to surpass the previous one the weight of our ancestors on our lives marriage our life's work and the legacy or real estate we leave our children i don't believe i would have liked this book twenty years ago it would be too depressing too far fetched in my middle years i appreciate each hurdle the characters struggled over i kept putting the book down and shouting yes most bittersweet to me was the marriage of eileen and ed it often felt like someone had peeked through my windows and listened to my own conversations with my husband her pain in the end for being so strong and capable yet helpless to help ed tore me up one of the best books i've read this year","2024":"immensely readable slightly tragic family story","2025":"one of the best books i have read it seriously makes you think how important family and memories and life is literally made me cry","2026":"this is a big book not just in length but the story it tells thanks to net galley for an arc of this book in exchange for a fair review","2027":"i was torn as what to rate this 600 page book i disliked the characters and wanted to throttled them for the decisions they made and how they lived their lives since i didn't truly enjoy the book i would normally give it a 2 star rating but because the characters invoked such emotion from me i figured the writing made it a 3 star","2028":"there were many times i was going to put this book down i grew frustrated with the characters and the inevitability of their lives but the author so satisfied me by the last chapter and the last three pages are worthy of being in the american literary canon flawless","2029":"i received a copy of this book from netgalley what a great read this novel follows an irish american family through several generations in new york each and every character comes to life from the main character eileen right down to the boys she encounters on the streets the settings in jackson heights and then in westchester county are beautifully crafted to show the readers not only the good the bad and the ugly of the changing neighborhoods but how as the character of eileen grows her perceptions of her surroundings grow and change much as the american dream grows and changes with each generation the examination of aging and of the trauma of alzheimers disease brings all aspects home the terror of loss the quandaries faced by families and loved ones and how this affects the family dynamic the honesty of eileen's reactions to her family from her alcoholic mother her brilliant but flawed husband to her struggling son ring true she does not live in the margins but despite herself dives straight into life highly recommended","2030":"i'll give you all love and devotion and work hard all my life he said p 65 overall i would say this book is a solid 3 stars certain parts were 4 or 5 star and others were 1 or 2 in the end and in my opinion this all evens out to 3 let me start by saying that i enjoy mr thomas' writing he writes with an ease and fluidity that is quite simple but beautiful only at certain times did i find it tedious but that is due to the plot and not so much the writing at the beginning i felt like i could relate to eileen and her desire to be somewhere else someone else i think it's something a lot of kids feel at some point i particularly related to the part where view spoiler sister mary alice described the manor house and how eileen daydreamed about living there and the life she would have led if she had been born in to that family hide spoiler however eileen is not fully relatable her desire or rather need to be married is something i cannot personally relate to thought that doesn't make the writing or the story any less interesting - just a disconnect on my part as eileen gets older something that really annoyed me about her was her racism and the fact that she insists she's not racist view spoiler e g \"she wanted to avoid black anger black retribution black vigilante justice \" p 205 hide spoiler her insistence that what she says and thinks isn't racism makes it worse when it comes to ed i think it was clear that ed wasn't quite right for eileen or at least it appeared that way view spoiler it's pretty clear that he doesn't want to fulfill eileen's fantasy of the american dream e g the suburbs perfect house neighborhood life etc also when he talks about his father there is something in the writing that makes him just fundamentally different than eileen i feel like he's much more practical than eileen and that persists throughout the book after they move to the suburbs and in a certain ways after he is diagnosed with alzheimer's hide spoiler something else i had a hard time believing on the part of eileen is her blindness toward ed's health it was infuriating to read i understand that she had a lot on her plate but she seemed to be in denial for a while most of part i to an extent her strategy view spoiler letting ed go off at her and connell hide spoiler worked but it was never a permanent solution i do highly respect eileen's devotion to her family and her willingness to provide for them even if i can't agree with her attitude and actions she does what she thinks is best the last third of the book is pretty slow going but also heartbreaking i would recommend it so long as the potential reader knew they weren't getting a masterpiece in my opinion","2031":" i was not committed to this novel for the first couple of hundred pages i thought that there was too much detail and i couldn't develop a relationship with the characters then it all changed for me once ed started to become ill i became completely involved with the characters and the story line and all the background information became very important and meaningful we have lived through alzheimer's in our family and i cannot imagine a better portrayal of the disease and its effect on the patient and the patient's family than that which this book provides matthew thomas has depicted all aspects of this disease incredibly well from the tragic losses to daily problems his writing is excellent this is an important novel on many levels","2032":"this review has been hidden because it contains spoilers to view it click here this is very much character driven and puts in perspective how everyone is flawed but trying their best i loved edmund the father who is afflicted early with alzheimers there really is no spoiler here because you can see it coming from a mile away very sad and very real","2033":"great story but a little boring at times i think it was too long","2034":"very good book flows nicely kept my interest let you really feel the characters' emotions and issues there are a few times at about the midway point that it started to feel like it was dragging but it never fully dropped me as some books do every time i thought it might start to veer off course interest wise it was just a glitch u0026amp picked right back up hopefully this author will publish more books","2035":"a slow and steady account of a woman's life","2036":"tremendous thoroughly solid a sprawling story a family new york city jobs and schools their journey including meanderings and times of focus togetherness and unspoken sometimes unexpected harmony a most touching letter from father to son loyalty generations and expectations seeing life's highest value not necessarily in continued or vast material successes but in appreciating the gift the unique joy of relationships and how we can must cultivate them with our parents spouse and children our book club agreed the last couple chapters are almost poetic in their beauty and goodness","2037":" i can see why it took matthew thomas ten years to write we are not ourselves this is such a complex novel with so much depth and so many layers that it boggles my mind that it is his debut novel my hat is off to mr thomas it is the story of family and each generation's desire that the next generation have a better life it is the story of how intergenerational patterns affect us all despite vows that they won't it's the story of how neighborhoods evolve and how people evolve it's the story of an irish american family but it's also the universal story of what happens to all of us as we progress through our lives despite of and sometimes because of our best intentions should you read it let's find out at http popcornreads com p 7605","2038":"excellent book hard to get through at points it deals with situations many of us dread having in our future it's an incredible saga of a family","2039":" i am absolutely baffled by all the positive reviews this book has received i feel like i've been tricked by other people's lack of taste it was quite possibly the worst thing i have read all year the characters are boring and predictable the plot drags on endlessly and the writing is heavy handed and over written in many sections it felt like the author was writing with a thesaurus in hand and did not always understand the proper usage of his occasional five dollar words there was also often a distracting repetition of a certain word many times over a few pages perhaps an incredibly skilled editor might have eviscerated this novel and given it back to the author to turn into something worthwhile but that would have been a monumental task spoiler if you want to read a good book about alzheimer's dementia check out the corrections or still alice","2040":" this is one of those books you know the type highly praised with considerable hype epic and beautiful in many ways wonderfully rendered but perhaps not tightly edited we are not ourselves seems to be many stories in one and i'm not convinced this approach was in the best interest of the novel at times it even felt like other stories i'd read here it feels like brooklyn here a tree grows in brooklyn and here the corrections of brooklyn perhaps it is a result of feeling too much like so many other stories that we are not ourselves doesn't stand out to me for its own merits it's a fine story--nothing wrong here at all save perhaps need for a tighter storyline--but it's not one that will stick with me long in fact ask me now for a summary of the story and i promise my response will be shorter than this review","2041":"i would have given up on this book except i had already given up on gilead so i felt like i should push through i was listening to it on my phone so i did not know how long it was if i had known i would have just read gilead and made this one my give up of the summer so slow so sad i couldn't find anything to like","2042":"this story is about life about longing for more than we have and accepting the cards we are dealt we are not ourselves follows sixty years in the life of eileen tumulty daughter of irish immigrants and a native of queens ny this story is beautifully written with poignancy and clarity without being pretentious i fell in love with the central characters and often forget i was reading and not living the narrative i really cared about these people don't let the 600 pages intimidate you the story flows effortlessly and is worth the time and investment this is a story i won't forget","2043":"astoundingly brilliant epic about growing up in an irish immigrant family in the latter half of the 20th century a must read","2044":" this is the saga of an irish american family who lived in queens in the 1940's raised by her immigrant alcoholic parents eileen tumulty takes on adult responsibilities at an early age when she becomes a nurse and then meets ed leary a brilliant scientist she is convinced that her dream life a wealthy husband to take care of her so she never has to work again will begin after several miscarriages eileen and ed have a son connell eileen is obsessed with finding a house in a \"good\" neighbor and can't understand her husband's lack of ambition when he refuses a high paying job for a pharmaceutical company when 42 year old ed is diagnosed with alzheimer's disease eileen struggles to hold on to some piece of the dream she has for herself and her family additional editing might have left me more satisfied the characters were real and flawed many reviewers disliked eileen my biggest criticism of her isn't her ambition it is the fact that while eileen is a highly trained and experienced nurse she doesn't recognize her husband's decline soon enough what i took away from this novel with a profound appreciation for the struggles of families dealing with major health issues it also made me think about how little moments with the people we love are the life events we will remember and cherish the most","2045":"the best novel i've read in years maybe you have to have to have lived in ny city for a lot of years for the story to get to you or maybe not matthew thomas makes you feel everything no matter where you are","2046":"pretty much anytime i read a long critically acclaimed contemporary family saga type story it's the same experience 1 it takes me a bit of time to get into it because the length and pacing of the novel is intimidating and it doesn't seem that different from other stories i've already read 2 finally something happens that feels new and different or takes the story in a new direction i get excited again 3 often there are moments in the meaty middle that give me pause and slow down my reading again perhaps because they're so fraught with emotion or realism that i need a break perhaps because they feel like they're wrapping something up and there's still another 100 or 200 or 300 pages to go and i get intimidated or discouraged again by the length of the novel and how much more there could be to say 4 at the end i ultimately decide that yes the time investment was worth it that yes it was a good experience to read it that yes i got something out of it and that yes i can't stop thinking about it days later this book as you might have guessed followed the same pattern there were probably 100 pages scattered throughout the novel that could have been cut just to pick up the pace a little bit but reading isn't about a race and it isn't always about an escape either if you're looking for a book that is going to take you away from reality this isn't it the description given by the publisher for this book covers maybe the first 100 200 pages of the book but there's another whole story after that as time passes and eileen and ed's son grows older it's hinted at in this line an inescapable darkness enters their lives and eileen and ed and their son connell try desperately to hold together a semblance of the reality they have known that's where the book gets really interesting where it becomes something new and worthwhile i hesitate to give too much away about what that inescapable darkness is because the reveal is handled so well in the book there are hints of the darkness to come and then more hints and more and more obvious hints spread out over years of the character's lives and i don't want to take that pleasure and horror of discovery away from anyone else quotes it hadn't happened for a reason but they would find something to glean from it anyway there didn't have to be a divine plan for there to be meaning in life the point wasn't always to do what you want the point was to do what you did and to do it well when the world seems full of giants who dwarf you when it feels like a struggle just to keep your head up i want you to remember there is more to live for than mere achievement it is worth something to be a good man it cannot be worth nothing to do the right thing","2047":"i came to this book expecting a tale of an irish immigrant family struggling to live the american dream not until a third to halfway through did i slowly realize the central struggle was really with alzheimer's and i love that the reader's slow realization of this horrible debilitating condition mirrors the family's slow realization as well in most movies or tv shows on the subject a late middle aged man has a singular public forgetful incident that foreshadows the disease with the subtlety of a hi beam spotlight here the progression of the plot like the disease itself creeps vaguely but irresistably forward until even the most ardently denying loved ones can no longer plausibly deny we are not ourselves is as devastating to the reader as to the characters and yet it is suffused with an undercurrent of resolve determination and the importance of celebrating life a great great read","2048":"5 stars because the core of this book will be with me for a long time made me wonder what i would do if i was really frustrated with this book and the poor decisions made until 1 2 way finished when it made a sharp turn","2049":"i love sad books i love a good cry but this story is heartbreaking on every single one of its 600 plus pages and don't even get me started on the sobbing that commenced in the final 100 pages as we watch a family struggle to hold on to one another in the face of early onset alzheimer's so i don't know how i feel about recommending it it is exquisitely written there are sentences and paragraphs that i would like to remember forever and the character development is beautiful by the end we begin to feel empathy for characters that are unlikable much of the time at first i struggled with a male author writing from the perspective of a woman wife mother i wondered if she was more stereotyped than realistic by the end that no longer bothered me in fact i found myself strongly relating to her as a woman even identifying with her materialism her preoccupation with the future her harsh judgment of others and her justification of so much in the name of love this is a novel about death but it is also a novel about living about doing the best we can about taking what life throws at us about accepting our flaws and about learning how to love","2050":"i like family sagas i love bildungsromans this novel is a little of both and it was to a certain extent satisfying from the first criterion because it spans 4 generations looking forward in the future towards a 5th and deals with the ups and downs ins and outs of daily life for the second criterion the life of the protagonist her dreams her schemes her obstacles and goals and finally her growth it also satisfied my problem overall with the novel is that it falls into a third category as well one which i despise what i've termed vic lit vic for victim a subcategory of chick lit i'm not talking about books where the hero ine faces a challenge and lives through and learns from it but rather one where the usually female someone's wife or daughter protagonist becomes a victim of a family member's foibles crimes and or death see the pilot's wife the night guest et al you know the one where the husband dies and the widow has to rebuild her life or the one where the husband cheats and she has to rebuild her life or the one where the husband leaves her and she has to rebuild her life these character are usually also victims of the author's need to pile on the indignities and hurts making us and the character wallow in the tragedies life throws at us ugh so too with eileen leary this novel felt less like the author was interested in eileen and more in presenting a naturalist message of the determinism of social realities and heredity as well as making a statement about the inevitability but also therefore also the fatality of the american dream in short the book is too damned depressing no spoilers but after a while especially in the latter section where eileen has to deal with the tremendous psychological emotional and monetary burdens the author throws at her you just want it to stop and extra points ugh again for making the book close not on the brighter future of the final generation going forward but on one full of fear and anxiety and looking backwards one more word matthew thomas can really write some phrases sing off the page his metaphors are apt there are sentences that are so beautiful it hurts","2051":" eileen tumulty's upbringing in queens in the '40s was dominated by playing caretaker to her drinking irish parents she dreams of a better life and thinks she finds it when she marries ed leary a research scientist eileen is not always likeable she seems cold to her son and critical of her husband's lack of ambition she is always striving for upward mobility until an illness reveals a different side of her although the pacing is leisurely it appropriately reveals an american middle class family of the 20th century--the way they live love and adapt to unforeseen challenges reviewed by connie r check our catalog http encore cooklib org iii encore","2052":"very long and slow moving at times but worth reading","2053":"i don't understand the love this novel has gotten though the fact that i did want to know what happened propelled me through it lots of bad things happen to the three main characters all unpleasant people in their own way shouldn't have been over 600 pages either","2054":"so nearly a 5 clean spare language and well developed characters that learn and mature with the plot but i felt let down by the ending and i'm not yet sure why","2055":"i listened to the audio of this book read by mare winningham and i didn't realize how much of eileen's detached frozen perception of life i absorbed through the narrator's tone and flat affect until close to the end the plot moves erratically from fast to slow in places changes character voices often and portrays honestly the conflicted feelings of eileen the protagonist as she moves from a child to wife mother employee and caretaker","2056":"sad sad sad no one gets a break in this novel no one gets more than a brief glimmer of happiness it's a total downer from start to finish but finish it you will the pages fly by perhaps because that as humans we are ever hopeful and matthew thomas is a good writer but we are not ourselves is hard going and left me feeling crappy is the novel worth the hype maybe if you are in the right place but i can't imagine where that would be","2057":"whoever said the tale was long winded wasn't exaggerating parts of the story were very interesting others not so much it was a character study that dwelled on minutiae rather than having any meaningful reflection","2058":"not what i was expecting from all the critical hype it was an interesting story but a pretty heavy read overall the unrelenting misery got to be too much and i had trouble finishing the book","2059":"after eagerly waiting for this novel to arrive i was feeling an increasing rise of buyer's remorse as i neared the 350 page mark the plot seemed plodding and uneventful with characters who became more and more annoying but a sudden shift takes place in the second half of the book that i'm still nearly void of words to describe let's just say that it was a stunningly accurate portrayal of a tragedy that affects millions of families that left me full of emotional awe","2060":" this book just didn't work for me i really liked the first fifty pages or so and thought he did a good job setting the stage for eileen's life but after that i thought it read like 600 pages of a 70's sitcom that wasn't funny thomas is over descriptive without any subtlety whatsoever to the point where he tries to tell you to think differently from what you saw a character do the characterizations were woefully inconsistent almost like he forgot earlier scenes i couldn't read this past page 220 it has been a long time since i gave up on a book mid stream but i stopped believing in it i skipped to the last 30 pages just to see how it ended and i honestly wasn't sure that i missed a lot in the 400 pages before i like epics and it was a good idea with an okay plot i just didn't flow with the writing style","2061":"this review has been hidden because it contains spoilers to view it click here i read it because my father had alzheimer's and i'm drawn to stories that involve the disease however there is not one redeeming character in this novel no one is even remotely likeable i kept reading just to see whether anyone would have an epiphany and change but no not at all","2062":"i was very excited to receive an arc of this novel through library thing's early reviewers group so i was actually surprised to find myself putting it aside twice to read other books the writing was wonderful but i just couldn't keep reading about eileen tumulty she reminded me of a great aunt i had not my favorite person when i finally decided to push through about a third of the way through the book bam i was hooked and finished it in two days the summary of the novel is below and i am going to let you go with that because i had mixed feelings about the start of the book instead let me tell you about the book as a whole it was a wonderful thought provoking story that will stay with me a long time without giving away too much it shows you how amazing life can be hopefully i will have many years to enjoy this author's works","2063":"i'm not the target audience for this book it wasn't that i thought it was poorly written or anything i just got nothing out of it and found it tedious to get through sure you don't have to be a werewolf to enjoy a book about a werewolf but this book is very much meant for white middle aged people who have been married and have kids","2064":"this is the best book i've read in years it's the story of an irish american girl born in 1941 in new york city and it follows the events of her life listened to it as an audiobook with mare winningham's narration which got rave reviews amazing","2065":"i love these family sagas that cover at least twenty years and end in the now eileen is a complex character and just as you start to hate her she shows her loyalty to her family to the very end well done story","2066":"hard to read because it was so realistic and hit close to home i knew some of these characters well written i thought","2067":" to sum it up it was not what i expected but it sure did have its moments at a young age eileen is offered a glimpse into her mother's version of the american dream it is the image of a large house with the woman able to lounge inside and look out of her windows at all that she owns from that moment on eileen is determined to achieve a similar level of success for herself the man she goes on to marry and for the child they will have however this idea of the american dream is not what i will take away from this story i was far more entranced in the plight that befalls eileen's husband and the way it alters the development of mother and son as they struggle to come to terms with a new reality and their shortcomings in terms of their own expectations i will not say more than that due to spoilers i only want to stress that those sections of the book really got me to think particularly the final section and the reflections it presented because this book covers such a large span of years it will jump forward to significant moments of the characters' lives this is a very character driven novel you will either appreciate it or you will not for my part i am glad that i stuck with the story beyond my initial inclination to abandon it due to length and what i perceived to be stagnation if you also find yourself in this predicament then i advise to carry on because the moments that build to a crescendo of reflection was worth it","2068":"i really enjoyed that this book took place in queens ny it's always fun to know exactly where things are happening in a book the story was a real page turner although about 100 pages too long and you find yourself embracing the lives of the characters but it is hard to see how life sometimes doesn't turn out exactly as we would like well written and i would recommend it","2069":"one of the best books i had read full of compassion love and more feelings and emotions than i can list i love this book","2070":"very drawn out i'm sure a person who looks deeply at the meaning behind books could find a lot of things to love but i'm just not one of those people it was well written and simply a detailed telling of a woman's life","2071":"the magic of the struggles and joys of an ordinary life are beautifully captured in this wonderful story","2072":"i almost don't know what to say about this one this is a way too long not always enjoyable debut novel it's all character and almost no plot the theme of the first 500 pages seems to be life is a very disappointing thing but the ending is so so beautiful and i already miss these characters deeply so 4 stars this is essentially a long long story of a marriage where the man and the woman have to negotiate their differing ideas about the good life the characters are very real full of flaws don't pick this up if you're looking for something happy or if you want a book full of action or twists but if you want to meet some complex people that will make your heart clutch this is a good choice i'll be looking for more from this author","2073":"first half of the book is way too long i assume that's because the author wants us invested in these characters i had to keep checking the son's age because he kept behaving as if he were a naive 10 year old when he was really 16 and doing stupid things when he was a college freshman who had graduated high school with fairly high honors i understand book smart isn't the same as common sense but still that said i liked the author's writing style well enough to look for something else by him possible spoiler alert halfway through this too long book something happens that we all see coming i tried to remember that this thing is set 25 years ago so maybe people weren't as aware but it was still frustrating to see how the characters dealt with the something","2074":"the subject of the book or rather the most compelling part of the story is the effect alzheimer's disease can have on a persons life and those around it that particular story has been told but matthew thomas has gone into a different subject we are not ourselves focuses a lot more on the people around the diseased how the disease affects their lives and interactions starting from the early signs of the disease in doing so the author also looks at the fact that those people live for an idea of what they should be not always focused on their own desires and needs but rather on external impulses furthermore the characters then fail to live up to this externally set ideal only to accommodate to those around them the book is more about how identity is shaped by the conditions of our life and how even in the over individualized world of the late 20th and early 21st century america we are shaped by those around us for better or worse as a reflection on ourselves and our lives it is a great book to read finally the smooth narrative the importance of everyday events the simplicity with which the author brings us into the character lives by narrating as workaday a thing as how evenings are spent and through this small narratives broach a complex subject that is magic the number of characters and the straightforwardness of their stories make it quite readable such that it can be recommended to anyone the book does not aspire to be a great work of literature and as such achieves quite a lot the lack of grandeur makes it a great book to read","2075":"i thought the summary of the book was written better than the book itself i never liked any of the characters because they were described with no depth it could have been a good story","2076":"i loved this book a great character study real people are flawed and sometimes not likable life is not always what we hoped for mistakes are made illness happens this story is all of that and i found myself caring for and cheering on each person to me that's what makes a great book","2077":"i can't believe i read the whole thing i wish i had not that's 3 days of reading time that would have been better spent on pretty much anything else in my tbr pile i'm not sure why i didn't stop i could have walked away from it at any moment and never worried about the fate of the boring grim miserable characters within its pages","2078":"we are not ourselves is a rare work that dictates its own pace achingly profound failings of humanity halt bouts of frenzied reading as selfish thoughts confront complex emotions and when the story ends it brings a deep sigh utterance of awestruck profanity and appreciation for the talents of matthew thomas","2079":"eloquent well written and depressingthis is a good book i say this because it's thought provoking it made me think and reflect in new ways about my own life it's very well written eloquent boasts an impressive vocabulary and contains great and profound sentences and concepts the plot is strong and the book held my attention this book addresses real life and its issues and downfalls in ways i hadn't before encountered in a book it is so real the downside of this is that the story is very depressing it left me with a faint anxiety about what my own life might hold in store for me it's a long book too which means a long immersion in a depressing world i was eager to finish it both so that i could find out what happens in the end and also so that i could get out of this depressing world and read something more uplifting to cleanse the palate","2080":"we are not ourselves is an epic historical fiction that follows the life loss and love of the leary family written in a beautiful prose this life long journey is an honest look at marriage parenting and family and how we all strive for the grass that's just a little greener","2081":"omg what a wonderful book unbelievable that this is the matthew thomas' first novel the story is set mainly in new york city and suburbs it's the story of a woman born from irish parents she wants a better life than they had she marries a man who she thought could provide her with that but didn't anticipate the unfortunate development of early onset alzheimer's in her husband their son struggles with trying to be a good son to his parents and finding his own identity it's a long read 620 pages but well worth it","2082":"heard a lot about this book but was disappointed pretty quickly it started out ok but draggggged so much in the middle that i am surprised i finished it","2083":"this review has been hidden because it contains spoilers to view it click here such mixed feelings about this book i didn't really like eileen much though she was a very well drawn character and seemed consistent throughout the book i just kept wishing she would get a good therapist she certainly had a hard life and i felt like the medical system let her down alzheimer's is bad no doubt that but there is more support available than she had or maybe than she would take the book didn't really address that sometimes she had friends and sometimes not early on in dia such mixed feelings about this book i didn't really like eileen much though she was a very well drawn character and seemed consistent throughout the book i just kept wishing she would get a good therapist she certainly had a hard life and i felt like the medical system let her down alzheimer's is bad no doubt that but there is more support available than she had or maybe than she would take the book didn't really address that sometimes she had friends and sometimes not early on in diagnosis she was kind of deserted she is about my age and also a nurse so i found myself comparing where i was with what was going on with her i thought about 3 stars but it has hung with me so that makes it worth 4 im not sure what would make me think this was great but it just seemed a little off more","2084":"why i read this book twice and it still lacks coherence while the words and descriptions are very well done i still don't get the point very disappointing","2085":"a great story about living with and caring for someone with alzheimer's disease accurate and well done","2086":"this book is oddly claustrophobic yet deep it's too long by at least a third and myopically focused two families a dad ed mom eileen and son connell for the majority of the plot and in the beginning of the book it's eileen's childhood family so her mom and dad eileen holds the tiny worlds together -- they aren't actually tiny but the writing rotates solely around the life and health of these family members in relation to each other so while eileen is a career long nurse the reader gleans practically nothing about her professional experience -- everything is focused on herself and her relationship with her parents and then her son and husband on the one hand i admire how the author is so disciplined on sticking with these parameters in terms of what to explore with each character on the other parts the book moved far too slowly especially in the chapters when the husband ed is clearly suffering some sort of mental physical breakdown that no one understands so while it's an impressive achievement of writing i do wish a talented editor had helped shape the narrative to be a bit more succinct","2087":"i wasn't sure what to expect but this was an excellent book it was so true and open and honest that it scared me a bit actually it's a novel that makes you face a potential reality and realize what some go through with this illness as well what their loved ones must experience and then the friends and family who aren't quite sure how to handle the situation the ending while emotional seemed just so sincere that it was truly touching and heartbreaking i'd recommend this book for sure","2088":"i really appreciate the character development and well thought out story i also felt the weight of what the author was trying to portray having said that there was something really grating about this book almost nagging it was waaaay too long drawn out to the point that it insisted upon itself i was so relieved to have it done that i barely gave it any thought when i put it down which is unfortunate because it really is a good story","2089":" thank god i've finished this book the blurb and reviews on the back cover are so misleading for most of the book nothing happened except everyday life of a woman that i could not connect with it was boring and lacking in emotion i suppose the clue is on the front cover longlisted for the guardian first book award well there was a reason it didn't make the shortlist the blurb says this book took 10 years to write and it felt like i've taken 10 years to read it a loss that will last a lifetime it happens so late in the book that there is no lifetime left even though the book trudges through this family's life toward the end the author suddenly refers to past events she will never forget the time that yet this is the first we have heard of it how can the reader feel the emotion of a non existent memory the book is shallow too long and without direction do not waste your time reading it like i did there are much much better books out there i have given it 2 stars but this is mostly for the grammar","2090":"brilliantly written very moving a bit long in the middle insightful poignant real 60 years 1951 2011 through the life of an irish american family the characters will stay with me a long time","2091":" i kept reading this book a first reads gift because it was so beautifully written the story characters u0026amp the life events presented are actually quite boring u0026amp by page 361 very depressing i will complete this novel because of wonderful descriptions u0026amp phrases ed describes the christmas window displays on fifth avenue as alters to consumer excess this was her life right here petty as it seemed at the moment u0026amp this was the man she'd chosen to spend it with he was holding his hat in his hand as if he had taken it off for the purpose of beseeching her u0026amp she saw that he would always have flaws that he would always be a little too intense in his objections a little too unbending when it came to to the decadence of the world there were some things that couldn't be communicated u0026amp this was one how much pleasure a woman like her could take in the fact u0026amp presence of her beautiful baby boy she knew it wouldn't be like this forever soon she'd make demands on him expect the world of him she was going to enjoy this part she was going to fill up her heart with it for enough for years this book is so well written it should have been a 4 or 5 star read it had has potentially interesting elements irish alcoholism marriage life bullying becoming a bully after being bullied life in new york altzheimers etc i have to admit to skimming the the last third it was too boring u0026amp too depressing","2092":"i liked didn't love this book it was about 200 pages too long i started to lose interest about half way through and had to force myself to keep going i'm glad i stuck it out however i can't say i'd ever read it again","2093":" this book is getting rave reviews but i'm really not sure why it is very long boring and hard to relate to the characters because they are so flat the epic immigrant saga is almost non existent really this about a boring story about a family caring for the father with alzheimer's what i could not believe is that it took more than half the book to get to his diagnosis even though it was so obvious thought it might pick up then but just continued being a boring story don't waster your time or money on this book","2094":"great fulfilling ending but the rest of the story dragged i felt like i was always waiting for something big to happen it was like a bunch of short anecdotal stories strung together","2095":"my favorite line that night when she couldn't sleep she concentrated on the steadiness of the stars their transcendence of human sorrow and confusion the reassurance offered by the unfathomable scale of geologic time wow","2096":"tedious depiction of one family through the years this is one of those books that doesn't really have a plot it's more of this is the chronicle of this particular family which i don't much enjoy unless the characters are interesting both in their personality and in their lives no such luck here","2097":" this was the kind of book without a lot of action girl is born and raised in new york girl marries boy and has a kid kid grows up parents get old etc parts of the story felt very real like the moments you think are super critical but you actually forget about them overtime and those moments that feel forgettable but turn out to be life changing other parts were annoying or felt pointless connell's elementary school days or eileen's house hunting escapades overall though the book was pretty good","2098":"compelling storyline if not as tightly edited as it could have been like real life it meandered a bit in describing the lives of its characters and there were times when i had no idea where it was going it traces the trajectory of a daughter of irish immigrants from her childhood dealing with her mother's alcoholism to a difficult marriage i won't reveal all the details because it would ruin the story but i think this was well worth a read","2099":"terrific read highly recommend this","2100":"held my attention for all 600 pages it was a very good account of a family dealing with the trials of alzheimer's","2101":"i've got to stop reading books like this apparently crushed dreams in unarguably great lives where the waiting for the other shoe to drop cripples me with dread all week where halfway through the the book i ask myself what the fuck is this even about and it is something altogether different than a failed revolutionary road marriage it is the american century and i felt so small minded ann patchett recommends this book at parnassus books in nashville and i might need to go there in person to get some more recommendations in person","2102":"i love it when the characters in a novel talk real and act real not like we'd like them to but how real people are this is definitely a character driven story about a family making their way through life figuring out what is important learning from experiences facing fears and disappointments and making the reader crazy when they do it wrong it is a novel that sucks you into the family's life and makes you feel their anger and needs and successes and losses lots of good insights along the way loved it","2103":"this review has been hidden because it contains spoilers to view it click here i really enjoyed this book yes it was long but i think in the end it's a satisfying read the focus is primarily on one character and how her experiences growing up shaped her aspirations and what happens when you aren't in sync with reality but push ahead anyway many flawed characters but there is a redemptive element in the many bleak moments and i really hope i don't get alzheimer's or have to live with someone who does","2104":" i love that this book started with a fragment of one of my favorite poems by stanley kunitz i knew i would be in for a thoughtful tangled book about love and i was not disappointed romantic love parent child love the love of a well worn marriage all are addressed in this beautiful story i was lucky to read this before lots of reviews have come out so the story unfolded for me as it did for the characters i had no foreknowledge of what was to come what i experienced is an author who seemed to have compassion for all of his characters as well as a deep kinship with new york and its ongoing evolution read this book you will not be disappointed","2105":"this review has been hidden because it contains spoilers to view it click here family saga following the life of eileen leary from the 1950s to the present very long but good characters and great depiction of alzheimers","2106":"writing was fine story transition was clunky at times overall just very predictable","2107":"could not make it through everything went grey and redundant around 150 and has not bounced back some 100 pages further in maybe things turn around but i am not pulled in enough by the characters to wait it out","2108":"well after finally finishing this epic i can say that it was very slow to start but somewhere towards the middle end i became engaged with the story this was a novel about ordinary lives told with clarity and detail the insight into the family relationships was moving","2109":"this review has been hidden because it contains spoilers to view it click here i just finished we are not ourselves i do not recommend it i was fine with it until i was half way through and behaviors in the main character started to change and i no longer liked her as a person and the same for her son and that takes the heart out of the story for me the best part of the 600 page book was a letter that the father left the son when he found out at 51 years old that he was developing alzheimer's","2110":"we trace eileen's life from her poor irish upbringing through her adulthood marriage her child etc eileen herself is not likeable nor is anyone else in the book this family is sad all of them and i found i really could not relate to any of them the book is written well enough that i stuck with this book to see if there was some kind of payoff at the end there isn't and it's way way way too long","2111":"i enjoyed the first half of this book but struggled to stay with the second half i cared about the characters less and less and it just started to feel as if the author was stretching to get to 100 chapters including vignettes that were not pertinent to the story that being said the ending finally was somewhat uplifting","2112":"i'm still not sure i know what the novel was about per se but i really enjoyed it the little moments that make up a life the paths taken and not taken it gave me a lot to think about","2113":"hard book for me to read very slow i was constantly annoyed by the narrator i didn't quite finish but i could not go on","2114":"very hard to summarize what this book is about because there is not an obvious plot to speak of i'm sad to be done with this book though because i was sucked into the lives of the characters and along with them for all the details of their lives","2115":" finishing this book was like saying a final goodbye to a beloved somewhat long winded fascinating family member who gives you a heartache but ultimately makes you feel rejuvenated if you had asked me to review this book partway though i would have said that the story moved at such a glacial pace that i could not give you a clear perception of it but once it hit the 3 4 mark it finally became rich and satisfying and continued that way until the ending it's especially remarkable for the relationship between the father and the son","2116":"a good read family saga that follows the main character through her girlhood into her late adulthood though some of the chapters are also focused on her son as he navigates adolescence and beyond she's not a very likeable character but she still evoked my compassion my only complaint is that it could have been quite a bit shorter than its 620 pages","2117":"way too wordy i think the author could have had a better story if he had condensed it it's a fairly simple story of love marriage children sickness and healing one of the problems i had with the author is that he would detail the couple's serious financial problems and in the next chapters they bought a very expensive home went to italy purchased a mink and enrolled their child in a pricey school at one point after the husband lost his job and his pension the wife hired a handyman and paid him $800 a week remodeled the house and consulted a spiritualist at over $1 000 a month when her husband went into a $5 000 mo nursing home she kept the handyman and her paid her son's tuition at a top 5 college since she was just a nurse i'm not sure where all this money came from there were too many disconnects for example we were introduced to a minor character in the early pages of the book but 400 pages later the main character goes to visit this person without reminding us who she was i had to flip back and find a mention of her to get the connection the characters were boring the husband laid on the couch and listened to opera music every night the wife went to her room to watch tv and the child was left to his own devices while there were moments of brilliance for the most part this book fell flat i really wanted to like we are not ourselves because it was so highly recommended that's why i kept reading when i wanted to give up after reading the last page i realized i should have moved on to another book 500 pages earlier","2118":"i probably didn't give this book a chance but i could not get into it i got as far as eileen being in college and just couldn't make myself plod forward maybe it's my age at 69 i figure i don't have the time to wade through epic books that i'm not really enjoying kudos to the author for being so successful with his first endeavor","2119":"three and 1 2 stars maybe just a touch too long a somber story about the intricacies of family relationships and the inevitable process of aging","2120":"an epic work this novel will remind you of the importance of enjoying life where you are living it right now","2121":"it took me a long time to get into this book and finish it i felt like it dragged at times and didn't understand why some parts were deemed necessary to the story at all however it was beautifully and honestly written i didn't like any of the characters hated eileen pretty much the whole time but somehow thomas achieved it with such finesse to see full review visit http foldedpagesdistillery blogspot","2122":"excellent writing the characters give insight into your own life no matter what family situation you're in emotional and straightforward at the same time i'm very happy with this book and looking forward to his next one","2123":"i didn't know if i would like this when i started especially since i knew i would be in it for 600 pages but it became unputdownable quite soon eileen was very hard for me to identify with since she was a rather cold mother but her relationship with her husband was intriguing i wanted her to recognize the signs of what was happening to her husband sooner than she did but it wouldn't have made any difference i recommend this","2124":"we really get to know these people and the way their experiences influence their decisions i cried in places i laughed out loud and at times for madder than hell good read","2125":"this is a beautifully written novel which i found painfully too long because the characters are just not likable i really wanted to like the book and the leary family but they are so cold and repressed i found it difficult to warm up to them i can't find fault with the words which are clearly well crafted and should be after ten years of writing except to say that there are just too many of them it was difficult for me to relate to a mother who is so absent from milestones in her child's life forcing him to quit a sport he loves not even taking him to the train or the airport when he is leaving for college etc eileen's control issues and stubborn ideal of how her life should be stood in the way of her living a rich full loving life no one in this book is honest with each other about their feelings there's little affection and everyone is held at arm's length i found it profoundly depressing and at times downright boring","2126":"i received an arc of this book in exchange for an honest review i don't think a book has ever made me cry this hard not just tears but full out heartbroken sobbing this is a pretty long book and for a good amount of time i wasn't sure where it was going but i kept reading because i liked the main character eileen and she agreed with a lot of my basic tenants about being the best that you can at whatever you do working hard saving money the novel is about the american dream and creating a good life for your family even if you come from nothing it's also an unlikely love story the character building is incredible it's slow and subtle and their personalities and quirks aren't just rattled off but shown throughout different scenes in the book i grew to love and hate them at different times but i was always rooting for them and i only grew more attached to them with every page towards the middle of the novel i thought that i could be reading my new favorite book of all time it was that moving that important and that beautiful unfortunately the last 100 or so pages took it too far for me i had been ready for the story to end but it kept going and i grew a little uncomfortable with the new relationships forming and i even started to feel at least at one point that it was getting a little melodramatic and just trying to break your heart but all throughout it continued to be very honest and very beautifully written and it is destined to become a masterpiece in the beginning i knew i'd love it but i knew i could never get very many people to read it because it was so long by the middle i knew that i would force people to read it to because it'd change their life and now i know i could only recommend this to a very special sort of person my first recommendations are always to my sister and my mom but my sister's way too young to appreciate it and my mom would never forgive me for making her so miserably sad for fictional characters i don't say that it's heartbreaking like when your favorite character dies but in the way that it so honestly explores the ways in which life can simultaneously lift you up and let you down a beautiful beautiful book it's not for everyone if you value action over growth and development you'll hate it but this is the kind of novel that can open you up to a life you'll never get to live if you're willing to give it a try i don't own many physical copies of books i'm an e reader kind of girl but i will have to get a hardcover of this and read it again and again","2127":"as a reader i've recognized that there is a right time and a wrong time for a book to come into my life it was the wrong time in my life for this one which is not to say that i didn't appreciate the writing or the epic saga of the leary family i plodded through it determined to finish and i'm glad i did but i can see the book having more resonance in my life twenty years from now when it will hopefully still be stored in my kindle version 18 3 5 stars","2128":" i went into this one with no expectations and it is really hard for me to choose just one rating so i'm going in the middle it was a well written character study more like 4 stars for the author's writing talent very long but didn't seem all that slow moving and had characters that felt like real people but it was sad and full of reality and for me i have a hard time loving these types of books i may be simple but i like an escape with a pleasant ending in my books and this one just left me feeling down so kudos on the writing just not my kind of story","2129":"loved the story line loved the characters for the most part i couldn't put it down there were a few parts where i felt the author left some gaps and that's why i didn't give it 5 stars","2130":"gorgeously written but heartbreakingly sad","2131":"wow this has a lot of very positive reviews here and its average rating is pretty high but i've read 15 chapters found that i'm only 21% of the way through u0026amp decided that i don't care enough about what happens to these characters to spend the amount of time with them that it would take to finish this long novel too many other books that i'm looking forward to on my to read list","2132":" matthew thomas creates a vivid realistic portrait in this his first novel drawn from some autobiographical experiences he writes about eileen tumulty who grows up under the animated shadow of her father who was a man that everyone gravitated to who held court at the local bar dispensing patience and empathic advice she grew up in a queens tenement house with one of the three bedrooms housing a border eileen was bright and attractive and fell in love with ed leary whose intelligence in brain research could have landed him in many prosperous positions but he preferred to teach and was noble in his resistance to his wife's social climbing ambitions eileen becomes a career nurse and eventually they have a son connell and move out to bronxville the dream house that eileen always wanted the narrative of the family changes as signs from ed start to concern eileen and connell their life from that point on will be drastically different based on an author interview that i have hyperlinked below mr thomas put a lot of his childhood experiences into the novel certain elements like the love of baseball and the satisfaction of teaching let you know that these descriptions did not have to be researched it was a pleasure to spend time with the leary family and the portrait of dealing with a loved one's failing health is realistic painful and loving http books simonandschuster com we","2133":" 3 5 stars if i could give half starsthis is a long book that is totally character driven i found that i really liked eileen o'leary although she is far from perfect and could have been more warmer to her son ed was harder to like although that was softened a bit by the fact that it was clear to me what his diagnosis was long before he and eileen received it their son connell is well drawn and anyone who has raised a teenager can relate to his self involvement during much of the novel i'm sure i'll be thinking about this family for quite some time","2134":"very sad but very readable","2135":" this is the first novel i've read that has compelled me to donate i started reading without recalling the plot details benefit of ebooks are no back cover spoilers so the inexorable excruciating decline of a lead character and his family's responses just got me this isn't the only book about alzheimers i've read john bayley's books about iris were pretty potent and last year the world and his onion was reading elizabeth is missing which i don't remember rating that highly this book is long and maybe the power came in patience the author took the time to really establish character before nodding to anything wrong at all anyway i shall go home and research which alzheimers organisation needs money the most and hand it over very willingly","2136":" we are not ourselves follows eileen the daughter of two irish immigrants as she navigates the post wwii era eileen wants more out of life feeling the pressure from her own not so great upbringing and the thoughts of society in general for bigger and better she get married has a son and constantly tries to work her family into a better part of society when her husband comes down with early onset alzheimer's she realizes that all of what she worked for doesn't matter in fact in some cases works against her in caring for her husband i liked the fact this book crosses through a little over half a century and while mostly through the point of view of eileen you get glimpses of her son connell's thoughts as well however eileen is a hard character to love or root for she comes off as cold and standoffish she loves but in a distant sort of way her son is surprised at one point in the book when she hugs him usually he is the one to start a hug her drive and expectations that everyone else should want bigger and better wears on the reader you are tired for her i gave this book 3 stars only because it did a very good job of bringing out emotional responses from me i cried several times during this book which means the author did a well enough job weaving his tale i would have given it 2 stars if it hadn't eileen is a tough character who by the end of the book i had very little sympathy for even though i could tell the author was trying his best to redeem her to an extent i almost couldn't forgive her for certain decisions she made","2137":"the book was very well written but about 300 pages too long the characters were well developed but the plot got really slow and at times i wondered where the book was heading i stuck with the book and found that it was very thought provoking when you got far into it it would be a good book for a discussion group but they would have to be forewarned that it is slow moving at times","2138":"this book started out good u0026amp turned out just okay for two reasons the first is that as i read on the book became more of a case study than a novel u0026amp i have read case studies that are far more interesting than this novel my second problem is that the character eileen was unbelievable if she was a nurse with both education u0026amp experience she would have known what was going on u0026amp taken action much earlier that she did","2139":"captivatingbeautifully written provided a clear picture of what it is like to live with such a difficult illness gave a good presentation of all the characters and their inner feelings","2140":" it will be difficult to talk about this book without giving too much away while it wasn't a twisty turny book it also wasn't about what i expected it to be about and that discovery made it all the more interesting staying true to my book kryptonite this is a book that follows the decades of eileen tumulty leary's life we start with her as a child of irish immigrants in nyc in the 1940s we continue with her as she marries ed tumulty a researcher with a promising career after a tough childhood she has big hopes for her life and she pins them all on ed but as life goes nothing goes as planned i'll admit eileen drove me batty yet another unlikeable character in a stream of books that i've read lately she is so focused on her own idea of happiness that she completely misses what is truly going on in her family i banged my fist on this book several times and even wanted to throw it across the room a time or two but my hatred of eileen kept me reading because i needed to see if she'd ever get a clue and what would happen if she did eileen doesn't necessarily get better as the book progresses it isn't until the end when she finally realizes that she didn't know what she was missing for basically her entire adult life but somewhere along the way between hating her and that ultimate revelation i began to change my attitude toward her because really how often do we all put unrealistic expectations on those we love how often do we not see reality either because we're too busy too self absorbed or too far in denial in the end this book is a wake up call against those very natural tendencies eileen is not unlike most of us though i still contend she's too self absorbed the subject matter is a bit unrelenting and i felt the plot was drawn out in spots this is definitely a book where i will forget some of the salient details because they were just minutiae in the leary family's trajectory but it is an engrossing read in the moment because what this family goes through is very real the author does a good job presenting us with a glimpse into a family that could easily be our own","2141":"couldn't finish this book it was so depressing","2142":"tedious","2143":" 3 5 this book is beautiful heartbreaking and very brutally honest what i loved was the way it flowed so much like real life with so many changes and unexpected directions we see a girl who was being picked up by her dad at ballet classes grow up to become a wife mother and responsible adult struggling with events that shock her family the book itself is a very character centric epic where you got to look into the heart of human flaw in the most honest way i've ever seen mathhew thomas sugarcoats nothing and i admire him for his ability to portray real people the problem was is that i didn't like any of these people there was no sole character i could find enjoyable the main character eileen can be really racist and strict on gender stereotypes her son is a wishy washy boy who has been steered so much by his mother that he has a massive lack of drive or ability to think for himself and i won't say much about the father just because of spoilers but lets just say at the beginning of his novel he is selfishif you have a 600 page character driven novel i think its important to have likeable characters thomas was brilliant at capitalizing human flaw and some human strength but it seemed like all we are is our flaws and the ability to move on during hardship it's like he could set up charater flaws brilliantly but he faltered on character strengths usually this is the other way around and i think the reason i could move past the fact that the characters had a lack of original strengths was the fact that the writing flaw was reversed besides this the novel is crushingly realistic nothing is romanticized the characters do ugly things and tell horrible lies but we all do at some point personally i think it was brilliant but in the end i can only give it 3 5 stars because i just wished that the characters were a bit more likeable i feel the book would have had more of a punch if i loved the characters","2144":"i would have given this book 3 1 2 stars if i could i was just sort of meh about this book some parts of it just dragged for me i know it was not a plot driven book but still there were times when i just wanted to shout let's move on and then the ending the epilogue just felt rushed","2145":" in this impressive debut novel matthew thomas has written a masterful story about the mysteries of the mind as well as the heart in addition he has written a sweeping family saga of the american middle class in the twentieth century that encompasses life love death and how we persevere at the heart of story is the fierce passionate character of eileen leary who remembering her irish roots strives for a better life for herself and her family despite the novel's epic size the story is made up of small truths and intimate moments that will remain with the reader for a long time 4 5 5 stars","2146":"just read the nytimes review and this book sounds fabulous","2147":"rounded up to five stars it was on 18 cds and started out so slowly it made me sigh and think oh dear another endless irish family saga but it moves along sometimes skipping years at a time until it zeros in on ed's illness in his 50s how eileen copes and to a lesser degree how ed and their son connell cope takes up the major portion of the book i saw it coming sooner than any of them did don't know if it's a spoiler to mention alzheimer's disease but i'm very sensitive about this because my mother had some dementia not ad and my husband does now ad is ruled out and that is a great relief so there is this extra apprehension for me and extra appreciation of how eileen handles it all a rather consuming book but very well written with spot on characterizations","2148":" 4 5 stars a quiet colossal epic using direct simple yet powerful prose thomas constructs a thorough and intimate portrayal of lives torn apart by alzheimer's but it's much more than just that this is fiction at its most three dimensional presented by a writer who clearly loves his characters and labored hard to see them fully realized in a way that is rarely done in fiction about as convincing an argument for getting to the heart of the story through specificity of character as i've ever read if it has a weakness it's that much of the beginning middle is nowhere near as gripping as the last 200 pages but i do not fault a writer this devoted to his story too much","2149":"this book was hard for me to read as it follows the progression of alzheimer's on a loved one but i am glad i read it as it was well done","2150":"fantastic characters even especially when i didn't like them much great pacing with moments of insight that never cross too far into preaching territory","2151":"what a beautifully written american story honest joyful painful and uncomfortable all at once like life highly recommend b","2152":"this just a good book not sure why it appeals to me so much but the part about the husband having early onset alzheimer's disease was so touching and sad something so many older children are seeing in their elderly parents","2153":" eileen is just a child when she has to take on a more prominent role in her family cooking cleaning watching over her parents depending on how much alcohol they have consumed so naturally growing up eileen dreams of a better more perfect life when she meets ed leary a smart educated man she thinks she has found it only ed is not what eileen thought and as their family grows so does their differences in the midst of this battle the family gets news that will force them to reconcile their situation this novel is a family saga about the changing dynamics of the leary family that occur from the mid 1950's to early 2000's the novel follows eileen her husband ed and son connell having grown up the way she did it is hard to blame eileen for wanting better yet at times her character came off as selfish nonsympathetic to be fair the same can be said about connell and to some extent ed without a doubt this is a character driven plot while the characters were not always likeable they were realistic which allowed for an honest portrayal the narrative was thoughtful and insighful and the prose well done having said that the book is slow moving and long too long besides that its a good debut novel","2154":"loved this epic novel about irish family in queens beautiful writing made me laugh made me cry","2155":"it took me awhile to get into this book and did not really care for the characters all that much once ed was diagnosed with alzheimer's felt the book became more compelling","2156":"a beautiful book that like the disease around which the story is woven slowly and inexorably draws you into the life of eileen leary the challenges she faces as an irish immigrant child her struggles to create a family in hard times and ultimately the burden she carries of a husband who succumbs to alzheimer's the characters are carefully hand crafted to be authentic and believable in every way i became engrossed and uplifted by this woman's experience","2157":"i am so glad to have finally finished this book it's depressing and populated with unlikable and unredeemable characters all around the only thing that allowed me to get through this lengthy book was that it is superbly written the story did move and kept me engaged but i was motivated to finish it just to get it over with so i could move on to something else many people love this book so don't take my word for it if the synopsis appeals to you i just thought it was a drag","2158":" i wish i could rate this book 2 5 stars although there were some excellent aspects to this book it was very tedious and boring at times about 1 4 to 1 3 of the way through when i was really wondering if i should bother to continue i decided to check out the ratings on goodreads for it and saw that several other reviewers had also found it boring and tedious as well as several who found it excellent i only grew to like one of main characters eileen near the end of the book she had grown up in a family in which her irish father was very popular among the people of their neighborhood but her mother suffered from depression and then became an alcoholic even though she eventually got sober and stayed sober eileen never seemed to get past the difficulties of her childhood she was always looking for something better in her life to be more upwardly successful and seemed to never be satisfied with how her life was until nearly the end of the book she married ed a scientist and was sure he would be the ticket to the kind of life she felt she needed to live but he had no desires for status or wealth he loved research and teaching and turned down promotions which he felt would not allow him to keep on doing what he loved then their son connell was a nerd type of kid who never seemed to fit in anywhere but was always under pressure from his mother to be a great success none of those parts of the book drew me in the book picked up interest for me when ed began to fail and was given a diagnosis that changed their lives completely from then on the book became much more interesting to me although i didn't like connell i thought his character was fairly typical of many teenagers and young people today fortunately he found his way eventually","2159":" 3 stars feels a little generous because the first 300 pages i really wanted to give up all the hype surrounding the book made me doubt myself a little maybe something really interesting is going to happen in the next 50 pages which of course was a mixed decision the latter half of the book was worth it but by then i really was wishing pain and tragedy on the characters just so they would do something a little more interesting to do and talk about there's nothing wrong with middle class striving it just needs to have something a little richer than the striving to talk about in a novel after about 350 pages some significant developments happen that totally change the tone of the novel eileen has always been a caretaker for her family members and the novel later on expands more deeply on this theme however the issues with constructing the novel and there are some issues i thought with the last 50 pages as well both in plot and point of view really detracted from it that being said this is fairly good for a first novel there are lots of pitfall and the pacing is atrocious but the characters were interestingly drawn and the actual mechanics of the writing were pleasant nothing too inventive or fancy but it did the job perfectly now if someone could just take a red pen to the whole thing that would be totally awesome","2160":"i really loved this book it is not a fast moving read but is quiet and meditative the second half after a medical curveball changes the lives of everyone in the family was especially gripping life doesn't work out the way we planned","2161":"i received a copy from netgalley in turn for my honest review we are not ourselves is a story about perception of the american dream of heartache and of life this story follows eileen the daughter of irish immigrants in woodside queens starting off when she was a child and the book continues throughout her life through growing up marriage children and so on there are struggles and heartache and the drive to have more but what she wants more of is not what truly matters she is very much stuck on the idea of having what others have doing more better but never quite achieving any of it even when it comes to friends she is a social climber or at least she tries so i found her to be a shallow person a real person but very shallow she pushes her husband who is quite satisfied with life as it is to want more work harder she is someone who even if she gets what she wants she will never be satisfied i found it hard to truly care for most of the characters i found them for the most part unlikeable though at times i could find some little charm here or there but i don't believe they were created to be loved and adored they had a realness about them that created a living world the writing was vivid and poetic even though at times i felt the book could have been a bit shorter matthew thomas has shown that he is every bit a wordsmith with this debut novel","2162":"this took me awhile i liked the story and the characters but the one character's deterioration towards the end of the book was difficult so i had to read it in smaller chunks worth the time to get into though","2163":"$1m for a debut novel intrigued me as well as the fact that a lot of it took place in jackson heights where my parents had lived when i was first born i heard about this book through a feature in the september october issue of poets u0026amp writers magazine it was a look inside the new york city offices of simon u0026amp schuster as its staff prepared to launch matthew thomas's debut novel we are not ourselves a title the publisher acquired for more than a million dollars the fact that they paid $1m for a debut novel intrigued me as well as the fact that a lot of it took place in jackson heights where my parents had lived when i was first born and where i would eventually move back to it is a book in which nothing much happens outside of following three generations of an irish american family from jackson heights and then eventually bronxville children are born couples fall in love they work kids go off to school they lose themselves and find themselves and all the things that life throws at you as you age from weight gain to doubt to illness to joy to say anymore would take some of the joy of reading this story from you it should suffice to say that it was well worth the $1m matthew thomas was paid for this novel","2164":"loved this wonderful family saga it was slow going at times but well worth sticking with","2165":"if only misfortunes would stay in stories you hear this is the kind of story where your average is not enough until it's all you really want and wish you hadn't taken for granted a wishing it weren't so kind of story","2166":"this review has been hidden because it contains spoilers to view it click here this review contains significant spoilers so don't read this if you don't want to know what happens we are not ourselves has gotten glowing reviews from reviewers and authors i respect so i started it expecting a lot it took a while to get into it it's long 656

depressing the second ha this review contains significant spoilers so don't read this if you don't want to know what happens we are not ourselves has gotten glowing reviews from reviewers and authors i respect so i started it expecting a lot it took a while to get into it it's long 656 pages in paperback and slow the story it tells of an irish immigrant family in new york is gritty and bleak at a certain point i found it depressing enough that i considered stopping then it gets more depressing the second half of the book describes a main character who it becomes increasingly clear is suffering from dementia he's relatively young in his 50s so no one except possibly the reader is prepared for it irrational angry behavior denial and avoidance on the part of the people connected to him isolation vulnerability as navigating the world becomes less and less possible for him it's all there and it all rings true thomas's portrayal is so vivid evocative and accurate that i have to believe that someone he loved suffered with this disease for me having lost my dad to dementia almost exactly a year ago it was really difficult to read the author creates a detailed believable world and dimensional if not always likable characters the writing is good and sometimes very good i'm glad i read it but i don't know if i would have if i knew what it was about more","2167":"liked most of it the ending seemed sudden the whole book was about eileen and then we find out she died with no explanation seemed like a sudden transition for this character it was a broad view of america from the late 50's to the present time","2168":" i'm not finished yet with this long book but i know that i will finish it in fact i can tell that i will love it the writing is superb the characterizations so real and the world in which they move and grow and change is rich and familiar without embossing it with special significance in fact that is the first point i would like to make marketing this book as a story about a multi generational irish american family while true is almost beside the point it could be about any newly claimed american family of european descent striving for a better life there are several themes that run throughout the book i can tell but one of them is how distorted our values become in a society that is always striving for more one of the more subtle talents this writer displays is portraying a character with flaws i'm thinking of eileen here and then showing us through the story how she manifests strengths that serve to balance out her flaws without giving away a major plot line i will just say that eileen does love her husband and son in her own way it's just that her striving and aggressive nature keep her from understanding what he and her son really need or what she herself could use i admired the way the author leads us to this conclusion in a very natural and organic way allowing eileen's flaws to represent a common human failure that anyone can relate to i'm about three quarters of the way through and the reading is getting tough right now as the learys deal with a major crisis that is hard to read about that is also a testament to this writer's skill in getting us to care about the characters i highly recommend this book","2169":"i have read about a fourth of this very long book and it is just dragging along with nothing much happening it rambles and rambles through an irish woman's life and i got to the point where i don't care what happens and don't want to even open the book anymore so i quit","2170":" what a quietly powerful novel it's hard to conceive that this is a debut work for matthew thomas but research shows that it was ten years in the making and i believe that this is a sweeping multi generational story about an irish american family that really does tell the story of the american twentieth century eileen tumulty was born to irish immigrants in queens new york and always dreamed of a better life she marries ed leary a research scientist who strives to provide that but struggles with unexpected challenges their son connell wrestles with his relationship with each parent and strives to find his own place i've been trying to figure out whose story this is but all of the voices are so strong and so true that it really is the story of the family the writing is breathtakingly beautiful i had about 25 pages left last night and couldn't push through so i read those final pages on my morning subway ride i lost track of stations time and jam packed bodies on the train and i found myself crying as i read the final words of this novel it's all here how we live how we love how we die how we carry on","2171":"this review has been hidden because it contains spoilers to view it click here i enjoyed this book but it was very hard for me i don't have any experience with alzheimer's but i strongly related to eileen and her family her irish roots her dream to move out of the city to a house in the 'burbs her love for and loyalty to her husband and son so it was very painful to watch her and ed going through what they did this book made me realize that there are no good ways for a marriage to end even if you both live a long happy life of love one of you is going to bury the i enjoyed this book but it was very hard for me i don't have any experience with alzheimer's but i strongly related to eileen and her family her irish roots her dream to move out of the city to a house in the 'burbs her love for and loyalty to her husband and son so it was very painful to watch her and ed going through what they did this book made me realize that there are no good ways for a marriage to end even if you both live a long happy life of love one of you is going to bury the other and i learned that a long slow demise is as much of a tragedy as a sudden unexpected one i also really appreciated the character of connell he enabled me to read this book not only with the eyes of a mother the role i primarily function in now but as a daughter there were many times i wanted to smack him but then i realized he wasn't a bad person at all just a young one it made me remember all of the things i wish i did differently with or for my deceased mother that i have been carrying around like the broken tooth in connell's wallet it also allowed me to forgive myself a bit because some of the mistakes of youth can't be helped empathy is not necessarily something teenagers and young people have in spades or even adults who haven't had responsibility or suffering enough to mature them into seeing things from someone else's perspective ultimately though this book is an affirmation of marriage and family as horrible as it is to suffer and die from alzheimer's indeed as horrible as many things in life can be at least they can be borne a bit more easily if we have people who truly love and support us more","2172":"seriously i hate this app because my review wasn't saved instead of trying to remember what i wrote i'll say this great writing style mostly disappointing plot development it was disjointed and always felt like it was in third gear back stories that have little to no bearing on its forward movement and stunted character development the author was overly ambitious in trying to create a story that spans a number of decades which is a difficult thing to do if you focus your attention on the wrong points secondary characters introduced and forgotten little closure on major events the story itself is depressing as fuck and will have you fearing genetics and mortality although i'm sure someone who really wants to delve into the giant metaphors could present it in a more positive light i had high expectations for this book because it started off so impressively but it fell flat about a third of the way through and never really recovered","2173":"this was an excellent yet heart breaking read at times eileen made me want to be a better wife and mother and at other times i wanted to punch her in the face but such is how life goes which is exactly what this book is about you can't have the good times without the bad times beautiful writing and an interesting look at society and what we value as important","2174":"this review has been hidden because it contains spoilers to view it click here i'm torn about how to rate this book the characters will stay with me which is one way to determine quality of a book i suppose about halfway through the book when ed started to demonstrate symptoms of alzheimer's before we knew that's what

people must feel in real life when this disease de i'm torn about how to rate this book the characters will stay with me which is one way to determine quality of a book i suppose about halfway through the book when ed started to demonstrate symptoms of alzheimer's before we knew that's what it was the book felt it had taken an incomprehensible turn for the sake of you know literature in retrospect it seems likely that the author intentionally created in reader something similar to what people must feel in real life when this disease descends but he was acting so strange that it just felt implausible that eileen took so long to suspect some physiological explanation and that was off putting but once he was diagnosed the book settled back into a place that worked overall for me the effects of this dread disease were heartbreaking and eileen and her son i thought behaved in very believable and complex and humane and ultimately heroic ways as they dealt with ed's condition the letter ed left for his son that we read near the end was remarkable more","2175":"a lot of this was very close to home for me like the self deprecating jokes all american irish catholic families make about being irish catholic are alive and well here in all their stark guilty non hugging glory and for that reason it's hard for me to write a useful review of this book i can say that it's definitely not for everyone given its length and its pace though i found myself desperately needing to know what happens to this family the book is not particularly plot driven functioning mostly as a look at how these characters who like actual humans have very real flaws grow but if that sort of thing appeals to you and you're in the mood to cry early and often i can't recommend this book enough","2176":"this review has been hidden because it contains spoilers to view it click here after following the main character for 60 years i would expect to feel more kinship with her but i did not the most exciting chapter was the last one where i felt that i was inside the mind of the son who seemed to be beginning to feel the first symptoms of alzheimer's or at least was aware of the possibility that chapter reminded me of all i did not feel by observing the disease through the wife but i made it through all 600 pages and it wasn't bad just not great","2177":"possibly one of the most depressing stories i've read maybe ever the chronicle of a couple's life together as the husband slowly descends into alzheimer's well written well drawn characters yes but there were moments when i simply had to put it down because it was so upsetting maybe you'd want to read it if you were going through something similar yourself but reading it was a confirmation of all our deepest dread","2178":"brilliant writing i can't believe this is thomas' first book it was fantastic he is a very honest writer and his writing portrays the human experience this is one of my favorite books that i've read this year the characters are real and deep and you really get to know them they are full fleshed out human beings living in a real world there is an emotional truth to the writing and it helps all the more because the plot isn't this fantastical plot the plot is centered around normal every day ordinary people and the writing gets to the heart of the characters will read this again","2179":"i enjoyed the character development of this novel the vocabulary and description were well conceived i recommend this book to readers who enjoy getting into their characters in depth","2180":"this book was too long the characters were well developed and their relationships as well however it was hard to really latch onto any character that you related to or actually liked as they were all pretty dysfunctional i listened to the audio version of this book i didn't feel the reader did a very good job of transitioning from character to character would have been better if she had just read the book and not tried to fall into character mode","2181":"what a long slow tedious journey this was this book is a great case for \"less is more \" none of the characters were all that interesting and became less and less interesting as the book droned on and on and on the narrative was often meaningless characters are introduced for no apparent reason and then just dropped never to reappear hints of deceit are made and then forgotten i had had enough by page 450 and finally bailed out due to terminal boredom i really just didn't care any longer for a while i thought \"maybe if this book was just shorter it would be ok \" now that i rethink that i'm pretty sure that assessment does not hold up either","2182":"gorgeous brutal heartbreaking authentic it's been a very long time since i read a book where characters that i didn't really like made me feel so much i'll be thinking about his one for a while","2183":"i really wanted to like this book parts of it were beautifully written however i felt as though it dragged on and on in parts and that the author could not quite make up his mind just what the book was to be about it seemed to go off in different directions before looping back and starting again","2184":"addictivei loved this book because the characters were flawed as real people tend to be instead of perfect as they are in many novels they also experience growth and insight","2185":"this is a character driven story i was pulled slooowly into the story not really a page turner to begin with there is a lot of minutia but that may be what pulled me into the second half of the book where i was immersed in the lives of the characters i felt a connection to them as their strengths and flaws had been so completely laid out the story rang so true to me these are ordinary people living their lives choosing their paths and destinies dealing with unplanned circumstances the best they know how then continuing on one foot in front of the other","2186":" i'm so glad that this book came out after i became a parent because i don't think it would have meant half as much to me if i had read it pre kid thomas is so finely atuned to what it means to be a parent to have your heart exist outside yourself and to achieve a better future for your child even if it means moving heaven and earth i can't even begin to describe the relentless humanity and empathy thomas' characters posses and the dignity with which he treats them eileen at first reminded me very much of scarlett o'hara her drive her loyalty and her ferocity and those remain with her throughout her life but she allows herself to be molded and changed by her circumstances in ways that leave her a better woman though it takes her most of her life to realize this these characters and their lives will stay with me for a long time and i can't wait to start recommending this book to everyone when it comes out","2187":"i'm on the fence had a good story line but i did not like the character development enough always felt like something was missing i did finish it and i'm glad i did i like where it went however it took too long","2188":"ultimately disappointing characters and plot points were introduced and nurtured and then forgotten the young and middle aged eileen could've been distinct characters as there were no unifying ties across the years to convince me they were the same character the financial aspects of caring for someone with a severe chronic and progressive disease also rang hollow","2189":"i rec'd this pre release edition as a bonus with another book i ordered finally picked it up and i was very pleasantly surprised it's not a warm fuzzy story but it's nothing along the lines of angela's ashes either a striking story of a regular family striving to do well trying to live up to their own expectations and doing their best to face some serious obstacles","2190":"there were moments when this book was intense gripping and really made you believe in what was going on in the lives of the characters the personal struggles of this family were amazing to read when we finally got to the issue but then there were so many other parts that just held pieces together and seemed to drag this resulted in characters that were not very likable for the most part i had high hopes for this book but it didn't meet my expectations","2191":"a hard one to rate i loved a lot of it but didn't like most of the characters definitely worth the read but at times it drags on","2192":"very long read i didn't love or even like the characters and i felt like i was getting pulled into a pit of quicksand i seldom put a book down three quarters of the way through but life is too short to spend reading something you're not connecting with it is well written but it progressed too slow for my taste","2193":" we are not ourselves is not the book for everyone it is a very detailed look into a families lives we start with eileen growing up in an irish immigrant family and offering a child's perspectives of the struggles her parents face eileen grows up gets married and has a son we continue to see the world through her perspective but then her son's point of view is worked in as well the relationships between family members are examined as well as their struggles with the outside world the book is well written and for the type of person who likes a novel really focusing on characters and a detailed look at their thoughts dreams and lives you should enjoy that book if you are looking for some action you won't enjoy it quite so much there is a lot of book here and while there are some true ordeals the family goes through there is a lot of book here as a whole i found it an ok read i didn't actively dislike it but at the same time i was never really engrossed","2194":"i finished reading this remarkable book a few weeks ago i went back and forth to it skimming pages rereading highlighted sentences and notes i had wrote in the margins weeks have passed and it continues to linger in my mind matthew thomas created an american masterpiece with we are not ourselves the characters are profound they run deep and they will burrow themselves into your mind and attach themselves to your literary heartbeat the names \"big mike\" \"eileen\" u0026amp \"ed\" and \"connell\" will remain permanent fixtures in your heart it is one of the most brilliant pieces of american genius to come out in a long time congratulations matthew thomas you have carved your name amongst the greats with we are not ourselves the book spans three generations of an irish american family when we meet eileen she is but a young girl however she is already captivating she lives with her parents and a roommate that rents a room from them eileen's father \"big mike\" is a prolific character he is built with character a man of his word and of the drink still a man that never sways from his commitments a man's man these qualities make big mike a character that is unforgettable as you read further it is easy to see the moral resemblance of big mike in eileen eileen's mother battles alcoholism and the relationship between her parents fluctuate eillen's biggest dream is marry well and get out from under her parents she is a lonely soul that desires to just be loved when she asks her detoxing mother why she does not say she loves her or embrace her her mother swats her off and says she's too old for that and doesn't need it yet it is the one thing eileen longs for love while at college studying nursing eileen meets a brilliant scientist named ed and they fall in love ed o ed when you read this book read closely the parts that involve him he is much more than thomas leads the reader to believe only at the end of the book did i recall moments that stood out making ed a giant in the book there is an image that really stood out to me as ed being such a towering figure not as just a character in a book but as a human he spent mounds of time doing research on lab rats and the lab burns down taking all his research with it including the rats he's grown so fond of he is devastated at the news at home ed is laid out on the floor in dismay eileen does her best to comfort him and he remains still and motionless covered in defeat on the floor as a reader i just thought the book would change and ed would not get up he would not continue more effort into his research or that something profound would happen the next morning ed is back at it again rising early preparing his new lab and that is ed in a nutshell a determined unmovable a giant ed and eileen have a son named connell and life is centered on the boy a series of events happen and eileen the daughter of \"big mike\" holds on for dear life swaying with the ever changing currents of the tumultuous tides she is a strong woman just as her parents raised her this is what is so great about the book it is life it is life in america as everything changes around you as your husband ages as your son grows as you bury your parents get promoted lose your job buy a new home lose friends love and are loved we are not ourselves is a book about life and the beauty that happens every day one of the greatest ideas of the book which rings so true in life is that often as a parent all our lessons and living as an example seems to at times not be taken in by our children yet in the end every little thing we say our actions our values how we treat one another all holds an impression on them and they will indeed become what we have taught them connell is no different i found this encouraging writer matthew thomas gave readers a book of truth on parenting it is a mirror and we see when looking closely that it all comes full circle unfortunately ed did not live to see it but all his teaching and rearing of a young connell blossomed in time ed would have been so proud thomas is an amazing writer each character is developed so well i felt a connection to each one but eileen wow eileen she will become one of the great women in american literature an \"every woman\" that lives and gives so much for her family a woman that takes the marriage vows for better or worse to heart she is the ultimate i could sing the praise of this book forever it is the best book i have read all year the best i give we are not ourselves five stars it is perfection it is a must read it is necessary buy it read it reread it place it on your top shelf it is worthy of collection a wonderful read brilliant in entirety i received this copy from netgalley and simon u0026amp schuster for my honest review thank you netgalley thank you simon u0026amp schuster","2195":"a lot of people spoke very highly of this book and although it was good it just never got off the ground for me i think this book was at least 100 pages too long and several things could have been deleted to make this book more manageable the writing on this book was very good but the story was too long to warrant more than 4 stars","2196":"although the talent of the author is clear for me the end product was a disappointment a listing of events characteristics and conditions all predictable with no insight relevance or conclusions","2197":"seemed like the whole story was told in the first few chapters of the book and the remaining three quarters of the book was how selfish someone can be when they want to seem successful there were certain points that were good but overall the book was irritating to read","2198":"clear prose big yawn make somebody feel good for reading a big book and the kid is a total walt jr","2199":"the more i've reflected on this book i've revised my rating to a 5 this is a very sad and devastating story but in the end there is hope acceptance and reconciliation because i'm dealing with this illness with a family member i would never have read we are not ourselves if i had known the subject matter but once i started reading it i was pulled in and couldn't put it down this book will stay with me for a very long time","2200":"too long and slow in places","2201":" i am rating this book as it was amazing because liking it had little to do with how i felt about it nor does so mild a term do it justice or seem appropriate there were times i hated this book and actually thought to put it down near the end which is where it culminated in ripping my emotions apart limb by limb so the writing was amazing the story was heartbreaking it is a difficult book at best to get through if you have witnessed a loved one and their family struggle with alzheimer's or parkinson's i caution you be gentle on yourself this book is powerful","2202":"this is a 4 1 2 star book for me the author this is his first book is just phenomenal his characters feel so real and although the main theme was depressing i still had to keep reading i was somewhat disappointed with the epilogue but that is often the case for me i highly recommend this book if you are not put off by a sad theme","2203":"sad but authentic having lived in a similar household i knew the clues","2204":"a more complete character development than i have ever seen you love them hate them get disappointed in them cheer with them everyone grows the writing is amazing on top of that a truly necessary story about love life and making the most of both","2205":"this book was not what i was expecting i really challenged my thought process and how i view the world it also made me strengthen my view and reaffirm my believes that i am a strong woman however if i was in her shoes maybe i would make the same choices","2206":"this is a story that waxed and waned for me sometimes it was just too ordinary and at other times it was so very moving illness always for families especially with young families can be so devastating but illnesses that are usually saved for the elderly have few role models for these younger families","2207":"powerful story focused on a man suffering from early onset alzheimers rivals still alice","2208":"an interesting portrayal of family relationships and reactions to illness and adversity thought provoking","2209":"written by matthew thomaswas gracefully provided by abc matthew thomas debut novelist gives the coming of age novel a completely different perspective and i might even go as far as callingwe are not ourselvesthe coming of age novel the book is an epic journey through the life of a woman trying to succeed in life chronicling her years lived between 1951 and 2011 yes this does mean this review was written for american book center's you review the advanced reading copy of we are not ourselves written by matthew thomas was gracefully provided by abc matthew thomas debut novelist gives the coming of age novel a completely different perspective and i might even go as far as calling we are not ourselves the coming of age novel the book is an epic journey through the life of a woman trying to succeed in life chronicling her years lived between 1951 and 2011 yes this does mean it's a rather long book but definitely a book worth reading if you're up for it from being a daughter eileen tumulty turns in to a wife and a mother as a daughter of irish immigrants eileen is trying to create her own american dream she decides to marry a mad scientist who is nothing like her father and plans to have a better life than her parents did for herself as well as her child when her son finds his way into adulthood something life changing happens that turns eileen's life - and the plans she made - upside down this book really has it all everything that life has to offer or - actually - doesn't have to offer personally i found the book book a bit too long but in a strange way i couldn't put it down either you really start to know and love the characters in the book and after a while it gets hard to leave them the book is really precise and gives you a realistic look into the life of a woman dreaming her american dream it's about real life and real problems that come along and mess up your dream life written by charlotte de heerwould you like to write a review for the bored to death book club blog just send us an e mail at boredtodeathbookclub@gmail com","2210":"very sad but moving book","2211":"this book frustrated me at times and i almost gave up i thought it was much too long and didn't always keep my interest however it won me over at the end","2212":" this is the first book i've ever won from a publisher in exchange for a review of course and boy did i get lucky we are not ourselves is absolutely spectacular i cried big time through the last few chapters and that's usually not my style so you know matthew thomas knows how to pull on the heartstrings this book is such an excellent character study the leary family is just so well developed it's like you know them like they live just down the block the author so clearly captures the complicated nuances of family life and relationships the frustration that surfaces when life and the lives of those around you don't go according to plan the hatred that often bubbles under the surface of your relationship with those you love most and the regret you feel looking back on the time you lost when you let the inevitable negative aspects of life get the better of you at times it felt like the author was peering into my own soul i know this all sounds very dramatic but it's been a very long time since a book touched me like this one has absolutely deserving of a 5 star rating","2213":" this book was sent to me for free as a goodreads giveaway in exchange for an honest review from the way beginning this book seemed to have as its main goal to be depressing i am all for deep complicated storylines but the author's scope here was just too broad and found no room for any semblance of joy or positive outlook that i was most desperately wanting by halfway through the book the characters were developed interestingly enough to keep me reading the book but there were too many ancillary storylines weird friendship with realtor changing neighborhoods a cultish women's group strange relationships with caretakers etc that made the book way too long and not fulfilling i enjoyed the author's choice and flow of words but this book definitely suffered from an incomplete editing process so much could have been whittled away to streamline this book into a more manageable and possibly more enjoyable read","2214":"to say i read this book is a bit misleading i got through about half of it and gave it because i was so frustrated with the narcissism and pettiness of the characters that i was thinking of slitting my wrists","2215":" we are not ourselves by matthew thomas trails the life of eileen the daughter of irish immigrants living in new york city from her childhood through the epilogue which is told from her son connell's point of view unlike many immigrant stories with heroic survivors who flee the potato famine or who labor in the woolen mills these protagonists inhabit the second half of the twentieth century here the themes are declining neighborhoods professional angst and a beloved son with baseball promise leaving the nest it was a book that i literally skimmed too many details for me but was still able to relate to emotionally the elephant in the room no spoiler here is the major character throughout the second half of the book and eileen morphed in my eyes from a young narcissist to a caring woman who gained my empathy and eventually my admiration six hundred some pages seemed excessive but a lifetime is a long time perhaps eileen is everywoman conceivably even ourself","2216":"the book had good story ideas but the characters were one dimensional the author had too many unnecessary details which made reading it laborious and slow","2217":"a powerful memorable book i highly recommend it","2218":"i find myself judging this book a bit harshly the subject matter is deeply moving but the writer's style and pacing didn't hit the nail on the head for me for me thomas's spare style was pleasurable to read but did not always pair well with the subject matter it seemed more journalistic than i would have personally preferred much of the book seemed to hover a few feet above true feeling just reporting action and not internal thoughts i was definitely moved but felt at times as if he was sidestepping the emotion i read this not knowing its' subject so the slow reveal was very effective thomas is good at conveying a slow build of uncertainty and unease one could also argue that by leaving some things unwritten it allows the reader to reflect back on earlier reading with the advantage of hindsight as i was near finishing the book i found out that thomas had a parent with early onset dementia it is likely that as painful as his own personal experience was with his subject he struggled with how to meet it don't get me wrong this book brought me to tears several times but took a long time to hit its stride the last fifth of this book had the depth i was looking for i didn't need the full weight the whole way through but he just took too long to get there for me even so i won't forget it and wonder if the frustration i felt was by the author's design","2219":"loved this story such real characters","2220":"this is a novel about alzheimer's that outdoes even the corrections i'll confess to having cried a couple of times there's an expression no tears in the writer no tears in the reader i sensed a lot of tears in the writer and certainly the intense engagement with the legal financial and family complications from a disease like this is unlike anything i've read before my only complaint is that despite the novel's comfortable even baggy size i was frequently learning things about ed and eileen that seemed out of character from the pages that came before somehow i couldn't imagine this couple taking european vacations or going out in black tie and gown every new year's eve but details like this come out of nowhere late in the book there's also a literary preciousness that seemed a little false and i never bought for a moment that eileen would name her son after an evan connell novel these small faults however barely detract from a novel that so beautiful limns our country and our lives and presents one of the best and kindest fathers in american fiction","2221":"wonderful but i would've given it 5 stars if it were a bit shorter much too long","2222":"oh god i wanted to love this book but for all its poignancy family drama etc i found myself wanting to read the book of the sub characters sergei the family who bought their house the new jackson heights families way more than boring eileen","2223":"i wish someone had stated in a review that the topic of alzheimer's is part of this story i thought i was finished with that subject many books ago the book overall tells a tedious tale and the characters are not likeable at all the only saving grace is that my irish family also knew someone named kehoe guess it was a more common name than i thought","2224":"skimmed more than read now wish i'd actually read might come back to it one day good writing and a sad story","2225":"thank you net galley and simon and schuster for the opportunity to read this book i received an e galley in exchange for an honest review tuesday this one was a rather long one and took me several days to get through it i will finish my review after i have contemplated my thoughts on this novel thursday i found myself not really liking some of the characters in this book however after reading further i did become more involved with them and truly ended up liking the story it is really long but i feel as though it wasn't overly so the story just took that long to tell and to help you get a real feel for the characters","2226":"parts of this book are very hard to take such dysfunctional characters in a family that cannot communicate if you love dysfunctional families you will love this book","2227":"this is a character book more than a plot book and it rambles a lot yay for me it was going to get a 3 until a beautiful scene near the end that bumped it to a 4 i loved this line too empathy he hadn't always had it it was a muscle you had to develop and then keep conditioned sometimes he thought his real goal wasn't to teach them to write better essays but to get them to think more about what it meant to be human amen","2228":"this is really a solid 3 5","2229":"i finished this book last night and felt like i had to take some time to really think how i would rate it it is a hugely long book which has not got a story as such instead a beautifully told life and lives of others i cried my eyes out at the end it was very moving and very real would recommend but you will need to try and get it into it at the start","2230":"this was a wonderful book extremely well written bit i feel i should warn future readers that it's not an easy book to read it deals with some tough subjects especially for those of us starting to deal with older patents or for those who deal every day with sick family members regardless i loved his story because it reads true to me the characters are not perfect they are flawed just like in real lifebelieve or not this is a debut for mr thomas his first novel is a winner in my opinion oh and one more thing the novel takes place in new york places you ay recognize","2231":"the book deals with real problems in a real world some parts are a little sad but in the ends pays you back","2232":"devastating and beautiful at the same time a truly honest book so much so that it could be gut wrenching at times","2233":"i have to stop reading books solely because they are on a best seller list this one started out as biography of a young irish girl of immigrant parents but the author's writing it cool and detached i then felt betrayed because the spoiler is that its about alzheimer's it went on and on and on with too many episodes of the wife not realizing what was happening to her husband and i didn't find the son a sympathetic character at all i finished it out of obligation but couldn't wait for it to be over","2234":"i know the year just started but i think this might already be one of the best novels i read in 2016 family drama with a whole range of emotions from pride to remorse to grief a masterpiece","2235":" sometimes i'll get a few pages into a book and i suddenly feel like a cat that has found its perfect spot i realize that i am in the hands of a master that i am about to read a book without tricks or gimmicks just structure character development and brilliant writing a couple of pages into we are not ourselves and i thought i hope this book never ends the story of eileen tumulty begins in 1951 in queens eileen is 9 and the book traces her life over the next half century or so she is not always likable eileen is judgmental racist eternally dissatisfied but in part because we see her grow up she is someone the reader always understands and feels for the less known about the plot the better i read michiko kakutani's review in the new york times and she discussed a major plot development which happens on page 300 and something seriously i usually hate long books this one is 620 pages and i could have kept on reading easily it has great american novel written all over it","2236":" i'm not sure how to classify this book it is not uplifting - but is strengthening in its own way eileen tumultry born in 1941 was raised in the values of the times - take care of family think of others before self control your emotions don't expect big things etc you were considered good if you kept your nose to the grindstone and women were expected to give way to and take care of the men... especially their husbands she takes care of her parents marries a good man with good prospects educated - on a road to good job in education ... but he settles for a teaching position where he can do research rather than go into administration she does hold out for a dream house it would be one if it weren't run down and needing major improvements her son tries to help but is \"sheltered\" and becomes selfish ... changes in her husband create problems and eventually it turns out that he has alzheimers the story really shows some of the problems of taking care of a person with alzheimers how she copes with all this is a moving story","2237":"while the book seemed too long i kept reading anyway and it got better and better the characters seemed very realistic with both their faults and their strengths it was with finishing because the characters grew and changed in a wonderful way","2238":"not a book for people who want action this book is not plot driven it is character driven the characters of this book were so well written they seem like real people we might meet they developed as life happened to them just as real people do the writing was beautiful and memorable i enjoyed the author's reading at the wisconsin book festival it was a pleasure to meet him and to learn more about his life and process hoping it won't take him as long to write his next book","2239":" i was so looking forward to reading this and was quite disappointed it is better than many many books but falls short of its aspirations a flat tone is used to tell the life story of eileen tumulty as she strives to better her place in life the author is quite hostile to her striving which strikes me as quite odd perhaps he has grown up in a more affluent place and time equally oddly he completely dismisses in one sentence eileen's use of birth control like the main character i was born in 1952 into a catholic family premarital sex and the use of birth control were sources of great angst and literally soul searching mr thomas is clueless about that also could a nurse really not see her husband's symptoms for so many years all that said it's a very good book to discuss","2240":" it took matthew thomas over 10 years to finish this book his first but it ended up being in a bidding war in which he came out with a million dollars someone has also bought the movie rights that gives you an idea how good it is we are not ourselves is a wonderful book peopled with characters who are so real they could be your own family your friends your neighbors the best thing for me in a book is characterization i love imperfect characters who are real you don't always like them but you understand and empathize with them this book has that in abundance while the book is multi generational the real protagonist is eileen leary it's not often that you find a male writer who does women this well he presents her frustrations with her husband in particular without making her come off as a demanding shrew her dreams of upward mobility for her family against her husband's desires for a more circumspect life are also given fair treatment thomas says he was greatly inspired by the great gatsby and you can see the american dream theme throughout i can't recommend this book highly enough it's great i'd say i can't wait for the movie but i'll probably be disappointed by it","2241":" we are not ourselves is the story of eileen and ed broken down into different parts of their life as they progressed the author begins with eileen and her life before ed here is where we as readers can get a grasp on those things from life that influenced and changed eileen into the woman she had become then ed enters her life and even though he is obsessed with his work him and eileen seem to lead an ordinary married life they even manage to find the time to have a child but eileen has there son and her job to keep her occupied but there is a whole left there by the long absences of ed ed had ambition when it came to his research but didn't worry to much about money or how the other half lived but eileen wanted more she wanted to live in a house instead of an apartment she wanted nice things she just didn't know how to convey this want to ed and they constantly fought about it especially when eileen decided it was time for them to move out of the apartment and into a house eileen picked out the house without ed and ed went along with it in the end because he loves eileen the house was nice but now needs a lot of work done to it to make it beautiful once more but eileen knows between her and ed's salaries that they would be able to make it work they always had here is where the bottom drops out ed has been forgetting things getting frustrated easily over the simplest things that he can no longer figure out he begins to get very angry and soon finds himself dealing with an alzheimer's diagnosis the job of a professor and researcher is full of skills and knowledge that ed once had but can no longer find within his mind so the university decides that ed can no longer work there and eileen is left to care for ed and work just so they can hang on to the roof over their heads and to put food in their stomachs overwhelmed and overworked eileen has tried everything to take care of ed but she comes to realize that that hope is no longer possible consumed by guilt of placing ed in a nursing home and the sadness of watching him rapidly decline eileen visited rigorously in order to make up for it but she knew deep down that her ed was slowly and painfully disappearing before her eyes we are not ourselves shows us that life is not only fragile but sometimes just down right cruel from the start to the finish it follows ed and eileen's story until the very end courage love anger frustration and every other emotion is thoroughly explored and felt in this book it also shows the harsh and unfair descent of alzheimers and how it effects not just the sufferer but also the family members involved i cried when ed dies and even cursed at my nook for that is what i was reading it on but i am truly honored to have read this story even though it is fiction ed and eileen felt so real to me that even as i write this it is hard for me to find the words to talk about them as just characters in this book for they felt that real if you get the chance to sit down to read a book soon make sure the book you are picking up is we are not ourselves","2242":" what an interesting read i went from bored to moved to confused i never really did grasp what pushed eileen i 'know' it was her father's model but i didn't get that link very well in the words of the novel surprised at the alzheimer's presences although it served an excellent tool here in thinking back through the book i was surprised to see how much i felt for ed and how little for eileen although i'm pretty sure i was supposed to feel both her pain and a sadness and sympathy for how she pulled so hard to keep her dreams that's interesting to me too since i could relate so well to that characteristic i was a bit disappointed that the wonderful descriptive writing of the first chapters of the book fell into another format in the middle but i must admit i was completely satisfied at the end ing whew and ahh","2243":"this book started strong but it really started to drag","2244":"i read recently that it took matthew thomas 10 years to write this novel after finishing the last page with that in mind i am reeling from just how emotionally brilliant mr thomas is he has written a family saga that follows eileen tumulty daughter of irish immigrants through 6 decades of life this story is about so much the american dream following wwii what it means to find that dream and then not have the dream anymore the slow unraveling of self marriage love alzheimer's sigh my favorite parts are eileen's inner dialogue and thoughts she is frustratingly real and i found myself trying to make this story her reasoning more complicated than it was i searched for reasons for everything that happened and tried to understand any point that mr thomas might be trying to make it took awhile but finally around the last third of the book i realized that i was just a witness to something that had no agenda it took patience and mindfulness to stay with this story and the characters it was worth every minute","2245":" this book gets a couple of stars because i got through it i was disappointed with this book on so many levels the writing was pedantic and dull the characters were flat and the story was filled with stuff that didn't seem to matter in the author's notes at the end he talks about researching minute details of events and places as they existed in the novel's time frame he described mets games in impeccable detail no doubt exactly as they actually took place gave very precise geographical bearings and i bet i now know exactly what businesses existed on the main drags in jackson heights and in bronxville but i couldn't tell you what any of the three main characters looked like except in vague terms if only he'd put that degree of energy into more richly developed characters stuff happens to these characters without giving anything away the big thing that happens was first hinted at long before it is revealed and i immediately knew what it was going to be which made it very annoying that it took the characters so long to find out lots of other little stuff happens to these characters more stuff happens to them than by them there are some build ups to climactic events that just fizzle out and seem to be of no real significance in the end now that i think of it the two stars seem generous","2246":"great book very sensitive and yet not a book you yell at and then cry","2247":"this book resonated with me on a personal level as the grandchild of immigrants reading the leary's story reminded me in so many ways of the struggles hopes and dreams that people have when moving to a new country this book is a raw representation of the value of family and the sacrifices parents make for their children it inspires humility in that it makes you question what is important in life and the responsibility we have to one another i highly recommend it","2248":"i am mad at the people who told me to keep reading this when i wanted to quit it went from boring to bleak and the end that i thought might never come was not worth it i can't 1 star it because the prose itself is sort of lovely impressive writing for a debut but holy wow does it make me feel a lot of ugggghhhhh","2249":"no argument that the prose in we are not ourselves is beautifully crafted however because i didn't find many redeeming qualities in any of the characters i had a hard time getting through its considerable slow paced length it's a difficult book on many levels one i don't like the protagonist she strikes me as shallow selfish and not good at managing her own life she makes these inexplicably bad decisions especially financial decisions with few consequences and with no regard for those she's supposed to love the scope of the story is not epic or dramatic it's about a standard middle class american life there's the usual amount of struggle family work and added on early onset alzheimer's which is horribly painful but seems to be considered by the main character as yet another obstacle to her ambition of an enviable position in life she protests a few times that she loves her ill husband but nothing about the prose makes me believe it she doesn't actually seem capable of or even interested in love at its heart this book is about upward mobility and largely about spending a life focused on material desires and outward validation it's about someone who may or may not have had potential making her way through life in a fairly conventional way without succeeding or failing at anything to any great extent and being dissatisfied with her situation for most of it that's the stuff of a lot of mid to upper class daily life for me it's not the stuff of great storytelling","2250":" about 1 2 way through i thought the book was too slow i also was pretty sure i knew what was coming i was right and i wish i had been wrong a beautiful touching painful loving sad story of a professor with early onset alzheimers his wife and son at first i was not impressed by the character of the wife but she became a strong dedicated persevering woman at first i thought the son was lazy and selfish he also surprised me as i read this book it was even more difficult because my mom has dementia and my sis and i just recently had to put her in a home it was the hardest thing we've ever had to do this is a heart breaking disease as i read this story i could not help but think of the cost of this disease emotional is obvious the home at $6 8 000 month medicare does not cover it the cost of lost work hours in this case an intelligent professor other times a caregiver giving up work to care for patient why isn't the pharma industry looking for a cure down the road this disease will bankrupt america and we know it's coming","2251":"i really like this book it was long but i read it quickly as the writing was so easy to stay connected to maybe its not universally appealing but i have to say its one of the better books that i have read lately","2252":"excellent book about how we envision our lives unfolding but decisions of other people involved change the path the strength and weaknesses of all characters in your life affect the results","2253":"i went back and forth between 3 4 stars i enjoyed the book but didn't love it it's a lovely story about different characters who live very relatable lives and without any developed plot but 600 pages of that seemed a bit much several characters seemed belabored at times when the same might have been accomplished in about ~400 pages and yet i wanted to keep reading about these folks","2254":"aggressively mediocre the writing was somehow as lifeless as the story and when he attempts humor he falls flat characters were wooden and the whole thing was twice as long as it should have been","2255":"disclaimer i grew up in queens ny at about the time period of the book couldn't get into the story the characters or the setting as i read the first part of the book i was hoping for some lively dialogue dilemma or something to get the story going when it didn't happen for me i decided not to slog through the remainder of the book tossed it aside and found something else to read this book may be of interest if you are of irish american descent otherwise it is ok to skip it","2256":"there was some lovely writing in here but it was just buried under so many words the book was way way too long there were some gorgeous lines but i ended up skimming the back third of the book because it was neverending i think even though it felt interminable and not enjoyable at points i will be thinking about ed and eileen and connell for quite some time so there's something to be said for that","2257":"the first half of this book is rather boring the characters aren't very likable and there's so much doom and gloom the second half doesn't get any happier and actually it's depressing as hell but the characters are a little less flat and more human but overall this is not a happy feel good book and it took me a lot longer to finish it than a book this size normally would","2258":"i am one picky ass reader and i wasn't even going to try a sample on kindle because it was around $3 so how good could it be but i tried it fell in love with the story the characters the words do not miss this book you will learn about and examen your heart sweetly tenderly playfully and painfully a must read","2259":"i had hi hopes for this novel however it ended up being a bit of a slog i genuinely didn't like eileen and f was already thought the book was coming to an end at about 20% there was a good chance i wasn't going to finish but i never quite gave up and i was awarded on occasion but truthfully i am glad it's over","2260":"it did take me a while to get into this book but then i couldn't stop reading about eileen and ed i loved her single mindedness and how hard she worked to keep the family together through ed's illness it was very difficult to read but i am glad that i did","2261":"this was probably the most depressing book i've ever read","2262":" this book is an epic that i found to be disjointed the protagonist is eileen a girl brought up in a poor irish catholic home in new york she dreams of getting out of her neighbourhood and making a better life for herself the first part of the book that delved into her childhood and adolescence i enjoyed eileen marries a young and handsome scientist who she assumes will move up the social ladder and help to fulfill her dreams but ed wants to remain in the neighbourhood and turns down promotions in order to continue to be a teacher at a community college eileen is a racist and fears for her safety as foreigners move to her street she is a senior nurse who works full time so she and ed are not poor she is however dissatisfied at this point eileen becomes a less than likable character and is bordering on bitter she is very closed about her emotions and now is cold there is a son who she adores until he is about three when he becomes closer to his father ed ed has early on set alzheimer's disease and eileen is so closed with her feelings and so inward she is almost angry with him and not very sympathetic i started disliking her immensely she is constantly worried about how she her husband her son her home everything will appear to the outside world i have not yet finished this book i will certainly finish it in order to see how it turns out but i have to honestly say that i find it tedious and i am unsympathetic to the characters except poor old ed who at the point in the book i have reached is just a dribbling man sitting on the couch watching television that may or may not be turned on","2263":"beautifully written reminds me of a tree grows in brooklyn","2264":"wonderful characters i only held one star back because i thought the first half of the book dragged along at a slower pace the second half didn't disappoint very heart wrenching and painful to read but also touching","2265":"no plot twists no split time narratives no gimmicks just good old fashioned writing and character development this is a character driven story in the vein of the corrections or the interestings the characters are not always likeable but they are relatable in their honest portrayals wonderful writing and a great debut novel","2266":"this book suffers mightily for lack of shaping and editing what could have been profound and powerful was diluted to tiresome and melodramatic","2267":"although there were moments when this book seemed so long and not going in a direction that was expected overall i liked the book i thought it gave a true sense of what it must have been like to grow up in a household with alcoholic gambling parents and then we get to see the result of that upbringing as the main character becomes an adult and parent herself i also enjoyed reading names of banks streets stores that i remembered from my childhood","2268":"the story of a family from 1951 present day how the american culture has changed in that time and how easy it is to have your life completely uprooted if you like character heavy books that are more a study on society or culture and less on plot pick this up","2269":"this book is 620 pages long if this book was 310 pages long there wouldn't have been a difference at all one of the most boring books i've ever read i found myself skipping pages just so i could get through the book i spent nine pounds on it feels like the writer is trying to justify writing this really long book by writing more to make it all seems worth it by the way it's not also i'm really bothered by the fact that literally half of the book is focused on his alzheimer's yet it was not mentioned in the blurb or anywhere i did not sign up to read a book about alzheimer's i feel like i accidently read a different book when i read the blurb absolute waste of time i've never disliked a book so much","2270":"read more than 300 pages and decided i just didn't care about any of the story or it's characters so stopped the writing is good but the story just did nothing for me","2271":"this is a must read i could not put this book down the way it deals with family issues and alzheimer's is spellboundingly incredible this is his debut novel i will be looking for more matthew thomas i will carry this one with me","2272":"i read a bit more than 100 pages with 500 more to read i felt i had to stop i simply could not get caught up in the story i sometimes think i am too fussy about reading but if i can't get lost in a book then i want to move on there are so many books so little time such a worn out phrase but it's true eileen tumulty irish descent in new york city narrates the tale of her life as she moves from girlhood to wife some reviewers like the mundane details of daily life because it reflects our lives day to day but there is so much of this that it's boring","2273":"such a surprise highly recommend","2274":"this was a good read it's definitely a character study not a plot driven book","2275":"at first i found it difficult to continue but soon the story got me involved a heavy story it reminded me a bit of williams' stoner quite depressing acutally but after 620 pages i made up my mind that this is a great book","2276":"i really loved this book and a part from that i loved the experience of reading it it's described as sprawling family epic so you should know from the start you're about to spend a decent amount of time with this family if you don't dig character driven plots don't dig into this book the narrative focuses on the life of eileen leary nee tumulty as she grows up in queens the daughter of first generation irish american immigrants her mother is distant depressed and an alcoholic and her father while tough is as supportive as he knows how and somewhat larger than life in the local irish community eileen like many dreams of getting out of her hometown and achieving the things her parents didn't in an effort to live what she believes will ultimately be a better life eileen meets ed leary a scientist who is unlike the men she's dated in the past he's brilliant and kind and she imagines him taking her into a higher wealthier social sphere they marry and eileen is painfully slow on the uptake that ed is resistant to that higher wealthier world he prefers intimate conversations to big parties he prefers to teach at a community college instead of nyu ostensibly because the community college kids are more deserving of his ivy league education he's happy with the first house they own because it works while eileen is always trying to improve her situation if only on a superficial level as the years go on ed has what the primary review refers to as a psychological shift that readers will pick up on way before eileen it's frustrating to watch them both as well as their son connell come to terms if they ever truly do with their evolving circumstances and how it will affect their future it's so captivating at this point because as a reader you are engrained with eileen the book is mostly told from her perspective and while she may not be overwhelmingly likable she does seem the most real character i've read in years i and likely other readers kept waiting for eileen to make the decision i wanted her to make versus the decisions she does in that way thomas does an incredible job of keep eileen true to who she is who these years of marriage these years of wars and jobs and houses and extended families these years of life have made her her depiction feels honest and as the description reads life is more than a tally of victories and defeats i felt like that line is apt for this book and for eileen sadly something she and maybe others realize too late in the game chad harbach is blurbed on the back which is ironic because this is the first book since his art of fielding in 2012 that covered a similar amount of time and where i felt so engaged with the characters just a phenomenal book that i was sad to finish","2277":"highly recommend thomas is so good that eileen becomes so real you want to shake her at times you want to just wallow in a book this one will let you do that","2278":"damn an epic debut novel details the life of eileen leary from her childhood living with her parents and a boarder to her marriage and life with her family eileen dreams of marrying a man who will be able to provide all the things she couldn't have as a child their own house her father threatens to haunt them from his grave if they don't have one more luxuries a more prestigious position than her father held etc eileen thinks she has met the perfect man who will provide that in ed they marry and soon eileen finds that ed is not the climber she thought he might be they eventually have a later in life child and the rest of the book follows their family life together including the death of a main character whose slow decline is hinted at and takes up much of the narrative for most of the book it's a novel that really inches along in some ways as it's recalling the life or most of the life of a character so there's no conflict not really to resolve originally i thought the book took place earlier as in the 1970's but it's actually the story of a baby boomer and follows that generation for all its joys and sorrows and changes much if not all is relevant to the present day it is the story of a woman the story of a family of a marriage and some of the surrounding characters while just about all the main characters need to be slapped upside the head here or there throughout the book thomas does an excellent job in keeping the reader interested he easily flows between the three main people of this story relating how all of their concerns are ones that are the same for many today even though main character eileen can be rather unlikeable with occasional racist and xenophobic thoughts perhaps questionable judgment with a character who may or not be able to consent eileen thinks about whether he knows what he's doing etc the reader still can't help but wonder to what she'll have to do next to help her husband cope there is much that is quite relevant for discussion and may be painful for those who are in similar situations like the leary family issues like long term medical care how to afford college tuition the uncertainty of the economy dealing with change that comes via immigration and general societal changes what it's like being faced with a parent who is clearly on the decline when normally the parent would be in middle age and perhaps preparing for retirement thomas does not flinch away from these issues although he does not belabor them either an excellent and long read perfect for a long flight or wait time but be warned it is definitely not a very happy book the decline of one of the characters is laid out in great detail and has further consequences for another right through to the very end of the book it's thomas' first novel and i look forward to his next work","2279":" this was at times a difficult book to read i found myself cringing at the benign insensitivity of characters toward one another yet the characters were good people real people people who cared deeply about one another this is a beautifully written family drama spanning 1950s to present the family deals with ordinary difficulties that transform into extraordinary difficulties if you start you must finish the epilogue provides a retrospective that offers emotional deliverance a reminder to live in the joyful moments of lives shared lovely soulful book well worth the read","2280":"there were times that i was really frustrated with the characters in this story and also found it slow and tedious to read but i couldn't stop the progress of the family relationships and how they dealt with life's changes was captivating and kept me intrigued it's a big book and probably could have been shortened","2281":"this review has been hidden because it contains spoilers to view it click here mr thomas captured the zeitgeist of 1950s queens new york and its changes through the decades with sensitivity dark humor and alarming authenticity in we are not ourselves which is what initially drew me to this novel that was clearly the most enjoyable aspect of this read however his detached manner of scrutinizing the lives of the leary family seemed more like a series of depressing vignettes that merely bespoke of tragedy from the get go the hard working intelligent and dedicated mr thomas captured the zeitgeist of 1950s queens new york and its changes through the decades with sensitivity dark humor and alarming authenticity in we are not ourselves which is what initially drew me to this novel that was clearly the most enjoyable aspect of this read however his detached manner of scrutinizing the lives of the leary family seemed more like a series of depressing vignettes that merely bespoke of tragedy from the get go the hard working intelligent and dedicated eileen and ed never seem to catch a break in over 600 pages as ed suffers from early onset alzheimer's for all their suffering and sacrifice they are rewarded with a wretch of a son connell who does not merit the author's largesse at the end moreover the realistic financial burden that eileen faces as ed's medical needs spiral out of control seem to magically disappear after his death for those interested in the disease i found still alice a much better treatment of the subject it coincidentally also dealt with a science oriented college professor grappling with this challenge but allowed me to feel a sense of sympathy towards the main characters more","2282":" 3 1 2 stars is more like it it surely is a long book but a family novel should be it surely is slow plodding sometimes but that's how middle class lives we are not ourselves' most endearing characteristic is its lack of artifice no literary tricks no manhattan attitude it is a queens to westchester novel pure and simple post modernism is across the east river no village radicals no upper west side shrinks no wall street masters of universe instead it's irish bars the mets' fortunes resentment of noisy smelly nonwhites taking over a good catholic neighborhood and finally the move to long coveted westchester actually no \"finally\" arrives in the form of alzheimer's here just as the life of the learys descends into hell fighting the health care system and their own deep misgivings and the disease itself the author sets himself some impossible challenges and handles most of them successfully the toughest to me was how do you reconcile the heroine's ambition being battered by her diminishing fortunes and not slide into darkest pessimism thomas falls back on the old fashioned love conquers all recipe and pretty much makes it work finally for those daunted by the length yes it could be a good 100 pages shorter we don't need detailed play by play descriptions of the mets' games and long lists of baseball stars really","2283":" i don't think this book earned a single star the worst read of the year so far this sweeping epic is really the minutiae of life told from the viewpoint of primarily one 2 dimensional character though later her son chimes in from time to time she is rigid and somehow simultaneously hyper aware while living in a self constructed bubble i wouldn't have coffee with her yet thomas had me listen to her inner monologue for the span of 60 years or more enter her son and enter another lackluster character ugh the only decent character comes down with alzheimer's half way through the novel and falls into the role of problem to overcome how this was a notable book is beyond me do not waste your time the epilogue really had me rolling my eyes since it seems the point of the book was to trot out empathy i stuck it through to the bitter end hoping for some redemption i was left with utter and complete apathy","2284":"a story to really fall in to","2285":"book group read that no one was particularly thrilled with after reading no one became engaged with the characters and it was hard for us to understand all the rhetoric about being a classic","2286":"a long book but a good book","2287":"was a bit too long but really enjoyed this story some great situations presented that were so spot on if any family has been through this just picked this on on a browse through at the local library would recommend it to most of my book friends","2288":"i received a review copy of the audiobook from the publisher i'm a sucker for a good family saga and we are not ourselves is that indeed we follow eileen tumulty born in 1941 in brooklyn to stereotypical irish immigrant working class parents her father moonlights in bar her mother cleans buildings we see her struggle with alcoholism in the home and distant but loving parents and we see how this nurtures her desire to achieve something more read my full review of we are not ourselves at 5 minutes for books","2289":"just awful the most despicable female lead character since olive kittredge do they still have editors out there or are they a thing of the past","2290":"i didn't manage to finish this through what feels like no fault of the books the characters were strong and their problems were all too relatable i wanted to like it more than i did","2291":" i read this on the airplane going and returning from vacation and then let it sit for a few weeks when i picked it up again i had trouble getting back into it i read the author's comments that he took 10 years to write it and i think it is a very good piece of literature however the story is long and difficult from the perspective of the issues that the main characters display they were all created by the author to be real enough which is a major accomplishment but i did not really like any of them in the end the book was reminiscent of the corrections wow i just looked up the reviews on amazon and they mention the corrections as well perhaps it just wasn't the time for me to read an epic family saga","2292":"beautifully written and a lovely story but very very long","2293":"sad story beautifully written highly recommend","2294":"a character driven life story of a woman who learns we are not in this life to rack up victories and defeats but to love and be loved","2295":"at times the author made you feel the emotion this family was feeling at other the characters seemed like 3 dysfunctional people joined as a family","2296":"600 page story of an average american family in the latter half of the 20th century mr thomas' beautifully perceptive writing shows us that none of us are average the successes failures heartaches and joy we all experience are epic tales in themselves","2297":"i thought that this was a depressing book having dealt with alzheimer's disease at a personal level it is a truly dehumanizing disease where you lose your loved one far sooner than you lose them to death the 'if we had only knowns' could drive you to despair i really didn't like eileen and i so longed for connell to grow up and play the man all in all it conveyed the heartbreak of alzheimer's and the toll it takes on a family already functioning at a dysfunctional level","2298":"this beautifully written character driven rumination on family marriage and ambition held me transfixed for days the slow dismantling of main character eileen's american dream against the changing neighborhoods of queens was poignant and heartbreaking the idea of being forced to live a life you did not choose by chance or circumstance is elegantly illustrated through eileen's crumbling house in the suburbs and her son connell's short memorable stint as a doorman in a posh manhattan co op a very human story about finding your place in the world and struggling to hold on to it","2299":"this is a lot of reading the writer tricked me into going along with his pace in describing eileen's life rather than the pace i wanted i nodded a lot and shook my head a lot i was awed with the love she sustained for her husband this is a heartbreaking story is this really what alzheimers looks like","2300":"the 600 plus pages of this book felt like a 200 page novel the author takes you on a journey with the leary family and it will be a while before i forget these characters this is a beautifully written saga and i'm sad it's over","2301":"i picked up this book due to the great reviews that i've read about it unfortunately i found this book rather ordinary and boring the characters weren't very interesting nor were they likable neither eileen nor ed nor connell had anything profound to say in all these many pages connell was hardly developed as a character this was a story about a family striving for a better future and the obstacles that are put in their way no different than most families that we know i wasted many hours reading this 600 page book waiting for the good part and it never did","2302":" an epic about three generations of an irish american family living during the twentieth century told primarily from eileen tumulty's point of view eileen is a compelling character she is a strong driven attractive woman who strives for the american dream leaving her scarred childhood of poverty and alcoholism behind her everything moves along according to plan eileen does well in school gets a job as a nurse marries a young promising scientist who later becomes a teacher they have a son they eventually move to the type of middle class neighborhood that eileen has always dreamed of even though they can't afford it then a tragedy enters their lives eileen her husband and their son desperately try to maintain a sense of normality and not give up on their future dreams this was a touching book about the human spirit and love in the face of adversity however it wasn't perfect the story started out slow and dull approximately the first 100 pages but it was worth persevering i also struggled with the portrayal of the family finances which weren't dealt with realistically after tragedy struck i expected financial ruin and loss of the home i will leave it at that because i don't want to spoil the story","2303":"truthfully i only got halfway through when i decided i was tired of rolling my eyes","2304":"this one will stay with me for a while i so enjoy being immersed in multi generational stories and there was something achingly familiar about these three authentically drawn rarely likeable protagonists i pulled for them all to see the light to acknowledge their misdeeds to concede their poor assumptions to ask for help to empathize to understand and to love and support one another unconditionally and i'm so grateful to the author that he rarely gave me what i wanted that he was as trite as it sounds honest","2305":"i found this book beautifully heartbreaking it is more character driven instead of plot driven which is different from the usual books i read but it is quite possibly the most engrossing read there is you are taken through the lives of eileen and her family including the heartbreaking diagnosis in the final 1 3 of the book i don't think i stopped crying through the final 1 3 of the book i was captivated by the characters i felt like i knew them and was there with them this type of book is definitely not for everyone but to me it was so powerful beautiful and ultimately heartbreaking and i loved it i hope people will give it a chance","2306":"nice story about an irish family from queens good read","2307":"while i was thoroughly engaged by the book i found that the author early ish in the book dropped the irish component of the plot line turned the book from a saga to a book about a nuclear family i was disappointed in his not using his creative energy to see if he could do something novel with the irish american sub genre","2308":"this book will stay in my mind for a long time immersing epic story extremely moving and disturbing best book i have read for a long time","2309":" this book is worth every star the word 'epic' in the sense of 'long' 'heroic' and 'grand' suits this novel well which brings the reader closest to eileen tumulty her surname must have been chosen on purpose she so much wants her life to not be a tumult turmoil commotion or uproar and yet that life has more imagination than every single one of us human beings is capable of having and disturbances of many kinds are unavoidable even for the rational and determined eileen it is interesting to follow her and her family's development and to absorb this narrative of an entire generation and i would recommend future readers to set aside sufficient time to read it and become part of the tumulty's life","2310":"i loved this book i was sorry to see it end one of the few books that moved me to tears i especially loved ed's letter to connell","2311":"i forget the last time that a book brought tears to my eyes but matthew thomas's writing has done it we are not ourselves is a huge book a family saga told with some of the most gorgeous prose i have read in a long time another irish american family story this one tells the tale of eileen leary tumulty from childhood well into married life post wwii queens new york is the setting of eileen's childhood and thomas brings it to vivid life every part of this book is masterfully written characters you have read before places you have been yet nothing is cookie cutter everything is fresh and real this is indeed a family saga everyone in eileen's life gets their turn in the spotlight the trials and trtibulations faced by the tumulty and leary families are numerous but you never react with 'what else can happen to them ' you just continue to read and grow with them matthew thomas has written the great american novel","2312":"this book hurt so good every page was full of life funny sad stupidity anger love jealousy i wish it didn't have to end unfortunately as with life all good things must come to an end","2313":" this was going to be a solid three star book for me but the incredible writing in the last few chapters bumped it up to four stars the beginning and the end of this novel were definitely the high notes with the middle fizzling out a bit for me this book was good but there's very little plot as it's largely character driven i was interested in the stories but it was a long read and took me a while to get through i also found that sometimes the characters sometimes made decisions that weren't consistent with the way they were described and there was no explanation for why they did what they did overall though i really appreciated reading this version of the american dream and i also appreciated the beginning passage and the reference to the great gatsby","2314":"this is a fantastic read i was very involved with the characters and could relate to the daily life well written interesting would recommend to anyone not intimated by a book this size","2315":"beautiful took me awhile to feel this one but ultimately so worthwhile","2316":" i wasn't sure what i expected when i started this but i loved loved loved this book thomas tells a real story of every day people sometimes not likable people sad people who are living a real life his characters are so gritty overachievers quiet men confused children all struggling to fit together the story follows a family as they grow apart and back together there is tragedy and strength in this story and i will say there were parts i cried through his characters and their lives touched me more that a book has in quite some time this is not an epic family saga a huge dramatic display it is a quiet story of love of ambition of loss of acceptance of growing older and wiser just beautiful","2317":"one of my favorites of the year a simple and straightforward story of the american dream and the decline of the middle class through the lens of an irish american family in queens and suburban new york sweeping in time character driven with brilliant third person close narration it's as devastating as it is life affirming","2318":"this novel started out as a gripping family saga that begins in the 1940's in an irish american working class household it tells the story of eileen tumulty a girl who witnesses the effects of alcohol on both parents and vows her own life will be different as she grows and matures her aspirations are directed towards building a different life for herself a life idealized by other children of immigrants like herself in which hard work and playing by the rules will result in upward mobility in other words the american dream for eileen the holy grail at the pinnacle of her journey will be a big beautiful house in the suburbs of course the way is littered with obstacles and eileen needs all her strength to conquer them though along the way she meets ed the love of her life the father of her son and her passport to the dream when things don't go exactly the way she planned she makes the best of her situation but always has the dream in mind the novel then takes a completely unexpected twist which i won't reveal here and takes on a different focus suffice to say eileen's strength and fortitude are sorely tested this is a beautifully developed study of human desires ambitions and relationships but my one criticism is that in the last third of the book the pace becomes uneven switching narrators at a fast pace as if the author is trying to get the book finished there are moments of true tenderness at the end but i felt as if i lost eileen in this ending and she is the most interesting part of the book","2319":"i didn't really feel like the first half of this book which was very readable had a direction and couldn't imagine how it would continue for 300 more pages however it does and another reviewer called the second half 'an epic gut punch of a page turner' and i will have to agree there are also some of the most touching scenes i have read in a long time","2320":"a very serious read","2321":" this is not a book to easily classify the reader follows eileen from girlhood to late middle age through a life that has many blessings and much heartache raised in a tenement with alcoholic parents she dreams of a better life for herself when she meets ed a gentle professor she thinks she has found the vehicle to make those dreams come true at last they do have a better life but it is not the one eileen has always wished for with the fancy house in the classy neighborhood ed it seems is content with his job with teaching the students he feels he is truly helping but life is good the have a son eileen is excellent at her job the house will come but when you are constantly looking to the future it can be easy to miss what is right in front of you in the present something is going wrong with ed what appears to be perhaps a midlife crisis of some kind is actually early onset alzheimer's disease eileen is nothing if not strong and resilient and it is heart aching aggravating and inspiring to watch her navigate the treacherous waters life throws at her thomas' writing is superb the characters the descriptions of the disease and people's responses to it are real and true a meaningful worthwhile read","2322":"featuring believable well developed characters who carry us through decades of life matthew thomas's we are not ourselves is an impressive debut novel while it is not a swift read at 600 pages readers will be drawn into the lives of main character eileen and her family from her dysfunctional childhood to the late years of her marriage surely identifying with one or more of the situations presented throughout","2323":" a fine fictional exploration of an american middle class family in the late 20th century we are not ourselves is a compelling multi generational look at an irish american family's rise during the mid and late 20th century to paraphrase joshua ferris this is a notable fictional anatomy of the american middle class during the latter half of the 20th century but it is a notable fictional anatomy that lacks characters as compelling as those in scott cheshire's high as the horses' bridles and vanessa manko's the invention of exile both debut novels worthy of the ample praise that have been bestowed on thomas' novel through the eyes of eileen tumulty who yearns for a better life for herself and her family we see how far the family's fortunes rise when she meets accidentally a brilliant young biologist ed leary with whom she soon falls in love and marries thomas' portrayal of the leary family is especially notable for the painstakingly poetic description of its triumphs and failures but only eileen comes across as a worthy protagonist as the emotional glue that holds that family together both during the good times and the bad simply for his portrayal of eileen thomas has written a fine debut novel that warrants ample attention even if his storytelling doesn't quite reach the emotional heights attained by cheshire and manko in their respective novels","2324":"could not hold my attention","2325":"one of the densest books i have ever read thick with profound familial dysfunction manic measures to keep life's disappointments at bay and desperate attempts to carve out what one perceives happiness to be or at least how it appears to others only to realize that it's all an illusion at best","2326":" i really really wanted to love this book the first half i fought sleep at whatever hour i read this i could not read more than a simple chapter before being bored to sleep i liked the story of this book but i felt like there was just so much excess fat to be trimmed a 600 page book that should of only been 300 if properly edited down as an alzheimers book i've read some that i thought were much better such as elizabeth is missing which i couldn't put down and read in one night this book just lacked the pace and climax that i expected from such a long book the only reason i gave it 3 stars is because of the father son dynamic which i found to be accurate based on my own familial experience","2327":"an enjoyable leisurely paced look at several generations of an irish family mainly through the perspective of eileen leary some tough issues are dealt with and the reader's opinions of characters will vacillate 4 of 5 stars","2328":" frankly i did not enjoy this book i enjoyed the first part of the book about eileen's upbringing and life much more than the later discussion about her son i just could not connect with his character and never found any redemptive moments that i felt made up for his stupidity maybe it's that my worldview of family and what it means to be part of a family is very different than that presented in this novel which is fine i found the exploration of ed's condition interesting and very enlightening i guess i just related a lot to eileen and ed's characters and felt constantly disappointed with connell i wish that i hadn't wasted so much time reading this- i think it was far longer than needed","2329":"i really enjoyed this book it is quite long but it does a brilliant job of writing about the challenges joys and sadnesses of being part of a family i see many reviews that it was boring i did not find it to be so i thought the author did a nice job of bringing the reader along in this family's life","2330":"just not worth the long slow drawn out mundanity of the read in the end i found the book deeply depressing there seemed to be so little positivity in any of the three generations of lives we follow i just did not care enough about the characters in the end to recommend the book to my friends yes an interesting story of the emptiness of 'the american dream' however the telling seemed so two dimensional so much of the detail did not get under the skin of the characters so they seemed in the end strangely unrealised and unlovable","2331":"while i enjoyed this book and it was well written i thought the story could have been just as effectly accomplished in less than 620 pages at times it was a bit wordy and i lost the train of thought and had to pull myself back in to it","2332":"i wish i could give four and a half stars for the first 200 pages i was waiting for the real story to kick in i was interested but not enthralled the story pulls you along however and some passages were so beautifully written they had me near tears","2333":" this is a difficult book to read but it's worth the try if you have the time there's nothing extraordinary or powerful to expect and yet i couldn't give up i had to know where the characters were going the reality of their relationship sometimes made me cringe sometimes made me cry in empathy what we can say about this book is that it is very personal for each reader view spoiler if you want a sensitive depiction of alzheimer's illness the end of the book is really moving hide spoiler","2334":" heartbreakingly beautiful book about a woman's struggle to live the life she dreams about with her husband and son after her marriage in the 1960s not surprisingly things don't go as planned i could almost seeing this becoming a version of the great american novel b c it captures so many important themes american achievement education dreams class consciousness parental love etc i could only read 100 pages or so at a time b c parts of this broke my heart don't miss ed's letter to his son at the very end","2335":"such an honest book about balancing life and death and everything in between","2336":"i absolutely loved this book beautiful writing characters i grew to love through the good and the bad highly recommended","2337":"i'm not really sure where i'm going to place this book on the ratings chart i'm not one to shy away from big books focusing on multi generational families but this book made me feel like i was running a marathon i loved the honest truth about a family's struggle with alzheimer's disease and believe it is certainly the gem of the book unfortunately the rest of the book left me feeling the opposite of uplifted","2338":"brilliantly written and hauntingly accurate in its description of the areas in which the story is set the characters are complex and flawed and wonderful the emotions are real the only negative if you can call it that is that it's pretty sad at times but i couldn't put it down","2339":" i probably would not have read this book if i had known that most of it revolved around a character with alzheimer's however i have to say that thomas does an excellent job with his characterizations and treatment of family dynamics the emphasis is more on the caregivers than on the victim there is a lot of pain but also a lot of love in the book the author's father died of early onset alzheimer's and he know what he is talking about in the end the subject matter didn't bother me however it logs in at over 600 pages and i think it would have been a stronger book if it had been shorter thomas spent 10 years on the book and i can understand his desire not to leave anything out but it dragged in parts maybe that was the point alzheimer's seems to go on and on one person wrote a book about it called thirty six hour day a family guide to caring for persons with alzheimer's disease which pretty much captures that feeling","2340":" we are not ourselves is an epic novel following eileen tumulty from childhood to her golden years when her son connell is born the book follows his life as well eileen grows up the daughter of irish immigrant parents and dreams of a better life when she meets and marries ed she thinks her dreams will come true he's a very intelligent scientist who could go far in his field unfortunately for eileen he loves teaching at a small college and has no desire to advance and make more money later eileen wants to move from her neighborhood where she's lived all her life because people of other races and ethnicities are moving in and that makes her uncomfortable then something happens that forces eileen's focus from her dreams if you don't want that something spoiled for you be wary of other reviews her priorities are forced to become different she wants connell's help but he wants nothing more than to get away from his family so that he doesn't have to deal with their problems this book is beautifully written and doesn't pull any punches the story is told in alternating third person from eileen and connell's points of view they they're multidimensional and have thoughts that make you upset with them and thoughts that make you sympathize with them we are not ourselves is over 600 pages which i was not aware of when i chose it i was nervous that i would be wasting a huge amount of time reading such a long book i had nothing to worry about even after 600 pages i was sad when it ended i could have read even more about the leary family it's well worth the investment of your time to read highly recommended","2341":" i received my copy of this book from simon u0026amp schuster in a goodreads giveaway going into we are not ourselves especially since the opening scene depicts a father punishing his son for killing a frog out of curiosity i was expecting a darker more honest sort of story than the one i ended up reading that vignette which as far as i can tell had nothing to do with the rest of the novel used sparse but powerful sentences i wanted to know more about the relationship between the father and son but then we met eileen leary the daughter of irish immigrants and the unwilling matriarch of a family torn apart by alcoholism and abuse and embark upon a 600 page journey focused on eileen's escape from poverty and her settling into motherhood and suburban life the focused prose from the opening scene dissipated the more time passed in eileen's life extraneous details and long clunky sentences bury a lot of the action in a lot of the scenes given that this is a novel of personal growth and the illusion of the american dream there was little action to begin with it isn't until halfway through the story when a doctor diagnoses her husband ed with alzheimer's disease that my interest began to return and thomas's depiction of the slow insidiousness of the disease is the gripping part of the story my major point of criticism is the bloated narrative surrounding eileen until ed's illness begins to become its own presence their son connell does not share narrative point of view the focus is almost always on eileen her story is tragic but i don't feel we needed 150 pages chronicling her path out of poverty and the nascent period of her marriage to ed unless of course one thinks of this novel as the intimate portrayal of a strong yet flawed 20th century woman and the adversity she overcomes rather than a gripping account of how alzheimer's disease grips and ultimately changes one family it depends on what you're hoping to get out of story it took matthew thomas ten years to finish once i set aside my expectations and simply took in what he was telling i began to appreciate it more but if the frog vignette ever ended up having anything to do with anything i must have missed it","2342":" really really long book i'm going to be honest there were quite a few areas where i would just skim or skip altogether because i didn't see the point to it being in the story this book goes off on tangents and tangents from the tangents that being said i did finish it and overall the story itself is good it hit a little close to home with me since i had family who had alzheimer's i am curious if this could or will be made into a movie and i for one would love to see it as a movie just not longer than 2 hours please","2343":"long long and pretty good","2344":"this book was boring yet ultimately a realistic portrayal of a lives lived in the last 50 years i'm glad a read it but wouldn't recommend it i do hope no one in my family is struck with alzheimers","2345":"this is one of those books that is excellent but feels like nothing much happens in it except then you realize characters have lived their entire lives and you won't stop thinking about them long after you've finished it's really quite beautiful but because i'm in more of a plot driven phase of my life i blame sleep deprivation and my accompanying short attention span it wasn't my favorite i also can't decide whether to recommend this one to my friend whose now deceased father had early onset alzheimer's the last half of the book in which alzheimer's is a major theme is heartbreaking and eye opening and it made me wish i had reached out more to her mother when her father was afflicted i suspect the book's portrayal of that horrible illness is accurate and i'm not sure whether my friend would want to relive those years and that grief or whether she would appreciate feeling understood","2346":" there are some very big ideas in we are not ourselves eileen tumulty is the daughter of irish american immigrants and is weighed with much of the baggage of her parents' aspirations and as well as their weaknesses she's a true striver in every sense of the word seeking to advance herself and her family to what she perceives as the next level of success and she hopes that happiness will follow the classic i'll do better than my parents did approach to life of so many americans but what if we do everything right get the right education work hard and achieve at our job and finally buy that big house in the suburbs and it still doesn't bring us happiness and fulfillment what if forces beyond our control bring an entirely different set of struggles and challenges these are the questions that eileen her husband ed and their son connell face in the second half of the the novel as ed faces a debilitating disease that will change their family forever this was a book that stuck with me i would find myself deeply saddened as the plotline advanced some readers have stated that the novel was too slow but i felt that thomas was illustrating the ways that ed's condition slowly but surely took its toll on each member of the family the small physical and mental changes that wear caregivers and family members down it was tough and heartbreaking to read yes there are places where it is tough to like each one of the characters for various reasons eileen is so determined that she has to have that status symbol the beautiful suburban home and the right friends that she misses the caring community she already has connell is a typical teenager who is trying to find his identity he can be self centered and immature judges his parents too harshly didn't we all as teenagers and makes poor decisions these very qualities are what made the characters so real to me the final section focuses on how eileen and connell are changed and especially how eileen comes to question her previous approach to life and happiness a letter from ed to connell at the end of the novel will reduce you to tears eileen is finally able to more fully embrace her life as it is and appreciate the sense of community that so many americans have moved away from in the past few decades i think this book is especially timely and relevant as so many americans are living with changed circumstances due to the great recession are we striving for happiness that is elusive when we have so many blessings in our family circles and communities that we take for granted this is a book that makes you think about and take some stock of own life your family and your community speaking of community i enjoyed the chapters set at the university of chicago including scenes set at my favorite lunch joint the medici matthew thomas' prose is spare but graceful and he doesn't pull any punches with his characters or situations i hope it won't be another ten years before we get the chance to read his next novel","2347":"this is a fabulous book characters and story no wonder it was in a bidding war write fast matthew thomas you have an audience waiting","2348":"be prepared to feel many emotions when you read this book i mainly felt sad don't get me wrong i loved the book matthew thomas writes beautifully he has created complex characters each one with many layers that he reveals slowly throughout the book i found myself wanting eileen to be different for her layers to reveal a softer kinder better person i wanted her to be a person content with her life her husband her son i wanted her to hug connell first and yes i did get my wish but the journey to get there was heartbreaking","2349":"one of the books that was getting the most buzz at this year's book expo was matthew thomas' debut novel we are not ourselves the 600 page tome delves into the life of eileen tumulty leary a girl born to irish immigrants in 1941 her father called big mike was the man that all of the guys in the neighborhood turned to for advice and a drink big mike spent much of his time at the local bar holding court and drinking whiskey the tumultys lived in a two bedroom apartment sharing one bedroom with three single beds and the second bedroom belonged to mr kehoe a quiet boarder after eileen's mother became pregnant and miscarried she spent months in the hospital upon her return home she was a different woman she began to drink and it was up to eileen to care for not only her father but now her mother as well it was a big burden for a young girl eileen knew the way out of her troubles was getting an education she was smart and worked hard to become a nurse her goal was to get into the middle class she knew the key to this was marrying a man who shared her dreams she wanted a man with her father's best qualities she wanted to find a man who was like him but who hadn't formed as hard an exterior someone fate had tested but who had retained a little more innocence someone who could rise above the grievances life had put before him if her father had a weakness that was it there were other ways to be strong she wasn't blind to them she wanted a man whose trunk was thick but whose bark was thin who flowered beautifully even if only for her eileen found that man in edwin leary a research scientist after a rocky first blind date they fell in love and married eileen felt sure that they were on their way to being solidly middle class american they both had good jobs and buying a home wouldn't be far behind she believed that ed would climb the ladder at work and when he was offered a job working for a pharmaceutical company making a lot more money she was bewildered when he turned it down ed wanted to teach students at a local college he also worked endlessly on his research leaving eileen and their young son connell alone for long stretches of time it began to dawn on eileen that maybe ed didn't want the same things she did she wanted to keep moving forward he was content for things to stay the same the eccentricities she had noticed while courting and thought romantic had curdled into pathologies what had been charmingly independent became fussy and self defeating after years of this stasis eileen became determined to buy a home their neighborhood in queens was becoming much more diverse the irish residents moving away eileen looked at homes in bronxville closer to her and ed's work and a place where there was more space she found a dilapidated home that needed a great deal of work to make it livable and after many arguments and ed saying he was never leaving queens she insisted and they bought the house soon after it became apparent that ed's eccentricities and rages were more than personality quirks there was something wrong ed was diagnosed with early alzheimer's their world changed overnight and everything eileen had worked and hoped for was gone their place in middle class america was in jeopardy ed had to hide his condition from his employer in order to make it to retirement in 18 months where he would made $1400 more per month than if he left his job now eileen had to make sure she kept her job for ten more years to get to retirement she saw a lawyer friend who advised her to divorce ed in order to keep her assets separate and then ed would be eligible for medicaid what an indictment of the american healthcare system that this is the best option eileen is determined to care for ed at home and that becomes increasingly difficult she hires a man to care for him during the day while she works and comes home to care for him at night we are not ourselves tells not only eileen's story but it is ours too we want what eileen wants love family satisfying work a home of our own our part of the american dream we are willing to work hard for it but along the way things happen that can derail our lives how we deal with the bumps along the road big and small will define us i loved this beautiful sad heartbreaking novel eileen is not a perfect woman her inability to show affection for her son caused both of them much pain but when the chips were down eileen showed her true colors she did what most us do step up soldier on and do the best we can even if that sometimes wasn't enough there were so many things that made my heart hurt here when eileen's mother is on her deathbed after years of sobriety she tells eileen that she wishes she hadn't stopped drinking she would have given everything she had a way for another drink that just killed me eileen's relationship with her son was a heartbreaker too connell couldn't step up when she needed him to and he was willing to throw away everything eileen and ed had worked for and hoped for him eileen's rage and disappointment is palpable on the page we are not ourselves is the kind of book that you savor as you're reading devouring it all and occasionally closing the book to contemplate the beautiful language and story and when i finished it i wanted to open it again and start re reading it wanting to experience it again and yet regretting that i will never read this stunning book for the first time again but i know this will be a book i turn to again and again frequently books that have such hype can't possibly live up to the expectations do not fear we are not ourselves not only does that but exceeds it","2350":"i see now what all the fuss was about this has the makings of a classic family saga compelling and well written characters going through recognizable and realistic struggles are handled deftly i look forward to seeing what matthew thomas does in the future","2351":"a grim and largely joyless trudge through irish misery that makes angela's ashes look like a trip to the bahamas steer clear","2352":"just plain loved it very real characters and story i was fully engaged in this intimate story of love loss and family suffering","2353":"this book was a marathon but it was worth it the book is really great when you start reading it but it really slows down toward the middle of it you start to wonder if you should keep going but i promise you that finishing it will be worth it you are tricked into living the characters lives and going through their hardships with them the ending is sweet yet sad and gives a great prospective on life and how easy it is to take things for granted of get caught up in your own selfish desires this book will make you cry and really think about your life good read","2354":"really enjoyable read excellent writer recommended","2355":"a lot longer than it needed to be got me through a 1 900 mile road trip u0026amp i still wasn't done writing was pretty good but the main female character had no soul simply needed a better editor","2356":"i am not going to lie i struggled getting through this book i found myself bored with the tendency to skim through paragraphs the basis of the novel was solid but the execution was lagging i couldn't connect with the characters and then when i thought i could i got bored again","2357":" disclaimer my sincere thanks to netgalley and simon and schuster for providing me with a complimentary e book copy of this book in exchange for my honest review my review lately i've been on a search to find a great sweeping saga of a read one that spans a couple of generations and has a lot of drama so when i read the description of this book on netgalley it seemed to fit the bill perfectly this book was described as 'epic in scope' so i suppose i was expecting much more of a intergenerational family saga with lots of energy familial turmoil engaging storylines and characters that i could root for unfortunately this book wasn't what i expected and i had a hard time staying interested i admit that certain scenes were touching but overall the book felt excessively long and lagged most of the way i think we are not ourselves focuses so much attention on character development and relationships that the plot and energy waned and got bogged down in small daily life details it didn't help that eileen wasn't a character that i clicked with at all she comes off as self centred and always on the hunt for the 'things' that will make her happy she was extremely superficial and i didn't connect with her at all i'm still not exactly sure why eileen's xenophobia was brought into the storyline either it didn't seem to give me a better insight into her and made me like her even less than i already did towards the end of this book i was still holding out hope that the author would divulge some big monumental secret some family skeletons that were going to turn things around and give this book some oomph unfortunately that big reveal never came i will say that i found this book at times quite touching and emotional due to personal connections that i have with one of the major issues in this book i truly wanted to like this book and my feelings are in the minority with many other reviewers but while i found this book to be well written unfortunately it was just too slow moving and i wasn't fond of the characters or its unrelenting melancholy my rating 2 5 stars this book review as well as many more can also be found on my blog the baking bookworm www thebakingbookworm blogspot ca","2358":" i had this book in my to read shelves and forgot about it until sarah reed gushed about it over lunch this was a well crafted meticulous book at over 600 pages you really feel like you are watching the leary family's lives unfold truman show style matthew thomas really knows his new york and it shows in the way he describes jackson heights and bronxville i chuckled when late in the book connell starts flirting with a woman and tells her about two feuding indian restaurants on second avenue thomas has the details perfect down to the chili pepper lights this has to be about panna ii and milon just one block over on first http eastvillage thelocal nytimes c two things that prevented me from giving it five stars 1 the length many of the reviewers who gave it fewer than four stars note that the book could be a few hundred pages less and it could the parts or in the chronology of the book years during which we see ed begin to struggle with alzheimer's were painful to read in part because they seemed dragged out it was hard to realize that this man was losing his grip and then read hundreds of pages where his family suppresses the desire to question brushes behaviors under the rug or plain doesn't realize that the patriarch's erratic behavior is troubling i understand that this was probably meant to mirror the painstakingly slow descent into the disease but it wasn't always fun to read 2 eileen leary at times it's really easy to root against her her upbringing which recalls a tree grows in brooklyn and angela's ashes is modest and sets her up for wanting more the problem is she always wants more she's one of those people who's judgmental and is trying unsuccessfully to keep up with the joneses and when she fails you smile to yourself a little she is noble and she is a good caregiver but she's not the kind of woman i'd want to be friends with i picture her to be that co worker who doesn't have many close work friends but who hangs around the break room so that you can see how perfect her lunch is or so that she can listen in on your conversations and think about all the ways her life child marriage house car is better than yours","2359":"so depressing and so many bad life choices i guess it says good things about the character development that i felt i knew them so well i could imagine what they'd be thinking but it's a problem that i was certain they wouldn't be thinking what the author said they were","2360":"it was a long book probably too long i enjoyed the story and the characters i almost wished it were two separate books though i liked the first half better than the second i would have given it a 5 stars after reading 300 pages or so i could not figure out where the next 300 pages would take me the second half just went on too long and a little to much information probably more like 3 stars","2361":"read this one folks a first novel about irish immigrant families in nyc featuring first generation daughter eileen and her husband ed along with their son connell keep the title in mind as you see these three characters navigate through their lives through thomas's stunning moving prose","2362":"very lengthy and depressing but well written","2363":"this came garlanded with raves from some authors i really like but i found it tedious and sad ymmv","2364":"a quotation from king lear is the title of this book we are not ourselves when nature being oppressed commands the mind to suffer the body the book deals with a suffering mind it follows the history of an ordinary family and the profoundly real affects a serious illness has on a family emotionally physically and economically an extraordinary novel that took a decade to write and thomas has dug so deeply into an emotional truth which is delivered in an accessible form of language i was absolutely moved by this novel in every way there was nothing sentimental about it simply honest truthful and completely empathic","2365":"couldn't finish this it was interesting and well written but soooooo slow moving and incredibly long other reviews have praised it but i just had to put it down it seemed like the plot was wading through quicksand the characters made me so frustrated that it was hard to pick it up","2366":" this was an extraordinary first novel ten years in the making one of the three main characters eileen tumulty was born in queens in 1941 to an irish immigrant couple her childhood bore the shadow trauma depending on the day of family alcoholism when she met ed she was drawn to the straight laced intense scientist who was so unlike her own father she knew she had found an enduring love a life mate eileen was a hard worker who pursued her goals with determination sometimes in disregard of ed's input or even of his appearance of not really caring but she seemed to have a grasp of what was best for the family when their only child connell is a young boy we begin to see a transition in ed which begins with his near obsession with listening to all of his opera music on headphones for hours at a time other subtle and unsettling signs creep in to let the reader know that all is not quite right people's reactions to these changes weren't always be what we wanted them to be but they were honest eileen remains strong in her love and support for ed the father son relationship is often tenuous sometimes heartbreaking it is also a story of the post war american dream with all of its hopes and realities and a coming of age story for connell who had challenges that no one else his age had this is a long book at 600 pages but it is written in such a matter of fact tone in short chapters of alternating viewpoints that the reading never becomes tedious many times in the course of reading the book i said to myself oh the love","2367":"it was a struggle to get through this one it seems to drag on and on at times and though there are parts of the story that provoked emotion those were not explored","2368":"$1 million advance knowing this i was somewhat surprised to find that it was a fairly quiet character driven novel but the quality of the writing soon became apparent this novel begins with the young eileen tumulty child of irish immigrants in queens eileen's father is 'big mike' tumulty a working class hero who rules the roost at his local tavern but despite big mike's charisma and mora 'we are not ourselves' arrives with some fanfare a debut novel it took ten years to write and won a $1 million advance knowing this i was somewhat surprised to find that it was a fairly quiet character driven novel but the quality of the writing soon became apparent this novel begins with the young eileen tumulty child of irish immigrants in queens eileen's father is 'big mike' tumulty a working class hero who rules the roost at his local tavern but despite big mike's charisma and moral authority he can't help his marriage from going downhill at a young age eileen becomes the caretaker for her mother paving the way for a lifelong career of nursing even though she has the brains to go to law school but not the money eileen is a vivid character and there are some nice scenes depicting her sensitivity to class such as when she's working as a dress fitter at a fancy store and has to serve a wealthy classmate thomas's writing generally shines though there were a few times when i felt he overworked a metaphor as in the ones who pleased him were the rare ones who didn't drain the frothy brew of his myth in a quick quaff but nosed around the brine of his humanity awhile giving it skeptical sniffs when eileen meets ed leary she decides she'll marry him even though he's from poor irish immigrant stock like her but different from most young men she knows ed is going places he's a scholar with a huge intellect and strong work ethic and becomes an academic neuroscientist however ed doesn't share eileen's passion for upward social mobility and insists they stay in their house in jackson heights even as the neighborhood's irish flavor gives way to drug gangs and indian restaurants the main part of the novel concerns ed's descent into illness and the pressure it puts on eileen and their son connell there's a long period where it's not quite clear what's happening to ed and eileen even finds herself contemplating divorce because of his behavior once he's diagnosed she is forced to marshall all her resources to care for him leaving the teenage connell adrift and vulnerable midway through the novel thomas introduces scenes told from connell's perspective which was a bit jolting at first but soon became a welcome addition from then on the novel alternates between eileen and connell giving the reader different perspectives on the slow burning tragedy that's unfolding both characters are flawed but despite these flaws or even because of them they are highly sympathetic connell has a special bond with his father and the fact that eileen can never express her love for him as freely as ed did puts extra challenges on their relationship once ed is no longer able to be the father he was 'we are not ourselves' is a novel of quiet intensity and telling details though i wouldn't go so far as to describe it as epic a term used by other reviewers it is a thoughtful portrayal of an ordinary but compelling woman and a family under pressure","2369":"\"we are not ourselves\" by matthew thomas was recommended to me by a close reading friend who warned me that this novel is a \"slow boil\" and i wouldn't realize what all the fuss was about until i'd been into it for a while but i have to confess i never did get to the point that i understood why there had been a bidding war in the publishing world over it for me it's reasonably entertaining and interesting but by no means magnificent it tells the story of eileen leary and her \"absentminded professor\" husband ed and their son connell i tried to think of adjectives to describe eileen who is the main protagonist and a nurse by profession such as cold shrewd xenophobic...but while those attributes can be defended they don't paint the full picture eileen is also fiercely loyal loving self doubting and pragmatic i was often frustrated with eileen she cares so deeply about what others even strangers think of her that it often negatively determines her course of action or inaction she becomes paralyzed by fear of reaction and several times in the narrative fails to act when necessary example early on in a choking scene i was also easily frustrated by connell who also seemed to lack a force of will unless it was to make the inappropriate choice but it's unfair to be too critical of eileen and connell having never experienced the challenges that these two characters are forced to bear ultimately \"we are not ourselves\" title hint think of nancy reagan's whisper to ronnie \"we are doing all we can \" is about the heartbreaking difficulty in letting go of our imagined future or a view of ourselves i suspect most of us having reached a certain age have had to \"recalibrate\" what we hoped and planned our life would be into what we must accept it is although i think the novel has been over hyped i never considered stopping reading - it definitely holds one's interest - but it could have benefited from tighter editing in my opinion note for a wonderfully absorbing novel about the health care industry and what happens to a family when medical bills become insurmountable i highly recommend lionel shriver's so much for that","2370":"why misha why it's so sad","2371":"i liked the writing and anecdotal structure well enough but i did not at all enjoy the time i spent with eileen and her family","2372":"parts i loved and felt were 5 stars especially the last section liked the beginning felt it dragged in the middle a lot a mixed bag but worth slogging through the middle for it became extremely emotionally powerful for me","2373":"i really enjoyed this book because thomas did such a good job telling the story of real people in a very compelling way","2374":" i'm not sure the person who wrote the jacket cover summary actually read the book while it does indeed start with eileen and her irish family that is only the very beginning of the book most of the book deals with her husband ed's gradual decline into early alzheimers what that looks like and how each family member deals with it i get the feeling that the direction of the book ended up being different than it started out being that being said it was a decent book giving an unflinching account of alzheimers it just wasn't what i was expecting","2375":"difficult topic to read about but i could't put it down at times you like the characters and then you don't made them very real","2376":"a well crafted novel that spans decades of eileen tumulty's irish family strengths of this novel include how thomas captures the setting and eileen and husband's different ideas about the american dream one of their downfalls i vacillated between three and four stars frustrated at times when the novel jumped in time in a telling way that didn't allow the characters to develop but when thomas paused and let them be there were lovely and heart wrenching family scenes in the end it was hard to stay with a 620 page novel where no one seems happy with his her life always wanting something else or someone else in the end we are not ourselves is a good summer read if you want a sweeping family saga but not if you are looking for a something with a speck of joy","2377":"it might be real as some reviewers suggested but such poorly executed realistic fiction simply becomes sad and i don't mean in an emotionally charged touching way and uninteresting which is the far greater crime for a novel disappointed","2378":"thoroughly enjoyed this book it's a long meditation on love life marriage and family all the lovable characters spend their lives trying to figure out who they are and what is their purpose for living and in the relationships they hold more or less dear isn't this what we are all doing","2379":"outstanding a little out of my comfort zone as far as subjects it's a surprise but i loved the writing and flow","2380":"a longer than necessary depressing read while i found the characters hard to like i understood their feelings and how they came to be the people they were eileen is a long suffering negative self indulgent martyr she cared about her husband and son but could not allow herself to show it","2381":"first page about boy and father so good made me eager and allowed me to stay past my usual allotted 100 pages which were boring it picked up when it became apparent what was happening to ed which his clueless nurse wife failed to pick up on very annoying that this family always managed to end up with money in the most dire straits where was the reality that most of us would face never broke the surface of these lives except for ed and his struggle which is why i gave any stars writing good at points but often drifted into tedious description o editor where art thou","2382":" 4 5 stars this had the potential to suffer from too much hype syndrome especially considering its 600 page length and yes it is probably longer than it needed to be but i adored this book it is more character than plot driven and i loved spending time with eileen and even the very difficult ed the author brilliantly captures hope and longing and resentment and love across multiple decades the treatment of ed is deftly handled he is at turns frustrating and sympathetic and downright hateworthy homage to family no matter how difficult cautionary tale a little bit of both the only person i didn't find as compelling is son connell in his older years overall though a gorgeous and impressive read","2383":"excellent stick with it","2384":"the book was very very long i'll use the word arduous to describe how it was trying to finish reading i really can't say i enjoyed the characters nor can i say i got a clear picture of who they were even after 600 pages the story was either predictable or confusing it was an important and relevant topic early onset alzheimers though the book really had no lasting impact","2385":"3 5 actually i wanted to love this book but it is so unrelenting and so determined to be so utterly grim that i went down instead of up in my rating it is worthwhile and parts of it have you rooting hard for eileen for ed for connell and it made me reconsider facets of my relationship to my own father but there's little cheer here and some loose ends i was unhappy about the ending is realistic but unsatisfactory to my mind i wonder what if anything i will remember of this book in a month or two or six","2386":"we are not ourselves by matthew thomas is a novel that starts off with a bang - the murder of a frog and a father abusing his son for it unfortunately the bang fizzles quickly the opening scene was something this reader wants to know more about - who the boy and the father are for example this reader is disappointed thomas moves swiftly from the frog and the abuse to the small daughter of irish immigrants to new york city there is no little boy in sight eileen tumulty is interesting enough for a while not for long but for a while she grows from a wide eyed girl ready to conquer the world to a jaded young woman in a very short span of time her father dotes on her and her mother mostly ignores her there's a boarder in their house who plays the clarinet and he's interesting but he disappears almost as fast as the boy and the frog as girl children of immigrants and girl children in general are wont to do eileen marries a man she figures she must love it's a very odd sort of love to be honest mostly eileen and ed are ships passing in the night the night being of course when thomas makes the point again and again that marital relations are just fine in bed when they have a son after years of trying and failing everything starts to crumble this seems due in part to ed's total disinterest in family and marriage and the constantly evolving racism that grows in eileen she is absolutely convinced that she is not racist but anyone who reads this book will see that she is and she really could do something about it but she doesn't all this happened in a quarter of the book i stopped reading when my kindle told me i was at 25% and i realized i no longer particularly cared what happened to these people i'm still a little curious about the boy who murdered the frog but i'm not that curious the blurb that attracted me to this book on netgalley mentioned the words masterwork powerfully moving epic in scope heroic in character... i didn't get those things i'm sure someone else will i received a copy of we are not ourselves via netgalley in return for an honest review my thoughts are my own this review will be cross posted on netgalley goodreads and my blog","2387":" my rating would be slightly less than 4 stars to me there were two separate parts of this book the first part is the story of a remarkable young woman growing up in a catholic family in queens in a family challenged by economic hardship and alcohol i found this part inspiring and i liked the young woman and her strong sense of herself as an individual the second part covers a good part of her adult life as her husband fails to live up to her ambitions for him and her family and in fact develops alzheimer's at age 50 i was sympathetic the the woman in this part having had a mother who developed alzheimer's like symptoms at age 60 but i didn't like her as much as she measured her life in terms of failed economic expectations even though she performed selflessly in so many respects but still i found the book engaging and worth the read","2388":"with we are not ourselves matthew thomas has single handedly destroyed my goal of reading two books every month i spent more than four months on this book granted i read a few non fiction books simultaneously but it rarely takes me more than a couple of weeks to read a novel we are not ourselves follows the life of eileen tumulty leary from caring for her alcoholic parents as a young child to dealing with unexpected events that threaten her sense of security later in life the characters eileen especially aren't always likable but they are always honest and understandable the book is beautifully written but i understand why several people commented that they were bored with it not a lot happens i agree that it could have been shorter and that some sections feel too dragged out there were a lot of clues leading up to the big reveal that started to feel repetitive if you prefer a lot of action and plot twists skip this one but if you like character driven novels about the bonds of family you might like it","2389":"i wanted so badly to like this book as i love long reads it was so boring and the characters weren't very likeable and sort of wooden maybe it was me or my mood i didn't care enough to finish and took it back to the library guess i'm not quite myself either and very disappointed","2390":"bit of a slow start but as the story unfolded i could not stop reading and crying as life of the main characters unfold","2391":" long slow moving story i actually put it aside to read another book for a bit i was so annoyed with all of the characters for acting so stubbornly human and not addressing any of the elephants in the room however none of the above is a criticism this book was written just the way it should have been it hit my heart hard at first i was taken by the characters' personalities they were intriguing and endearing souls but after getting to know each one of them so intimately their numerous flaws and inability to communicate nor work together infuriated me and then they suddenly became these vulnerable human beings whom you forgive and learn to love as accurate and honest a portrayal of the evolution of any human relationship as i've ever read beautiful","2392":"3 5 stars a long challenging and depressing read very well written for the most part though it could have been edited down about 150 pages i'm glad i read it more glad that i finished it","2393":"this review has been hidden because it contains spoilers to view it click here i finished this amazing book yesterday but wanted to take a bit to think about what i wanted to say i had an extremely hard time reading the last 250 of this book not because they were bad but because they were so horrifyingly truthful simple and explorative and here begin the spoilers one of the main characters is diagnosed with alzheimer's and in breathtakingly honest fashion the book details the slow disintegration of his mind body and relationships with others reading about an i finished this amazing book yesterday but wanted to take a bit to think about what i wanted to say i had an extremely hard time reading the last 250 of this book not because they were bad but because they were so horrifyingly truthful simple and explorative and here begin the spoilers one of the main characters is diagnosed with alzheimer's and in breathtakingly honest fashion the book details the slow disintegration of his mind body and relationships with others reading about an academic undergoing these changes made me reflect on my mother's alzheimer's diagnosis and my possible future one as such i found this book deeply personal and reading it was very emotional i cried multiple times at that strangest of times but i wanted to see this book through i do not think i will read this again but it is not because it was badly written it is one of the better books i read this year by far the story construction the characters the quality of descriptions and treatment of all three were fantastic i look forward to whatever matthew thomas writes next i not sure i fully understand eileen leary but i like that in a story she captured my attention angered me garnered my sympathy and spite sometimes simultaneously i highly recommend this book to everyone and anyone more","2394":"i vacillated between 4 and 5 stars and ultimately settled on 4 because sometimes i didn't love eileen or indeed father and son which i suppose is not a bad thing i'm not going to use the word epic since that seems to be the favorite description for this book but it certainly is quite a tome i think the extraordinary thing about this book is its ordinariness there were so many parts to which one can relate because they reflect the human condition all around quite a book","2395":"good but about 200 pages too long the protagonist was not very likable and it was hard to empathize with her based on her decisions the themes and scope and ideas are good but all together just good full thoughts here http wp me p2zcma j7","2396":"this book is stunning the writing is beautiful and the story captures all of the emotions of life perfectly heartbreak joy pain hope disappointment it's all there in the story of eileen tumulte not sure of spelling i listened to this one i won't give away too much it is better that way great for audio performed beautifully by mare winningham to give you an idea of how much this story sucked me in it was 21 hours of listening 102 chapters and i finished it in less than a week","2397":" oh man this is a depressing book it follows the life of eileen as she skillfully manages her way out of a poor immigrant neighborhood by becoming a nurse and marrying a brilliant medical student who chooses research and teaching over wealth eileen is so close to her dream of owning a fine house in a good neighborhood nothing deters her she plans saves works and finally over ed's objections wins her dream home early in the lengthy 600p book ed's behavior takes interesting increasingly bizarre turns until the reader is very sure that he is dealing with some sort of dementia eventually even eileen recognizes the problem which a diagnosis confirms several years of hiding it follow when ed tries desperately to hang on to his teaching job long enough to retire with a full pension the author skillfully shows all the pitfalls for a family when this disease plows through it money is always the first and most difficult but how does a teenage son fair as his father disappears the beautiful eileen gives the next chapters of her life to caring for an increasingly combative confused ed she gives everything to keep him home for as long as humanly possible the book is so well written that i kept reading although the subject matter is not one i would deliberately choose pick it up with trepidation","2398":"i was going to give up on this book after the first 50 pages but i decided to stick with it i'm so happy that i did the book started out a little slow and the characters were filled with awful faults by the end of the book you end up loving them and feeling what they feel i was in tears for most of the last 100 pages a solid debut novel","2399":"this is a hard book for me to review it pulled me in quickly and i was immediately impressed and moved by the writing thomas paints a vivid moving and nuanced portrait of the protagonist a woman who is resistant to the change in the world around her determined to live the life she wants and unwavering in her love for her family and her sense of self the writing is great and so many issues class xenophobia sex are touched on in ways that don't hit you over the head most of the time and that aren't afraid of making characters unlikeable or complex which i appreciated however despite covering decades it is a slow and quiet book and wow is it occasionally depressing i certainly don't think that books have to be uplifting but i did find myself somewhat dreading my visits to the world of the book overall i'm glad i read it and i think it will stay with me for a long time although in a sad somewhat haunting way","2400":" so this is a read you have to be committed to it doesn't move quickly but it's so well written i never questioned not finishing it matthew thomas is a master of character of sympathy and of story the story is one of an irish american family eileen and ed they meet fall in love and so begins their heart wrenching story you are not sure what is wrong with ed cheating on his wife becoming ill etc but as the story unfolds you just know something isn't right once the reader discovers the answer it is hard to put the book down as you see the power of a love so deep between a husband and wife and son powerful story","2401":"this book is honest well written heartbreaking and absurdly long some parts are more interesting than others and there will be times you can't fathom how the book could go on for 600 pages i wanted to rush through some of the more painful parts but the book forced me to continue to take it slow to absorb the writing and think about life for a bit it was a bit of an exhausting experience reading this book but i'm glad i did it it's a good one one that i'll remember for a long time","2402":" just goes on and on and on and on until you are screaming out for something to happen and then nothing does the characters are self obsessed and lifeless when a story line presents itself the author shies away from it and reverts to the mundane if you want to read a book that magnifies the trivialities of life to grandeur please try stoner by john williams which achieves everything that this book fails to if this really took ten years to write then i would hope that it was the seventies which was a truly awful decade and one that the author would not have missed too much","2403":"i have mixed feelings about this book there is no doubt that the book was beautifully written there were times when he was describing something and i thought wow i've had that same exact thought or feeling but i never could have articulated it so well you could read any random chapter in the book out of context and it could be a beautiful short story of its own i was truly impressed by his narration however the book felt very long and at times boring the book also lacked a character that i was really drawn to they were all so flawed i like someone to cheer for and who i can relate to and these characters were often disappointing to me if i were to rate this book solely on writing style i would give it 4 5 maybe even 5 stars if i were to rate this book solely on plot characters and entertainment value something i like in books it would probably be a 2","2404":"there have been a lot of mixed reviews for this book and now i understand why the begining half kept my attention but it was dragging by the second half i couldn't put down the book and i think it finished strong looking back i think the first half could have been cut down significantly to me a sign of a good book is when you still think about the characters even after finishing the book and that is how i feel about these characters","2405":"fascinating look inside the process of alzheimer's and it's emotional effect upon loved ones as one going through this right now i found it insightful and accurate i also enjoyed the insights into the immigrant assimilation process really good story well written","2406":"bleak tiresome protagonist tedious pace stopped reading half way through","2407":"this one was a tough one to continue and finish pretty depressing all the way through and left me just kind of empty at the end of it phew glad to be done with it","2408":"this review has been hidden because it contains spoilers to view it click here i

mostly eileen with occasional chapters on connell i was going to give this book 3 stars as i progressed through it eileen and ed's lives mirror those of any family as we see eileen's drive for status more money a bigger house a better neighbourhood prospects for connell all frustrated by ed's lack of financial ambition but eileen has been through a tough upbringing and she is the driving force of the relationship so she gets what she wants as a reader you understand her reasoning and sympathise with her but the move to their new bigger but not necessarily better family home signifies the start of the family's decline the reader suspects as does eileen that something is wrong with ed and tests showspoiler alertthat he has alzheimers and it is from this point on that 'we are not ourselves' breaks your heart ed's mental collapse from genius to towards the end of his life the person who when he can communicate makes a series of clicks or just manages one word 'no ' is just heart wrenching in its description you live through his decline and i defy anyone to read it without crying i knew alzheimers was a horrible disease but this this is just awful yet matthew thomas compels you to read on to find out how it ends eileen has been the tower of strength throughout her life the one carrying her family so he leads her to explore some different situations in dealing with the mental loss of ed the portrayal of ed's decline is what made me give 'we are not ourselves' 4 stars i can highly recommend reading the novel but be warned you will need the tissues towards the end it's also a fantastic first novel no wonder it's been long listed for the guardian first book award more","2409":"the writing deserves more than 3 stars and while this book is thought provoking i can't say i would recommend it to others it was difficult to read at times two out of the three main characters are not very likeable for much of the book i personally appreciated the level of detail though given my familiarity with the setting","2410":"i had high expectations for this book but i actually didn't finish it which is unusual for me certain sections worked better than others but i had no real feel for who these characters were what the details of their lives were like i couldn't picture them at all and felt little sympathy for them the story was unrelentingly unhappy and the more it spiraled downwards the harder going it became i was happy to move on","2411":"although the character of eileen was well developed i didn't get a sense of who her husband and son were until nearly the end maybe that was the point but given the fact that eileen was an unhappy perpetually dissatisfied shrew i had a hard time caring about any of them until the last 30 pages tough subject matter was admirably handled though","2412":"i absolutely loved this book but acknowledge that it may not be for everyone some may say it's too slow and not much happens however the characters were so familiar to me the themes explored were so true and honest in ways i have rarely encountered","2413":"extraordinarily too long and too depressing the first half of this book is like the most painstaking and depressing episode of love it or list it and the second half is just painstaking and depressing i consider it a personal feat that i managed to actually finish this one","2414":"this like a little life was a hard book to read i felt guilty being an observer to the slow decline of a man's life i felt uncomfortable reading not being able to help what amazing writing to bring me so deeply into the story of this family it made me question the end of my own life who will care for me","2415":"i simply wasn't a fan of this book i found the characters under whelming i found it slow moving the plot wasn't engaging the writing was good which accounts for the rating and my completing it not a book i would rush to recommend to people","2416":"interesting read difficult emotional issues worth the read","2417":" this book had me at page 6 with this beautiful prose the ones who pleased him were the rare ones who didn't drain their frothy brew of his myth in a quick quaff but nosed around the brine of his humanity awhile giving it skeptical sniffs a debut novel which encompasses several generations and their hopes and dreams and what life actually deals them the portrayal of the husband's early onset alzheimer's was especially moving to me as the daughter of a mother with alzheimer's highly recommend and can't wait for a next novel from matthew thomas","2418":"good irish american story with round characters that you end up caring about","2419":"this is heartbreaking and long and gorgeous and part of me wants to begin it all over again","2420":"definitely one of the best books i have read this year really loved this story of second generation irish american family and could very much relate to them especially the wife's ambition to live a better life and achieve more than her parents for me as a european it is also always really interesting how normal americans live brilliant book","2421":"recommended one woman's desire to better herself and her family in search of the american dream immigration healthcare education and parenting form the backdrop to the devastating effect of early onset alzheimers sensitive but pulls no punches","2422":" i want to thank simon u0026amp schuster and netgalley for an advanced reader's copy of this wonderful book although this is a three generational story the majority of the story features eileen tumulty leary her husband ed leary and their son connell the past and the future tie the present family to the life path they choose for themselves or do we get to choose our life path the main thing i learned from this book is that despite the best of intentions the best planning hard work and day dreams fate makes it own storyline eileen innately a survivor plows her way through an tumultuous childhood having to face mature issues at a very early age driven to find a way out of the broken down environment she fantasies about what a better life would look like to her a child of irish immigrants eileen yearns to have the american dream an ozzie and harriet family with a loving family and the beautiful house with the picket fence she wants to become part of the main stream where she doesn't stand out as different but is seen as successful and beautiful eileen meets ed leary on a blind date and their attraction to one another is instantaneous ed is a scientist an expert on the brain and an educator at a local community college she feels instantly that ed is destined to be her soul mate and future to the world she envisions for herself they marry and eileen sets out each morning wearing her imaginary life is good t shirt in her mind her less than satisfactory choice of a nursing career will be a temporary lead in to her golden vision when she has children and her husband's obvious talents and intelligence lead them up the status ladder she will have reached the greener grass on the other side of the fence life isn't easy for eileen her goals and dreams remain solid but reality pushes back against her when ed and eileen decide that it is time to begin a family eileen is unable to conceive when all hope of a family seems inevitable eileen conceives and produces a son connell ed is advancing rapidly in his career and his talents have been recruited by the drug company merck eileen is stunned when ed turns down a chance to have a state of the art lab and the larger paycheck to remain as an educator and mentor to future researchers she bides her time it will only be a matter of time before another opportunity will be presented to ed to advance his career when a seemly perfect job offer of the deanship at a larger college is offered to ed eileen again is shocked when ed turns down this job as well eileen sees ed as entrenched and stubbornly out of touch with her needs and the needs of the family she wonders how their visions of the future have become so different as eileen tries to light a fire under ed to strive for a better life in a new home in the better part of town her son becomes yet another source of concern for her he doesn't seem to have any initiative either despite the obvious inherited intelligence and potential life becomes unbearable to eileen when she sees both of the men in her life squandering their lives unwilling to challenge themselves and take risks the more eileen takes up the challenge to change the direction of their lives and to find the perfect home the more isolated and aggressive ed becomes their neighborhood has been rapidly becoming multi ethnic and eileen becomes desperate when ed is not going to help her escape to an idyll stepford community she finally locates a realtor in the upscale bronxville community and locates a fixer upper home that she feels will transform their lives despite violent and adamant insistence on ed's part that changes in his life and moving are something he just can't handle she sells their current home and moves the family lock stock and barrel into the neglected home in the upscale neighborhood connell just seems to drift along staying in the background struggling with the fact that he feels alone in a family war he has a father that is retreating into isolation on the couch and a mother that has become a demanding controlling force taking all of the air of the home life an unseen enemy has invaded their lives eileen with her background in nursing has focused on what she sees as obstruction in ed's behavior and missed the signals that would show her a far darker future for them and would explain ed's reluctance to change anything in his life by the time ed is diagnosed with alzheimer's disease eileen has removed all sense of the familiar in ed's life the rest of the story shows eileen's deeper strengths to take care of ed as he rapidly succumbs to his illness it is heartbreaking for everyone too late eileen sees that the grass on the other side is green but not necessarily a better pasture at times the story seems to lag along and i felt like screaming at eileen as she misses obvious clues to ed's disease you are a nurse wake up but then isn't it the truth that we see what we want to see and deflect that which we don't want to see i have experience with a mother having had severe dementia like eileen i dismissed the clues until it became too obvious to ignore i thought the story wrapped up a little too cleanly and nicely at the end but that is the advantage of a work of fiction it can do that","2423":"there were passages in this book that were so well written that i stopped and re read them but the book was way too long it was so frustrating to have to wait about 150 pages for the extremely obvious medical diagnosis to happen to one of the main characters especially since he is married to a nurse not worth investing the time it took to read 600 pages the author needs a better editor","2424":"i would give it 3 and a half stars if that option were available i often wish there was a goodreads rating between 3 and 4 stars or liked it and really liked it i enjoyed the writing the early irish immigrant history the authenticity of the characters just got a little bored in the last few chapters overall i liked the book","2425":"vivid chronicle of one man's descent into early onset alzheimer's from his wife's point of view would have been far more powerful if the meandering opening had been cut nonetheless a poignant novel","2426":"this book was so much deeper darker and more intense than i would have guessed from the liner notes the story takes you through the life of eileen leary from her childhood to her school years her marriage motherhood and finally as a widow by following eileen's childhood we learn what drives her to make the decisions that she does and what is behind the way she treats her husband and son","2427":" welcome to a book that's 300 pages longer than it needs to be a book with three of the most annoying characters i've ever read in fiction a book that's 90% pure distilled sadness 5% weird moments of happiness that usually end up being marred by sadness and 5% insight that comes from dealing with so much sadness for so long meet eileen the matriarch of the leary family and the protagonist of our long boring sad book read about her unhappy deprived childhood for almost half the book before you realize it's not even what the book's about and has little to do with the rest of the story and was all in fact needless filler watch as she infuriates you by becoming a racist and xenophobe even though her own parents were immigrants waiting about five years too long to notice her husband descending into alzheimer's even though she's been a successful nurse her entire adult life and ignoring the needs of her husband and child for years because she only cares about material possessions for a good two thirds of the book like seriously prepare yourself for a book where most of what happens is eileen's husband doing something that makes you want to shout at her lady he obviously has alzheimers get the man some help and she just sighs and goes ed has been acting strange lately but only if we had a bigger house eileen's husband ed is afflicted with early onset alzheimers in his late 40's before his alzheimers ed and eileen's marriage is basically a situation where two people who are almost completely incompatible with each other somehow end up married and have to deal with it where eileen is a classic ivan ilych type ed is basically scrooge just when you think you want an antidote to eileen's materialism ed comes along and actually makes you feel bad for her by being so freaking cheap all the time they're at either end of an extreme so far apart both are wrong for instance eileen just wants to enjoy the simple pleasure of looking at the christmas displays in windows on fifth avenue and ed shits all over her childlike wish with blah blah consumerism blah blah capitalism and makes her feel bad he refuses to take promotions for better jobs to help support his family even when said promotions are basically offered up to him on a silver platter he makes her sit bored inside a sweltering house because he's such a miser he won't go out with friends and won't turn the air conditioner on for even a minute this is all before he has alzheimers this is just the person he is basically he and eileen just don't communicate and when they do it's through fraught yelling matches or passive aggressive silences why do they remain married what pleasure to they derive from their married life why did they get married in the first place i don't know you tell me the book certainly doesn't explain it the best the book can do is vaguely indicate that eileen feels like ed is the one and describe very occasional angry bouts of make up sex that make you kind of uncomfortable to read all of that does not a healthy relationship make oh and they have a kid connell between all their arguments they basically forget about him and don't even notice when he gets severely bullied at school and becomes borderline anorexic but is he any less annoying than ed and eileen nope when ed gets alzheimers and he and eileen both soften at the edges and actually become more likable connell blooms into his full incompetence and ennui and being a jerkness he won't grow up and take care of his dad basically even if it means just staying in the house to watch his dad sleep while his mom goes out for once he can't do it he stays out with friends at all hours instead he uses his dad's illness as an in with girls he blows himself up on a sense of his own importance and then wallows in guilt when he realizes he was being an idiot but his guilt doesn't do anything to change him it just makes him proud of himself for being guilty and the vicious cycle starts all over again he masturbates at work and school out of boredom and at home out of weird guilt side note this book can seriously not describe anything sexual without being creepy everything is pathologized and weighed down with guilt and anger and even fear sex is never just for fun ever in this book now the book does have a redeeming quality in its much lauded portrayal of alzheimers i have to agree that once ed's diagnosis of alzheimers becomes clear about 350 long pages in the book finally finds its true voice and meaning the most heartbreaking poignant moments of the book come after this point as we watch the learys struggle with the progression of the disease eileen both softens and strengthens herself giving all her time money and energy to her husband's care giving up on everything she once held important except her love for ed ed's diagnosis explains some but not all of his bewildering outbursts of anger and obsessive episodes earlier in the book watching him change from a strong deeply intelligent professor to a confused and despairing and finally near catatonic shell of himself is horrible but this wasn't enough to redeem the book in my mind it plods along through so much backstory to get to its few points of clarity and afterward it keeps slogging along limping towards the finish the entire time poring over endless unnecessary details i've never read so much about the minutiae of health insurance pension funds and public assistance it reminded me of some of the memoirs and essays i've read about parents of special needs children who discuss in detail the cost and bureaucracy involved in accessing care but somehow it's more interesting when you know you're reading about someone real for whom these are real struggles with fictional characters i kept finding myself thinking what's the point the book also has a weird focus on these details as if they're the literal most important thing in the story in fact it's a book that as i said earlier focuses about 90% on sadness in every form a book so obsessed with suffering and tragedy that it willfully ignores any shred of happiness early on when eileen grieves after a miscarriage in some detail the birth of connell is summed up in an almost coldly biographical way essentially a few years later eileen carried a pregnancy to term and had a son this is a book that starts out with child abuse and parental alcoholism and neglect transitions into an unhappy marriage characterized by desire for things that are missing instead of happiness with what is and finally finishes strong with an in depth discussion of one of the most terrible heartbreaking diseases known to humanity oh and cult membership car accidents miscarriage racism theft and bullying are all thrown in too when eileen deep in the misery of caring for her now nearly vegetative husband is offered one slim chance at happiness and love and hope beyond the horizon of ed's inevitable decline and death she turns it down even though she badly wants it for literally no reason the most heartwarming unexpected even cute relationship in the book and both parties end up saying nah i'm not kidding i'll actually quote the book page 520 nook edition she wanted to reach out and touch his face but she knew that she would never be with him that something about the circumstances of how they'd come together made that impossible something about the author doesn't even have a reason he can explain it's like these people want to be miserable if you want to be miserable too go ahead and read we are not ourselves","2428":"i am only giving this two stars because for the first basically half of the book it was pretty good but when you still have 30% to go and all you want to do is for the book to end it is a bad sign the second half of this book was sooooooo boring and repetitive and rambling and chock full of navel gazing i could hardly stand it this book would have been a lot better off if it was 1 2 as long","2429":"some beautiful writing but a slightly uninteresting story i wasn't rooting for anyone when unfortunate things occurred it didn't necessarily upset me sergei was the most interesting character in my opinion","2430":"ugh just couldn't get into this one found it very boring sorry","2431":"written well and good ending well written just a little too slow for me","2432":"beautifully written a bit long but worth it","2433":"the writing is lovely but the story was a real downer and i just did not enjoy it","2434":"a very impressive debut with intelligence feeling and judgment a rich engrossing read with a cleanness of purpose that's an aesthetic pleasure in itself in a book that could easily be carried away by the emotive possibilities of the story it tells","2435":"a spot on portrayal of alzheimer's and what it can do to a family it brought back many memories of my grandad who died in 1960 back in those days no one ever said alzheimer's but today he'd be called a textbook case grandad like ed in this book dearly loved baseball his loss of interest in it was the first sign that perhaps something was wrong then he got forgetful disoriented unpredictable and given to flying into rages the end was horrible he was totally disoriented to place and time but wandered at all hours of the day and night the local cops came to know him well this family is familiar too eileen grew up in an alcoholic dysfunctional family and was forced to mature quickly but she turned into a much more shallow person interested in moving up more than anything and then goes into deep denial when she learns ed's diagnosis you might think as a nurse she'd know what this diagnosis means and the financial devastation it can bring instead she reacts by buying an expensive house as is which needs a lot of work when she does not feel accepted by her more affluent neighbors she buys herself a mink coat as ed's condition gets worse she continues to leave him alone during the day or in the care of her teenage son who is quickly overwhelmed with the tremendous responsibility i find this to be totally true to life yet depressing as ed gets worse and worse like a train wreck you don't want to look at it but can't help doing so but stick with it and you will recognize many people you know perhaps even yourself","2436":"moving story about eileen and her husband ed especially once ed gets diagnosed with alzheimer's","2437":"well written but a bit too slow boring for my taste while in the middle it was a chore to plow on by the end i cared about the characters","2438":" i found myself reading lots of other reviews on this book to really do it justice i would call this adult fiction it is basically a story of a family beginning with the mother's growing up and going forward if i had known what this book was truly about i would not have picked it up we are all getting older sick whatever some of us have dealt with our fair share of illness whether our own or of a loved one a child etc i do not want to read about it see endless commercials on tv about being ill all that but i did pick this book up and stuck with it it is nicely written beautifully at some parts but alas way too long for the amount of ordinary lives it portrays life is always changing for better worse plans go out the window and life becomes what it will for all of us this is that story i hope this review makes sense","2439":"this extraordinary novel about family the american dream new york city and ethnic identity is as remarkable as the ten years it took matthew thomas to perfect his debut novel this epic story of growing up parenthood and the interruptions of life is the bonfire of the vanities on new york life in this millennium","2440":" first of all i almost wasn't going to finish this book because i disliked eileen and didn't understand her but i tried to understand her and continued to read i wavered between 3 and 4 stars and would like to give this 3 5 but am unable to and i loved her husband ed even more as the book went on and the last few chapters were my favorite i think this book gave a fair portrayal of how a family copes with hardships illness etc i think the actions of the characters while definitely not perfect were what made this book seem real to me","2441":"i didn't finish just couldn't get interested","2442":"i thought i would enjoy this story way more than i did i was expecting it to be a certain kind of plot but it ended up being a different kind of book","2443":"the writing is very good but it's another book that could have been significantly shorter ilya tough book to read and subject is depressing in the end it's famil and love that is the main subject","2444":"this book is the pinnacle of taking an ordinary family and telling an extraordinary story without being too spoilery the major plot arc of the second half of the book resonated with me very much a must read","2445":" i got a copy of this from netgalley you know how when you start reading a book you kind of have an idea of where it's going that was my impression of the book until it took a turn for the dark side that's not to say it was a bad turn but wow this book was not what i expected this is why i don't like reading book descriptions before reading the book first being surprised by a book is half the fun of reading it when i got about 40% through the book i couldn't imagine why there was still so much of it left it seemed like a touching coming of age story of an irish catholic girl with alcoholic parents and all the trials and tribulations that entails i'm glad i read on though because the best was yet to come without going too much into details we are not ourselves spans a few generations but mostly focusses on eileen her husband and her son it's heartbreaking at times and frustrating at others i was almost beside myself with rage at some of the seemingly irrational things her husband did if you liked moehringer's the tender bar then this book would probably be up your alley some of it takes place in the same era but it also has the same but slightly darker tone i would have rated this 5 stars but i really didn't care for the epilogue and thought the book should have ended sooner","2446":"this is anything but a typical family saga it begins with an irish immigrant family arriving in america to pursue the american dream it turns out to be a study of human nature and also tackles the difficulties of alzheimers not always an easy read but always a page turner","2447":"this was a story of a girl woman growing up as an irish american in new york it starts with her as a young girl with a undemonstrative dysfunctional family she is quite likable in the beginning until her marriage then she falls into many of the bad habits of her own family the real problem isn't that i often disagreed with the characters choices but that the novel is just too long i did stick it out to see how it ended but it really became a chore to finish it if it were shorter it would make a good book club discussion","2448":"a slice of life novel--albeit a 600 page slice follows an ordinary irish woman from her immigrant childhood in queens through marriage motherhood u0026amp the tumults of life tracing the broken promises of the american working class a giant book of small moments beautiful u0026amp so heart breakingly sad that i often looked away from the page to keep from crying a good chunk unrelentingly describes a character's alzheimer's deterioration not easy to take the length is imposing the subtle pace this book is in no rush can be both frustrating u0026amp enveloping well worth the effort","2449":"i almost didn't read this because of the topic but i'm so glad i did i couldn't resist because the main characters were irish americans who grew up in woodside queens ny and my mom's family were irish americans who grew up in woodside btw the topic is early onset alzheimer's and what was really interesting to me was that the first manifestations weren't necessarily what you would think","2450":" born in 1941 in queens eileen plays caretaker to her drinking irish parents she dreams of a better life when she meets ed a research scientist she believes she's found a man to deliver her to the \"more\" she wants in life another book on a dysfunctional family another book where the lesson is that your parents can really screw you up that being said it was still a good story on this particular family's dynamics it wasn't pretty and it reinforces that sometimes you search for happiness and \"more\" when they've been right under your nose all along","2451":"i didn't actually finish this book i read part 1 and liked it okay but didn't love spending time with the characters enough to invest another 500 pages","2452":" when i read the reviews on this book i thought not another book about irish drunks happily the book is so much more than that though the book is not set up this way specifically i felt it was really 3 distinct novellas more than one novel in the first part eileen tumulty is born in 1941 in queens the only child of irish immigrants who scratch out a living as best they can eileen grows up in a tiny apartment which reminded me of a tree grows in brooklyn in the second part eileen marries a wonderful man and becomes eileen leary she is a nurse and he is a professor the portrait of their marriage is so realistically relayed that i felt like i was in the story listening to eileen as a friend and confidante i wanted to have a glass of wine with her and give her advice rather than spoil the story i will not describe the third part but it is the most dramatic and interesting of the three now that i am done i find myself missing the characters and wishing the story had continued","2453":"an immersive journey of the american experience","2454":" wanting to like a book and liking a book are two different things being an exceptionally talented writer matthew thomas makes a great case to like his book as he brings eileen tumulty the daughter of an irish immigrant to life some passages are splendidly unforgettable the only problem however is that the life tumulty is only moving if you can slide into who a woman who lives a rather commonplace sad sack life while novelist matthew thomas captures the 'promise' of domestic bliss and economic prosperity that captured hearts and minds after wwii and turns it upside down into a slow moving and semi tragic melancholy telling of a quest for normalcy despite already having it tumulty is an everyday person at the end of the day she has troubles just like everyone but pretends they are somehow bigger so she spends a great deal of her time always looking for superficial things to make herself happy only to discover much too late that life is about living to be loved and love others in our lives sigh","2455":"two stars doesn't seem like a lot but the designation it was ok is exactly how i felt it was not a hard read but it felt very long maybe because it was the first book i read on my phone it's not so much a plot as the chronicling of the lives of the leary family who are when it comes down to it ordinary people who achieve and disappoint just like the rest of us nearly everyone in the book just seemed so lost and sad the story surrounds eileen and ed leary and their son connell it follows eileen from her youth through her marriage to ed his early death from alzheimer's portrayed realistically and unashamedly through connell's college graduation and entry to the world as an adult it was a beautifully worded book but ultimately for me too long and of too ordinary a story the best line in the book was in the letter ed writes to his son who reads it posthumously you are not in this life to count up victories and defeats you are in it to love and be loved","2456":"the author is so spot on with his details of the medicare medicaid process that it's a little difficult to read when one is dealing with those government agencies in real life clearly however he's done his homework the author crafts the vignettes with such authority that one becomes convinced he has lived much of the alzheimer's experience and maybe he did during the 10 years it took to write this novel the author's propensity to use double verbs drove me crazy e g eileen had had a bad day once forgivable but it happens too much to be overlooked did the editor not edit overall a good but not great read deserves more than 3 but less than 4 stars","2457":" 3 1 2 stars probably worthy of 4 stars but it was so long by today's standards and because the world puts so many demands on us i begin to tire after 400 pages that was not the case in the past i always loved very long books because i could really get into them and live there for a time but these days there are too many books calling my name and i'm getting too old to spend too much time on one book so i don't read many epics anymore this was a character study not a plot driven novel and so was really a story of one woman's life and all the ups and downs that are in any one's story began in the 50's and proceeded through 2011 and was spot on with much of what he wrote i could relate to much of it and some of it brought tears to my eyes as it made me think of things in my own life but i have to admit that i listened to quite a bit of it on audio in order to get other things done at the same time the reader was great but i become more emotionally involved when i read rather than listen i saw the author at an author event at the library and if it hadn't been for meeting him and hearing his thoughts on this book i may not have read it but now i'm glad i did","2458":"beautifully written characters are well developed due to my parents' history i can say that matthew thomas was very accurate in telling the story of an irish american family coming from modest means in the new york area and the challenges they face as they try to advance in their financial educational and social circumstances the book also has a sad but meaningful piece about alzheimers disease","2459":"i can't believe i read the whole thing when i feel that way after finishing a book i know that i found it more of a chore than a pleasure yes thomas is a thoughtful observant writer but he tells more than he shows he is also too wordy and the intricate detailing of his characters' actions becomes tedious reading there is no real story here at least not in the sense that the reader says ooh i can't wait to read what happens next we have a pretty good idea what's going to happen at times i felt i was reading an article in a magazine narrating the sad events in the life of a family derailed by disease on the plus side the main characters are well developed and the terrible devastation of a deadly disease is outstandingly portrayed","2460":"3 5 stars good but long and joyless with no very appealing characters","2461":"empathy he hadn't always had it it was a muscle you had to develop and then keep conditioned if your empathy muscle isn't developed and conditioned after this book there's nothing that can be done for you","2462":"a very sad book well done a dysfunctional family laughs cries copes don't read if you're depressed","2463":"wasn't enthralled with this book at first but it's a real great slow burn detailed characters with acknowledged flaws a great family tale","2464":"beautifully written prose that i could only dream of penning character driven in a way that may have others complain it had no plot or nothing happened but i disagree wholeheartedly it was accurate patiently paced and brave not every story has a clear point where the plot thickens some are paced evenly and beautifully as much as i loved this book i don't know how much i will recommend it it takes a very particular kind of reader to appreciate it not everyone will enjoy this one but i certainly did","2465":"simply stunning i love it when a book stats with you long after you close the final page","2466":"i wanted to like this book more than i did i gave it 4 stars but i would give it 3 75 if i could the book was well written and engaging i just had a difficult time with how the characters behaved there were times i just wanted to shake them and tell them to wake up or get motivated or communicate it reminded me of the corrections but without humor","2467":"i expected to really like this book but only got halfway through it ed's health problems which are suspected by the reader but not revealed until about mid way in the book have a here we go again feel to them it might be a better story without that narrative instead just focusing on a marriage that struggles to work","2468":"hands down the best book of the year a meditation on life marriage and parenthood it was shockingly well written and the characters were well drawn eileen is incredible i didn't want it to end but to be honest there were parts that were hard to read because they were so painful but read to the end just make sure you have tissues handy","2469":"when the world seems full of giants who dwarf you when it feels like a struggle just to keep your head up i want you to remember there is more to life for than mere achievement it is worth something to be a good man it cannot be worth nothing to do the right thing","2470":" pretty amazing read 4 5 stars it's the story of eileen tumulty's life starting in 1941 and going through 2011 it's also the story of her irish parents both who love the bottle just a little too much her husband ed leary a man with a brilliant mind her son connell their friends extended family and life in a 20th century middle class american family living in the suburbs of new york city it's the story of a woman who wants more than what she has a husband who gives her what he can with what he has and a son who doesn't really understand it all until much later for wisdom comes with age right the first sentence of the book jacket says destined to be a classic i think they just might be right","2471":"a very thought provoking book which is beautifully written emotionally heartbreaking","2472":"a testament to the successes and failures in life the story begins with irish immigrant parents and tells the story of the immigrants daughter eileen it keep my interest for the entire 620 pages it was a steady story without lulls or climaxes a meditation on what it means to be human and how we are here to love and be loved","2473":"it found myself slowing down so as not to finish this amazing book loved loved loved it","2474":"i loved this book it ruined me in a good way","2475":"this was a very moving account of a families journey through life and all of its inevitable struggles the characters were so 'real' and came to life through thomas's writing what i walk away from this novel with a profound appreciation for families struggling with major health issues it also made me realize that the little moments with the people we love are the moments we will remember and cherish the most 4 5 stars","2476":" i almost feel like my 3 stars is a cop out a sign of my simply being too exhausted after reading all 600 pages and sobbing during a certain part of it to know whether i really disliked the book or enjoyed it some of the reviewers here who have been critical of the book have hit the nail on the head about the very things that annoyed me torturously depressing too long kept waiting for things to get better frustration with the main character's inability to change her situation boring at times and yet there were parts i truly felt jumped off the page and were top notch i literally sobbed during a part in the end which i don't want to mention for those who haven't read yet and felt i knew these characters in the end it did make me feel for the plight of those growing up with alcoholism or living with someone with alzheimer's or the keeping up with the joneses upwardly mobile immigrant mentality that was so prevalent in the 20th century and had so many wishing their lives away on what they thought life was supposed to be like but i agree with many others who said it didn't need to be this long overall worth the read but could have been edited down considerably","2477":"i kind of wanted to hate this book mostly because i found some of the characters fairly deplorable eileen with her vanity and her extreme status consciousness connell so cowardly and selfish however the more i thought about it the more i realized that maybe the characters were so painful for me experience as a reader because they were too close to the truth of who we really are i came to admire the author for his unscrupulous honesty in portraying them this way also in time they did redeem themselves in the end i loved this book for its unbearable sadness and for being in its own way a beautiful kind of love story","2478":" there are so many glowing reviews because we are not ourselves really is good eileen's deep disappointment with the way her life turned out and the lack of drive in her husband conveys the restlessness felt when faced with the facts of reality and growing up more than anything else what better love story than one where the very things that you found charming soon sour and each spouse is living life with different visions the 'darkness' that changes their life is the true soul of the story and their son connell's reaction to it eats your heart it was hard to read because it was true to the domestic 'bliss' we all encounter it is a very human story and caring for someone ill is brutal and tender in turn i read with a heavy heart because you start to really care about this family you understand the hunger for more through the character eileen and not in a greedy shallow context so much as just wanting something better the reader aches for the loss connell deals with each day as his father's mind slowly seeps out our wonderful ed slips away from us the smart scientific ed with an illness that is such a thief to those afflicted and more a twisted cruelty to a brilliant man here are some quotes don't ever love anyone her mother said picking the papers up and sliding them into the bureau drawer she'd kept her ring in all you'll do is break your own heart the people who lived in this building had figured out something important about life ad she'd stumbled upon their secret there were places she now saw that contained more happiness than ordinary places did unless you knew that such places existed you might be content to stay where you were she imagined more places like this hidden behind walls or stands of trees places where people kept their secrets to themselves the fact that they were there that everything they owned wasn't enough somehow disturbed her suggesting a bottomlessness to a certain kind of unhappiness there was still a little lingering restlessness in her spirit though it hadn't been her dream to live in an apartment like the one she and ed had ended up in sandwiched between two ends of a family there was something romantic about that but living with him made his eccentricities curdle into pathologies what had been charmingly independent became fussy and self defeating in the novel love dies a little every day and becomes some other sort of creature our desires in life adjust to reality as they must and that is certainly part of the story there is genuine love in this novel and the struggles connell faces in caring for his father goes from humor to heartbreak grace grace is a wonderful word for this beautiful story","2479":"i wanted to like this so much the writing is terrific but the story just dragged and dragged with very little light to balance all the sadness i struggled to finish it","2480":"this is an emotionally powerful reading experience my hope is that this author continues to tell us through his characters who we are and what love is like when life gets hard","2481":"what this book was about really snuck up on me i'm so happy the jacket description didn't give it away because it came upon me the way i think it comes upon people in real life beautifully written","2482":" you ought to know something very important about this book yes we are not ourselves is in the midst of a massive push read it is receiving hype describing it as the great american novel but a large percentage of this book is not very well written it's different from say donna tartt's the goldfinch which really only had a great beginning and a somewhat satisfactory ending and a lot of nonsense in between but still ended up winning a pulitzer in that there's good that periodically breaks up the bad what i'm saying is don't believe that this is a uniformly well written book because it isn't sometimes while reading it you may think and try to convince yourself that matthew thomas deliberately wrote it that way the choices that seem like merely bad or pedestrian or wildly disjointed in the early going he restates the same things at an alarming rate part of a master plan the fact that it took thomas ten years to write it also surfaces in gradual changes such as his shifting style the term evidently which replaces apparently for those who want to sound pretentious is something i've experienced as a change in my own sister's vocabulary in recent years and appears to be something he adopted along with whoever else did so at some point and there's the notion that you cannot know about the secret without having the whole thing spoiled for you i have no idea why this book is being marketed this way maybe it's because everyone wants you to think it's a great american novel about the american dream this is somewhat ridiculous the secret ends up smashing the lead character's notions about the american dream there is that sufficiently explanatory without spoiling it for vast stretches while you're reading a book that seems like it's not at all worthy of the hype eileen tumulty leary is going against the grain it's about someone who is actively working their way into being the kind of person the great recession would have you think we maybe don't admire anymore although a lot of american novels are still written to appease this audience possibly because it has money and thomas is not a writer who is at all interested in exploring a story so much as sludging forward he's is not an introspective writer even though he ultimately follows the interior journeys of two characters you read what they think and they often aren't very critical at all fallible but thomas waits for the very end for either of them to reconsider because at that point he understands that it's traditional for the story to ruminate on what it's all about eileen in fact can be interpreted throughout most of it to not really be a very good person although thomas works hard to obscure that the writer writes and unwrites at the same time it's a sentimental journey it's a bad tv movie that was written as a book first and then it kind of becomes something greater the two narrators as it eventually emerges eileen and her son connell thomas made this name up i think from the comic book character superboy's secret identity kon el pivot around husband and father ed leary subject of the secret and the perspective connell reaches at the end of the book makes nearly all of thomas's choices make sense when he compares his father to gregor samsa from the metamorphosis turning kafka's classic allegory of alienation and the rise and fall of family fortunes and interdynamics into one of our favorite modern topics the secret actually has a way of shifting the ball away from the secret for vast stretches of the book i was convinced thomas was writing thinly veiled biography and i felt like i should be guilted into pushing away negative thoughts because that would be insensitive the alternative is that in the end he is a bad writer with a good story i suppose it doesn't really matter which makes this my final word on we are not ourselves bad writing with a good story","2483":"i enjoyed reading this book even though the topic is heavy especially for those who may have experienced this in their own families it's an easy read which is nice the only drawback is that the novel is 620 pages which seems too long it would have been better condensed into about half this amount as i feel it rambled on and on toward the end","2484":"boring plodding wearying characters too much telling made it to page 146 and abandoned","2485":"i thought there were so many interesting insights in this book there a letter that is unbelievably touching so sad it's over","2486":"a story about the leary family ed and eileen and their son connell i liked the way ed parented his son not being critical he wanted connell to live his life without feeling tied to his father eileen had ideas for whom she wanted her son to be however when ed became ill eileen handled it pretty well when connell a 19 year old said he couldn't stay home and take care of his dad i thought that was good i learned things from the behavior of all three learys new ideas to cope with very stressful events it was nice to see how eileen matured over the years and learned to be more loving and accepting and less materialistic very good book","2487":"this review has been hidden because it contains spoilers to view it click here this was well written and an interesting topic i had read that it was epic but i did not have that feeling after reading it the first third of the book was a slow paced back story of the wife character the book became more interesting after the big reveal of the husband's

but it did keep me interested good plot line and interesting characters","2489":"excellent book cried at the end would recommend this book","2490":"wow what to say about this book in some ways the characters resembled those in the corrections i have to admit reading it on my kindle was a plus because i had to look up so many words beautifully written but so heartbreaking it will haunt me for awhile","2491":" this book earned an a from entertainment weekly and i kept waiting for the a to emerge the beginning of the book was much more interesting to me since it contained characters i actually found likeable or at least sympathetic the protagonist eileen must grow up too soon as her mother spends years in a depression fueled alcoholic haze eileen idolizes her father whose charisma carries the early pages of the book once eileen reaches adulthood it's like the book shifts completely from its nostalgic yearnings to the almost present day at this point i really didn't care much for any of the characters save eileen's husband ed i realize we often choose not to see certain characteristics in the people we love but i found it laughable that it took eileen forever to become suspicious of ed's weird turns of behavior anyway definitely not an a in my mind but i did finish the book which is saying something","2492":"this book was very slow for me yet probably very realistic it is a narrative of a family's life as it progresses through the different seasons of a marriage the mother is a nurse who wants for more and her husband is a high school teacher who is content where he is in life","2493":"challenge yourself we are not ourselvesby courtney allisonwe are not ourselves is one of the best books i've read all year but it's not easy material and i say this in the most complimentary way to the author debut novelist matthew thomas it's a rare thing to race through a book not only because you are enjoying it immensely but paradoxically because it's seeping so far into your bones it's making you uncomfortable thomas tells a compelling unputdownable story of one family's trajectory in america in the twentieth century starting with a close visual on eileen tumulty born in 1941 to irish immigrants in woodside queens eileen's father who she adores is one of the most charismatic men in town he's the one all the men come to for advice even before the local priest and he's practically the mayor reigning supreme at the local bars eileen's mother does the best she can but struggles with alcoholism and lacks the capability to give her daughter the affection she so craves eileen is intelligent and hard working and grows up dreaming of a life that will take her away from her turbulent upbringing and improve her circumstances while reading we are not ourselves finding a paragraph in the novel's 600 plus pages that doesn't contain a gorgeous line or image packing so much punch it begs to be underlined is unlikely here's just one example of the razor sharp writing which arrives when eileen crosses paths with a former schoolmate virginia eileen is working in a dress shop when virginia on her way to a top tier law school and promising marriage comes in looking for bridesmaid dresses virginia tells eileen she should come to law school with her that she was always so smart eileen thinks it was as if virginia was speaking to her from the outside of a circus cage clutching a bar in one hand as she absently held a lamb chop in the other law school wasn't in the cards for eileen but she works hard to become a nurse and create not just stability for herself but upward movement the novel follows eileen into her marriage to ed leary a promising research scientist and eventually eavesdrops on their son connell's life as well it hems close to real life in all its familial dysfunction thwarted ambition and tragedy true to the novel's title the characters are not always themselves they are flawed and beautiful and human as they confront social issues face emotional darkness and obstacles out of their control all the while keeping their heads high some of the conversations and arguments are almost too familiar and will likely hit close to home for several generations of americans we are not ourselves is raw stark and painful at times but worth the effort to read this beautiful story","2494":"this is a tough one to review i'm not sure that i've ever read such a sad and depressing book that being said i enjoyed the evolution of the characters and some of the lessons they learned along the way but man there isn't much uplifting in this one","2495":" we certainly aren't we spend our lives trying to make ourselves into us but as we go along we get entangled in the lives of people we come to love marry parent befriend and along the way we become something but what we have dreams we think will shape our lives but we find ourselves bending to accommodate we are not ourselves is the story of eileen tumulty born in 1941 to irish immigrant parents with problems of their own her father a strong personality is almost idolized by the community around him her mother not so much moods swing her homelife is dependent on those moods she longs for more eileen's dreams are sure to be answered when she meets ed leary even though she promised herself she wouldn't marry an irishman she decides he is different enough from her parents she gives her life to him hoping he will redeem her american dream ed has other dreams and they don't include climbing the ladder of success eileen changes again she has one child connell and she changes again now resigned to her life she does make the most of it and the three learys forge a life together until again they are all forced to come to terms with the worst life can give them this truly sounds depressing i know but it isn't i found myself anxious to get back to this story and thought about it when i wasn't reading it that's the sign of a good one","2496":"i loved this book it is masterfully written and truly is the story of redemption for one american family the power of love when chaos reigns moved me especially since i know many similar stories where the endings were not so good i highly recommend this book","2497":"meh hard to pin down my opinion of this book i found it hard to muster any strong feelings for any of the characters they were rather flat i liked the beginning quite a bit but somehow started to find the remainder of the book tedious and rather depressing all of this being said there were moments where i was completely engrossed","2498":"matthew thomas is a master storyteller a master of vocabulary and masters the gradations of what it means to be successful in life","2499":"this book was okay it is about a family and the choices we make to better ourselves even at the expense of others what we do for our loved ones what sometimes happens to people we love it just plotted along it was a book i could only read a bit at a time","2500":"i'll write a review of this once i pull myself together five stars will have to suffice for now","2501":"what is the novel about the story of an irish immigrant and his descendants searching for the american dream into the 21st century or is it the story of an american family who's patriarch is struck by early onset alzheimer's whichever the case it is a compelling novel i believe it provides a personal insight into the trials facing each and every member of the family who deals with this cruel disease at times i was exhausted but this lengthy novel is worth it","2502":"beautifully written conveys with simplicity the pain and terror of living with alzheimer's each character is flawed but somehow evokes empathy this one will be haunting me for a while","2503":"this review has been hidden because it contains spoilers to view it click here for a 600 plus page book i was able to finish it in record time the narrative flows quickly and i was deeply embroiled in the story and anxious to find out what happened next the story covers 3 generations but mainly focuses on the life of eileen she is the daughter of poor irish parents who raised her with dignity despite their poor fortunes she grew up in the 50s smart and due to her sex and era obtained a masters in nursing instead of becoming a lawyer or a doctor she is beautiful and for a 600 plus page book i was able to finish it in record time the narrative flows quickly and i was deeply embroiled in the story and anxious to find out what happened next the story covers 3 generations but mainly focuses on the life of eileen she is the daughter of poor irish parents who raised her with dignity despite their poor fortunes she grew up in the 50s smart and due to her sex and era obtained a masters in nursing instead of becoming a lawyer or a doctor she is beautiful and could have had any man she wanted but picked edward who also grew up poor and irish and worked himself up through education he obtains a phd and teaches at a community college instead of a more lucrative job working for a job company or a more prestigious university he wants to make a difference they have a child late in well into their 30s and he is the apple of the parents eye just when you think everything is stabilizing for the family ed develops alzheimers at 51 the story again continues on the trajectory of making the best in a bad situation eileen works hard all her life to do better than her parents give more opportunity for her son and have a good life with her husband instead he has to overcome these challenges which many families have to deal with health finances and loss the story is poignant and while i would be dissuaded to read it if i read a blurb about multigeneration family dealing with alzheimers i'm glad i read it the book has mass market appeal but the prose is good enough for lovers of literature as well i understand that thomas was in a bidding war for this novel and he received a 7 figure advance he deserves it it's difficult to write a book with such fully fleshed out characters that's plot driven without delving into sentimentality i look forward to more from this author more","2504":"this was a long book and at first i was tempted to quit but i'm glad i persevered i felt the book was a look into the differences between the lives we want and the lives we have it was fascinating to watch the characters focus so intently on what they think should be the ideal life that they may be missing out on what could bring joy","2505":"really slow i tried to finish it i really did kept waiting for something to happen but i just stopped caring eventually maybe got a quarter of the way through","2506":"this seems like a never ending book no matter how much you read it seems as though no progress it is however a book that keeps my attention and at some point in my life i will finish it","2507":"there were moments i really liked this book but at other times i was forcing it down i wish the editor could have lopped about 100 pages from it a lot of this book rang true for me having a family member with ed's issues and as such made it hard to read at times","2508":" this was an incredible book it could have been a little shorter as the last few chapter dragged a bit elaine leary is the only child of of irish immigrants living in nyc her parents are not very affectionate and are big drinkers she vows that she will have a better life a big house a wonderful husband and kids she meets ed leary and he seems to be her dream guy handsome intelligent and kind but her marriage isn't all she imagined it would be she remained a strong advocate of her imagined life but life throws her a curveball and she deals with things that come up with an intensity that sometimes makes her seem unsympathetic eileen has a good heart though and even though she wants a dream life she often must accept the cards she had been dealt with courage and a strong conviction this is a long book over 600 pages but it goes fast and i couldn't wait to get back to it each day","2509":"this review has been hidden because it contains spoilers to view it click

story that would be able to keep my interest for the majority of the 620 pages unfortunately this was not the case the concept of the story was interesting knowing someone who had alzheimer's it was interesting to see how that was depicted in the story and how the other character's lives were effected by it however this was not enough to keep me compelled to continue reading the first portion of the book kept my interest but after that i would often find myself reading several chapters and then leaving it on my bookshelf to continue after a few days or weeks the story felt more driven by the characters and how their circumstances were effecting them than by an actual plot while the characters were well developed this is probably why i began losing interest eileen was the main character in this story and i frequently struggled to relate to her she was so consumed in achieving more opportunity money a higher social status that i found her character to be annoying in a sense she didn't take much time to stop and notice what was around her she was constantly trying to make her life everything it wasn't when she was a kid she had spent her entire life as a nurse yet she didn't notice ed had alzheimer symptoms until ed started making noticeable behavior changes i would give this book 2 5 stars because it was an interesting concept to read about but fell flat in keeping my interest throughout the entire novel more","2510":"a book about characters rather than a story some parts really drew me in but overall found it too long and drawn out","2511":"this book was really somewhere in between 3 u0026amp 4 stars for me as someone who grew up in an irish family from queens there was so much that i could relate to with the younger eileen i loved her drive and determination well researched and well written","2512":"mehget to the point already i'm 40% in and i feel like the whole thing is building up to nothing everything about this book is just ok it's ok enough to keep me reading but i'm not exactly sure why i don't really like any of the characters and the events of the story seem to be leading to some sort of big predictable let down in the life lesson department i wouldn't say it's horrible just not my cup of tea","2513":" this was a tough one to read as it was less plot driven and more character driven while i really didn't relate to the main character personally i did relate to her pain and anguish for her husband who was diagnosed with alzheimer's the disease is often worse for the loved ones who have to watch the decline of their family members and this book brought home a lot of the experience my mom had when she had the disease this book was well written about a difficult subject but it was also difficult to read because of the content as well as the fact that the decline of the husband marriage and family did not happen until 300 pages into this 600 page book","2514":" this was okay moderately interesting but waaaaay too long and monotonous with details and ramblings that added nothing to the story esp since the story is a bit depressing anyway had a hard time forcing myself through to the long end unlikable characters and situations which i'm seeing is a theme with these literary darling novels i enjoy a good dark not traditional hea story on occasion even unlikable characters but i've read a bunch of these critically acclaimed novels and have left me pretty meh give me something to engage my emotions and deep interest good or bad light or dark and this pretty much failed to do that","2515":"it really was an interesting book about people who try to just live their lives and make the best of it without losing themselves in the process and although i liked the topic i found it was too slow and lacking in a certain rythm that just pulls you in and makes you want to go on reading besides that i didn't like eileen very much","2516":"can not finish halfway through and i need to stop i do not care what happens to these sad characters","2517":" disclaimer i received a free copy of this book from the publisher in return for an honest review authormatthew thomas was born in the bronx and grew up in queens a graduate of the university of chicago he has an ma from the writing seminars at johns hopkins university and an mfa from the university of california irvine where he received the graduate essay award he lives with his wife and twin children in new jersey reviewthe book tells both the stories of eileen and her son connell growing up i liked eileen's story the way she is dreaming about her future but keeping it real the same time understanding what might be within her reach but not giving up on thinking bigger i do feel it brought her chances she would not have gotten otherwise though her action can be seen as bold at points most of them turn out well i did have a big problem with her emotional development specially towards connell when just born she obviously loves him and at some point she does not know exactly what to do with him any more but there is never a clear turning point for me i did not understand the why i appreciated connell's part of the story too eileen is very much about not making the same mistakes her parents made with raising her and it is interesting to read how connell experiences his life i really liked the approach in ed's story the emotions coming with a disease like his are all pointed out without disrespecting any of the reactions still the book left me with an 'i am fine that it is over feeling' i am not sure why though it was pretty lengthy with 640 pages maybe a bit to much it was slow in development and there was a distance from the emotional life from the characters for most of the part but i still felt connected in a way i can only say i am not really sure what happened and am really curious how other people who read the book experienced it","2518":"this review has been hidden because it contains spoilers to view it click here i related to the main character for having ideas of how she wants her life to be she made many compromises and was never happy my most gigantic issue is with everyone's failure to recognize alzheimer's symptoms that was very hard to accept as a premise when eileen worked in hospitals","2519":" as a friend pointed out to me any time a book blurb mentions the word multi generational you start to assume some level of dry boringness but we are not ourselves a solidly multi generational drama is anything but boring following first generation irish transplant eileen tumulty throughout the course of her entire life with a few chapters written from her son's point of view this is an emotionally charged epic reminiscent of the corrections minus the humor if ever there was a reminder of the importance of empathy and a call to appreciate one's parents despite their situation this is it and it's riveting from start to finish","2520":" this is one of the very best novels i have read in a very long time i was given the book by my daughter who had read it first there is much within the story that i could relate to as it was set in a time period of the late 50's to probably the early 2000's i found within its pages much that is a testament to our human frailties and desires yet by the books end was a sound endorsement of our hope for the future everyone should read this book and i am mailing it to a relative tomorrow loved it","2521":"more like a 3 5 i enjoyed watching the characters evolve over time this book was just too long very detailed","2522":"it started out well the plot moved me along our main characters are irish immigrant parents and their daughter the daughter is driven as a teen to rise above her drunken parents but somehow ends up marrying a fellow with origins much like her own but i'd have to say i liked we are not ourselves liked but didn't love it's a solid story of an irish woman in nyc who wants more for her life than her drunken parents gave her in spite of her dreams she marries a man who is not ambitious and big spoiler alert unfortunately develops altzheimer's solid yes but also long it could have and should have i think been edited down to a nice three hundred page novel but on and on it went i was very very tired of the storyline by the end","2523":" several reviewers enjoyed this novel i moved it up on my reading list but was disappointed midway through the book i am not quite sure how to express myself without divulging spoilers for the most part i was disappointed in the main character eileen for a nurse with her level of education eileen made poor decisions my colleagues and i may have different ways of viewing patients vs our family but i don't think we would be as slow to recognize our families' needs as eileen eileen's interactions with both her husband and her son infuriated me at times my personal issue was the poor display of the nursing profession i do not mean to discourage others because the family encounters real issues life happens to all of us u0026amp this novel demonstrates that through its characters even if i didn't agree with their actions or reactions","2524":"really well written really really long a main character never satisfied with what she has barely recognizes the beauty of a lifelong relationship until its over","2525":"i too am in the minority with this boring depressing book i found all the characters unrelatable eileen was desperate for a child then finally has connell and cannot display any warm feelings for him he is close to his father but the only thing they have in common is baseball otherwise connell sees him as an eccentric nerdy man eileen marries her husband since he is different from the rest of the bunch in that he is an intellectual but the author fails to show why she even loves him as the years of their marriage progress he refuses to to take any promotions and they seem to have different goals in life he refuses to entertain moving making more money having nice things and fails to see how important they are for her when he is afflicted with alzheimers which being a nurse took her quite a while to figure out the author stresses how much she loves him it doesn't ring true the subplots of the story seem to end but never seem to come to a conclusion connell or the author goes on this rant about the politics of germany where does this come from and what is the point being a nurse and being born irish in woodside queens i was excited to read this book what a waste of time i finished it only because i held out hope it would have some redeeming message nada zilch almost as bad as the goldfinch","2526":"this was a very well reviewed book of 2014 it started out interesting i did not like where it went tough to hang on when protagonist isn't someone you particularly root for son was annoying so was husband","2527":"i finally got through this book there were a few times i was tempted to abandon it but i guess i'm glad i stuck with it there were some moments of elegance and others of what the heck depending on where you are in your life you can emphathize with the mother and or son or you can think they are the most self centered people ever i thought both at times it's a long read and i know some people absolutely loved this book but for others it just rates an ok i lean towards it's ok","2528":"i kept thinking why is this so long why wasn't that edited more why is this chapter even in the book i didn't feel that this was a great american saga i felt like there were some genuine moments there was love there was longing there was sadness and ultimately life goes on but this took too many days of my life to read 2 5 stars but i'll round up to 3","2529":"uggggh what a horrible read i dropped out at chapter 15 couldn't take any more of this painfully boring book and the way the author refers to connell as the boy the only reason i gave it one star is because there wasn't an option for stars","2530":"a long read of dramatic characters but there's nothing wrong with that at all understand the essence of humanity and failures that took me on a journey with this family second generation irish new yorkers emotional yes big time what this family endures you will read about and it's nothing surprising just life itself in its intimate form all the experiences life throws at you you will read it here i thoroughly enjoyed the ride and was inspired the writer captured that depth of emotions not only the story but with each character absolutely wonderful i won this book on good reads first read giveaway thank you darlene cruz","2531":"this book is difficult to review i hated it why because it was so incredibly painful to read it is so beautifully written it cuts you it touches in fact delves vividly into what it is like to live with one of life's most feared monsters it is about the loss of hopes and dreams and yet about life's triumphs beware if you plan to read it","2532":"i loved this book from beginning to end so many themes of family vulnerability roads traveled and choices regrettably left unmade really enjoyed every page and only rarely wished for the author to have spared the detail this ome would be a tremendous book club read for those who aren't afraid of weighty topics and lengthy reads","2533":" rating 3 5 starsa very long but relaxing and cozy read i enjoyed myself far more at the beginning of the book than i did through to the end i felt like there was a running start for about the first 30 chapters or so and then the story dropped off a bit and was just moving through the motions until the very last chapter and epilogue where it picked up again for the ending given the plot of the book {which is up and down and around with drama} i was pleasantly surprised and pleased with the ending the characters were likable but not necessarily lovable throughout the book each had their own personalities and voices but each person in the story was also all sorts frustrating here and there this book however was beautifully written the narration was magnificent and the overall plot was enticing from the very beginning this is also one rare book that has pretty all topics covered alcoholism abuse politics youth adolescence love marriage gone awry racism death work immigration and well life in general the whole of the book is very real and down to earth with something for everyone also reviewed at http booknooksbooks blogspot comhttp www netgalley com i received an advanced electronic copy of we are not ourselves for free through netgalley this review is based on an uncorrected proof the novel is now published and available for purchase","2534":" i wondered as i finished this very accomplished and overly long novel what exactly was it about is it the story of an irish american family working fighting loving and living the american dream with all of the usual vices attributed to irish immigrants is it the story of the daughter who dreams of breaking free from the things that held her parents back is it the story of a marriage and family built on love and tested by a devastating disease or is it just the story of the human condition defined as the positive and negative aspects of existence as a human being esp the inevitable events such as birth childhood adolescence love sex reproduction aging and death i guess that was rhetorical because clearly it's all of the above while i really liked this novel there was a certain dispassionate way it was written that kept me at a distance so i never felt as fully invested in the characters as i wanted to be 3 5 stars rounded up to 4","2535":" i can't remember the last time a book made me cry this much maybe never i feel like i started crying about halfway through and just didn't stop such honesty and insight in this book the characters were so real even when their realness made them awful and despite their awfulness they were always sympathetic the prose was also lovely the only thing keeping this book from a five star review is the first 50 pages or so i didn't believe eileen as a kid and her parents were sort of flat to me too and while i can see how it's important to get that part of eileen's history but i don't know that it needed to be explored that slowly with that said i'm so so glad i stuck it out overall this book made for a really moving experience","2536":"just loved this it really resonated with me","2537":" well written and long this story details the life of eileen who has a plan for her life and the boy she meets and marries ed all the things she loves about him become the things that annoy her later son connell also has a voice as the story progresses slowly spoiler early onset alzheimer's begins to intrude in ways that may only be obvious if you've experienced it since i hade the story took on an alarming personal poignancy for me clues not put together well early on still eventually lead to the presumptive diagnoses connell want to live a life with out the shadow of his parents and eileen wants to continue to live some remnant of the life she had envisioned while not a terribly sympathetic character you do feel for eileen as she struggles to maintain an equilibrium in a life that has gone off kilter sad and honestly written","2538":"this was just excellent a great family saga with a lovely ending","2539":"this book was gut wrenchingly realistic and the ending was just perfect","2540":" four and a half stars would be more accurate had there not been a few places in the novel where i could 'see the writing' instead of be in the writing it would be a five star book for me a first novel wow the story is primarily eileen's when she's a child in a mess of a family without means to her own married life as a mother of one child but the book is long and full we see her hard drinking but respected irish father her hard working and respected science teacher husband and her intermittently grown son who takes far too long to become a man most of the book's action takes place inside the walls of her home despite references to trips to italy disneyland we primarily see the characters inside where they feel most comfortable eileen is a nurse but it's unclear why she changes jobs so often perhaps because she's rising in administration and she's eager to learn and earn more perhaps to contrast with her husband ed who could have been more successful in her mind but chooses to stay a science professor at a local community college he loves the classroom the lab his office his desk his routine eileen wants to leave their changing neighborhood for something more upscale ed wants to stay put they move but can only afford to fix up the 'public' rooms upstairs remains unfinished growing ever more shabby ed's behavior changes in unpredictable ways then he becomes markedly strange and it was striking that eileen the nurse wouldn't entertain the possibility of what was wrong until she hesitantly considered divorce the rest of the novel shows her stern dogged loyalty and love and how we are forced to confront the inevitable perhaps earlier than we intend the author captures the decline of a very bright caring husband and father in painful scenes a few well placed shots at the vagaries of the health system adds to the conflict a series of anti climaxes follow the death of the father the book could have ended in a few places but goes on the people left behind go on that's life at over 600 pages carve out the time to read it carefully it was gripping","2541":"i found most of this book kind of depressing the ending at least was a bit uplifting but the overall story seemed a little hard for me to believe","2542":"an honest portrait of a woman trying to live her version of the american dream while coping with a husband who has different aspirations and who eventually develops alzheimer's it took me forever to finish it but it was well done and worth the long journey","2543":"the book was very slow moving and i thought about quitting it a couple of times the book did not become something that drew me to continue reading until about page 270 then it got interesting and moved me along to the mid 500 pages and then it dragged again if i could i would give it 2 5 stars as i think it could have been a much better book tapered down to about 300 to 350 pages","2544":"wow this book has really touches my soul for anyone who has faced life's disappointments or the loss of a loved one this book will speak to you loved the story and writing style i look forward to more from this author","2545":"this review has been hidden because it contains spoilers to view it click here after 475 pages i'm closing this book this well written book has taken a turn that i don't wish to pursue the main protagonist eileen throughout the book has been a grasping person who has made those around her miserable now she will have to deal with a terrible illness that her husband has and i am unable to slog through another 400 pages it's just me","2546":"i wrestled with this book more than any other in recent memory for the first half of the book i could decide if it was anything more than average at times it felt great but at other times merely pretty good but as the book continued to unfold its greatness came to fruition it is a stunning debut i kept wanting the book to be other things i wanted the characters to be different the plot the storytelling but mostly i wanted the writing to be different i wanted the writing to be jonathan franzen or ian mcewan but it wasn't it was matthew thomas and in the end the writing was good not what i hoped or wanted but something to enjoy and appreciate none the less despite not having the same gravitas as some of my favorite writers there were quite a few paragraphs or pages that left me stunned they were slaps to the head that forced me to pause and digest and usually reread moderate spoilers eileen is a fascinating central character i did not expect the book to focus on her so much i thought we would eventually see from ed's view or more from connell's the book took off for me when ed's alzheimer's is diagnosed everything from then on to the end was amazing you never get the story from ed's perspective but you get enough from eileen to get an idea of what he is going through eileen perceives that other people's lives are more pure that others are more noble and have less problems the orlandos and the thomases are the obvious examples but there are quite a few other small moments where she is deeply envious of other people she oversimplifies what their lives must be like while hers is so complex there is a sharp contrast between ed and eileen in their dealings with others when ed sees an opportunity to help someone there is no hesitation he jumps in but eileen she overthinks plots wonders what other will think of her then she chooses not to act or has lost the moment i got a little annoyed initially at eileen's obsession with getting a bigger house i feared it would be too much of a cliche for the family to move out to the suburbs but i underestimated the author the house theme is brilliant and powerful there is always more that can be done with a space decorating a house than you think there is other people remodel and organize in ways we would not have imagined thomas uses this as a metaphor for people's lives different people can take the same parts rearrange them and make a different whole what we perceive as limits our own or others are just failures to see different potentials thomas drives this home when eileen goes back to visit the old house it's not stuff that makes us or makes us happy eileen's old house is lively because of the lives within in it her new fancy house did not change her dull existence we can search for happiness all we want in things but they will leave us with the same amount of emptiness as we started one of the top two or three books i have read this year it is a book that seeped into me","2547":"super super good touched me in a way a book has never done before","2548":"after completing some 75 pages i thought that is piece of literature makes me somewhat morose despite my story induced angst i strongly recommend we are not ourselves the story details an irish american family's journey through the second part of the 20th century while the pitfalls are many the book is not without humor and pleasure the author has a great ability to take characters who may not appear likeable and reveal acts of bravery and mettle this new book was a pleasure to read and i am privileged to offer my opinion read this as soon as it is available","2549":"heartfelt and deepavid fiction readerextraordinarily perceptive heartfelt andlife affirming i loved it one of the best books i've read in a long long time","2550":" i just finished reading and reviewing a novel about home identity and how unexpected human developments illness can capsize lives called the arsonist by sue miller and here are those themes again but in a much different style plot and story thomas's debut novel is an epic saga a tersely executed but moving tale of an irish american family and spans a few generations from the early 1950s to 2011 the story predominantly focuses on eileen tumulty who is a first generation american and opens when she is just a child however it is her married adult life that is the heart of the novel the story is both broad and specific thomas expands his lens to incorporate eileen's life experiences growing up in new york her hard bitten childhood especially dealing with her mother's alcoholism and her father's more veiled gambling problems at the same time we get a sense of each era that we pass through but just enough to strengthen the story at hand too as neighborhoods change or gentrify we see how they evolve from what preceded them the details of different suburbs in new york city make them come alive both physically socially and emotionally an analogy to how people evolve in families each generation leaves its fingerprint on the next one eileen in her quest for self improvement and her status conscious nature is tenacious in her ambitions to climb the ladder of success the ineffable something she'd been chasing eileen loves to entertain and to take pride in her home her husband ed leary a quirky academic scientist cares little for furnishings and material trappings he cares about his work and his students and playing baseball with their son connell ed has no aspirations to attain financial wealth especially if it means sacrificing his principles and giving way to what he calls the decadence of capitalism and consumerism it is all about the students to him he has no interest in being an administrator dean or corporate executive positions that were offered to him but that he turned down eileen was frustrated at his complacency she yearned for ed to aspire for more specifically a climb to the top of the food chain she needed him to be her partner because she loved him terribly and so she was going to save him from himself he needed a real home no less than she did his mind had grown smaller as he'd bunkered himself in his ideals he needed to regroup to see new possibilities to think bigger than ever if there was anything she could help him with it was thinking big life throws some curve balls at the leary family and what is most vivid about the book is the gravitas of eileen ed and connell eileen is the polestar of the family and i deeply felt every twist and turn in her life there are chapters devoted to her husband and son but it was mostly though eileen's eyes that we experienced their lives despite the large page count the pages move swiftly it isn't dense and wordy the prose is lean and assured and the characterizations were supple and organic there were a few times that i felt the story editing could go a bit smoother as far as which events were captured and which were not periodically i felt i had missed something and realized it was just that some events that happened offstage were referred to only later and it came out slightly unnatural there were also a few anachronisms like oh snap said by a character in the 1990s however these are minor irritants and although it may have removed me from the novel for a few seconds it didn't have severe consequences i don't want to cover much detail as the surprises and developments in the story daunted me as if i were one of the leary family a sort of free fall that i felt for them when life handed them lemons and although eileen is a completely different character than scarlett o'hara both irish american women possessed a certain degree of self possession and especially resourcefulness both women had threats to the nature of their home and home lives one in civil war the other in the everyday war of life and yet they both persevered with determination and resolute aim it took me no less than 75 pages to really engage but eventually it fully absorbed my attention","2551":"this book is good but not great i felt at times it dragged on and other times it did not go into enough detail without giving too much away i had hoped for a happier ending","2552":" we are not ourselves is filled with masterful dialogue insightful observations about marriage and what constitutes real success emotional scenes that crackle and flawed yet sympathetic characters whose aspirations and foibles come alive as their stories unspool born in 1941 to irish working class parents eileen tumulty is raised queens ny in an apartment where finances are thin and alcohol is a means of coping with the rigors of everyday life eileen's big dream is to escape her dreary existence and move up the social ladder enter ed leary a quiet unassuming professor research scientist who is nothing like the men eileen has grown up with and appears to be the answer to her prayers they marry have a son named connell and eileen attempts to motivate her husband to bigger and better things in both his professional life as well as their domestic circumstances they have achieved a certain level of economic prosperity and ed appears to be satisfied with the status quo while eileen aspires to bigger and better things then comes the discovery of ed's early onset alzheimer's and the trajectory of the individual lives of the leary family are forever altered lessons are learned and the importance of loving one another is brought to the forefront matthew thomas has rendered each of his characters with compassion and his writing rings with a conviction and emotional honesty that delves into truths that are bittersweet and ultimately timeless this is one of those rare novels in which the individual parts are so brilliantly rendered that together they form a near perfect reading experience as thomas merton once observed \"the beginning of love is to let those we love be perfectly themselves and not to twist them to fit our own image otherwise we love only the reflection of ourselves we find in them\"","2553":"we are not ourselves by matthew thomasanother story about the ravages of early onset alzheimers thought it was a good read although a bit long 4 stars","2554":"wow did i love this book even though it was more than 600 pages i found myself rereading paragraphs and sentences that were so beautifully crafted in many ways it was heartbreakingly sad yet i hated for it to end","2555":" the story is about an irish american family and spans three generations the main characters are eileen her husband ed and son connell why are we not ourselves firstly there is the problem of identity when people move to a different country or place eileen's father had not wanted to emigrate to america but the land could not support all the family and he was considered the most suitable to go eileen lived in the countryside before marrying ed and moving to the city they both found themselves in an environment where they queried who they were connell was moving via education to a different place to his mother although his father was a lecturer he didn't really know where he wanted to be secondly there is the problem of expectations from grandparents parents all the family that has gone before all wanting the next generation to achieve more society in the form of school and college reinforces this message connell ended up dropping out of college and taking a menial job before deciding for himself that he wanted to teach thirdly there is physical and mental change which affects who you are eileen's mother drank which affected those around her ed developed alzheimer's which destroyed his mind and ultimately his body eileen became stronger by having to cope connell felt guilty because he couldn't cope with the changes to his father fourthly there is the 'road not taken' idea eileen fell in love with ed and married him then got disillusioned when she realised their long time view of life was different if she hadn't married him she would have been someone else she wanted to own a house in the suburbs which meant ed earning sufficient money to finance it ed was less ambitious turning down a high paying job to do research and teaching which he felt more worthwhile he spends long hours at work then long hours listening to music when he retires - almost substituting obsessive behaviour for living she finally gets her house only to find she misses the city one left behind at the end of the book she visits the old house and feels envious of the people living there the book is well written the characters are well portrayed and the story gradually unfolds they are all concerned with whether their lives reflect who they really are or whether something is missing don't we all feel that you feel that they should stop agonising over who they are - and concentrate on living their lives as best they can which both eileen and connell do in the end although i appreciated the honesty and thought within the pages i did not enjoy the book as an elderly person i felt i'd been there seen it done it and survived and did not like to be reminded of the past","2556":"a book about home family identity and illness a bit bleak at times i didn't love the story and i didn't think it needed to be as long as it was but for some reason the normalness the bleakness of the story and the family and the writing propelled me on","2557":"how each of us processes life's events those every day experiences how each of us responds and acts or fails to take action determines who we are who we become the book's title is superb the characters sometimes extremely unlikable are deftly developed a very good read for me","2558":"the brutal honesty in this book was so wrenchingly well written that i had to put it down a few times for this reason it took me months to get through the 600 or so pages but i'm glad i did and i can imagine coming back to it for another read in a few years","2559":"fabulous book","2560":" i'm reading the large print version maybe that has something to do with not enjoying reading experience but i've decided to stop too many books out there waiting for me the fast pace clipped writing style and confusion of where we are going with this abbreviated zoom through eileen's life 100 pages in just isn't grabbing me so i am stopping example when she was thirty five after she had long since given up worrying about it she conceived a child and carried the pregnancy to term delivering at dawn a couple of days before the ides of march 1977 ba boom and on we go loving 'the child' so much but something is missing he is given a name finally but is often referred to as 'the boy' or 'the child' is she mentally ill is this going to all be understood as things unfold i hate to quit but i'm doing it","2561":"the beginning and middle kept me up late at night the ending just kind of dropped off i'm not even sure i understand what i was reading a little too deep and philosophical at the end for me","2562":"a story of flawed individual a in an immigrant family in the 1900s the daughter grows up in alcoholic family and escapes by marrying a professor the book is very honest about the frailties of human nature","2563":"well crafted and compelling but i did not connect with a single character which was a bit disconcerting i wanted to identify with one of the main characters but i really didn't like any of them early onset alzheimer's disease is a nasty nasty thing","2564":"i loved this book it is so true to life and so well written that it is hard to describe i was swept up in the story and the characters and the depths of emotion that we all experience that i was drawn to tears many times excellent excellent","2565":" good lord this book was beyond depressing for the first half you think it's about a marriage falling apart which is depressing enough but then it turns out it's about a guy getting alzheimer's and his family having to deal with it to the bitter end geesh talk about rough reading if i take anything away from this book it would be that if i ever get a degenerative disease like that i'm finding some way to go out with some dignity none of that slowly withering away crap for me and i'm never putting my family through that kind of agony the book had some interesting moments and i like the pov change from the mother to the son it's interesting though that we never get ed's perspective i guess the story focuses more on the impact of the illness on family members and friends another thing to note the book covers many years very quickly i'm not sure how i feel about this writing style on one hand i see how it would add depth and substance to the characters to tell their entire life story from beginning to end on the other we get so much information that doesn't seem very relevant to the main point of the story i generally prefer focusing on a shorter time period with flashbacks to relevant past experiences but maybe that's just me all in all 600 pages of mostly depressing reading does not a happy ioana make","2566":"the wiring was good the story was memorable but dragged a bit towards the end of the book if i get into more specifics i would create a spoiler","2567":"well written book though probably could have been shorter i found it hard to feel bad for the main character throughout the book and didn't connect the dots right away on the twist interesting read and very good first novel for this author","2568":"one of the best i've read in a few years great portrayal of irish americans","2569":"i loved this book i was drawn into the characters' lives and wrapped up in how they were dealing with the life events they encountered just real people responding to life it is not a quick instantly engaging read it takes awhile to get into but so worth the read","2570":"a sometimes long and often heartbreaking story of a family confronting alzheimer's disease however a worth the read","2571":"i was tempted to give this two stars it was okay in the goodreads rating hierarchy but all things considered i just did not like this book--even though in many regards it's at first glance the kind of novel i tend to gravitate towards as i may already have said in my updates while reading the book the characters were persistently wilfully one might even say distant it felt like the literary equivalent of an edward hopper painting the subject viewed from the outside of a late night diner et cetera but without the quiet engaging subtle implication thomas works hard at covering a huge canvas but he seems to me to have little skill when it comes to getting his characters off the page or if he does he loses it in the edits that such a huge novel must inevitably have required in fact the more i think of it that's what it reminds me of a novel i wrote a few years ago and which was edited by my then agent after numerous drafts at his insistence he finally admitted that the heart of the novel had been lost that feels suspiciously like what's happened here all this said i will be interested to see where thomas's career takes him there is promise undoubtedly and the scale of this endeavour is certainly courageous smaller canvas next time perhaps","2572":"this book starts out like many sagas of irish immigrant families but then the characters and their thoughts slowly make their way into your heart and it reads quickly with the arc of life and all of its hopes dreams and realities unforgettable characters don't put it down it's very rewarding and you'll feel enriched for having read it all 600 pages","2573":"it was well written but just didn't grab me the way i thought it would i love this type of book but i ended up stopping almost half way through","2574":"this book was probably more like of 4 5 it was a beautifully written story about life to quote my friend ashley it simply leaves you alone in your thoughts at the intersection of what i wanted and what i got by the end i felt like i had become friends with eileen and loved her faults included","2575":"a long winded saga with unlikable characters that i never connected with and had not sympathy for","2576":"this is the kind of book that stays with you for a long time in ways that are terrible wonderful terrifying and life changing i can't recommend it highly enough","2577":" i am really surprised at all the positive reviews of this book it was so depressing and unnecessarily so these people were so repressed and so self centered about their obsessions you can paint eileen and ed as good people but they were so blindingly determined to not communicate their real wants to each other that i had a hard time connecting with them and even liking them they paid attention to their son yet somehow ignored him just like they did to each other i only got to see the pleasant part of their lives later in the book when eileen would flash back to a happier time but for the most part i felt like this book was a highlight reel of the depressing life together a depressing life that could have been happy if only they reached out to each other i did have hopes for it at the beginning but it was a chore to get through this for me spoiler i didn't even think ed had alzheimer's at first i just thought his obsessiveness drove him to a mental breakdown this got two stars because the writing itself was good but the story which should have been my cup of tea was not not even close","2578":" i received this book as an early reviewer copy from another book site if i was to believe the letter that came with the book from the publisherand the glowing review from the new york times book section i would have thought this book the next best sellerbeach book movie event to visit the year 2014 meh while i give praise to the wonderful writing that did an excellent job of propelling me forward with the story andthe interior life of the characters it is the story line that i have the big problem with for most of us in the adult worldlife is about 95% boring if i had been a fly on the wall for eileen leary's life i would have died before my time ofboredom that's just it nothing much happened except the long long descent of her husband into debilitatingillness and the effects it has on eileen her son and their circle of friends this is the main meat of the book i guess because i am of an age when i have lived through the aging decline of my own parents and my husband'splus details of friend's parents downward spiral i just did not really want to be reliving all the horrible details it would have been nice to know the details of eileen's life as a fairly young middle aged widow and to see somelightness enter into it no the last chapters were just run on boring interior thoughts of her son like so many oneand two star reviews on amazon com i kept hoping the book would pick up but it never did i only finished it as i takemy responsibility of reading the whole book seriously as an early reviewer","2579":" along with a little life this was the holiday season of depressing but beautiful books eileen tumulty is the child of hard drinking working irish immigrants who comes of age in post wwii queens she is smart motivated but is constantly foiled by the gender norms and poverty of her time she longs for a better life of which a free standing house becomes her goal the key to success and happiness she marries a smart hard working scientist and professor ed leary and they have a son who struggles to fit in the shifting demographics of jackson heights queens as one of the only bookish white kids in the neighborhood i don't want to give away what happens to this family but it's the stuff of real nightmares and eileen's struggles to maintain her family through it are truly harrowing epic in length and scope but really a touching reminder to appreciate the life you have built and the people in it this book is a powerful statement of the cliched but resilience of the human spirit","2580":"3 8 the last third of this book was good eileen wasn't a likeable character until that point and i usually enjoy flawed characters","2581":" hmmmmm well first of all anyone getting a million dollar advance for a first book these day must have something going on that's why i decided to read matthew thomas's we are not ourselves it drew me in because i spent my formative years as an irish catholic in another queens neighborhood surrounded by a slightly different version of an alcoholic family i liked eileen as a child but i wasn't at all fond of the woman she became except for her loyalty to he husband still i could not understand how she continued to love her dribbling drooling husband except to say she must be a better person than me the book was excellently written but it was loooong i don't read long books kindle versions sometimes trick me into buying books that are much longer than books i would buy in hardcover the fact that i managed to get through the equivalent of a 600 page print book speaks well to mr thomas's storytelling and character development capabilities he also gave a vivid portrayal of his father's disease the best i've seen however i'm surprised at the number of people readers included who hadn't figured out what was wrong with him much earlier in the book including his wife an r n i diagnosed him in the second sitting i'd like to congratulate mr thomas for this stunning achievement in a constantly evolving publishing world where first time books are usually greeted with rejection slips not $1m advances","2582":"well written honest 4 5 stars in my opinion because only very few books are perfect 5","2583":"i'm struggling to review this book i liked the time frame i liked the setting i found the people and subject matter to be interesting i had a difficult time choosing the number of stars to give it so i tried to decide if i would recommend it not sure i would but i liked it so how is that possible i don't know","2584":"unbelievable debut novel the writing and character development are stunning i did find it a bit slow and depressing in the first third i almost abandoned it because i felt exhausted emotionally spending time with the characters but after a certain point as their circumstances caused their lives and relationships to one another to evolve into something new entirely i couldn't put the book down nevertheless heart wrenching the final few chapters brought me to tears which i haven't had a book do to me in a very long time beautiful read","2585":"not sure why this was a best seller but i read this right after i read the nightingale nothing compares well to that book in my opinion it would have been a better read if 300 pages were removed it just kept dragging on and on and on","2586":"took me awhile to get through this lots of fluff but ultimately i enjoyed it","2587":"this was a fantastic book it was my first time or the first one i can recall reading a book that was character driven rather than plot driven it was the story of 3 lives i follow the recommendation not to read the summary of the book and i am glad i did it shares too much information and i was happy to have discovered that myself as i was reading through the pages the characters have stuck with me and they would for a long time they were real as real as you can get i was able to gain an insight on their thoughts as i never did on any book before my rating changed in my mind while i was reading the book however as a overall this book was absolutely fantastic a quiet yet very powerful book a story i will never ever forget","2588":" matthew thomas has written a gripping emotional family saga that follows the protagonist eileen as she navigates her life as it develops in relationship to her family first as a daughter and then in much more complexity as a wife and mother much of the narrative focuses on eileen's perspective her yearning to achieve more than her parents and then her acquiescing to various disappointments as she settles into married life with ed leary but the narrative also widens to include the perspectives of other characters most notably eileen's son connell and how he comes to reconcile his choices in life with his parents' hopes for him most notably his father's overall the novel is a beautiful portrait of a family and how it evolves despite and because of its collision with illness and eventually death the only weakness for me is the length which seems a little unwieldy and maybe 150 200 pages too long for the most part i was drawn into the story and caught up in the emotional lives of the leary family","2589":"i do not review many books but i would be remiss if i did not get to call matthew thomas's novel a masterpiece it is artfully written and travels through the years in a way that made me feel as if i were there alongside eileen i rooted for emphasized with hated and loved thomas's characters at various times but through it all i desperately needed to see where their lives would take them i did not know this book depicted a battle with early onset alzheimer's when i started it my mother has the disease so it is a sensitive topic for me and i was deeply affected by thomas's account it broke my heart all over again but it was important for me to read 620 pages is a very long book but i would read it again in a heartbeat it will stay in my heart for a long time","2590":"another reviewer mentioned the word honest and that's the best word i can think of for this book it's not flashy with twists and turns and while i guess that leaves it a bit predictable its honesty is what makes it it is a story about a typical life anyone's life really and the ability to recognize its realism that the mundane challenges faced could be my own well it's oddly comforting a gentle reminder that we don't need to be perfect to be good","2591":"go into this book knowing there is no part of it that isn't sad even the parts you think are trending up nope sad but beautiful real well written and sad i agree with melissa i'm loathe to recommend this book but i'm glad i read it","2592":"i agree with a previous poster in that this book is way too long i felt like the first 300 pages were just setting up the second half of the book but not really telling me a story that i was interested in i kind of see how it was about the american dream but i think the author has a bit of work to do before he becomes a consummate storyteller and a more ruthless editor is definitely required","2593":"look what i found at a used book sale could this be real did someone actually give away a signed copy i searched online for matthew thomas' signature but i couldn't find any photographs so i really don't know if this is authentic i have a feeling it's not mostly because i have a hard time believing someone would treat a signed copy so poorly the jacket is torn and the back of the book has more than one coffee ring real or not i'm happy to give we are not ourselves a home on my bookshelf the story takes place over a 60 year period starting in eileen's childhood and ending in her elderly years i love the ambition of novels like this it's so interesting to meet a character at a young age and watch all the little things that shape them into an adult eileen is average not always likeable but her love for her husband and son is evident the only problem i had with the book is being realistic fiction the beginning is slow an average woman living an average life it takes a few hundred pages for eileen's struggles to become overwhelming a book like this covers a lot of different themes and whether you agree with the characters or not their motives feel genuine it's obvious their growth and development was well thought out and i became completely invested in them what i wasn't prepared for was how sad the book is i teared up so much i could barely read the pages this is a great family saga and a really lucky find for me if anyone out there knows if this is an authentic signature or not please tell me","2594":"it's a long slow burner this one i read in 4 days and i loved it somehow despite the long narratives it managed to keep me there all the way i was interested in their lives i wanted to see how it developed and i was really moved great story","2595":"http booksnfreshair blogspot com 20 4 5 stars","2596":"at times i loved this book and at other times i totally disliked it it took me forever to read as it is extremely long and it is driven by the characters rather than the plot however the character development is beautifully done this author is expert at show and not tell an example of this that i used to share with my fourth grader's was this a nine year old boy was riding his new bicycle when all of a sudden he crashed and fell off his bike his mother screamed look what you did to your new bike i then asked them to tell me what they learned about the mother obviously a simple example throughout this book thomas shows us his characters through the way they react to one another at times this book is very depressing but i am glad that i finished it because it was an interesting study of family dynamics","2597":"did not finish characters were flat and plot mundane it was just unrelenting misery throughout the story alcoholism miscarriages death illness bullying and that was only the first quarter of the book i know i am in the minority as most people loved this book but i needed to see a glimmer of hope or even a likeable character and matthew thomas failed to deliver it","2598":"apparently matthew thomas is the thomas wolfe of 2014 in that he doesn't believe in economy of language at over 600 pages we are not ourselves is a badly swollen narrative that could have easily and more effectively been handled in half the length this is the story of eileen leary the hero child of alcoholic parents who learns enabling as a young child and hones it during her marriage to ed she is smart beautiful and ambitious yet she settles for a man who shares her irish background but not her drive by marrying ed eileen sets herself up for a life of frustration and seething anger something that really bothered me about eileen is that she is a nurse but manages to miss ed's early signs of alzheimer's disease she spends a great portion of the 600 pages being angry with ed as a nurse she should've been more attuned to the rather obvious behaviors associated with early onset alzheimer's i'm actually surprised at myself for finishing this book usually i can't tolerate this type of bloviating prose but i kept hoping it would get better well it didn't matthew thomas is one of those writers who loves the sound of his own voice maybe his editors were paid by the page someone should have urged him to edit edit edit","2599":"quietly yet absolutely compelling this novel challenged my ever present desire for more this habit i have of believing in a perfect future just beyond me when i should believe in what i have right now","2600":"it was very well written and had a lot of historical value but a very sad story not what i would usually read","2601":"without giving anything away this book devastated me it ripped me to the core it is written in a sparse no nonsense way no extra word or phrase even though it's just over 600 pages about one woman's journey from childhood til old age i wish i could start it all over again","2602":"the learys may not be themselves but they are definitely exhausting and just a little too much that said the goodwill these characters built up in the book's first quarter kept me going for the next 470 pages matthew thomas does some pretty evocative work here","2603":"it started off slow but got better about half way through timely","2604":" to be honest i'm not really sure what to think it's a character driven story rather than plot driven which isn't a bad thing i just didn't find any of the characters particularly likable again that's not necessarily a bad thing i've read reviews where folks have just slaughtered eileen leary but even though i didn't find her likable i found her real in fact i think all the characters were pretty realistically portrayed i think people feel and act like eileen and connell more than we are willing to admit i read this book because it was so highly reviewed and though it was slow going i can say i was glad i read it all the way through","2605":"this is my best read book in 2014 incredible debut congratulations to matthew thomas this is an epic novel a must read enjoy the journey","2606":"some of the best fiction writing i've read in years","2607":"sorry this was the most boring book i have listened to i have to say i wouldn't have made it past the 50 pages i will give a book i just keep listening for back ground noise they went from day by day living a distant life from each other the family nuclear not sharing day to day nor showing love that is until the very end even though thighs like this happen in life i feel that it would have been more devastating and played out different","2608":" received a copy of this book through goodreads first reads because of this a review of this book is optional but recommended here it is good writing evokes sensation not the fact it is raining but the feeling of being rained upon el doctorowwow just wow the feels in this book i have never read a more emotional book it pulls on your heartstrings and leaves it sitting there in your throat for you to choke on the writing in this book is beautiful and it evokes sensation you can feel what the characters are feeling and it can be intense at times but this book is so good so so good this one will stay with me for a while you should read it","2609":"this is a very intense book the subject matter grips you and i felt like i was dealing with the wife and her husband's sickness alzheimer's is something i am so afraid of that i was tempted to not finish the book am glad i did","2610":"i'd give it 10 stars if they were there to give excellent","2611":"starting amazing but by the end it dreaded reading it every night finally gave up with less than 75 pages left","2612":"i don't usually go for character driven books over plot driven ones but i enjoyed this one i was captivated for about the first 200 pages and then it did get a little slow but i did like the ending especially the epilogue that really hit home for me","2613":"i like a good lengthy book just not this 620 page book i hung in there waiting for something interesting to happen unfortunately it never did","2614":"i won this book in a goodreads' giveaway thank you goodreads and simon u0026amp shuster wow what a fabulously written book a brilliant piece of work by matthew thomas 620 pages of captivating fictional reality we are not ourselves is a multi generational story of the tumulty leary family chasing the american dream and facing the realities of life this is definitely a book that will pull on your heart strings a real page turner highly recommend this book especially to jonathan franzen fans","2615":"i was going back and forth about giving this book 3 or 4 stars it's just a book about a life or a lives in a family there are highs and lows exciting parts and boring parts but really it's just about real life when i was done and could see the big picture of the book i felt like i couldn't just give it 3 stars a good read that makes you think about how the ebs and flows of life","2616":"this is without a shadow of a doubt going to be one of my books of the year i have just put the novel down and a thousand thoughts are spinning round in my head linked to the story linked to my own little world linked to the world in general the last thing i would want to do is put anyone off choosing to read this book but you do need to know that it's not all plain sailing and it's certainly not packed with extraordinary events it's most definitely dispiriting by moments and it's over 600 pages long so in parts it can feel a bit relentless but this is exactly i think what matthew thomas wanted to accomplish and he achieves his aim perfectly while it could be said that the nub of the story revolves around ed and what happens to him during the course of the book the main thrust focuses principally around the central character eileen and what makes her tick yearning to escape a troubled childhood where she is pushed too soon into an early maturity her clear aim in life is one of determined survival and her upwardly mobile aspirations are both tangible and in fact wholly understandable her character is not necessarily the most likeable in fact at times her actions leave the reader cold but by golly is eileen a fighter we stand side by side her as she as she races after that elusive american dream we cringe - but with feeling - as she deliberately cruises for a bruising by viewing houses that she knows full well are way over the family budget for instance and we get a very strong sense of her and our foreboding as the pages and the years of this 'normal' household move forward and things begin to turn inexorably overall the author's tone is rarely sympathetic in fact it is unflinching hardened and matter of fact at times but it's also heartbreaking and it's a slice of life that often made me think back to williams's \"stoner\" there is a familiarity in the recounting of not very extraordinary lives which does somehow render the tale all the more out of the ordinary it's real people getting some things right and also making glorious cock ups but generally it's about human beings just giving it their best shot and living the life as best they can with those rolled dice read full review at literary ramblings etc","2617":"the best family saga i've ever read better than the corrections","2618":"good but a liittle too drawn out and quite sad","2619":"not what i expectedi read this book knowing nothing about it except that it was critically acclaimed i don't know what i was expecting but it wasn't this although i have no complaint with the writing and the story was interesting enough i was just never fully invested in it the idea of the story a man's descent into alzheimer's disease u0026amp the effect it has on his family is interesting enough but it just wasn't the right story or group of characters for me","2620":"http www ondbookshelf com p 1007","2621":"a story centered on a family in brooklyn characters u0026amp places are so deeply drawn i couldn't help but love them all","2622":"at first this book was a very hard read in fact i almost put it down but i could not as i kept wondering what will happen to eileen the main character as the story wove its way through her young life and on matthew thomas took me on a journey of heartache and loss through out the change of time i am pleased that i've finished the book and i highly recommend it","2623":" i was drawn to this book by the strong protagonist eileen tumulty she intrigued me with her fighting spirit and can do attitude born into poverty eileen makes every effort to get out of poverty she receives a college degree and falls in love with ed leary a research scientist for eileen ed is her knight in shining armor with time eileen realizes that ed is not quite the man she hoped for but dispute his flaws she sticks with him this love is tested when ed comes down with a devastating illness the novel spans 50 years and the first half of the novel drags with the minutia of the leary's daily life the saving grace of this novel is the second half of the novel when eileen has to cope with ed's illness the love and generous spirit eileen shows for husband makes up for the determined cold woman of the first half of the book although long the novel highlights the importance of family and the strength of family relationships","2624":" i can't even express how much i loved this book sometimes i find myself avoiding books focused on family dynamics because i lump them in with the usual \"women's interest\" titles like jodi picoult etc which are totally not my thing but this was so much more eileen ed and connell were some of the most \"human\" characters i have ever experienced and the time i spent with them felt like real time matthew thomas was brilliant at conveying just the right tone and cadence of real life--how sometimes the biggest events sneak up on us while the smaller ones can loom large like when frank can't bring himself to maintain his friendship with ed in the foreground and then has a stroke in the background--masterful and shows so well how life events are experienced in the midst of the drama of an individual life my heart breaks for eileen breaks because i see her as still existing somewhere as an individual and at the same time she really illustrates how we all do our best to navigate life--slog along have a dream attain it by hook or by crook realize that it isn't the answer incorporate a new reality into everyday life and just keep moving ahead trying failing no nonsense not much pathos just keep going and get on with it much more powerful than piling on emotion highly highly recommended","2625":"not really sure i how i feel about this book the author succeeded in telling a story that felt like a lifetime but i don't know if i enjoyed it there were some wonderful parts and then some really strange things but that is life i suppose i just wanted the book to be great and it wasn't","2626":"book journal #13 book #1293outstanding literary fiction not for the faint of heart this is a journey into the challenging darkness of a family living alongside terminal illness woodside queens nyeileen nee tumulty because eileen's life is filled with tulmult and ed edmund leary son connell ed is a research scientist phd eileen is an rn connell ultimately attends the university of chicago","2627":" it took me a very long time to read book it started off pretty good and ended on a high note but the middle part was entirely too long and tedious i had to put it down and read something else because i was just so over waiting to figure out why the husband was acting the way he was and honestly there just wasn't much of a story as an avid reader i am always looking for reading recommendations and i found we are not ourselves in an online listing of must read books of 2014 i am not exactly sure who makes these lists but they could have left this one off","2628":"600 pages not necessarily much happiness in those pages either","2629":"very long book and not what i was expecting based on the description it was good even though it took me a while to finish i can understand how people thought it was boring considering how realistic the characters and the situations were it's definitely not one of those books that you want to read to get away from life unless you just like to experience someone that's having a worse time at life than you are","2630":" book blurbs describe this tome as one about the american dream no that would have been a different book this book didn't know what it wanted to be and until deep into the book the characters didn't know who they wanted to be either why do editors let writers get away with bloating their books with irrelevant information and committing the cardinal writing sin of showing not telling this book at its heart whatever the blurbs say is about alzheimer's and how eileen's and ed's relationship adapts to the early appearance of the disease it is not about eileen's childhood or her relationship with her mother or father it is not about her working her way through school and yet we are subjected to chapters and chapters of backstory that add nothing to the plot in fact they detract from it not only because the writer has tested our patience for so long without making or fulfilling any promises but they serve to paint eileen as a bland two dimensional character we are indifferent to while the story could conceivably begin at ed and eileen's first meeting and give us information about the early years of their marriage even that serves as a stalling mechanism their early middle marriage gives us nothing we are as frustrated as the characters because we know what is happening before eileen does and yet the writer must continue with a pretense of building up the suspense ed's decline is traced minutely step by step but we've already been clued in so long about his health issues that it feels like sadism on the writer's part to keep the reveal at bay the book could have been shorter by half and focused on the most poignant parts of the characters' development the backstory is nothing but a waste of time during this buildup characters could have been introduced that appear later instead they materialize one by one later in eileen's life as players in her past why couldn't the backstory serve to introduce some of these characters the main characters continue to make choices that are so belabored by the narrative eileen's choice to go to a psychic for example that their anticlimactic effect is magnified despite these ideas being overworked they don't reveal much about the characters or propel the story along in any manner and if they are meant to give us deeper insight we are told so outright rather than the story carrying us along to understanding through a careful negotiation of the character's inner world or observations of the outer world the shift from eileen's to connell's perspective is strange the story could have been stronger if both were given from early on connell's perspective as a little boy would have done wonders for providing information about his reactions to his father's decline later which the reader in turn reacts to with uneasiness we want to be concerned for him but only end up confused the connell character is a puzzle anyway eileen cherishes him as an infant and then for chapters he is referred to as the boy really why is this necessary we get no information about why her shift in affection occurs but this depersonalization of him feels too extreme and it only serves to alienate the reader from eileen more it takes a lot of effort and too much time to like eileen or understand her it is only in the final parts of the book that it begins to feel genuine the characters finally finding their voices and emotional and developmental shifts taking place in a meaningful manner the rest just feels like practice like exercises for the writer's own benefit the latter parts of the book are also more literarily written less like a catalog of actions and more deftly presented it is only in this part that we can feel anything for the characters eileen's monumental efforts to take care of ed connell's confusion and acceptance ed's realization of his degrading ability to function this book reads like a draft it isn't that it doesn't have anything to offer some parts are indeed moving but those core ideas should have been focused on and developed more and the superfluous stuff cut away before the book made it to print","2631":"i loved the art of fielding this one started off nicely gradually i noticed how it was moving along at a good clip with wonderful character development about half way through i thought wow this book is really good and by the end when i realized it was so much more than a work of fiction but a work that speaks to how we travel through life i was so very happy i read it it is beautifully seemingly effortlessly written without being flowery i highly recommend it","2632":" 3 5 starsi knew when i got this book from netgalley that it was one of the summers' much awaited debut novels however this was not a light summer beach read it took me more than a few nights to finish because at times it felt like an arduous thing i just had to get through it was an emotional book and it was unsparing in its graphic detail of families coming together and apart when i first started reading i had flashbacks to frank mccourt and imagined it was going to be a hard knock irish story like his when the story moved to slightly more psychological issues it reminded me of the glass castle i'm not sure why i believed this book had autobiographical details but it seemed that the author had an unusually intense connection to his characters this book almost felt like two books and maybe it could have been the first story would be eileen tumulty's who we meet at a young age she has become caregiver to her parents whose alcohol problems have changed the family dynamic in this part of the story i am rooting for eileen because i understand how desperately she wants to succeed but at some point eileen becomes selfish which while understandable given her past is still not excusable when she affects the lives of others eileen has big plans for the future with her husband ed unfortunately she didn't tell him this and so she did not know he had no such ambitions but eileen goes full steam ahead with her plans despite his protests now i like a strong woman but eileen becomes an almost over the top striver she wants the perfect life she has imagined and she will get it no matter what the cost financially or emotionally honestly there are probably people like this but i don't have to like them worst of all she is supposed to be an extraordinary nurse and yet she cannot understand her husband has a problem until more than halfway through the book i cannot imagine what the author intended with that - it did not make me feel smart it made me think she was completely ignorant this is not a first person narrative but the author gets into the heads of several of the characters including young connell on his way to college connell walks with his father to the train he will take to the airport for college his mother for some reason cannot take a day off work to see her cherished child off to college \"he was having another of those inchoate ideas that he couldn't entirely articulate to himself he knew that these cloudy notions would come into sharper focus when he was away at college where he would divest himself of the stultifying habits of personality and the false conclusions of biography and shine the light of pure reason on experience \" yes i get it he went to regis but really when i was on my way to college i am pretty sure i was thinking about classes roommates laundry and the dining hall but i guess that's just me so this is what i think of the book it was a difficult painful read especially if you are anywhere near my age but there were times that the writing transcended all of that and approached an almost perfect beauty there were scenes that moved me to tears so yes i did like this book i just didn't always love the characters and it was just too long don't get me wrong i love a big thick book to read but reading it unpaged on my kindle it just wouldn't end and then when i thought it was over it just kept going despite this i did appreciate that the author gave his characters a bit of redemption in the end i could almost reconcile myself to liking them again","2633":"this book reminds me of all the books i have loved it is about real people who happened to live within my own lifespan and the daily aspects of their lives some days are more important than others for revealing who they are but the cumulative effect teaches us that striving to do the best you can with one's life is worthwhile it is also the truest most vibrant love story in years","2634":"this story started about half way through the book it was extremely long with too many descriptives and because of that i lost interest in the story much too loooooong","2635":" 3 5 starsthis was a really hard book to rate the word that comes to mind to describe this book is honest it's more of a character based book and you really do get a great feel for the personalities good and bad the wife mother eileen is the main character her focus on her status material things drove me crazy at times the way she treated her son and husband appalled me sometimes but other times i felt such sympathy for her and the obvious love she really did have for her son and husband was touching while it is character based there is a story it's a truly heartbreaking story this book has very few ups and it can at times lots of times be very depressing but that's where the word honesty came from in describing this book it doesn't suger coat things and the people seem very real with flaws and honest thoughts it took me awhile to read this i had to set it aside several times and read other books which i rarely do one reason to be honest is even though it's a well written book it's so descriptive at times that it's boring and tedious another reason was the plot of the story is one that many of us have watched a love one go through maybe not so young and can be hard to read about like i said before there a very few ups and it got overwhelmingly depressing at times but i am glad i read it it's a book that will be on my mind for awhile","2636":"i managed to avoid spoilers about the last 2 3 of the book and i was completely impressed with the slow build and discovery of what the cover refers to as darkness the characters were complex and not always entirely likable but realistic","2637":"i was really looking forward to reading this book and was so happy i would have the chance to read and review it i'm disappointed to say that i did not like it it was simply too long this book is very character driven it's the story of eileen's life from childhood to late adulthood and i suppose the problem i may have had with this book was that i did not like eileen i didn't like how cold she is how singleminded and selfish she is for most of the book in the second half of the book you get to see some warmth and humanity from her but for the most part she's simply cold reading over 600 pages of a character driven book of which you don't like the most prominent character makes for a very long book i received this book as part of the goodreads first reads","2638":"oh my goodness clear a few hours and grab a box of tissues and read this book it's perfect","2639":"i thought it was really boring with uninteresting characters","2640":"we are not ourselves is a very readable book but it is also a very long book in the first 150 pages of the book the author spends developing his main character in deep detail because of the time spent describing her irish family her father's community ties her early dating experiences it seemed that the author intended to say something about the irish in america but as the book develops i feel the author created an everywoman she leaves home and deliberately tries to not be outstanding she does not maintain community ties she blends in she is normal eileen marries a nice man they have a son she seems concerned that ed is not ambitious then the crisis of the book becomes apparent she has to deal with a sudden change in the health of her husband the book describes how eileen learns about the disease and slowly begins to realize the full implications of the situation the reader sees how an average woman might handle the crisis sometimes with skill sometimes without but always with concern and caring for her family well done excellent story telling","2641":" i wish i was a professional writer or reviewer so i could give this novel the brilliant review it deserves but alas i am just a reader who is still processing and recovering from the last highly emotional pages of it this is about as perfectly written as a novel can be eileen tumulty is born to irish immigrants in queens new york her childhood was tumultuous and she was forced to grow up sooner than most girls her age she knew early on that she wanted more of a life for herself she thought she had found it when she fell in love with and married ed leary a loving and brilliant scientist professor and truly decent man no slouch herself eileen became a high achieving nurse ed and eileen went on to have a son connell in whom they placed high expectations eileen's american dream was shattered by events of which i won't speak for fear of ruining the story i like to go into a book knowing as little as possible and this story is a prime example of why i feel as i do the story is so remarkable and emotional that it deserves to flow and gradually reveal itself to the reader i loved matthew thomas's sparse writing style i loved his evocative character studies he seemed to write as if from a distance but he knew his characters so intimately that i took them into my own heart even his minor characters were unique and memorable i would be surprised if this novel doesn't earn all sorts of awards and i think it will appeal to a wide spectrum of readers it is such a perfect novel thank you to netgalley and simon and schuster for the honor of reading an advanced galley of this book","2642":" i really enjoyed the read at times the characters were maddening to me but that's actually a good thing as people rarely act as i think they should and how boring would it be if every character in every book did as they should the only time i found myself wanting to skim a bit was when i quickly realized what was going on with the husband and the wife didn't despite being a nurse who should have recognized the signs sooner i could by the unwillingness to want to admit something is wrong and there's an aspect of being too close to a situation to see it clearly but after several chapters of it i actually said out loud c'mon i get it beyond that however it was a great read and i loved the flawed characters","2643":"this was an excellent book great writing compelling characters story that spans the 20th century i won't go into any plot details as that would give away a central premise beware it's sad","2644":"i plowed through this book right up until the last quarter or so thought the end could have been cut a bit i got lost mostly in eileen missing her husband overall a nice literary fiction read","2645":"despite the brave handling of early onset alzheimer's i didn't like this book too long too many words and i very much disliked the main character eileen","2646":" this was by far one of the most depressing books i have ever read the story follows eileen a typical child of irish immigrants as a child she is impressed by living conditions grander than her own and sets out with determination to marry the right kind of man who can help make those dreams come true reality has a way of not living up to your expectations and this is true for eileen her handsome irish husband has no interest in moving up in life instead preferring to teach in community college he doesn't want to leave their increasingly bad neighborhood and their son is a fat kid who gets beaten up at school eileen has sacrificed everything and then she gets blindsided by her husband's medical condition this is the dark side of the american dream that for many people working hard just isn't enough life moves faster than you can keep up with and you have to make the best of it the darkness pervading this book is like an infection i was so depressed i cried through half of it","2647":" ok perhaps reading this right before the holidays wasn't the best plan that and the combination of adele's new cd means that i was basically a sobbing mess by the end of this book this is one that will stay with me for a while it is the kind of book that made me want to curl up into the fetal position and cry after finishing it it just hit home in so many places it is a rare thing when a book is able to do that to me i read so much that rarely do i let the characters enter my very being like they did here a delicately realized and extremely well written book with three dimensional characters and a story that takes a turn that makes this into something more than you originally thought this is a book about family it is a book about getting older it is a book about decline and frailty most importantly it is a book about love i could identify so much with connell our stories are somewhat similar don't even get me started on how many tears i wanted to shed toward the very end of the book the letter from his dad part yeah this book hit me like a ton of bricks a great book but not one that i think i will ever be able to read it again it just left me so raw afterwards highly recommended but it should come with a warning that it might be triggering for certain people it certainly was for me read with caution but please read this book is too lovely and too powerful not to be read","2648":"we are not ourselves is an irish american family saga that spans the latter half of the twentieth century in great detail it relates the challenges that the leary family faces when the health of the father declines i found it a meaningful book but my one criticism of the novel which plagued me throughout the novel is that it never felt authentic to the eras it was set in it is rare that i am not satisfied with the setting details of a novel but it always felt about twenty years behind the time periods that the author placed the events in his book","2649":"well written tale of family who struggles with alheimzer's quite sad but good in the end","2650":"a sad poignant look at a family coming to grips as best they can with change i like the strength of the family matriarch but i would have liked to see more joy in her life a well written book but the ending dragged a bit","2651":"a life changing book for me it is slow but it has to be to follow true life of each of the

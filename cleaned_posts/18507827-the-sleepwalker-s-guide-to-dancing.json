enjoyed the way this book was chaptered out i couldn't put this down as the story compelled me to keep turning the page although i am not certain that i agreed with how it ended i am not sure what i was looking for as an ending i do recommend","2":"a beautiful story that i didn't want to end about the tricky intricate forms of communication between family members and the love we always have for them despite shortcomings or faults","3":" the writing in this book is beautiful the eapens are one of the realest families i've ever seen depicted in fiction and their huge flaws and annoying deeply ingrained habits make them endearing and aggravating at the same time i really liked it at the same time this book is so long there were many pages or chapters i thought could have been completely cut without the book losing any of its energy at times i found myself bored there were also parts in particular the entire native american part that i found completely contrived in her notes the author says her interest was 'with the intersection of the indian narratives and what it means as an immigrant to make a life in a stolen country' while i love the very last part the first one is just so utterly arbitrary there doesn't have to be a connection and the message about the difficulty of living in america when coming from a very different culture would not have lost its meaning at all with this part completely removed from the book it gave nothing to the story even considering amina's career path the life changing photo she took could have been about literally anything else any personal tragedy lastly there is nothing mystical about brain tumors i wish the book hadn't been sold as a 'deep mystery about to unravel' it works completely without that byline yet another thing i found a little over the top","4":"i didn't want it to end this is a fairly long book for me anyhow but i got so engrossed in the story and attached to the characters that i wanted more the book takes place in the 80s and 90s mostly and i feel like i need an epilogue to know what is going on with the characters present day or even ten years from the end of the story recommend","5":"i received an advanced copy of the sleepwalker's guide to dancing a novel by mira jacob through the goodreads first read program jacob's novel will be released in july but it is certainly worth waiting for from the very first page i was drawn into the lives of the eapen family from their heartbreaks to their heroics yes the heartbreaks are plenty and i did weep a rare occurrence for me while reading at one poignant moment between kamala and thomas but i smiled and often laughed out loud as well i don't always prefer books that jump from the past to the present but jacob takes advantage of the style weaving the past with the present to create a novel incredibly evocative of a time a place and a family","6":" i always enjoy a novel about the immigrant experience especially the indian immigrant experience this one was a little different in that it dealt with three different time periods did not discuss the move to a new country and did not tie everything up neatly so it had you thinking the story centered on parents neurosurgeon dad and a reluctantly immigrating homemaker mom and two kids akhil who dies young and amina a photojournalist the family deals with loosening ties to india strengthening friendships in america loss of family members and unexplained illnesses it all made for a good read my only complaint was the character of the mom who fell short in my estimation but perhaps that is what the author was going for","7":"easy read from start to finish the characters are masterfully created with quirks that are so realistic and believable that you fall i love with them right away the plot line is filled with intrigue and mystery and jacobs descriptions of the immigrant in a stolen land experience rings true with any second generation indian immigrant family living any where in the world","8":"started out listening to this book and was immediately enthralled finished reading the book and could put voices with faces so really enjoyed ms jacob is talented and am looking forward to book #2","9":"i really liked this book it is about an indian american family told through the eyes of the daughter there are flashbacks to her childhood but most of the story happens in the late 1990s the story is centered around how a family deals with tragedy and loss in the context of being an immigrant family in the u s","10":" so my experiment of creating a 5 star reads shelf on this site so i could get some book recommendations based on the books i love the best has paid off big time this was one of my reecommendations and it's the best book i've read in a long time it is such an easy engrossing read i just fell in love with the characters and could have lived in their world for even longer than the 500 pages of the book but it has a lot to say on a lot of really heavy topics as well family love loss the immigrant experience finding yourself and your place in the world also it's funny and the characters talk like real people talk i just loved it","11":" from the first pages of this novel i was drawn into the circle of family and friends of the eapen family i bonded with the characters who are all so realistic i felt their joy their hope their despair their anger what mother couldn't connect to the lament of dimple's sanji auntie a wedding without family might as well have a zoo without animals with great tenderness mira wrote of the experience of immigrants who make the commitment to move with their families to other nations and the families that are left behind her writing is so luminous i have been craving appam sambar chutney and dahl since and want to experience the beauty of new mexico i loved the comment in the author's note my interest was with the intersection of the indian' narrative and what it means to be an immigrant to make a life in a stolen country","12":"what a wonderful booki would recommend this book without reservation i loved it story line characters plot and resolution this story has it all","13":"this book was hard to put down it is a beautiful story filled with love laughter regret and sorrow","14":"i really enjoyed this book there are so many good reviews that express everything i felt so i recommend reading them but just to summarize a bit very much the indian american experience with such complex loving characters one thing i didn't see mentioned is that two of the female characters the mother from india and kamala wound up having very similar characteristics is this nature or nurture","15":"i loved this book for now i'll just leave it at that this book really has a lot to offer though but as i just finished i'm too emotional to say more definitely recommend","16":"beautiful writing and an engrossing story i could hardly put it down and was so sad when i was done i just didn't want to be finished with it i loved it so much","17":" i received the sleepwalker's guide to dancing as part of a goodreads giveaway nearing 30 and quietly going about life as a wedding photographer in seattle amina eapen is summoned home to new mexico by her mother who is worried about her father who seems to be having conversations with no one in particular upon her return ami finds herself faced with people and often tragic memories that have defined her adolescence and young adulthood as she struggles to deal with new family crises the book is told in several sections alternating between ami's adolescence in the late 1970s and early 1980s and her adulthood in the late 1990s ami's life has been a difficult one despite the presence of two loving parents and material comfort as the reader we relive these difficult moments through ami's eyes as well as the more mundane events that define a teenager's existence as an adult ami must relive them herself while dealing with the consequences they have wrought years later it's hard to describe why exactly i found it so engaging but nonetheless the intertwined narratives kept me reading down to the final sentence","18":"a good family story kept my interest throughout","19":"just wow beautifully written and gripping story","20":" i listened to the audiobook version of the book and i must say that i really didn't know what to expect i still don't know what the title has to do with the book i found difficult listening to the part where the characters were in india as there was such anger and frustration but as soon as i moved beyond that i became engrossed in the story a story about immigrants about following tradition about the struggle of integration about a parent's love for their child about tragedy about spirits about facing adversity and about grief i highly recommend this book which made me laugh out loud many times and that's not an easy feat i liked it so much that i bought a hard copy for my partner to read","21":"i wanted more i want to know what happens now","22":"traveling through decades and across continents the sleepwalker's guide to dancing is more than just the tale of amina eapen and her family it is an immersion into different cultures both indian and american and an exploration of the truest nature of love loss and resilience jacob's book has a deep heart and an edge of magic to it","23":"as i read this book i became sure that it was one of those first novels that draw on the author's own experiences and was contemplated and rewritten for years in the afterward the author confirms this saying it had been 10 years in the writing the characters and the depiction of asian indian family life in the us are so real that they made me feel i'd been for an extended visit i also loved the writing which was both graceful and insightful amina the main character was born in the us to parents who emigrated from india so that her father could be a brain surgeon family life for amina includes her own ill matched parents and older brother her father's mother and brother still in india as well as two other indian emigrant couples that are de facto family in america though not blood relatives dimple the daughter of one of these couples is amina's cousin and best friend the book shows how amina's personality and choices were shaped by family events during her teens and twenties and focuses on how amina negotiates between the demands of career and family as a 30 year old there are 'sleepwalkers' of different types in the book but amina is the figurative sleepwalker who needs to learn how to dance","24":"i have a feeling i'll be thinking about this book for while it really got to me a great story about life and loss and love and family very good","25":"beautiful first novel wonderfully written great characters a delight to read","26":"3 5 stars and i would love to see a movie version of this book life is rarely straight forward and often complex and amina's life is turned even more upside down and backwards in a manner of weeks she returns home to find out what might be wrong with her father and seems both surprised and not surprised by what unfolds from there there are so many layers in this story adolescence immigration family relationships career longing and regret etc i wanted more felt like there was more to be told not necessarily after the ending","27":"excellent first novel about an family from india who live in new mexico would make a great movie funny poignant and beautifully written","28":"i'm learning that beautifully written family sagas are some of my favorites this is just that a heartbreaking yet at times sweet story that captures a true realistic family dynamic where all the characters feel like real people you could know this 500 some page book went so quickly i want more even after everything the story put me through that's a five star read for me","29":" don't read the goodreads description of this book because it's not entirely accurate this is a story about a family who emigrates from india to new mexico as told through the eyes of daughter amina the narration alternates between past and present as the family's story is revealed the problem with reading this on my nook is that it'd take me forever to find the quote i forgot to write down without spoiling the book i'll just say that in a story well told there are many things for people to relate to whether it's the immigrant experience indian families career troubles or family crises","30":"very satisfying read wonderful characters and an interesting story","31":"boring the dialogue was run on and repetitive i was waiting for something to happen and it never built up to anything even the epilogue was boring and it just didn't go anywhere sounded to me like a dysfunctional family of every day life amina was a shallow character who didn't know herself very well very disappointing","32":"i received this book through a goodreads giveaway i can't say enough good things about it i literally read the entire book in one sitting the characters came alive off of the page i liked the way the book came together through flashbacks of the past it could have made it a difficult read but the author blended the past and present together seamlessly","33":"debut novel story of an family told through the eyes of the only daughter story moves back and forth from india 1970s to new mexico 1980s to seattle 1990s the indian traditions made the story extra interesting love the debut novel","34":" this book spoke to me on several levels i thought it would be interesting to read about a family of immigrants from india what i didn't expect was to find that many of the family dynamics were the same that existed between my irish immigrant parents and their american children but beyond this aspect of the novel there is a story of a family and how they react to and handle some of life's toughest moments i loved this family and i felt very moved by the story i can't wait to see what mira jacob writes next","35":"what a perfect book to get when it didn't matter if i stayed up to the wee hours this is jacob's first novel but i loved this story of an indian family that moved to n m while the story moves back and forth from the past to the present jacob weaves you into her indian family with all it's love crankiness grief rituals and personalities cultural expectations and difficulties etc tall order that jacob met and i finished last night and am already missing amina the central story teller read it tell your friends and don't plan to get a lot done till you have put it down it is over 500 pages of lovely writing so if you are traveling get it on your kindle says the bossy lady reviewer","36":"although i expected more of a ghost story i enjoyed reading this and was quite sad when the book came to an end i caught myself thinking about the characters and almost wondering how they were all getting on after i'd finished the book like old friends i hadn't heard from in a while quite bizarre","37":"this story of an indian immigrant family begins in india in 1979 then moves to the us new mexico and seattle but location is almost incidental this saga of family dysfunction and tragedy is pretty universal jacob does a superb job of crafting dialogue her characters are totally believable and it's easy to drop oneself into the conversation to the extent that it matters that the characters are indian she captures nuances of dialect and dialogue patterns that are amusing without making fun that lightens a story that sometimes gets a bit intense on the negative side though this book is way too long and the plot isn't quite tight enough there's lots of detail here that doesn't move the story along even if it is interesting and that makes the book ramble a good read but one that use some editorial work rating 3 5","38":"spellbinding book from page one i just fell in love with this family from india to new mexico to washington state the author has a clever way of dealing with a very serious and sad situation by interjecting humor via the family interactions love to see what miss jacobs writes next brilliant","39":"i gave this book 4 stars the story of an indian doctor and his family who emigrate to new mexico the book bounces back and forth in time and place exploring the family's complex relationships and choices the daughter amina a photographer is central to the action and a sympathetic character in her struggles to be faithful to but separate from her family and to make her way professionally and personally","40":"a different read","41":"not your typical dysfunctional family indian americans set in albuquerque seattle some india this book and its characters grew on me and there was room 500 pp and i was glad it wasnt all that tidy at the end i loved how the family relationships developed","42":"i enjoyed this story i read it for book club it was a good book but i didn't find it to be a page turner","43":"quite good it reminds me me of works by jhumpa lahiri since it is the story of a young woman born in the united states of indian parents characters are very believable i felt for them all","44":"one of my favorite books in a long time","45":"this book was fantastic the writing is really beautiful","46":" when i first started the book i didn't feel i was going to like it i often struggle with books where the characters are from other cultures that are so alien to my own and i find i have a problem relating to those characters i'm left feeling more like a voyeur than someone enveloped in the story and a part of the people in the tale but this book touched me in so many ways having lost a sister when we were both teenagers and having many regrets and many things that were left unsaid this book made me think and feel like few others ever have additionally what thomas went through and how his family reacted deeply moved and touched me i've rarely been so deeply affected by a book i've just finished this and i'm sure i could give a better review with more time to absorb all of it but the fact is that the review i would leave them would be more clinical and i believe that this book deserves a raw emotional review read it i think you will find that various parts of it will have meaning for you or remind you of pieces of your own life in a way perhaps you've never really looked at head on deeply impressed and as stated deeply moved by this book now i will go and do chores and let it wind it's way around my head for a while","47":" the past is beautiful and also has the power to be vicious for it to rear its ugly head and not let go till the demons have been put to rest as a reader i see this theme occurring again and again in books i think that one cannot ignore it in any art form the past is a strong element of nature that will not be ignored at all and it will be repeated again and again just as it plays a central and vociferous role in mira jacob's book \"the sleepwalker's guide to dancing\" \"the sleepwalker's guide to dancing\" is a story of a dysfunctional family of old ties of relationships that cannot be forgotten and which honestly is nothing new in the world of literature what is new though is the way it is said the narration is so strong that it made me feel that i was reading a book of a different nature and plot as it happens in all family stories - this one also has a lot of grandeur a lot of mess a lot of fleeting and unsaid emotions and a lot of past present and future that tangles itself and slowly unravels the plot at the heart of this book is the eapen family the novel opens in seattle where amina eapen gets a call from her mother kamala in albuquerque saying that something is wrong with her surgeon father thomas who is now talking to family members who are no longer alive this is where amina flies down to check on her father and the story begins - back and forth between india and america and new mexico and the eapen family's secrets and despair and love and longing are unravelled chapter by chapter there is a lot happening in the book and maybe that is what makes it so special also not to forget that it keeps coming back to the core of the plot the family is just like any other family and yet it is not what it seems as you turn the pages you are stunned by the language the tenderness and harshness of prose at the same time the starkness and as a reader i was only happy that it was a big read and not cut down every character has his or her part etched beautifully no one is out of place from amina dealing with her issues and identity looming large to her brother akhil who is struggling with his own demons there is also a lot of humour infused in the book - dry as it may be but it definitely helps the reader get through the complex parts jacob in a very tragic comic manner talks of an indian family in america and their past linked to their future the journey from india to america in search of a better life and the consequences of it are described in great detailed and told with great empathy the book is honest and that is most needed out of any book there are no frills or pretensions around it there is a lot of food in it as well there is a lot of drama there is a lot of love and there are sentences and dialogues which are stunning and will leave you begging for more","48":"mira jacob's writing is exquisite i savored every written word in the book the characters will stay with me for a long time and i'll keep wondering what kamala is growing in her garden and what she will be cooking today in her kitchen i will also wonder if the couch is back in the family room i will not just wonder but expect to run into amina and jamie in seattle a stunning story told with love and care do read","49":" i'll admit i picked this book because my inner malayalee begged me too i should always listen to her mira jacob created a story about immigrants from kerala india their children and how they all navigate life together her style is conversational and engaging and her characters so so familiar to me she even nailed the subtle way all parental conversations somehow end with a plea to get married malayalee ness aside the story is touching and this book is a very quick read i really enjoyed it","50":"in the sleepwalker's guide to dancing a novel by mira jacob we meet the eapen family who left india in search of a better life we meet them at three crucial junctures in their lives each one revealing the pull of \"home \" the need of each person to seek their own identify and the tensions in the family relationships this book seeks to cover a lot of ground in its over 500 pages read my complete review at http www memoriesfrombooks com 2014 reviewed for librarything early reviewers program","51":" i received this book as part of the goodreads giveaway author program when i signed up for a copy i remember reading the description and thinking the book sounded interesting and i enjoy reading books by new authors mira jacobs is a talented author and wove a remarkable story about a multigenerational family who immigrate from india to settle in albuquerque new mexico in 1968 the story plays out over a thirty year period of time dealing with the eapen family who are forced to come to terms with painful family memories of times spent in india the horrific loss of a teenage son and the terminal illness of the father i look forward to reading more books by the author","52":"the weaving if the story kept me interested a mystery while dealing with family life and death enjoyed reading but took me a moment to recall so no real stick to the characters","53":"oh what a beautiful story this has instantly secured a spot on my all time favorite books list written so beautifully and with such different but all so lovable characters this family's story has so many heartbreaking details and oh how you fall in love with them this is definitely a book you want to sit down and read when you have a while there was a bit of the book where i'd read a few pages here and there at work but i think you get so much more out of it by setting aside time to really dive into it i loved it absolutely loved it","54":"a lot of good in this book but it's way too long for how little story there is great on characters not great on plot would read her next one if it looked good","55":"it just wasn't that much of a page turner for me personally","56":" wow thanks for the recommendation katie this was a great book i had a bit of trouble starting this book sometimes fiction is too close to truth but once i was swept into the story there was no question except what's going to happen next from the goodreads synopsis now twenty years later in the heat of a new mexican summer thomas father u0026amp surgeon has begun having bizarre conversations with his dead relatives and it's up to daughter amina a photographer in the midst of her own career crisis to figure out what is really going on","57":" previous experience with the goodreads first reads giveaway program has taught me that it is often best to keep my expectations lowered upon receipt of a new book and at just over five hundred pages long it was hard not to feel daunted by the sheer scale of the task of reading this novel when it arrived through the post however after breezing through the first few chapters it appeared that mira jacob's debut novel was going to prove me wrong on multiple counts the story succeeds incredibly well where i've found other lengthier novels have failed the plot carries you forward at a comfortable pace skipping backwards and forwards in time without feeling clunky or confusing neither lingering too long nor hastily skipping ahead at no point was i overcome with the need to skim or completely skip drawn out paragraphs of overly detailed description or dialogue and i had no need to go back and re read sections out of confusion or lack of clarity most importantly the characters are intriguing charming and simply likable enough to want to accompany them through the 500 pages of the novel and still feel sorry to see them go at the final page i rarely award 5 stars for books too picky but it was so much of a pleasure to read the story of amina and her weird charming heartbreaking family that i wouldn't hesitate in rating this novel as one of my new favourites","58":"a beautiful depiction of what it means to live through tragedy","59":"i did not care about anyone in this book i know each in their own way were trying to find their way in the united states whether born here or not carrying the baggage of their parents and family i did not find anything believable about any of these characters although well written it was too long","60":"a moving funny and wholly believable family saga loved the indian aunties and uncles with their wonderfully comic malaprops found the conversations between the protagonist adult daughter and her parents convincingly maddening admired the way the novel was put together between past and present charming and sweet","61":"beautifully developed human characters intriguing storyline humor joy and sadness 4 5 if it could be leaves you literally hungry as well as hungry for more story truly enjoyed this","62":"this book started a bit slow but became more engrossing as i got farther into it amina is dealing with her own job as a wedding photographer when she finds out her father is having auditory and visual hallucinations so she must go check on him the book goes back and forth between amina's childhood teenage years and adult life while also showcasing the dilemma of generations of familial guilt and duty","63":" this was an interesting story of a family's process assimilating to american life while dealing with a parent's worst tragedy the story moves around within a twenty year time period and i had a hard time with the time shifting i wish there could have been less of it as i think the constant shifting took something away from the character development two points were made painfully clear in this story one is that a parent never really recovers from the loss of a child it's not the natural order and the death of a child will forever haunt the parent the second point that was made quite clear is that it is more important in life to tell people what is going on with you than it is to just put on a mask and pretend the story illustrates so keenly what happens when people sweep feelings and concerns under the rug customs and family rules often get in the way of genuine communication and that is unfortunate","64":"this is an enjoyable read that sparks the emotion tied to culture and family the eapen family emigrate from india to the us the different way in which generations assimilate to new cultures is evident the author depicts the struggle around communication and acceptance of these generational differences through the events that occur when crisis rears its head that struggle peaks but what comes through loud and clear is that family endures beyond circumstances that try to break them apart","65":"i know i truly like a book when i think about it when i'm not reading it sometimes i'll look forward to the evening after dinner when i know it'll be time to sit down and pick it back up this was one of those books for me","66":"amazing and beautiful story of love and family and loss i didn't want this to end","67":"perfect loved it","68":"this is the best book i've read this summer i couldn't put it down and when i did i kept thinking about it jacob writes a beautiful emotional story punctuated by reality","69":"i dare you not to cry at least twice terrific book with wonderful characters","70":"4 5http www goodbookfairy com the slee","71":"incredibly beautiful i laughed wept felt it all it will stay with me and be one of my favorites of all time","72":"really good beautifully written","73":"heart breaking beautifully written funny i loved this debut novel by mira jacob and definitely recommend it to others yes it is a bit long however it's one that you'll find yourself becoming immersed in there aren't any slow parts or 'useless' parts instead i was engaged throughout as i came closer to reaching the end i had an idea of what would happen but i wanted the story to continue the main character amina is wonderful her mother is a strong willed woman who don't tell her reminds me of my own mother in ways i wish her aunt sanji were my aunt i wish i knew someone named dimple and on and on i could go the characters are flawed yet lovable they are impossible to relate to at times but despite that they're still relatable and oh so human i'm not much of a crier but this book did cause me to tear up more than once and it's one i keep thinking about since finishing it i look forward to reading more from mira jacob and will say that this is one novel i may actually read more than once this is a rare thing indeed read it side note she did an interview on the podcast a few things with claire and erica that is worth a listen their podcast is what led me to this book and for that i am grateful","74":"good relatable read though just another domestic drama really","75":" o k maybe a 4 5 but i loved this book it is a very entertaining read the author strikes the perfect balance between humor and tragedy cultural appreciation and deprecation function and disfunction her characters are likeable in a realistic and flawed way and her storytelling weaving in and out of past and present is top notch even though it is a longer read it never seemed that way because mira jacob is able to keep the story moving along so well i listened to the audio version which jacob reads herself i am not always a fan of when an author reads her own text on an audio book but i can see why jacob chose to do this so she could perfectly control the tone and accents of the narrator and characters brilliant job","76":"when i first started reading this book i thought it was ya and i wasn't sure i would finish it as it turned out it is right up my alley another family that puts the fun in dysfunctional lol on the whole however i liked all the cross cultural inclusions and that made it a good read for me this is a family with education and background who has immigrated to the united states amina's father is a respected neurosurgeon but it doesn't mean that they have an easy time adjusting to the us or that they don't receive the taunts and criticisms of their schoolmates and experience the utter shame of being different at first amina comes off as a lightweight but as you get to know her and her history you gain respect for her vision and her intuitive insights reflected in her art photography the mother kamala has some of the best lines in the book as she mangles idiom after idiom in the worst most serious moment she will crack you up i liked the way the doctor's cancer and his choices were handled i didn't like the impromptu wedding which brought me back to the ya ness of the book on the other hand it may be a book that was written to be a movie and the wedding will be fun and colorful even if a distraction i'm glad i read the book but i doubt i will remember much of it a year from now","77":" mira jacob's novel should be included in the many top ten books of 2014 lists that it isn't really surprises me it is wonderful magical i had trouble putting this one down critics have compared it to jumpha lahiri's man booker short listed novel the lowland it has similar themes family torn between india and a new home in america however mira's novel has more levity and humour and allows us to really grow to love the characters her writing is image provoking the reader can almost see and feel the settings she describes it definitely makes my own top ten books of 2014 list and very near the top","78":"i really enjoyed this book however i was left with the feeling that i wanted further resolution of a few of the subplots","79":"simply gorgeous","80":"there is so much going on in this novel on so many levels and it can't be pigeon holed into being just another immigrant's story i love that the central characters are allowed such a wide range of thoughts feelings and expressions beyond their ethnicity yet some of the best humor comes in the form of recognizable linguistic and cultural trappings for anyone who has spent any time with indian families at the heart of the story is the fraility of human life and our struggles to make sense of it and to try to take control of things we can have no control over every character bears witness to similar events from a different perspective each one with its own validity in the end these kaleidascopic views zoom in to clear focus life happens richly with complexity we are all on a journey that is sometimes shared and sometimes taken quite alone funny bittersweet heart wrenching at times but you can't look away","81":"a very well written story of a dysfunctional family living in a foreign country it's two parts circle of life and one part guilt","82":"enjoyed this book tremendously i think my favorite books follow families through generations her writing is beautiful and the characters are likable yet complex illnesses teenage angst dramatic accidental deaths difficult family relationships and great writing all the things that make a book exciting","83":"i'm not exactly sure how i feel about this book i loved the writing style of it the characters were deep i listened to it u0026amp loved how the author 'read' each character the storyline was interesting u0026amp the dynamics of the family were good however i think i was left wanting more of a wrap up or more explanation of some things that had happened it was dark but good","84":"the thunderstorm at 4 30 am solidified my inability to sleep so i folded laundry and continued reading this book i just finished you know i like it if i let it keep me up all night","85":"one of the finest books i have read in a long time and i have been reading a lot lately","86":" a warm tale about an indian family's life in america and how family events have shaped their relationships i wanted a light hearted read after the last book i read and remembered this one sitting on my shelf i had been avoiding it because of the strange title and unappealing cover art but found myself in amina's head and living right along with her throughout the book the author seamlessly manages to provide flashbacks to the 80's during amina's childhood and returns to her present late 90's with an ease that makes you feel like you're reminiscing your own past i really didn't want to put this book down once i began reading it i found myself laughing crying and aching right along with the characters in the book i appreciated the cultural indian values and how amina growing up american learns to accept her parents' ways while not always agreeing with them kamala amina's mother will remind you a bit of your own while you're reading this no matter who you are jacob manages to paint the perfect picture of a nagging loving mother who wants the best for her family some turns of events in this book will shock you but leave you wanting more i thought i was getting into a light hearted read but it was so much more meaningful than that","87":"thank you carol for letting me know about this mesmerizing book by a new author who skillfully wove a tale of east indian culture with native indian undertones highlighting a loveable heroine captivating dialogue and a compelling story that had me laughing and crying as a reader who could ask for more","88":" the story begins years ago when the family returned to india to visit the relatives the book switches back and forth between the present when the daughter now grown visits her childhood home and her aging parents in arizona to her home and career in seattle and her childhood memories with her brother at first i felt no interest in reading about the inner life of a 30 something who was single and looking for love and connection but the story is well written and i must be a sucker for learning about indian culture some of my favorite books are about indians both immigrants and in india in this story the mother is always cooking indian food in her suburban kitchen endlessly it is a vivid portrayal of a different culture their values and ways of being what it is like to be an outsider in america and i found myself caring about all of the characters in the book","89":"this was a goodreads first reads giveaway book it had parts where i had to keep reading well done","90":" it's not that i thought this book was poorly written it wasn't the story was at times touching and poignant but i couldn't get over the emotional unhealthiness of the characters they were so brutal to the ones that they loved i kept being startled by the crazy interactions and although i am sure that there are lots of people out there who are just as emotionally unhealthy as the principals in this story reading about them is not something i do for pleasure it felt more like watching a train wreck in slow motion on the upside the indian culture was written beautifully and richly into the novel and i was hungry constantly because of the excellent descriptions of amazing indian food","91":" i've been around people and in fact am married to one who live in transposed cultures their families have moved to a new country but of course bring their own cultural backgrounds with them the challenges never recede amina is in her 30s and is a professional photographer her parents emigrated from india to the u s after her brother akhil was born when amina gets a phone call from her mother to say that her father a highly respected neurosurgeon is talking to his dead mother amina reluctantly takes a few days off work to go down and see if there really is a problem and thus enfolds a wonderful story full of memories and humour and pathos","92":"1 2 a beautifully written story of family nuclear and extended friendship love and loss mira jacob's debut novel is at once heartbreaking and humorous poignant playful and deeply profound i really liked this a lot and look forward to reading more from this talented author","93":"loved this actually liked it more because i listened to it pronunciations of indian words names etc made the story even better","94":"i knew by the second chapter that i would adore this book and be sad to reach the end mira jacob surprised and delighted me greatly especially knowing this was her debut novel i'm not sure if it's the fact i was also raised by immigrant parents and how endearing many of her anecdotes and dialogue exchanges were or the beauty of her plain but beautiful use of words but i felt connected to her writing this was a very enjoyable read for me","95":"beautiful sad funny life affirming i enjoyed this novel immensely the family feels familiar to me as the daughter of an immigrant jacob does a stellar job of structuring her novel and jumping between eras in the lives of amina and her family there's a lot of tragedy and suspense leading to it yet this book doesn't feel heavy or depressing there is sadness in family histories but there is also happiness in family and the specific ways in which they function","96":" this book is to be savored it's the kind of novel where the only thing that prevents you from being sad about being closer to the end every time you turn the page is that you're totally wrapped up in the narrative although it deals with dark themes honestly it's also a book that's overwhelmingly optimistic and cheerful and funny a reminder to embrace life's beauty even or especially in situations when it's easiest to ignore by the time you finish it you feel like you've made a friend who's made you a better person you also start getting slightly jealous of all the people who haven't yet discovered it and are soon going to have the experience of reading it for the first time","97":"just wow loved this book","98":"my lord that was such a good book never in my life would i have picked this book if it wasn't for the fact that i was trying to find a book for book club and i'm so glad that i did i don't think you would regret reading it","99":"i'm giving it 3 stars because she's a really good writer i was really enjoying it but about page 150 i suddenly hit a wall enough already with the teenage angst for me it just bogged down and i couldn't force myself to continue","100":"amina is called home to new mexico when her mother decides that there is something wrong with amina's father in a series of flashbacks amina relives her childhood and the various family hardships and tragedies while trying to come to terms with the fact that her father is probably dying also a long and rambling story","101":"good book and probably deserves more than a three but can't do the 1 2 markings overall just ok","102":"i loved this book rich and lovable characters made me think of the value of the modern extended family and how much i want that for my kids","103":"got halfway through and the interest i'd had through the first 100 pages had waned too much relived teenage angst and not enough plot","104":"the writing was rough but the story was compelling enough that i avidly read to the end","105":"amina a wedding photographer living on her own gets a call from her mother who is worried because amina's father spends his nights out in the yard talking to dead relatives amina travels home and has to not only deal with what's happening with her father but needs to finally come to terms with the the death of her brother as does the rest of her family this was a quirky and different book with characters and a story that really grew on me enjoyable book","106":"this is one of the most beautiful stories i have ever read this book is easily one of my top 5 favorite books and any review i write will not do it justice just go ahead and read it","107":"man i loved this book i can't think of the last time a story drew me in so immediately and completely i fell in love on the first page the sleepwalker's guide to dancing is a big book about family and loss and otherness but it feels as tight and sharp as a short story i'm stunned that this rich rewarding vivid novel is mira jacob's first i can't wait to see what she does next","108":"library hardcover","109":"i liked this more than i expected i would esp given my recent string of dnf adult literature but maybe because of the coming of age elements mixed with the immigrant family or something that drew me in i founs myself wanting to keep reading definitely pensive moody and a little sad but intriguing too","110":"loved i can't believe this is jacobs first novel again i dig stories about the human condition and this one deals with loss in such an emotional way i enjoyed the stories being told in parallel and actually enjoyed how it all came together at the end even though it felt a little too tidy","111":"this is one of the best books i've read in a long time it spoke to me on so many levels it's a story about identity family and community it's about the interplay of individuality and the connections that bind sometimes even after death it's a huge book but the chapters flow easily i will be thinking about this one for a while to come","112":"solid 4 5 stars for this beautiful and emotional story while it started a little slow i soon was entranced by jacob's meticulous prose and the characters that she so lovingly created a heartbreaking family tale flashing between decades 80s and 90s and locales south india seattle and finally albuquerque as the story falls into place downgraded just a tad because i felt that the end was a little slapdash and other parts of the book could have been edited e g almost all of amina's life in seattle with her boss etc only other criticism was the awkward conversations and very little chemistry between the two love interests however this got better as the story progressed","113":"outstandingincredibly entertaining hilarious while remaining respectful endearing characters relatable to the reader's own family doesn't everyone have a sanji a fine first novel","114":"slightly long but enjoyable i love books about 1st 2nd generation americans","115":"good writing but i thought it ended a bit abrubtly after 400 some pages","116":"wow incredible story of the indian immigrant experience a beautifully crafted and beautifully written first novel which i loved","117":"i'm almost embarrassed to admit that i've had this book on my shelf for a year and i bought a second copy anyway i should've read it sooner this is another book that i picked up because of the title though i'm still figuring out it's meaning this long tale of a family and all it's secrets a thirty something still trying to find her way and figure out who she is in relation to her parents and her own self is a great story jacob does a great job in weaving in the family culture as part of the story and illustrating who they are in so many diverse books the culture becomes the central character rather than the background amina deals with not only the loss of her brother and impending loss of her father but also all of the rules and customs that make it not acceptable to talk about it all i read the first half of the book in a rare day that i found some quiet hours then was wrestling to find the time to finish the rest over the next week or so in my writing group we've been talking about the proper length for a debut novel this comes in at 498 pages way above any recommended length which proves that you can break the rules when you make it worth it","118":" i loved the entire experience of this novel the gorgeous picture on the cover the almost five hundred pages packed with shifting story lines jacob's use of language the themes first generation american life indian immigrant communities in random locales loss of a family member grieving parents being of two worlds how one choice can alter a life holding the heft of the novel in my hands it was clear the time creative energy and deep reflection that went into creating this engaging story i enjoyed this novel so much i started marking passages with post it notes so i could easily find them later and ruminate further over the language and ideas so much of this engaging story is thought provoking but it is also deeply real incredibly well composed and artful the story starts in seattle in june of 1998 amina eapen is busy working as a wedding photographer when she receives a phone call from her mother revealing that her father has been conversing with his dead mother who died twenty years before amina's mother doesn't believe he is delusional simply filled with weakness and devilish spirits the story shifts to india in 1979 amina is eleven her immediate family has journeyed to her father's former hometown to visit with his mother and brother they bring american trinkets for the extended family play cricket with their cousin and watch their grandmother's scheming and their uncle's bizarre night time behavior and then the visit is cut short this creates a rift in the family and amina's uncle's last words will soon be deeply prophetic the family interactions in this novel are deeply realistic at the center of the india drama is thomas eapen amina's father the brother who left and sunil the brother who stayed behind and feels like a failure ammachy their mother wants her first born son to return home and may be one of the few indian mothers not to kvell over a successful brain surgeon son she snaps \"well no one asked you to become a brain surgeon\" his choice to be a brain surgeon makes it impossible for him to work in india which creates a tension between him and his mother and him and his wife she's so caustic and particular and thus deeply authentic in the eyes of this reader she tells her granddaughter she must be clever since she's not pretty she calls one of her grandsons a no brains she meddles endlessly and she refuses to accept that her son's home is anywhere but the one she created for him she also disparages thomas's wife for being too dark back in seattle or the present day of the novel amina prepares to put her life on hold and return to new mexico to help her parents we learn all about her budding love affair with photography and the story behind the photograph that stalled her career as a budding photo journalist the novel shifts again to a time during amina's adolescence when her brother struggled with a unique medical malady the novel does an artful job of showing how even a family helmed by a doctor can ignore signs of serious illness i connected deeply to amina's experience of taking care of her father as he fights cancer jacobs who lost her own father writes about the experience of facing the perilous future so giftedly simple sentences resonate deeply for example \"it was getting harder not to spiral these days to hear one thing and think of the next and the next until all that was left was a closet of her father's sweaters and shoes\" 397 i was deeply moved by the scene that follows amina's father asks her how she knows when to take a picture and together they decide the reason he can't get a good photograph of his wife is that \"she's a pretty woman who makes ugly faces\" 398 i also greatly enjoyed amina's romantic story line she connects with a boy from her high school past - something that some would perceive as cliche but the relationship between jamie and amina is complicated and authentic it also made me consider my own parents relationship with a new sense of perspective they were high school sweethearts who reconnected in their thirties there were many occasions while reading that i stopped to linger over jacob's use of language for example \"they were luminous pieces of moon fallen from the sky still reflecting every bit of light from the known universe smiling at her across the yard in a way she hadn't seen in years may have never seen \" pg 449 or\"because really it didn't matter whether he was the by product of thomas's tumor or some filament of time slipped through a chink in the universe it didn't matter that kamala and the others could not would not would never see him the very idea that akhil could be in the garden had brought back his loss pushing it into every corner until the house bled with it if she shut her eyes amina could feel exactly how gone her brother was her ability to weigh his absence extra keen dialed up like a blind person's ability to hear \" pg 457 there is a rhythm to jacob's use of language that is uniquely her own the sleepwalker's guide to dancing is a tremendous feat it's a story that brings the reader inside its rich worlds to struggle and grieve and discover and fall in love with the eapens and their extended family it's a story that brings us inside the experiences of a loving community of suriyani christian indians it's a story that shows how adolescence can deeply shape us and mold our later choices it's a story that shows that even with deep sorrow there can be magic moments found amidst family","119":"this was a wonderfully strange story that i think was even better for me because i listened to the second half on audio i was getting tons of headaches so reading made them worse however i really wanted to move forward in the story so i got the audio version the audio was really great because the writer reads the story and adds character and an indian accent to the other characters especially the mother","120":"i learned a lot about indian the country customs esp the food great story about a family that immigrates from india to new mexico the family left behind in india is destroyed by a man w some kind of sleep disorder likewise the new american family is also afflicted the main character amina becomes a professional photographer her father thomas a brain surgeon starts having conversations w dead relatives kamala his wife alerts amina they find he has a brain tumor somewhat sad at times this book was also hopeful and humorous a fine 1st novel","121":"started out as a 4 stars probably ended with 3 5 stars enjoyed the family relationships hard to believe this was a debut novel just could have been edited down a bit more last 100 pages were a bit too long still a worthwhile read","122":"great first novel charactors well drawn held my interest through out","123":"beautiful debut novel read it","124":"such a beautifully written novel so vividly descriptive in such a fluid way i was hooked from the first chapter and couldn't put it down emotional and sweet a must read","125":"this was just one of those books that i couldn't put down it kept me up till all hours of the night and early morning i loved it the story combines so many different emotions that i was laughing one moment and tearing up the next a beautiful story of the very imperfect family unit so many of us are familiar with this story shows us how love and loyalty of family will always win out when the core of the family is genuine and respected no matter what the nationality a great read","126":"one of the best books i've read this year definitely one i'd read again","127":"i liked this book but for me it was a little long in spots i would have liked to hear more about the family's first few years in this country and why they left india in the first place","128":" and to think i almost sent this book back to the library without reading it before i'd only read 2 books about families of indian descent they were pretty dark and depressing i was hesitant about another story based in india this however was not that story it was amazing it is rare that a book can make me laugh out loud and cry it moved me on so many ways thinking about family and friends and friends that we make a family with it's just a moving and touching novel that i am so glad i took the time to read","129":"little long at times but wonderful and descriptive writing","130":"the title the sleepwalker's guide to dancing immediately caught my eye as unusual and intriguing it piqued my curiosity and once done satisfied my love of a good story i was very happy to receive this as goodreads giveaway mira jacob's debut novel will be available july 1 2014 it'll be worth waiting for from the opening paragraph to the ending my interest never lagged actually my interest in all things i was supposed to be doing lagged never my interest in the story mira does a great job beginning the story near the end and in a series of flashbacks which alternate with current time brings us up to date she has created characters who are warm appealing irksome contradictory - pretty much like most families i found much of the humor based in the immigrant theme of the narrative the tension between the first and second generations the mangled grammar and lack of understanding about american culture are always a minefield - could be funny could be tragic and sometimes its both knowing some indian immigrants it was easy to hear the accent see the headwagging smell the fabulous dishes this is a very sensual story in that respect the eapen family is the center of the story and is surrounded by friends who are also from india they settled in albuquerque where their daughter amina and son akhil attend a private school dr thomas eapen experiences a health crisis late in his career and that is the starting point of the narrative from there the layers are peeled back to reveal all that transpired prior to the latest crisis this book will appeal to anyone who loves a good story with compelling characters and it's nice to see another story of an albuquerque family after the tale of walter white breaking bad","131":"wonderful i've loved it so much i just couldn't stop reading it","132":"i won this book through reading with robin @robinkall and adored it","133":"this was very well written it's the story of a woman born in the us of indian parents whose close but stressful family has strong ties to their culture and origins the book goes back and forth between the main character's growing up and the difficult events she went through and the current period when she is facing the current crisis in her family as well as recovering from her own depression","134":"maybe 1 5 i really wanted to like this book but about 1 2 way through i went to speed reading for just the parts i was curious about","135":"i'm going with 4 stars because i did really enjoy reading it and it's tough for me to find fiction that i really enjoy i've become so particular with fiction these days i appreciated the well drawn characters and the interactions between them it wasn't a story with a big plot but that doesn't bother me if it is well written which it was my only complaints are that i wasn't satisfied with the ending and also it has only been a few days since i finished reading it and i finding it difficult to even remember enough to comment on it i like a book to be a little more memorable","136":" one of the best books i have read in recent times an intricately woven plot that has a sad undercurrent but can be beautiful and humorous in turns it's based off seattle and salem tamilnadu which made it extra special though it didn't turn into one of those immigrant books the immigrant part was just a very small part of a much bigger story the narrative was brilliant and engrossing and i couldn't wait to get back to it every night the characters were well developed and deep rooted it's believable that the author molded them from people in everyday life how the author portrays immigrant families coming together to form a closer bond than they would ever have with their own relatives is very true all the characters never strayed from who they really were from beginning to end and each one of them had ample time and some brilliant writing to back it up to form their home in the readers hearts for a long time to come i could sense a little bit of 'kristin hannah' style in mira's writing but to compare the two authors is not in the least bit fair this being a debut novel hats off to the author looking forward to more of her work","137":"i really loved this book the insight in to the children of immigrants family relationships and tragedy highly recommend","138":"there was a lot to like about this book it's really a lovely story but i just didn't love it quite enough to give it a 4","139":"why i decided to read it this book actually popped up as a \"you may also like\" book during one of my searches on my library's website yay library i don't know how i missed this one last year it was named one of the best books of 2014 by the boston globe kirkus reviews and the millions among others what it's about broadly speaking this book is about the lives of an indian american family father mother son daughter the book spans decades and continents from one of their visits back to the father's family compound in salem india in 1979 to their lives in albuquerque and seattle in 1998 this family saga is about drawing on the powers of love and hope to get through and ultimately overcome unspeakable tragedies and hardships the latest challenge that the family must face thomas the patriarch and a celebrated neurosurgeon has been spending sleepless nights on the porch carrying on lengthy and in depth conversations with his mother the problem his mother has been dead for years rating 4 5 5this is the best book i've read so far this year and i'm kind of shocked that it didn't get more hype or for that matter more awards last year it's a debut novel so i don't think it was widely read which is a shame it's a damn good book the book is largely about how tragic events stay with and continue to affect people years after they occur in retrospect it's pretty amazing to me that the overall tenor of the book is not super depressing because the book covers a lot of really sad and terrible events but the tone of the book is very hopeful jacob deftly shows how different personalities react to the same event with acceptance stubborn denial purposeful resilience willful ignorance anger an outpouring of affection caretaking etc and how families absorb and accept and shape themselves around those differing reactions the characters are vividly realized unique and full of personality jacob is a great writer \"amina's eyes filled with tears it was a distinctly feminine humiliation the kind daughters close to their fathers go to great pains to avoid as betraying of their fragility as a stain on the back of a skirt \" and is especially skilled with dialogue the conversations between first generation kamala with her slightly flubbed idiomatic expressions and overbearing let's get you married attitude and her american born daughter amina with her generally exasperated tone and small amount of patience for kamala's earnestness serve as quippy highlights of their cultural and generational differences despite its length the book never seems long winded or slow in fact if anything the conclusion seems slightly rushed the circuitous storyline despite jumping from decade to decade and event to event wraps up powerfully i really enjoyed this book you should add it to your tbr list immediately this is an excerpt of my full review which you can read here https iknowwhatyoushouldread wordpr","140":"i didn't know what this novel was about but picked it up because i'd seen it on several lists of great novels of 2014 i was swept up in this well crafted beautifully written layered story i read in the acknowledgements that it took mira jacobs 10 years to write this novel and i am glad she spent the time because the result is wonderful the sleepwalker's guide to dancing is a well wrought novel about a young indian american photographer amina living in seattle who goes home to albuquerque to check on concerns about her father the novel weaves through time sharing amina's family's rich history as the story unfolds revealing layer upon breathtaking layer the novel is funny but also sad deep but also compulsively readable it was a quick very enjoyable read","141":"decent storytelling albeit depressing undertones really if you're going to write a slightly depressing book revolving around a family from india that's about pretty much nothing your name should be jhumpa lahiri","142":"there were several unexpected doors that the writer blew open i liked wandering into the kitchens of a different culture and being made to feel at home it was interesting to look at the workings of a family under different difficult circumstances and see the dynamics working","143":" i registered a book at bookcrossing com http www bookcrossing com journal 13078790a family story amina is at the center of the story but it involves several members of her indian american family and it involves sleep disorders it is a huge book but written lightly so it is easy to read it has been several months since i read it and i no longer remember details only that amina travels to her family home encounters uncles and brothers and various other quirky relatives and considers staying if just for a little while we follow her through her adult life journey to a point when she has absorbed what she needed to absorb","144":"i really liked this book nice to see a glimpse into the lives of an indian family who immigrated to the u s i want to try all the food they talked about","145":"cover

well written i felt that the haunting appearance of past family member's needed to be either made into something more or left out altogether","147":"a surprisingly engaging and touching story of one family's lives spanning several decades this story is filled with love loss and lots of food an excellent beach vacation read but can be a bit of a tearjerker so if like me you're likely to be reading this on a plane consider yourself warned","148":"couldn't put the book down the book contained fantastic humour and also the the awareness of everyday family life was definitely worth reading the book","149":"i loved this book i'm so happy i happen to come across it at the library i have a feeling this book and the characters will be on my mind for quite some time","150":"hard to put down story of indian immigrant family's tragedies successes and hopes","151":"this book started out strong for me but i felt like it just became progressively more depressing and by the end i was racing to finish it so it would be over","152":"indian american family story","153":"good story of immigrant family from india lots of tragedies but some humor too enjoyed it","154":" i liked the characters settings and the way the book was constructed jumping back and forth in town that so many of the characters are immigrants are indian is an important aspect of the novel but not as much as the unique aspects that comprise each one they felt authentic to me and i could connect to each one i loved jacob's writing and often found myself re reading sentences and saying them out loud i did expect a little something different at the end it could be my own experiences and thoughts about talking to the dead interfered or that the book's summary led me to believe there would be a different sense of resolution a number of people wrote in their reviews that it was too long perhaps because i was in a kindle version that didn't have page numbers i did not feel that i enjoyed the reading and was always glad there was more to come i agree with the reviewer who commented that the romance was a bit contrived but that wasn't any kind of obstacle for me overall i really liked the book and consider it a great summer read it leaves me wanting to read more literary fiction and not jump back into my constant genre of mystery suspense","155":"beautifully written story of love death and the strength of family i recommend","156":" i know it is only january albeit the bitter end but i am sure this book will end up being one of my favorites of 2015 reading it reminded me of why i am drawn to debut novels there is an earnestness and completeness about them that seems somehow different from an author's subsequent efforts amina was the common thread throughout the book but she was also somewhat on the periphery or behind the camera not in the frame of most of the action whether it was her brother's illness and relationship her cousin's job or relationships personal and familial her father's illness or her parents' marriage amina was more an observer along for the ride than a participant and yet her role and involvement was a critical factor in moving the story along i loved the characters in this novel and the way mira jacob linked them all together and i really enjoyed how she wove in the different perspectives of a multi generational immigrant family including the cloudiness between actual family and adopted family that happens when you live far from home the characters are indian and some aspects of the story were unique to that perspective but the overall theme and tone was more universal mira jacob did a masterful job drawing me in to the indian culture without making me feel like i had to be indian to understand the issues and challenges they faced or the feelings they experienced","157":" if you want to sit down with an intertwining immigrant family's saga here it is this encompasses a family of several generations including those who appear from the dead although they are mirages or perhaps ghosts or perhaps spirits the parents and their generation are strong on work ethic with the father gone all day as a brain surgeon and the mother cooking typically the mother is always pushing her to marry an person of indian background the main heroine is amina who has moved away from home and culture to be a serious photographer but ends up earning a living from wedding photography she has a best friend domino and her parents have dominos parents as best friends when amina's father appears to be losing it amina goes home and trys to determine what is happening to her father's psyche is it medical or psychological all the characters become closer and bonded as the father fails concomitantly amina falls in love with a man she has known since before her brother now dead dated the man's sister","158":" this was an interesting book it's about an indian family that moves to the united states early in the marriage the father is a doctor the mother is a funny indian lady that is a great cook the book goes back and forth between decades and locations the son grows up to be a good enough kid smokes a little dope attends high school and ends up with an illness that causes extended periods of sleep finally diagnosed as narcolepsy the daughter is quiet loves photography and attends the same high school as her brother there is language in the book that i don't use and find kind of offensive although i know it's part of the kids vocabulary i have mixed emotions about this book the book is well written no doubt about that i could never figure out the reason for the title maybe there wasn't one it's not a happy feel good book it moved slowly for me the first half then picked up a lot the later part i was sad at the end not that it ended but how it ended but i was pretty sure that it would end the way it did it's a thought provoking book one that i don't think i will read again","159":"so glad i received an advance copy of this book to read i put it off for a while because it seemed rather long however once i started reading it i became involved with the characters and hated that the book had to end mira jacob is an excellent writer providing an engaging story of middle class immigrants from india at times her dysfunctional characters were frustrating yet she inspired me to care about them i look forward to more great stories from ms jacob","160":"i didn't fall in love fast or realized i had until it was over the first half was slow and the second half overwhelmed and i now think that was somehow on purpose but i can't yet work out why this book is about life and it's about death and then life again and then death again and back to life etc etc etc but in a good way 4 5 stars","161":"fantastic book loved it","162":"it has taken me a very long time to write this review it also took me a long time to finish this book i am so conflicted about how i feel about this novel the beginning of the novel was stellar i was completely absorbed in story of amina's family and their visit back home to india i wanted to know more about their life and time there unfortunately that section of the book was very brief most of the book focused on the eapen family life in america here is where i felt it lagged the most detailed descriptions were of the food they ate and i found myself wanting to try indian food what i didn't crave was the bland details of amina's current life as an adult the supernatural elements of the story were interesting to me and ultimately saved this book from getting a 2 star rating the last 75 100 pages were very heartwarming and beautiful in the end i would give this 3 5 stars","163":"the middle was great but it was sandwiched by meah it took me 100 pages to get into this book and then the ending fell flat i loved it when i was enjoying it but i kind of felt slighted at the end","164":"i enjoyed this book not overly familiar with the indian culture i learned quite a bit about customs foods etc the main characters were very realistic and their conflicts were too the book left me with lots to think about and overall i found it to be a well written novel","165":"loved the albuquerque setting entertaining read with intriguing supernatural elements","166":"this review has been hidden because it contains spoilers to view it click here at first i didn't really think i was going to like this book the whole flip flopping between years really isn't my thing so first we have thomas and his family kamela his wife then ahkil his son and amena the daughter he moves the family from india to america when ahkil and amena go to high school 20 years later in seattle amena has settled into this adult life that has her still trying to launch a career away from her parents whom live in a different state yet still in america anyways at first i didn't really think i was going to like this book the whole flip flopping between years really isn't my thing so first we have thomas and his family kamela his wife then ahkil his son and amena the daughter he moves the family from india to america when ahkil and amena go to high school 20 years later in seattle amena has settled into this adult life that has her still trying to launch a career away from her parents whom live in a different state yet still in america anyways i honestly feel bad for amena see the thing is she is a photographer that really doesn't have much going on until the day she takes this candid picture of an important man jumping off a bridge boom suicide caught on camera her picture becomes famous but as her fame rises so does her guilt for having taken that one picture at the same time kamela amena's mother calls her to come home because her father is acting strange i felt bad when ahkil died in that terrible accident and i also feel bad that her father has no one else to blame but himself it's sad to think that him being a doctor could not see that his son was ill and needed his attention until it was too late but also i don't think he is much to blame ahkil is the one that did not want to listen as any teen would amena tried to make amends for her father i'm sorry that her father got ill too and although he was going through treatment and feeling better he opted to stop because the hallucinations were now gone and ultimately met his demise as well i think i would've done the same in that respect poor kamela had to endure so much loss but through it all she was there for her family i'm glad that at the end amena had someone to share her life with someone to love her and be there for her i think that in the end amena got the forgiveness she looked for in her brother when she got to see him too i think that she wanted so bad to believe that he was actually visiting them that she made it real in her father she felt that she betrayed him in a few turns but that that betrayal was necessary to ease her guilt i like that also she learned to accept things and just go with the flow i know this book was long and a little confusing at the beginning but i am very glad that i got to experience it it touched my soul and made me see things from other peoples perspective more","167":"beautiful book about families and how they deal with tragedy amina's family is also managing what it means to be a first generation american and the collective loneliness and isolation that brings i almost let this expire on my nook before reading so glad i didn't","168":" this was a book i read on my kindle a couple of months ago about a syrian christian family dealing with tragedy and loss the protagonist tells the story of her parents and brother hopping locales from new mexico to kerala while trying to untangle the knots their lives are made up of i started the book not expecting much more than the typical diaspora story with the usual dose of alienation sundered bonds cultural and generational chasms peppered with slightly trite anecdotes of weird aunties friends and awkward dinner parties it did have some of those but it also had characters i ached to understand and a story that had enough plot developments to keep me engrossed and then i got to the end and bawled my heart out and tweeted the pain to mira jacob heh if you want a quick easy yet engrossing read give it a try","169":"wonderful book so glad i read it at first try though i was overwhelmed by the number of characters and the 'bossiness' of so many of them and then i got it i lived like this once i am not from the southwest i am not indian american but i grew up in a large family filled with a lot of very opinionated somewhat bossy a type personalities the type where a little disagreement would set off a whole lot of contention also where the quieter people in the family had to sometimes 'hide' in books crossword puzzles or just the cellar in order to simply breathe yeah i got it some people like to control others other people like to be left the heck alone but i did like the book despite all that the characters are so alive so well written and the storyline though familiar had its own feel even among the boisterous arguing and shouting and the constant reminders of food as comfort as contribution there was a sense of love regardless of how achingly delivered i rooted for the mc even as she slipped and fell and tried to make her way through a slew of people who always seemed to know better than her they usually didn't btw there was also sadness as well as many moments that made me laugh out loud and caused my daughter to say what are you reading no spoilers here just a review that tries to give a taste or flavor of a really really great book i hope she writes another i received a copy of this book through the goodreads giveaway program","170":"i read this book in about a day and a half which is significant given that it's 500 pages i am also pretty sure that i looked like a lunatic reading it due to the range of emotions it put me through jacob's prose is magnetic and beautiful and completely real each chapter makes you feel like you've just had a very down to earth conversation with your wittiest friend you know that kind of tangible engaging conversation you don't ever want to stop having this is the book you want to read this summer i kind of want to hear the audio version so i can know how the author interprets it but the story jacob paints in my head is so satisfying i just want to let it linger in my own voice too what a dilemma get this book right now","171":"there were parts of this book i thought were perfect and there were parts that dragged for me i expect that if had known more about the indian culture i would have enjoyed some of those draggy parts a lot more in hindsight i would have familiarized myself with indian food before starting this book so that i could have gotten through the food sections more quickly that having been said there was a love and understanding of human emotion in this book that made it delightful to read","172":"i expected this novel move perhaps it's title that disillusioned me although some of the characters are rich some are half heart and it leaves the story two dimensional i'm craving indian food and an actual end to the story","173":" this has been on my to read list forever i'm glad i finally got around to it it is the story of a family from india now living in new mexico told through the eyes of the family's daughter it spans time from the late 1970's when she is a teenager to the late 1990's when she is a professional photographer is seattle amina is called home because something is wrong with her father a surgeon he is seeing and talking to family members that have been long dead we follow the family as it confronts several tragedies i found the book heart breaking at times and very funny quite often the book starts slow i almost put it down but glad i pushed through it also took me a little while to gain an ear for the names of the characters which sounded similar to me in the beginning the audio version is excellent because the reader does very convincing characters with both american and indian accents i'm not sure i would have enjoyed the book as much without hearing the lilt of the indian accent in amina'a parents and family audio version excellent","174":" audiobook amina a young wedding photographer living in seattle returns to her childhood home in allbuquerque when her mother explains that her father is having conversations with his mother that died in a tragic house fire in india the dialogue and tone of this novel is superb and the plot is thrilling i haven't read a book so perfectly pitched half laugh out loud hilarious and the other half tender and heartbreaking this novel has something for everyone and shot up to my top ten a novel about family comparable to white teeth freedom and the god of small things the audiobook is read by the author and is wonderful","175":"this was a very character driven story with witty dialogue and struggle through transition love and loss as a family it had interesting parallels between everything i never told you from celeste ng that i also read this year if you enjoyed that book i think you'll like this even better while the story had a similar arc the characters are lovable and relatable and honestly just pop right off the page plus there is a lot of cooking and good indian food you will be hungry","176":"i am not sure why this book is receiving so many glowing reviews it is a story about an indian family dealing with an ailing father and still suffering from the death of their oldest son the writing is sophomoric and on the level of a high school student the storyline is kind of silly with the father talking to ghosts the characters are wooden and one dimensional","177":"incredible it took me a while to get through this book which usually frustrates me but in this case i felt such a nerd to chew and swallow and properly digest every beautiful heart wrenching honest moment","178":"this is an absolutely fabulous read the author captures india and its people in sight sound and smell you can feel the family bonds whether they be genetic family of familiar relationships from similar backgrounds this book is like ectoplasm it moves and shapes itself around the people an events there are lots of quotes that i could use and so much in this book that appealed but my favourite is there are some blessings tiny ones that come unbid and make a hard day one sigh lighter as a first novel this shows remarkable talent i cannot wait for more from this author","179":"4 1 2 stars beautiful haunting lyrical loved it","180":"i read about this via sarah mccarry's blog and i'm so glad i did it was a relief to come back to this book and take little sips of its world the subject matter is not soothing but the feeling that i was part of the world in the story was","181":"lovely and enjoyable though not perfect the characters were complicated and their relationships messy wrapped up maybe a bit too neatly while some pieces were left a little vague but some sections of prose were so beautiful i read them multiple times","182":"i loved this this is a perfect epic family drama the story is great the dialogue is believable the characters are complex but likeable the writing is pretty straight forward and readable the voices of the characters are what make it special it's long but in a really good way i wanted to stay with the characters through it all","183":"uncomfortable but compellingi couldn't stop reading even though it was tough at times experiencing the challenging lives of the immigrants portrayed in this book funny mystical thought provoking worth the read","184":"i won a copy of this book through a first reads giveaway there aren't a lot of books that i enthusiastically recommend to my friends and family but this is one i will encourage everyone to read mira jacob's beautiful prose is simply not to be missed so much of the novel is enjoyable from the atmospheric settings to the wild cast of characters the highlight for me is the protagonist amina i think readers will connect with her and the struggles she faces over the course of the novel beyond the characters readers will find relatable themes in family struggles the loss of loved ones and growing pains for all of it's tragic moments the sleepwalker's guide to dancing also has plenty of lightheartedness it's an engaging novel that will stay with readers long after they've finished the last page","185":"that was a 4 so beautifully written i enjoyed the crazy family dynamic the seattle albuquerque settings flashback style great book club pick by holly can't wait to discuss","186":"interesting read loved the immigrant perspective","187":"i received this book for free through goodreads first reads beautiful beautiful book i sincerely feel honored to read it before anyone else is able to pick it up at the bookstore it's moving and funny and so full i love these people like my own it feels strange to even call them characters","188":"i really savored this book such richly drawn characters intricate layers and so much heart i loved amina and everyone in her life also i'm a sucker for father daughter shit and that's a big theme here well also just parent child more generally the only thing keeping me from giving 5 stars there are a few moments that are a little too rom com ish for my liking but it hardly matters the rest of the story more than makes up for it","189":"i found the writing and narrative in this book tedious and not highly developed the dialogue and character relationships were simplistic and juvenile","190":"i love stories that span decades that show a character's development over time and that leave you feeling positive about the character's future at the end i read this book one sick day it was a satisfying read","191":"fantastic story looking at family relationships expectations as well as the values and beliefs of different cultures the characters are believable and easy to connect with and the plot is interesting sometimes funny and other times heartbreaking i highly recommend","192":" a lovely lyrical debut novel jacob moves seamlessly through the years and across the globe from seattle and new mexico in the 1990s to new mexico in the 1980s and india in the 1970s it's a beautiful portrait of a family and how they cope with tragedy written in vibrant colorful prose jacob's themes are infinitely relatable her characters are depressed they wallow they are deeply unhappy and yet they love they laugh they eat they see the beauty in a puking bridesmaid or the grandmother at the reception who has passed out from too much to drink they try as best they can with what they've got they learn to move on to become richer from their wealth of trying experiences to let their wounds heal they may be scarred but aren't we all i should add that jacob has a particularly deft hand with her descriptions of food and the artistic process which i really appreciated i highly recommend you add this to your summer reading list","193":"slow start but ended up being a really good book","194":" i finished reading the sleepwalker's guide to dancing several days ago and i've been somewhat reticent to sit down and begin my review i want to be absolutely careful and clear with what i want to say here though i've always been reluctant to declare any book my favorite this may well be the closest i've ever been to throwing down that gauntlet as i read it and in the days following i felt myself on the very verge of dubbing it so click to read my review of the sleepwalker's guide to dancing at abacus moonwala reads books www abacusmoonwala org","195":"this was easily the best book i have read this year it is a fantastic debut that i devoured in one day the story is deep layered and relatable what i really loved was the character development and the feeling that i almost knew some of the characters i laughed and cried this is one i'm sad is over i will anxiously await her next work","196":"it took me a little while to get into it but i ended up loving it","197":"an interesting take on how loss affects a family also interesting take on immigrant families in the us","198":"a superb book to read while visiting relatives in india so much of it rings true to someone who has never lived in india but is a half british indian","199":"thanks to goodreads first reads i received a free copy there is really quite a lot going on in this book a very ambitious effort for a debut author the story didn't take hold for me until page 200 nothing about it drew me back into it after setting it aside for a time but then it finally got more interesting i'm just very sorry it took its sweet time doing so i probably would have given it 2 stars but for some of the decriptions of the characters' feelings of grief and how love can grow in the midst of it all that was its salvation","200":"from the very beginning it was like a magic carpet ride of scenery a tapestry of family loved every word","201":"it's all in the family they are part of your past present u0026amp future the connections bind us all u0026amp this tale weaves different relationships through several decades sad funny poignant u0026amp sometimes absurd it's a well written novel","202":"this is the best book i've read all year why isn't everyone talking about this book the characters are totally relatable and the family dialogue is funny and realistic it reminds you of why family is so special at the same time they are driving you nuts will definitely have a book hangover after this one","203":" mira jacobs examines family tensions exacerbated by diaspora in this narrative of the eapen family emigrees from south india a prologue establishes the present day timeline june 1998 it is a literary snapshot providing the reader with a glimpse of their tenuous dynamic one that's conscious formal safe prescribed and emotionally repressed and one that's explosive and brutally candid to be expressed only under the guise of abnormality sleepwalking or mental aberration amina lives in seattle rather than returning to the family homestead in albuquerque she is unmarried despite countless blind dates set up by her mother without her permission and not much of a cook \"a collection of takeout boxes slumped together like old men in bad weather\" in her refrigerator p 5 still she remains connected to a sense of ethnic identity her best friend is dimple another indian from albuquerque they went to school together and they are so close they refer to each other as cousins dimple's parents are like an extended family to her own kamala is almost a parody of the ethnic mother in addition to her obsession with marrying off her daughter to another indian she devotes herself to cooking biryani pickles chutneys breads stews and dips flow from her kitchen the radio tv and tabloid headlines appear to be her main connection to the world outside her kitchen she supplements this with her own outrageous opinions voiced with a tenacious dismissal of opposing arguments jacob exploits this with often humorous results the third character we view is her husband thomas a neurosurgeon who keeps late hours and chooses to spend his time isolated on the porch tinkering with whimsical inventions and succumbing to the soporific comfort of alcohol the question jacob appears to be addressing is how did this family become this way the opening chapter provides a partial answer the time jumps back to 1979 amina is 11 her older brother akhil is 14 the family makes a disastrous visit to thomas' mother and his younger brother in india his mother ammachy is hardly loving instead we view a tyrannical matriarch unhappy at her inability to control events for her the past was wonderful everything afterward was downhill beginning with the urban sprawl that now surrounds her house she is angry that thomas rejected the marriage she had arranged with kamala's lighter skinned in her eyes more desirable cousin she wants him to return to practice in india and attempts to manipulate him into accepting a position at the newly established rehabilitation center for her dutiful son sonil she has nothing but complaints and belittlement the situation explodes thomas and his family leave despite kamala's objections it's the last time he sees his mother and it leaves a permanent rift in his relationship to kamala after such a dramatic opening i was expecting the story to resume with amina's reluctant return to albuquerque in the prologue kamala had called complaining that thomas was talking to his dead mother she is able to guilt trip kamala without actually asking directly for her help however this thread is interrupted with the backstory of amina's career in photography she had been a successful photojournalist but has retreated into events photography -- weddings funerals graduations and the like book 3 makes another time jump it is three years after the disastrous visit to india amina is now 14 and akhil is 17 the focus switches to akhil's troubled adolescence along with the time jumps there will be shifts in points of view we follow amina's problems her adolescent observations of akhil and her observations both past and present of thomas unfortunately although jacob ties all of this together these pieces never coalesced for me into a satisfying whole it was as if jacob was trying to cover too much ground grief alienation vulnerability and the price of sacrificing duty for happiness all seem to compete for the reader's attention on the positive side jacob has created some memorable characters thomas was especially vivid with his outgoing exuberance off beat sense of humor and intensity the author mentions in an interview that this character was modeled after her own father who passed away during the course of writing the book kamala is irritating and humorous the author takes great pains to explain that the character is not modeled on her own mother individual sections such as the explosive family conflict in india were unexpectedly sad however at 500 pages i found this a difficult book to finish i purchased this book on an online flash sale i was particularly interested because of the albuquerque setting","204":" enjoyed mira jacob's debut novel sleepwalker's guide to dancing will have to think about the title a bit the writing is wonderful strong characterizations i had the advantage of hearing the author read from her book so perhaps i had the sound of her voice in the back of my mind but the tale of immigrant parents resonated with me from the endless aunties and uncles who are kind of related even if not by blood to the way that siblings are the only ones who sometimes can really share your personal experience sleepwalker's guide uses time and memory well at times i found myself frustrated with the emotional baggage that put a stranglehold on the main character's actions or lack thereof i'm not sure for me if some of the later parts of the book rang true but could be a sign of my investment in this family you really can only get annoyed if you actually care about the characters right overall a beautifully written and told story and enjoyable read","205":"good book confusing at times didn't like the ending it's like reading a tv show really","206":" an insightful multi generational family saga spanning from the 1970's into the 1990's when an indian family moves to america the children amina and akhil open themselves to this new world while their overbearing mother is intent on keeping rooted in established culture and tradition brain surgeon father thomas is working such long hours he seems oblivious to the familial cracks forming the movement between cultures ebbs and flows the author articulates the joys sorrows and challenges of this family very well","207":"the story slowly unfolded and captivated me i learned things about the indian american culture and cooking i really liked the amina character","208":"i already miss these characters i am waiting for her to write a new novel she has a beautiful voice","209":" i super struggled through the first 60 70 pages of this book then i fell in love with it and couldn't put it down the author created these characters that were so real flawed and great at the same time this is one of those books that you enjoy as you read you mark passages as you go and after it ends you find yourself thinking about how it had so many layers i also loved all the spaces where she let the reader interpret what happened someone at book group made the point gillian that it's truly written from amina's age perspective and it makes so much sense after thinking on it i would recommend this book with the caveat that you may not like part one but it's important to the story and it will get better so much to love here characters plot the realness can't believe this is a first novel","210":"this was a really good book however it wasn't the best time personally for me to read it still there were many places where i would re read sentences just to imprint them in my head a little more there are many great characters in here and most notably i find myself thinking about the story at other times when i'm not reading very good","211":"felt immersed into the shift between cultures generations locales felt as though i was part of the family suffered crushed expectations exhilarations anticipations loved the book","212":"there were so many things i loved about this book the characters were so alive the dialogue was strong the relationships between the characters were so well developed it was an excellent book for a first novel though not everything sat well with me i didn't enjoy the second half of the book as much as i loved the first i would highly recommend it","213":"i've had a difficult time lately remaining engaged by fiction books i loved this book it didn't grab me right away but that may be because i had to read the beginning in bits and pieces i loved the characters i loved the story has been a long time since i had a book i couldn't wait to sit down and read enjoyed this one","214":" while this book moved quickly with fast paced dialogue between the characters it could have easily been edited down to half its length the middle was a bit of a slog but picked up again towards the last third the style is reminiscent of jhumpa lahiri but darkly comic instead of the quiet tragedy that hangs over her works as an immigrant narrative the sleepwalker's guide to dancing is a good first novel jacob has a way of writing long scenes with a lot of dialogue that doesn't confuse the reader despite the 'fingers stained of turmeric' type of cliches in the prose i enjoyed the book overall","215":"sleepwalker's guide to dancingthis is the debut novel by mira jacob ms jacob narrates the story of the eapens a syrian christian family that moves to the us in the early eighties and settles in the small town of albuquerque the father is a neurosurgeon and is a well respected doctor his wife never really can leave her roots behind and is generally unhappy they have a close knit friend circle all from the subcontinent and are the 'family' the original family in kerala is strongly opposed to the elder son immigrating to the us and this reveals in a very strained relation between the doctor son and his mother who also is a retired doctor and is quite a strong willed woman the two children akhil and amina grow up in the us with all the contradicting emotions that children of first generation indians go through the story taes a serious turn when tragedy strikes the family the story moves between 1983 when this incident happens and 1998 when amina recalls all that has taken place through her childhood till the year 1998 the original plot is quite engaging as it deals with the various cross currents that run in a family especially when each one is dealing with grief in their own way the problem is with the sub plots of amina's photography exhibition her friend dimple's engagement and her own sudden romance these add nothing to the main story while making the narrative dull and repetitive ms jacob's use of the language is quite appealing and some situations are beautifully described i would like to give it two stars as the story just dragged on towards the end and i had to muster all my will power to read it till the end","216":"held me captive as if i was listening in on someone else's conversation so easy to visualize the characters","217":" excellent novel shedding light onto the tragedies and joys of an indian family living in the us taking the reader onto a journey into their world a very intimate world with problems and challenges that can occur everywhere i think the strength of this novel lies in the the unique way the author shows how sometimes we make decisions or take actions that may seem irrational to the outside world possibly crazy but inside the very private life of a family guided by traditions culture religion those actions make sense are acceptable are dealt with there is a clear message to the reader to sometimes just accept what is to make the best out of every moment to sacrifice own desires and needs for others so this is what it felt like to tell other people the truth it felt like shit its one of those books that's hard to put down well written with tons of humor and little pieces of wisdom that needed to be written sometimes a surprise was just the acknowledgement of something you had tried hard to ignore","218":"fascinating characters very well written listened in part to the audible version narrated by the author she nailed the accents added a whole new dimension to the book","219":" i love long books where the length feels justified and i love books that focus on a family the sleepwalker's guide to dancing a literary debut by mira jacob is both it's about amina eapen a first generation american and the large makeshift family she's formed among other indian immigrants in albuquerque the book alternates between different crises in amina's life one involving her older brother akhil and one involving her father as i said it's a longish book 500 pages and i loved the way jacob was able to offer a complete picture of amina's character and surroundings without ever letting the plot go stagnant--this is a surprisingly quick read for all it's length i didn't expect it but this novel is compelling and truthful without ever delving into the realm of the pretentious though honestly shortly after i started reading the sleepwalker's guide to dancing i felt that i'd made a terrible mistake the first 100 pages or so take place primarily in india and paint a portrait of the eapen family at their most dysfunctional most unhappy and most chaotic i'm all for stories about families--in fact they're some of my favorites however i honestly couldn't imagine spending 500 pages with a group of characters i didn't like and who didn't seem to like each other at all but though these initial scenes are important in setting up the story and its later conflicts i also don't think they are wholly representative of the eapens and the story mira jacob ultimately chooses to tell the majority of the book is about family and loss and grief what happened in india with the \"original sleepwalker\" at the beginning of the book comes to haunt the eapens as does akhil's sleepwalking and then eventually amina's father's though sometimes the themes of sleeping and dreaming that jacob introduced felt a bit fantastic i felt they were grounded by the emotion that amina and her family felt relating to each tragedy i don't want to lie and say the sleepwalker's guide to dancing is a fun joyous book it's not however i think the author has really captured the ins and outs of families in a way that any reader can recognize and identify with though the family situation back in india was genuinely awful the branch of eapens in the us is genuinely caring and well intentioned though not always the best at communicating or getting along i really really enjoyed that aspect of the text and how amina herself fit into her family and seemed to recognize the beauty in all the mess this book is perfect for people who like family dysfunction and immigrant stories and a compelling slice of life style narrative though it took mira jacob 10 years to write the sleepwalker's guide to dancing i do hope that her next novel comes out much sooner this was a very very strong novel and i was truly surprised by how much i enjoyed it considering my first impression reviews u0026amp more at respiring thoughts","220":"great book amazingly written such incredible well developed characters beautiful one reason for the four star was i thought it was just a tad too long dragged just a wee bit but do not let that stop you from reading gorgeous book","221":"a sprawling story much like india itself having visited tamil nadu in 2012 i felt connected to details","222":"i did enjoy this but for the length i would have liked more satisfaction","223":"there was nothing about this story that was not believable written so well you feel the sadness pain disappointment and happiness of each character i enjoyed being a part of these families for a few days","224":"this is one of the best books i have read all year there were a dozen different sentences passages that sent me mentally in search of a highlighter i loved the writing the characters and the stories loved it all","225":"more like 4 5 but the first 100 pages are difficult stay with wanting to continue reading had this not been a book club choice i would have given it up the major strength of this book is perspective the author's choice to use the daughter's vantage point as she becomes caught between the pulls of her own life and that of the responsibility of family is told with measured resentment","226":"i think this book would make an excellent movie as it played out that way in my head i loved the characters the examination of immigrant life the pull of family loyalties and obligations versus the need for independence and building one's own life it was also unexpectedly funny loved it","227":"i really enjoyed reading this one and i was sad when it ended","228":"this is a really lovely book the characters are strong and interesting there is a compelling plot line and pacing wonderful details of life in india and in the us i felt entrenched in the story and caring about what happened to everyone it's just wonderful","229":" i can't agree with other reviewers who thought this book was outstanding the main characters who span three generations are unhappy resentful and deeply angry with other family members and or the world in general there is no true communication among family members and everyone keeps saying they are fine fine fine when obviously they aren't in fact it got to the point that i was quite irritated by the author's gross overuse of fine as her go to adjective in my opinion the characters are extremely irritating and unlikeable especially since they do not learn or grow for over 400 pages i just wanted to grab them and say talk da #it and really listen the remaining 100 pages or so do contain character growth but by that time i just wanted the book to end speaking of which i found the ending contrived and not believable","230":"i loved this book i found the characters so engaging that a week after i finished it i was still thinking about them the scope of time and place that the novel covers is broad yet there is an intimacy to the reader's relationship with the characters that allows you to feel as if you should be able to call and check in with them to see how they are doing","231":"this book had so many good qualities it was moving interesting novel funny and had terrific characters which will be familiar to anyone with a family and family friends in other words everyone because they were simultaneously lovable and crazy making and completely nuts i wish there had been a little more of a tie in to the sleepwalking business that seemed to run in the family it felt like it was kind of left out there a bit but that's a quibble","232":"this is very different from the books i normally read i found a glimpse of an immigrant culture very different from my own fascinating it was a little hard to follow the jumps in time but they allowed the reader to get a sense of how the past formed the character of this family it made me laugh and cry","233":"i loved this book and probably would have given it five stars if i had read it all at once instead the first hundred or so pages we're read over a couple of weeks always right before bed when i was really tired as a result it took extra time for me to figure out the characters remembers names relationships ages etc i recommend reading this over a weekend or on vacation when you really have time to absorb it","234":"mira jacob understands texture layer by layer using a colorful palette she builds up her story as a collage moving back and forth through significant decades she brings the tribulations of establishing identity as an immigrant family in new mexico very different for each member of the eapen family to life as they move through pain alienation confusion and into love of place and one another","235":"the description over simplifies this beautiful book wept for the entire last 40 pages weirdly magical heart wrenching and one of those reads where i come up for air blinking and wondering where i am","236":"i loved this book the rich characters the sadness and the bonds","237":"it has been a long time since i have read a book that i did not want to put down i didn't want this book to end","238":"fantastic page turner mira jacob's ability to make the reader visualize the scenes is perfect","239":"beautiful voice could not put it down read this book","240":" i wasn't expecting it but the eaken family of mira jacob's the sleepwalkers guide to dancing had me captivated from the first chapter jabob's effortless prose set up amina and her family with snapshots of their lives in india and seattle before squaring in on the twists and turns of their lives in early 1980's and late 1990's new mexico the tragic death of amina's teenage brother intertwined with the deterioration of her brain surgeon father made for compelling family drama from start to finish","241":"i just love that the author rated this five stars truth it was really entertaining and fantastic","242":" i am grateful i won this book through goodread's giveaways program read this book it did not get near enough of the buzz it should have this year in a world full of gimmicky books and out there plots and writing styles which believe me i love as well just depends on my mood this book this book is just a big thick novel and something to get lost in no gimmicks just wonderfully formed characters lush writing a family saga all the stuff novels are made of i couldn't put it down what more is there to say","243":" well crafted narrative told through amina who was born in the us to southern indian parents the story like memories meanders from childhood to adulthood adolescence and back to construct a deep understanding of the complex relationships of the characters the power of the image whether captured through a camera the lens of the eye or simply as a manifestation of a hallucination is a theme that is seamlessly woven throughout the book ultimately this is a book about love regret grief and hope this is a book that is delightful to read but also leaves you impacted as a reader i hope this first time author has another book to share","244":"i could keep reading about this family for another 400 pages beautiful tragic touching and funny and so so much delicious indian food","245":"i loved the funny bits the best if this were a tv pilot i would predict a spinoff focused on the character of the mother kamala as always it is a treat to listen to a book read by the author","246":"amina's eyes filled with tears it was a distinctly feminine humiliation the kind daughters close to their fathers go to great pains to avoid as betraying of their fragility as a stain on the back of a skirt what was it about hospital beds that made everyone look like puppet versions of themselves she knew her father wasn't actually smaller than he'd been before the diagnosis yet in the bed his diminishing felt palpable like a sun setting without the beauty or relief because really it didn't matter whether he was the by product of thomas's tumor or some filament of time slipped through a chink in the universe it didn't matter that kamala and the others could not would not would never see him the very idea that akhil could be in the garden had brought back his loss pushing it into every corner until the house bled with it if she shut her eyes amina could feel exactly how gone her brother was her ability to weigh his absence extra keen dialed up like a blind person's ability to hear \"we are all we have here do you understand that is it and we can all talk about old times and campa cola and wouldn't it be nice if we could go back but none of us ever want to go back to what to who our own families can't even stand us for longer than a few days no we are home already like it or not \"","247":"i really enjoyed reading this book and learning about the culture in india even though the size of the book was daunting once i started reading i didn't want to put it down","248":"very scattered goes from one place to another in the middle of the chapter and no real ending","249":"i devoured this book in one sitting the poor german family next to me must have thought i was crazy sobbing one minute laughing out loud another it's an emotional rollercoaster loved every minute of it","250":"i made the commitment to finish this book because the author is from my hometown and the book takes place mostly in my hometown i think this book just needed to be edited like way down the book's length is far more expansive than the actual subject matter at least half of the book seems to be irrelevant dialogue taking place between characters in the kitchen and the last thirty percent of the book just becomes a soap opera things happen people scream and cry and fight and have sex and yet somehow the temperature remains tepid throughout by far the most interesting part of the book to me was actually one of the smallest amina in seattle the story of the indian settlement and the microsoft people etc here jacob shows off a talent that makes the rest of the book look like intellectual laziness on her part","251":"bookclub pick so can't write a review till later but my one sentence review everything you would want out of a multigenerational family epic and more","252":"slow to start","253":"i enjoyed this book it was long in places but mostly it kept my interest themes included importance of family and dealing with illness of a loved one i received the book for free through goodreads first reads","254":"at times difficult to read because of the sadness of the family relationships this is a very good book it is written well and was difficult to put down i highly recommend it although not at christmas time","255":"this book was ok i'm surprised i actually read all of it 500 pages","256":" this is the story of the eapens a family from india told mostly through the eyes of the 30 year old daughter amina a photojournalist who has turned to photographing weddings after her most successful photograph sends her into a spiral the novel shifts back and forth in time from 1979 83 to the present time 1998 in this case i found this an amazing debut funny heartbreaking all that good stuff but also a really good look at an immigrant family it's rare that i want to linger in a book world usually i want to move on to the next book in my pile but i felt a little sad when this story ended i'll miss this family","257":"i loved this book even though i'm not usually one for sprawling slightly meandering tales it's amazing that a book filled with heartache left me feeling full of love and hope it's structured a little differently but i seem to enjoy books that jump around in time","258":"this novel made me laugh out loud cry and ponder along with just being a great story i loved it i loved each character and all the stories it surprised me on the whole and in between i hope mira jacobs will write more books thanks goodreads for sending me an advanced copy","259":"it took a couple of chapters to get into it but once i did i didn't want to put it down very interesting story and the way it bounced back and forth between the past and present worked really well the characters were interesting and it was written so that you could basically hear their conversations while reading i was sad when i finished","260":"i couldn't put this book down hated for it to end","261":" it took me most of the book to realize it but i fell in love with amina's family her extended family in this country anyway with the way they yelled at each other and cooked for each other and circled the wagons when they had to and loved each other without ever letting go i miss them already not least of all for the way they reclaimed american sayings by using them incorrectly adding a plural here changing out the article there changing them just enough that they sounded right and wrong at the same time the final scenes with amina's father are some of my very favorite ones in the whole book they are simultaneously full of such sadness and joy and the end of the book amina's final look back is perfect a wonderful book","262":"one of my favorite books of the year a warm and vibrant book about the complexity of family and loss i really identified with amina the main character can't wait for the next novel from this author","263":" the sleepwalker's guide to dancing delivers a hilarious and moving story of three generations of an indian south asian family mira jacob delivers complex characters nuanced relationships and an engrossing story the book opens with amina eapen single professional photographer working on weddings and celebrations learns from her mother kamala that her brain surgeon father thomas has been acting strange thomas has apparently been seeing and speaking to dead family members and seems even more distracted than usual amina finds replacement photographers for her assignments and leaves her comfortable life for what she expected would be one week but as amina learns more details of her parents' changed behavior she finds that she's unable to return to her old job and life at least until things normalize her close family friend a k a cousin dimples is a go getter beautiful and works at an art gallery dimples is used to getting her way and has no qualms about taking advantage of amina but even in her most manipulative dimples is still a sympathetic character throughout the novel even the most difficult and temperamental characters are easy to sympathize with and to love mira jacob gives us a beautiful and sympathetic immigrant story from multiple points of view the perspective of the parents left behind in the homeland who long for their successful doctor son thomas to return and the resentful and overlooked younger brother who lives with the widowed mother in the family home the successful thomas who has decided to make a home in albuquerque with his indian wife kamala and their young children the brilliant children who adjust with differing degrees of success to their lives in their privileged part of america","264":"family dynamics always interesting flashing back and forth between present and past allows the story to unfold in nm","265":"a very well written book that could have been about anybody actually since it is about common human problems like family love and losing loved ones etc but the writer sets the story in a malayali christian family in new mexico and hence gets to write about many indian stereotypes the affectionate but meddlesome indian friends who are more like family the overbearing mother the clueless father the rebellious son daughter the token american white boyfriend girlfriend some scenes in india to say how dirty and noisy the place is etc in spite of all this the emotions felt largely real and the writing was good","266":"severe family dysfunction a rambling story which hardly kept my attention unhappiness just a messy pot of discomfort i simply didn't want to read about these people any more because i've been related to too many like them not my cup of chai i had to put it down","267":"3 5 stars was a good story to listen to the author is the narrator on audible great dialects and interesting isms make the characters come alive","268":"the story begins in 1998 with amina eapen a 30 year old professional photographer living in seattle when her mother calls with the news that amina's father has taken to spending his nights on the porch conversing with long dead relatives amina decides to make a trip back home to albuquerque to investigate and help from there the story shifts backward to her childhood and a pivotal family visit to relatives in india her parents' home country the inciting incident that sets in motion every family development to come centers around a destructive episode of sleepwalking by her father's brother as the narrative moves forward in time to her adolescence amina becomes aware that her own brother has extreme sleep issues as well then as an adult she has to grapple with her dad's problems is he experiencing dementia waking dreams or what she also questions her own life and whether she's been metaphorically sleepwalking through it i don't want to make it sound as if the book is all grim there are a lot of light hearted moments especially involving the amount and changing styles of cooking done by amina's mother","269":"my best ever bookshelf is small but this one could not be placed anywhere else i read it on audio and was so fully enamored and filled that i could not give it anything other than 5 stars do not read this book in print listen on your commute while cleaning or just sitting still and listening the author narrates this book with such passion that i cannot believe she did not receive a grammy award i know the characters' homes their psyches and motivations because the descriptions were so rich the mother's voice is perfect","270":"i really liked this family saga its portrayal of illness and grief was particularly strong","271":"heartwarming and heart wrenching all in the same beat i was enthralled with this family i couldn't stop reading their story","272":"2 5 it just feels like a quick and light read to me i don't know i'm not moved or anything i finished it really quickly and the story was fine but i think that i will forget about it very soon","273":"what a great book to start the new year with","274":"beautiful story of love loss and the things that make us real felt i knew the characters and didn't want it to end loved it","275":"listening to this story truly made all the characters come to life a great story funny sweet and sad","276":"i really enjoyed this book i can't exactly say why but it was very satisfying","277":"absolutely delightful audiobook charming fun deep culturally enlightening everything you want in a book it is read by the author who uses all the indian accents to help you really understand the characters and their comprehension of american culture it's the perfect balance of comedy and tragedy","278":"another story about indian families who came to the us the characters are quite wonderful and the plot is realistic this is an author i'd like to read more of","279":" while as a native american it is difficult for me to understand why someone could choose to live in a culture yet not adopt it this book provides a glimpse of understanding thomas the father and amina the protagonist contribute so much to society through brain surgery and photography that the bitterness of kamala the mother who still longs to return to her south india home can be tolerated no doubt becoming part of the melting pot is complex and often painful speaking of kitchen utensils an added bonus in this book is kamala's cooking so not only did i get a new appreciation of being an immigrant i am also ravenous","280":"could not put this one down yes it's another immigrant tale from india to new mexico with a side trip to hip seattle compelling characters confused like the rest of us dealing with some of the difficult issues we all must face in this short span we are given a must read","281":" i spent the first 425 pages wondering what compelled me to keep reading the narrator irritated me and the plot seemed excessive i still think 100 pages could be cut yet somehow i was pulled through the writing is spectacular riveting perfect and in the end i'm glad it held it together because the end was like nothing i'd ever read there's a difference between death and dying i've read a lot of books about death but rarely books that capture the full process of dying this was absolutely magical","282":"amazing beautiful story from the first page to the last page","283":" an astonishing debut novel that i couldn't stop reading listening to if you can get ahold of this in audio form do it the author reads it herself and the way she does the accents of the family is wonderful this book is funny and sad sarcastic and exuberant it's about being foreign in an adopted country which makes it a uniquely american tale it's also about the idiosyncratic nature of one's family how our love for them is tangled up with many other emotions and memories this was a welcome surprise that i'm glad i stumbled on","284":" \"there are small blessings tiny ones that come unbidden and make a hard day one sigh lighter \"good writing is one such blessing i ordered this book based on my mom's rave and spent a wonderful few days entranced by mira jacob's wonderful debut novel it's the rare book that continues to get better as it goes on but in this case i couldn't put the story down once i was into the second half the plot is nothing remarkably new amina is a thirty something who has to return home to deal with a sick parent of course her family is fractured with buried secrets tragedy and misunderstandings but on top of the predictable jacobs layers an indian immigrant's story then she goes a step further through amina's career as a photographer to highlight the ideas of isolation and belongingness without being overwrought or sappy she breathes life into this family and into her themes in a compelling way \"it wasn't that she doubted their love or intentions but the weight of that love would be no small thing \"i understood amina but more importantly i liked her and i adored all the surrounding characters especially her parents they start out as the typical stereotypes of overbearing mother and ambitious professional father but their stories evolve to become complex and emotionally touching \"why is it that fathers so often ensure the outcome they are trying to avoid is their need to dominate so much stronger than their instinct to protect did thomas know amina wondered as she watched him that he had just done the human equivalent of a lion sinking his teeth into his own cub \"amina's relationship with her parents held special resonance for me as they faced many quality of life decisions what is real what is right who controls the outcome all of these questions and more come to play in very honest ways bringing me to tears on several occasions across the board jacobs does a terrific job of fleshing out every character she introduces admirable given the fact that this novel stretches almost 500 pages three decades and two continents as the story comes to its beautiful ending i found myself completely satisfied highly recommend read alikes the lowlandthe namesakesister of my heartand the mountains echoedanatomy of a disappearance","285":"interesting story and the characters were brought to life with the dialogue the author did the audible recording and did a great job of the different voices especially the indian ones enjoyed this but it did drag on towards the end so maybe really 3 5","286":"nope this one's not happening for me i gave it a good go but i feel like i'm being asked to condone some seriously questionable behavior and i'm not comfortable with it nor is the story engrossing enough to excuse it","287":"excellent book amazing writing it's one of those books where the author pretty much tells you the end at the beginning of the book and you can't wait to hear how it all happened interesting insight in to indian ex pat culture","288":"a beautiful novel that i found to be near perfect please read it","289":"so very good i really loved this book the characters the stories the writing style very enjoyable i can see this as a good movie","290":"one of the best debut novels i've ever read","291":"the audio book was the best it was satisfying to hear the characters and their expressions this book is complex i would love to talk about it in a book club","292":"different from others i have recently read interesting insight to indian family culture in india and the us second book i have read recently dealing with choice at death other one is pretending to dance similar in some ways but also different recommend both","293":"the sleepwalkers guide to dancing is a vivid family saga that's told with humor pathos and a touch of romance it strikes every emotional chord imaginable love grief yearning regret dignity ... there's even an undercurrent of the supernatural in it i wish the book had included a directory of good dravidian indian restaurants with one close by the dishes described in the book sounded delicious i received this book for free through goodreads first reads program","294":" i liked this book and it was very well written but i didn't love it i'm trying to figure out why maybe it was because i felt like all the characters had so many issues as the story of amina's indian american family unfolds we learn of her parents' complicated relationship with their family in india and how that family history colors the future for decades to come each of the characters seemed to me to be shipwrecked on their own separate islands in shark infested waters they could see one another but they couldn't get to one another and they could only communicate through long distance sign language it was an interesting novel and i wanted to finish reading it to find out what would happen but it was certainly not an uplifting read","295":"an intriguing portrayal of an indian american family that will keep most readers wondering and pondering long after the last page is read i am sure about that i appreciated the humour interspersed throughout the at times truly tragic story as well as the empathy the author manages to evoke for each and everyone of her characters listening to the audiobook narrated by the author herself was a very special treat","296":"this is character driven compelling and thoroughly entrancing the writing was great and the family disfunction felt achingly real flawed but believable characters enhance this multi generational and cross continental family saga a great debut novel mrs p","297":"i have a list of books to read and am giving all books on the list at least a 50 page read i was not excited about reading this book for some reason but was so glad that i read it it was the best book i have read in a lot of time i took a writing class once and the teacher told us to reveal instead of tell mira jacob does a superior job weaving these revelations as the story unfolds well worth your time","298":"just finished the book and am wiping tears from my eyes the author writes a portrait of grief that is impressively palpable the last 50 pages of this book in particular were fantastic the only reason i am not giving it more than 3 stars is that the book is very lengthy with long stretches where it feels like nothing is really happening i feel like the whole book could have been about 200 pages shorter i considering quitting the book multiple times but decided to stick with it","299":"this is a review of an advanced reader's edition of this book which i received through the goodreads first reads program some initial hesitancy in the first chapter but i always get nervous when starting a new book especially a free one slowly i become a bit more interested and endeared towards amina and her mother as the next few chapters unfold i'm pulled into the drama of the sleep disordered men in this family enchanted by the varied layers of death and destruction that speak to beauty through art and pain through trauma adding to the mysterious elements of the book the compelling madness of the male characters sleepwalker's guide speaks to the stubborn nature of holding on to our own mortality by denying our faults weaknesses health issues even our strengths in pursuit of some recognition of a protected life family conflict supposed isolation in the world even though those around us want the best for us even when their ideas aren't similar to our own so often we don't know our own saving graces or even give people the chance to help us jacob excels at navigating between the decades and structuring the book so that the timing is just right to expose the story i think this helped accentuate the right parts shocking us in the best places devastating us and shocking only when it works just so we are a part of this family through the author's writing whether we like it or not and we celebrate laugh cry with them really i'd give this book 4 1 2 stars for what it's worth i liked what jamie smirkingly told their high school teacher that maybe it's best to just experience something and then think about it later i found myself doing that with this book and found the overall experience very pleasant","300":" this was an enjoyable read i thought it flowed really well and i even enjoyed the flipping back and forth through time i loved that it stuck with one character and through that character explored the others the characters are so well written too i don't think there's one character that i don't feel like i know other things i liked the dialogue isn't written phonetically as i've seen in other books to depict accents word choice and well written characters help the reader to form how they sound the many flavors of family explored born into made abandoned etc","301":" marriage children family extended family relationships dysfunctions special needs serious illness medical care religion parent child ren immigrants morality work job vocation these only touch the surface of this beautifully written first novel of mira jacob i found most of the book unsettling u0026amp dealing with messy stuff which most of us like to avoid but which must eventually be confronted if one is ever to find resolution u0026amp peace as a human being personally i found the ending somewhat abrupt u0026amp unsatisfying with many loose ends unresolved but then life is very much like that","302":"engaging book with a glimpse into a dysfunctional east indian family i listened to the audio book and can't imagine that it would be as good without the distinctive indian accents and intonations","303":"so good i even read the acknowledgments at the end because i didn't want it to be over","304":"the ending felt a little weak and the romantic subplot was an unexciting distraction from the family drama but on the whole this book was a fully absorbing portrait of a lovingly dysfunctional family it's long but very readable without sacrificing emotional depth","305":"i received an arc of this book in a goodreads giveaway and immediately began reading it the moment it arrived this is a beautifully written debut novel that is full of emotional ups and downs for an indian family and their haunting past the dialogue is smooth and the characters practically jump off the pages a touching tale that will stay with you long after you finish reading disclaimer i received a copy of this book in a first reads giveaway in exchange for an honest review this in no way affected my opinion of the book or the content disclosed in my review","306":"after reading this book i'm ready to get down with some serious indian food","307":" this is a tale of a family that has immigrated to the us in this case they are from india and they live in albuquerque nm which hooked me as i grew up there this book is lyrical and enchanting building a defined sense of the family their cooking the challenges in being first generation americans all while keeping the story based in something that many families experience at some point the loss of a child i would call it an ordinary people book in the sense that certainly the family drama genre is flooded with novels that touch in one way or another on survivor guilt marital discord loss depression death and dying but from a crowded field this book carves its own place and offers its own unique perspective that is imminently readable often poignant and also darkly funny it offers no major challenges it isn't literature but it was quite enjoyable and well written","308":"i received this book from a first reads giveaway i so wanted to love this book it had all of the checkpoints of an oh yeah abby's gonna love this book story spanning several decades check story follows a family and explores the relationships within that family check book jacket hints at supernatural magical undertones triple check what i ended up reading however was what i feel is a book that's couple hundred pages too long with a story full of people who were well developed but did not grow at all until the end while i won't give too much away of the story so as not to spoil it for anyone i will say that mira jacob is phenomenal with the written word the structure of the novel and the weaving in of different points of the eapen family history was great and sincerely refreshing one really gets a sense of the family dynamic from the very first chapter it is no surprise that they are so familiar to the reader so quickly being that it took jacob over ten years to finish writing the book it was very easy to see that these characters were very close to her heart the most frustrating part of this book was that no one really wanted any of their family members to know their true feelings i spent 400 pages reading about them telling each other they were fine only to have the last 100 zoom by at warp speed with feelings being unearthed and the family somewhat moving forward maybe that was done on purpose and other readers may have liked it but it just wasn't my cup of tea i will definitely be reading another of her books should she write more in the future","309":"one of the best books i've read this year","310":"this was fantastic a slow burning enthralling read the characters had depth and i really enjoyed the family friend and romantic relationships don't judge it by its title and cover it's way more interesting than they let on","311":"liked this and enjoyed the story and characters","312":"absolutely loved this novel read aloud by the author who's as talented a narrator as author","313":"really enjoyable i did not want to put it down the characters are really well developed the family relationships explored and developed from start to end of the book for me it was an extremely compelling read and i am not indian female or part of an immigrant family","314":" first i thought because it takes place in new mexico it was a native american family but it's an east indian family who immigrates it took me a bit to get into it but how this author ties things together culture stigma marriage family life is amazing and it has made me think about the book even after finishing i actually cried aloud at one point reading where thomas complains he has given his wife a nice home children et cet and what have i not give you he asks his wife and his wife replies myself but wow and the part where the daughter stops expecting people to understand and stopped expecting to feel normal amazing","315":"mira jacob does a nice job of storytelling her family's past and intervening it with present i thought this book was captivating especially the second half","316":"mesmerizing so many individual stories melding into one totally absorbing mystery the book is beautifully written i highly recommend this book","317":"almost abandoned at the start because the writing started off rather immature but it really warmed up and the characters were wonderfully developed i realized afterwards that she took 10 years to write this book and that shows in the evolution of her style it was engaging and touching","318":"this was a very powerful book i felt deeply the loss and longing that amina thomas and kamala struggled with throughout the book yet this wasn't a sad story there was hope and humor and awkwardness and beauty really enjoyable and something that will stay with me","319":" in her acknowledgments mira jacob comments that it took her ten years to complete he debut novel the sleepwalker's guide to dancing let's hope it does not take her that long to provide us with more of well crafted prose here she has given us characters who can be likeable and unlikeable often at the same time and a story that is universal in describing what a family can be the family is the eapens surgeon thomas his wife kamala who with their son akhil emigrated from india to new mexico some thirty years prior their daughter amina is born shortly after their arrival we also meet thomas' mother and brother in india and a variety of extended family in both countries through the first half of the book we see all the dysfunction that impacts this family mothers who attempt to manipulate their children fathers who concentrate on work at the expense of family teenagers who rebel against authority siblings who feel jealous and abandoned young adults who defy the traditions of their parents but as the story continues we see that with all the hurt heartache and regret there is a balance here we find acts of loyalty and respect of compassion and support of humor and joy there is love here and it binds this family together late in the story amina reflects that she found solace in the idea that some things could just fade gently away instead of be analyzed and rationalized and validated sometimes things could just get better that's how this book should be read don't get too hung up on the dysfunction cry when you have to laugh when you can relax and let the story happen hear the beat feel the rhythm enjoy the dance","320":"very well written novel about an indian american family spanning several decades i especially liked the seattle connection","321":"good book quick read interesting characters i enjoyed learning about the cultural dynamics of an indian family living in america the dysfunction within the family was interesting and well written","322":" i loved it i was reluctant to start reading it i was not impressed with the cover or the number of pages but once i started reading it i couldn't put it down i picked up the book from library because the author's name sounded like a 'malayali' name and i am glad i did i absolutely loved the story and the way in which it was written i can't believe this is the author's first book also i loved the malayalam words and the foods in the book one thing i had an issue with during the first part of the book was amina's name i thought the author didn't know that it was a muslim name but that got cleared up when amina pointed out that her parents gave her a muslim name i enjoyed reading this book i loved the relationships portrayed especially dad daughter","323":"a look at family what it means what brings brings it together and what can tear it apart featuring a stereotypical but delightfully aware of it indian family that immigrate from there home country to america funny sad and a little romantic","324":"3 5 stars it was really good started slow middle was fantastic ended slowly an enjoyable story with strong characterization that addresses assimilation across two generations within a family but there is not anything particularly new here and i wish the pacing would have been more even throughout the novel favorite quote there are small blessings tiny ones that come unbidden and make the hard day one sigh lighter first sentence it was a fever a hot rage of words","325":"this is a terrific book that brings to light all the messy beauty of living in a family i talked with author mira jacob about her work on this book which took her ten years to complete you can listen here http www bksandauthors com episode","326":" i received this as a first reads book and i'm so glad i did it tells the story of 3 cross cultural generations spanning from india to america characters range from the matriarch ammachy a traditional indian mother to her son thomas who moves to america with his wife to their two americanized children the women are strong characters who find strength and remain true to themselves through all of the struggles most of all the book is about family and their intricate relationships through challenges and happiness","327":" amina is a special event photographer living in 1998's seattle washington amina was a photojournalist but she seems to get too attached to photos that show too much real u0026amp raw in a human being images that others might not want to see she goes back to new mexico to check on her parents because something is wrong with her dad he spends nights talking seemingly to himself on the porch and he is a brain surgeon so if there is something wrong there is more at risk if he continues his work being home brings back hurtful memories for amina so the book also flashes back to her 1980s mesa high school days growing up with her brother u0026amp cousin one chapter of the book also takes place in india where amina's parents are from i did wish more of the book was spent in india it seems many people in amina's family have different harmful sleeping disorders the book is much better than i'm describing while reading this book i just think of all the color color color i thought i was imagining what new mexico looked like and searching for photos of the state this is exactly what i envision http d2dxvtbjf2drh cloudfront net w all those burnt orange mesas and super blue skies if new mexico itself isn't colorful enough then add lovely silk saris and imagine all those chutneys i wish i had a shelf in my fridge just for chutneys at least i was sipping some masala chai while reading also at certain points in the book it's the 1980s color enough there this book invents colors i adored this book amina u0026amp her entire family you just grow to care so much i love the idea that amina has an extended family that isn't really related to her just fellow immigrants from india that were invited over to the house one day and they all stuck together i'd love to think this happens for immigrants all of the time because it sounds much nicer than remaining so isolated in a new country it's almost difficult to imagine it was possible for amina's family to have this much support as at one point in the book the emotion of everyone almost became unbelievable which probably says more about my own family and what i'm accustomed to it was also unbelievable that with that much support they couldn't overcome certain challenges they say it's unlike anything else a grief so profound it can bring people closer to the dying than the living page 457 this might be a problem for both the characters and the book itself yes those no longer around are important to remember but i wanted to hear more from the laughter inspiring living i'd say the book's main theme is family no matter who you choose them to be or if they are still with you the entire time jacob has your heart in her hands both for the characters and this perfect and at times darkly hilarious writing style i was both tearing up and laughing at times i had no expectations from this new author and i was very surprised at how well written this is it's very fluid and detailed though i feel like the author's note did a better job at explaining one of the plot points than the story itself i would have liked to see more of that so i think some things could have been expanded the book wasn't long enough for me anyway even at 500 pages no spoilers but it was tough for me to see if some of this was magical realism or if i was supposed to take it as real but i usually have that problem i will definitely be keeping an eye out for mira jacob's other books if the first is this good i loved this much more than this year's pulitzer prize winner 'the goldfinch' by donna tartt if only a book like this could win but it doesn't need awards it stands on its own sleepwalking dancing feet i can't say enough about this one i'm very happy i caught this one","328":"as one reviewer on the back cover said it is a combination of time traveling multigenerational relationships photography and the ability to see things that may or may not be there definitely enjoyed it","329":"a good debut novel about family dynamics a 3 5 for me a little overlong and rambly but there are some poignant and eloquent observations about grief that will ring true if you have experienced the loss of a loved one especially an immediate family member","330":" in the sleepwalker's guide to dancing a family's painful past alternates with the present as they struggle with a developing crisis yes the following line is overused but well it's true i wanted to like this book as much as everyone else but i didn't the best thing about this book is that the family's dynamics are so genuine as awkward as the relationships become at times they are full of real emotions and highlight the various facets of the immigrant experience i especially enjoyed kamala's character the well meaning but overbearing and stubborn mother who is constantly spouting endearing indianisms my main problem with the book is that it is way too long and i often found myself bored with the excruciating details of the lives of these characters i don't feel like enough happened in between the first and last pages to justify the length of the book it was in need of editing to cut out some of the superfluousness i also found amina's romantic relationship kind of dry and contrived there was zero chemistry that i could discern so i couldn't buy into it others may enjoy this novel more and find it at once heartrending yet cozy and amusing especially those who lived through the '90s or who can relate to the immigrant experience for me in some ways it was charming but it also dragged it's not what i'd call a page turner","331":"this was an early review book it is one of those books where you say i'm just going to finish this chapter and 50 pages later you are still reading and i'm not really sure why it was so compelling it is well written but not fantastic jacob does not do that much with description but she has a very good knack at writing dialogue flipping mostly between 1998 and 1982 83 the story focuses on an indian family who migrated to albuquerque in 1968 the blurbs say that this is what it was like for them away from their native country the father thomas is a doctor and as would be expected has a lot of contact with all types of people the mother kamala seems to hate her existence but we really don't see that she made any attempt to try to live outside of her indian friends and family i would have liked to have known more of what happened between 1968 and 1982 that being said i thought the book was too long because it was compelling i just wanted to say get on with it we have been here before there was a lot going on in this book which sometimes robbed one story line for another and the way amina got her show seemed a bit contrived i know very little about the indian culture but i do have a good friend who is a christian from india and if her boys spoke to her the way amina and akhil spoke to their parents i doubt that they would be among the living today that bothered me because it didn't seem true but i would think ms jacob would know i did understand the grief of losing a child and a sibling and it is hard to be judgmental of actions taken by those who are affected one just hopes they can come to some peace and get on with their lives even with my criticisms i would recommend this book","332":"this review has been hidden because it contains spoilers to view it click here there was so much that was great here and i finished this huge book in barely one week but there is still so much that i am unclear about and that feels superfluous to the story the entire narrative that takes place in india comes back into the narrative later in a very perfunctory way paige's presence is built up as being significant but then it seems that her importance is nominal at best and most importantly the author repeatedly states that amina's relationship with her father is an e there was so much that was great here and i finished this huge book in barely one week but there is still so much that i am unclear about and that feels superfluous to the story the entire narrative that takes place in india comes back into the narrative later in a very perfunctory way paige's presence is built up as being significant but then it seems that her importance is nominal at best and most importantly the author repeatedly states that amina's relationship with her father is an extraordinarily close one but there is very little in the descriptions and dialogue that actually demonstrates that i am left with the feeling that there is so much that was thrown in without really thinking through why it needed to be there but great characterization of amina as one of the best protagonists i've read in a while and of course the wonderful kamala who i believe i have met several times over in real life more","333":" the title of this book intriguing as it is doesn't do justice to the wonder of the book a story of an indian family transplanted to new mexico brings together the culture of the american west with that of the india of the east amina the main character who has found a place and job in seattle reluctantly returns home to deal with her surgeon father's bizarre hallucinations nsthe story moves through time from amina's childhood to her teen years as a high school student then to the current time when she finds she must deal with her family once again this book wouldn't let me go even though the sleepwalking dancer mentioned in the title has only a small moment in the scheme of things his actions set in motion the complications that follow the family around the world","334":"interesting book that towards the end got really enticing only to leave me hanging didn't love the ending","335":"fantastic got nervous because the book starts in india and its a crazy hubbub which seems like it would just be jokee jokee but once the family players get introduced this is such a well observed family drama i couldnt put it down","336":"enjoyed this novel even though it was a long read","337":"all my goodread friends would love this book it is the story of an indian family who lives in new mexico and struggles every day to fit into the american culture the reader gets to know each of the family members as the physician father starts behaving strangely as he speaks to family members long dead the family relationships are so very realistic as the children grow and push back against the parent's choices i will remember this book for a long time","338":"simply beautiful the complexities of family and friendships exposed carefully like a photograph one is compelled to keep examining i hope reviews that dwell on the immigrant aspect of this don't limit the readership this book is universal i hope it doesn't take ten years for her next one","339":" i don't know if i would've liked this book more if i had read it as opposed to the author reading it on audiobook i did not like her voice but i loved her accents for the indian family members none of which would have been so rich in my own mind i can't tell if amina is as annoying and needy as a character or if she just sounded that way from the reading not enjoying the main character made liking this book tough but some things compensated characters like dimple and the family interactions","340":"i loved this book","341":"i gave this book 2 stars because although i finished it i felt like that only reason i read through 700 pages was because i liked the characters enough that i wanted to the book to have a great ending i wanted it to step up and have be worth all the investment and in the end i didn't think it was i thought that it was too simple of an ending for a book that was going to end like that it could have been much shorter i was disappointed","342":"intriguing indian immigrant family suriani christians story takes place in seattle and albuquerque very high achieving family many personal losses and how each member copes in their new country america liked it sharp clever dialogue","343":" a story full of the depth of life and magic this story is funny and heartbreaking all mixed together if you've ever lost someone close to you lost yourself or found yourself in the midst of family chaos you will feel that truth very deeply and at the same time it's very entertaining and touching to just observe the story being told this book portray's the intricacies of relationships from those with one's family and friends this work will make you laugh cry and it will stick in your mind long after you're finished reading it","344":"an amazing journey loved every minute of it","345":"a wonderful debut novel and an excellent book discussion pick","346":"there are a lot of reasons why i enjoyed this book the writing is great the family dynamic is honest and sad and true to life most of all i liked the explanation of the immigrant experience i thought that the author did a fantastic job of capturing the whole same yet different cultural aspect of coming to a different country it resonated with me because the characters seemed very real and flawed and memorable recommended","347":"i thought it was a good book but very dark","348":"not easy to get into because so many new characters are introduced in the beginning but this book is worth the effort","349":"i listened to this book as read by the author and i think that really colored how i felt about the book it's hilarious at times and i thoroughly enjoyed it ultimately it's an intricate story about family both the family we're born into and the one that we create in this story the created family rises to become crucial to all involved i would highly recommend it but i really recommend listening to it","350":"the only reason i paid any attention to this book is because it was set in albuquerque i wasn't disappointed with the portrayal of albuquerque in the 1980's or late 1990's at all the date at hidden park the meal at the frontier the drives through corrales all rang very true i live just a few blocks from hidden park and the only thing that didn't hit me right was that i don't think of the park as having impressive trees the settings of the book were charming however i didn't connect with any of the characters i found the story very odd the jumping back and forth in time wasn't done very well and i didn't like that every single chapter ended as cryptically as they did there were hints of family secrets and mysterious happenings that never panned out or were never explained there was much made of a mystery but there didn't seem to be anything to work out also i can't figure out what the freaking title had to do with the book if you aren't from albuquerque i wouldn't recommend this book on the plus side the descriptions of food were amazing and made me crave dosas and puris like crazy","351":"this is mira jacob's first novel it is the story of an immigrant indian family and extended family and their dynamics with dealing with loss and change it is a story of communication and the inability to communicate beautiful storytelling details about daily life that bring added dimensions to her descriptions of albuquerque and its environs i could taste the tortillas at the frontier and see the cinder block walls around hidden park everybody needs to read this","352":"really enjoyed this book heard the dynamic author speak at a book store in santa fe and knew we'd like it it addresses the immigrant experience family dynamics the albuquerque area illness and death but with a fine ending very well written and my husband enjoyed it as well","353":" living in new mexico i found this story of the eapens an extended family that relocated from india to new mexico when their children were very young to be largely entertaining it seemed that every time i listened and it is a very well narrated audio edition replete with convincing indian accents the family was either preparing or gathering around yet another extravagant meal of southern indian delicacies my mouth waters just thinking of the dal chapati dosas etc mira jacob develops an interesting tale of first generation indian families struggling to adjust to the us culture and the dysfunctionality of the family left behind in india i would have rated the book more highly but i found myself frustrated with amina the 30 something protagonist who is often shockingly unable to communicate what she feels to those who need to hear from her","354":"families are families they make you laugh make you cry and drive you crazy this book made me laugh and made me cry","355":"this is a 3 decade story of a first generation family there is much conflict between the parents and children the story takes place in india new mexico and wshington","356":"i may be the only person who hasn't read anything by jhumpa lahiri which at least means that i didn't come to mira jacob's debut the sleepwalker's guide to dancing ready to draw that comparison i enjoyed this novel for many of the reasons already given by other goodreads reviewers the fully realized characters the intricate family dynamics the beautiful writing jacob has a talent for capturing people with a single sentence as she does with amina's mother amina was well aware that kamala with her jesus religious radio shows and ability to misquote the bible at random could and did believe anything she wanted to and her father's colleague dr george small and dark and tucked into his white coat like a check in an envelope the man came to an abrupt stop when he reached them smiling with a precision that suggested military training or a sociological disorder what really stood out for me though was a theme that i didn't see mentioned when i quickly browsed through the other reviews that of sleep all of the significant male characters have a troubled relationship with sleep amina's father suffers from insomnia her brother appears to be narcoleptic and her uncle is of course the sleepwalking dancer of the title perhaps this struck me because one of my daughters developed narcolepsy after undergoing brain surgery for epilepsy her unusual sleep patterns definitely affected her personality and her interactions with others and i found myself contemplating how the various sleep disorders in amina's family might have contributed to her father's emotional distance and the tragedies in which her uncle and brother were involved i didn't come to any startling conclusions but i did appreciate the ripples jacob created through this theme i received a free copy of the sleepwalker's guide to dancing through netgalley in exchange for an honest review","357":"well thought out book with intertwining subplots just kept getting better and better and i like how the author chose to end it great character development i really enjoyed the personality of the mother kamala mouth watering descriptions of indian food strong book worth reading","358":"this is a sweetly written richly evocative telling of a 1st generation indian american experience living in new mexico and seattle spanning the 80s and 90s in particular i appreciated the character's viewpoint was that of a syrian christian malayalee the same community to which my keralite husband belongs many of the character's wry observations of indians and syrian christians made me laugh out loud i could hardly put this down and finished it in a few sittings because i really wanted to know how everything came together i've seen several comparisons to jhumpa lahiri and i think they are unfair don't misunderstand i love lahiri's work but jacobs is a very different author besides lahiri's stories have a much different focus and feature bengali characters it's silly to compare two authors simply because of the indian connection should we start comparing gillian flynn to laura moriarty simply because they are both kansans overall i enjoyed hearing a story told from an indian american's point of view but it was a story that did not involve long emotional strands on what it means to be a 3rd culture kid many of the main character's struggles were simply standard teenaged angst that any teenager goes through being a 3rd culture kid was only one part of the main character's story jacobs is an author i will be watching in the future","359":" no spoilers here read the book i don't remember what originally drew me to buying this book but i am so happy that i did it's a story of the familiar pull of family and society both in seemingly different directions it is also about dealing with loss and for me a very relatable upbringing as first generation indian american at a time when indians were few and far between so much in this book made me chuckle or tear up mira jacobs tells this story and makes you feel like the characters were people you grew up with my favorite line from the book he had finally found an america he could love an america that would love him back loved this book","360":"what a delightful read i loved this dysfunctional family from india trying to navigate albuquerque and blend their native customs and thoughts with kids who were raised american the book wasn't a feel good novel but the author's way with words softened the blows as they fell","361":"i loved the peak into the south indian culture the irony of the father's chosen specialty and his diagnosis was poignant i felt there was not real ending and the reader is left to surmise i guess that's the way of today's fiction","362":"a must reada beautifully written heart felt novel about family love cultural differences and growing up as a first generation american this book spans 30 years and two continents following amina and her family as they weather the challenges of moving from india to america the pressures of being a part of an over achieving family and heartbreaking losses amina spends most of her life trying to separate herself from her family only to find herself wondering if she truly belongs with them","363":" mira jacob's debut novel the sleepwalker's guide to dancing opens the readers to the world of amina where family shapes and molds the world around you amina's family came to the united states new mexico when her brother was a small child and before she was even born they make a life by bringing the other indians in the area into their fold and visiting india only occasionally while the characters in the novel are both indian and immigrant these are not the main focus of the story instead the novel centers around how a family deals with difficulty and functions or does not function in the face of trauma jacob structures the novel by moving between story present 1998 and story past 1979 forward in the story present amina is beckoned from the life she has made in seattle back to her parents' home in albuquerque to observe the strange behavior of her father her mother tells her that her father has been talking to his dead mother and that she is concerned by his behavior convinced that there is something wrong amina leaves her photography career in seattle behind for what she hopes will be a short visit as jacob unravels the story of amina's family she tells the story of the family in india and there loss as well as the loss of amina's older brother very early in the novel the reader is made aware that akhil has died but jacob hordes the details of his death for the end of the book as though to perpetuate the mystery of why her father mother and even herself behave in the way that they do in fact jacob works very hard to cultivate mystery in the novel as the sections alternate between past and present there is the feeling of peeling back painful memories removing membranes that have grown over the tender moments in order to protect amina from their existence she is very careful in what she reveals and what she waits to reveal while the book was a little padded for my taste--if i were the editor i would have chopped a good hundred pages--it is a very lush book full of sensory details especially olfactory descriptions amina notices the scent of every person around her a curious sense to be focused on for a photographer who i would assume would notice light color angles and images jacob most certainly has promise and demonstrates that she does not wish to satisfy herself with a simple structure she is one to watch i received the sleepwalker's guide to dancing through goodreads first reads program and this novel is the best i have won through the program so far","364":"though the characters are east indian the story is universal it's about how a family deals with illness and tragedy each finding their own way of handling the stress the central character amina finds release behind the lens of her camera her mother kamala retreats to the kitchen cooking more food than the family can eat her father thomas succumbs to visions of his beloved son who died before him finding more comfort there than in reality jacob tells her story of this dysfunctional family with frankness and humor developing believable characters that come alive on the page i didn't want it to end--amina's story seems to just be beginning i believe this is the author's first book i definitely look forward to reading more from her tt","365":"amina eapen troubled daughter of neurosurgeon thomas and mother kamala whose solution to all situations is to cook and cook some more comes home when her mother says thomas is behaving strangely the story goes back and forth between amina's younger years and the present where she struggles with memories of tragedies and where her life is or isn't currently headed although the plot rambles at times i thoroughly enjoyed the well drawn characters in amina's immediate and extended family and the frequent laugh out loud moments","366":"this is an ambitiously plotted effortlessly written novel with an unforgettable cast of characters it is also partially set in new mexico my favorite place on earth i devoured this book in just a few days","367":"video review https www youtube com watch v qgbmn official rating 3 5 starson the whole i enjoyed the book the premise was quite unique and i can't say i've ever read another story like it which in a world of copycats is a rare and wonderful thing to find the things i enjoyed about this book are the things i enjoy about most books the character development the plot the setting the description i'm a person who loves description which is part of my affinity for classic literature and i often find it lacking in contemporary literature that was not the case in this story we visit multiple locations throughout the narrative including india seattle and albuquerque and jacob's description and development of these places india in particular was perfect not overdone but it didn't feel lacking i've never been to india personally but i have several friends who have and jacob's description of the country the sights the sounds the intermingling of smells was exactly like i've heard it described so many times the crux of the story is the eapen family specifically amina coming to terms with their past their present and their future as a family there's a lot of wrestling with the demons of regret and what that means for the family as they work to move forward it's a topic that isn't discussed often in literature at least not in the literature that i've read and i really appreciated the way jacob approached it recognizing that when a family particularly an immigrant one like the eapens has extensive baggage in their past there is a necessary dealing with that must happen before reconciliation and forward movement can happen one thing i was not a fan of that i'm beginning to see more and more in contemporary literature is the non linear style of storytelling we jump not only from location to location but back and forth in time eapen does a better job of it than some other authors i've read but i have always preferred to receive back story and context as the novel develops and not in chunks like happens in this book she also restarts chapters with each change in location time which made the whole story feel a little disjointed and more like several short stories grouped together than one cohesive arc the other thing i disliked was the graphic nature she used to describe certain intimate encounters amina has it's definitely a personal preference but i'm very much a fade to black kind of person i find that excessive detail about the what and the how and the where of characters making out having sex rarely if ever contributes to the story in this case in particular as the relationship was almost superfluous though not entirely to the plot i found a couple scenes gratuitous and unnecessary however those particular annoyances don't overshadow the fact that this is a lovely story about life and death and wrestling with one's past in order to embrace one's future would recommend","368":"this amazing book really deserves 4 5 stars i found the first fifty or so pages a little hard to get through but this multi generational story of an indian family living in nm is so well written and the characters are so believable that i found it very hard to put down highly recommended","369":"this book started off a little slow but after about page 60 i couldn't put it down","370":"the book was very well written and really gave a sense of place and feeling to the story the characters where fully fleshed out and realistic however i felt that the storyline was not going anywhere and worse it just seemed to bounce from one tragedy to another i think the author is an excellent writer and hopefully with a bit more direction in the future she might write something i will love","371":"i loved this book i just finished and am still in the spell of it so well written with characters so well developed it was frustrating amina was never able to say her words she kept so much in and hidden i was really glad she and jamie began dating","372":"this book was longer than it needed to be but pretty riveting it is a great reminder to white folks of the challenges of being an immigrant in this country but also deals with the universal challenges everyone here faces choosing a career and partner losing loved ones etc","373":"a little strange and a little jumpy not really my style of writing i found the relationships interesting","374":"it was ok dragged a little in spots but i liked the characters","375":"loved this a cross between the namesake and me before you but better great plot and rich characters that you can identify with and feel for read it in two days this may have just squeezed itself in as the best i've read for 2014 highly rewarding read","376":"such a poignant sweet moving story about fathers and daughters families both biological and chosen friends happiness sadness triumphs disappointments love life and death i will be thinking about these characters for a long time there are sentences i had to read over and over because they were so true so perfectly expressed i highly recommend this book","377":"it was the title that captivated me and the cover that enticed what was inside was a painstakingly beautiful exploration of facing personal dilemmas alongside that scary realisation that your parents are no longer bulletproof infallible and are actually getting old and may need your help","378":"wonderful characters that will get into your heart and will not be easily forgotten i loved this story","379":" here's the thing i liked this book it was nicely written entertaining but it was just one of those books that can't decide what it wants to be when it grows up it started out indian immigrant family drama then turned into chick lit with some stock chick lit characters and some tragedy added for gravitas a place at the tear jerker table it didn't all need to be in there jostling around i don't know i'm not dismissing mira jacob but i need something more from her to consider a serious relationship the food sounded yummy though thank god there were no recipes i hate that","380":"very much enjoyed this story it sucked me in and moved me along some of the stories were convenient and didn't resolve well i wanted the emotion to build and it really didn't but it's a great story","381":"great characters story and writing humorous sad and touching","382":"i found this engrossing and very touching at times i look forward to reading more from mira jacob the descriptions of indian meals were great","383":"loved this so much so completely","384":"i wanted to like this book a lot more than i actually did i can't place why exactly it didn't work for me but it just didn't the story was nice enough the characters were likeable enough and the writing was pleasant enough but that was all for me a nice story not life changing not a book i'll remember much now that it's finished it was just okay","385":"loved that the lines between life death home country new country etc are all blurred in this novel the descriptions are so rich that the characters and their relationships to each other come alive loved the first half and possibly the end haven't decided yet but somewhere in between it got a teensy bit long made me crave all of my favorite indian foods over and over again a delicious book in more ways than one","386":"this book does an amazing job of connecting pain and beauty that is in all of our relationships and lives the good and the bad and sometimes how the most beautiful moments can emerge from the most painful ones the bond between the family the bickering the visions choosing not to be cured and the love that ensued the ending reminded me of atonement in the way that it was profoundly heartbreaking because thomas was able to find closure and beauty through a lifetime of pain i think my favourite part of the book was kamala and thomas's relationship at the end of the book when she seemed to fully understand him and support him in his hallucinations she understood his deepest hurt which seemed to be beyond his actual illness and she decided to trust his decision despite the dissent they were in love it was like an atonement for their marriage their family history through the conversations that should've happened but didn't it brought thomas's life in a full circle for closure and release there was a section of the book that gave insight into human relationships when amina realized that maybe dimple needed her more than she needed dimple i can't remember the exact quote but it pinpoints that its hard to understand the dynamics of relationships that we need each other and sometimes the stronger one may actually be the one who needs the other person more","387":"i really wanted to love this book but ended up liking it perhaps some of it had to do with trying to navigate the voices in the audio version there was a good flow to the cadence of the story but i think i was hoping for more magic","388":"i stumbled across a book recco on twitter that suggested the sleepwalker's guide to dancing the title was intriguing enough for me to pull the amazon listing that the author's name sounded indian was enough to make me read the blurb and the reviews i hopped over to my library's online portal to place a hold and was surprised when it said i was next in line the book begins with a prologue that takes you right into the eapen's home the characters are introduced in turn and before you know it you are traveling with amina as her mind takes her on journeys to her father's homeland and back you sit back and enjoy as she paints the arid earth of new mexico and the moisture laden seattle even as you settle in and think you know where the book is taking you you are shaken as she is as life hands out one blow after another yet you journey through it all because you want to you are part of the family as they grapple with the unknown you are sitting there with amina akhil and dimple smoking as sanji auntie bears in you wince as jamie shows up unannounced at amina's home you sit with bated breath in the doctor's office as the test results come in you hold your breath and weep unabashedly when it is all over the power of her writing is such that you do not read the story you are a part of it i am not sure if it is because i am indian that the nuances of sibling relationships so fraught with angst envy and emotion hit me square in my gut but every situation she paints rings with authenticity long after i finished reading the book the characters stayed in my mind most times after i finish a book i remember passages i relish the writing i go back and look at the construct of the story arc with this book the story is all that remains in my head mira jacob is an author to watch out for this book is a keeper","389":"i won this novel through goodreads first reads and i'm happy that i did this was a wonderful novel by mira jacob it was a very moving story which evoked a lot of emotions i loved it and i would definitely recommend it","390":"a beautiful story","391":"four and a half stars slow start but the novel grew more and more beautiful as it progressed captures grief captures crazy indian parents u0026amp community but also wholly original and strange in the best way","392":"it was almost a 4 for me but just didn't love it like i was expecting to 3 5","393":" when amina was just a girl a family trip to see relatives in india ended in disaster and estrangement amina never saw her grandmother her uncle or his family again as they all died in a tragic house fire in the present day amina an events photographer in seattle goes home to albuquerque after a troubling call from her mother there seems to be something wrong with her father and the tests that amina insists upon reveal an inoperable brain tumor but the situation is more complicated than it appears and amina finds herself revisiting both that painful trip to india as well as her brother's death a few years later there is no way to do the sleepwalker's guide to dancing justice in just a short summary this complex and beautiful story demands your whole attention from the first page and you will find yourself wondering about the characters' fates long after the last chapter ends mira's complicated professional history layered over the family's past makes her a fascinating character and author mira jacob does an impressive job drawing readers into every nuance of her life with a debut like this mira jacob is an author to watch review originally written for san francisco book review","394":"a wonderful year about a family dealing with past loss and impending loss beautifully written characters you don't want to leave","395":"i loved the family dynamics in this story it was interesting to get a closer look at this family's indian culture and how that affected their decisions and interactions this author leaves many situations unresolved letting the reading fill in the blanks and come to their own conclusions","396":" i enjoyed this book very much i listened to the audiobook the book had wonderful character development i enjoyed each character which often made me sit in the car to hear what the character was thinking or feeling in the parking lot at work the main setting was in albuquerque which made me feel a deeper connection since i lived in albuquerque for 13 years and was astounded that a family from india immigrated there however it is more than a story of immigration it's a story about family dynamic i was sad when i finished it it made traveling in the car so enjoyable the narrator on the audiobook had a wonderful indian accent which i enjoyed very much but i did not really like her interpretation of the english speaking characters in the book spoke but i was able to imagine the voices into my own interpretation even when i was listening","397":"i have always had empathy for people that leave their own country and customs to live in the usa i've always thought how difficult it must be this is such a story a story that reminds us to be present otherwise we sleepwalk through our to few days on earth while life keeps dancing onward beautifully written","398":"if you love family sagas complex characters and relationships and books you don't want to end is is a must it's literary enough to engage you and keep you thinking about the action and the characters surprising enough not to feel pat but happy and easy enough for a vacation read except for the part about staying up too late reading it","399":"i cannot understand why this book didn't get more attention it's absolutely wonderful tragic lovely beautifully written i highly recommend","400":"pros easy read interesting story well written interesting story well written characterscons annoying cousin predictable flat ending","401":"just upped my review to 5 stars it's the day after i finished reading it i can't stop thinking about it and i think i am going to reread it starting today great sentence there are small blessings tiny ones that come unbidden and make a hard day one sigh lighter wonderful writing and characters interesting view of another culture","402":"this was an excellent read well developed characters great present past transition and plot development really enjoyed this moving story","403":"although this book took me a while to get into i ended up really liking it all families are crazy","404":"so disappointed in this book it started out really interesting and i loved the writing but then it just went downhill from there at least for me started focusing on parts of the story that were not interesting to me didn't live up to the potential of the first chapter so sad i wanted to like it it has a terrific title","405":"mira jacob's has a real talent for writing her descriptions are imaginative and her style is clear and smooth i'll admit that i didn't like the story as much as i liked the writing the story was just eh with some unclear portions that i didn't understand it was unique and never really boring but there was just something odd about it all but i loved her writing i could read her sentences for days","406":"a long disappointing read far too many pages","407":"covered many issues indians coming to settle in america and how it affects those they left behind their relationship their children etc also deals with career crisis death of child love interest death of spouse packs in a lot","408":"wow one of my favourite reads of all time beautiful heartbreaking emotional amazing loved loved loved the writing is just so beautiful that it begs to be reread wonderful","409":"at the end of the book the author said it took ten years to write this book well it also took about ten years to read it the story was interesting but it dragged and not all the pieces seemed to connect in the end","410":"beautiful story about family relationships tragedies and triumphs the prose is exquisite and the story line believable i thoroughly enjoyed getting an insiders view into this indian family's dynamics initially i had a difficult time getting into the story but i am so glad that i gave it a second glance","411":"i loved this book i laughed i cried i enjoyed every minute","412":"wow what a fantastic read i hated to see it end well written insightful great characters great story with wonderfully real family interactions there was so much here being a first generation immigrant family family dynamics the hurt and pain that only family can give you the pain of the person behind the camera who are real people with feelings the entire book was lovely to read i look forward to more from her this would make a great movie","413":"i generally don't like or read contemporary fiction but this one did a good job of capturing the essence of how people grieve especially when they're dysfunctional my mom died a few months ago so maybe it just hit a personal nerve i would have given it 5 stars if it wasn't for the prevailing foul language and fairly graphic sex scenes","414":"i liked this immigrant family drama and especially liked the reading by the author read and listened simultaneously","415":"amazing best book i've read all year i didn't want it to end 500 pages went by too soon","416":"so this book had a strong beginning and actually a pretty strong middle but towards the end things started to fall apart i've already voiced my dislike of jamie things about him seemed stilted in one way or another and he seemed like a very garden variety love interest when i don't even know if this plot needed one i believe he and amina would have an affair i do not believe she would fall in love with him maybe he would have seemed better if the work he was doing with casinos and the work amina had done investigating the puyallup indians was explored in more depth than just a few lines amina's relationship with dimple was the one i wished got more attention than it did there are so many references to dimple being sent to reform school as a teenager but even though numerous sections of the book take place during those days that's never explored the sections set in amina's childhood were the most fascinating for me and i would have liked one more of those in order to get that look at what happened to dimple thomas was apparently in a lot of pain he was letting himself die letting himself be with all the other dead ones his family his guilt over his inability to save them but i wish we had seen more of his mind in many scenes of this we see amina simply watching him third person limited is nice but with so much of interest happening in the lives of people who aren't amina maybe free indirect or third omniscient or switching in between third and first in present and past would be better monica's also an oddity she's presented as an annoying irritant who amina cannot stand but who keeps pushing into amina's life but then she becomes necessary i wish a smidgen of that irritation had stayed it made amina very relatable to me in the beginning so i liked it i will read anything else jacob writes but flaws certainly","417":"this is a story about an indian family coping with a tragic loss the characters were colorful and the plot details were fun it was a little bit lit light but a pleasant story 3 stars good enough but nothing extraordinary here","418":"to say i loved this book doesn't begin to describe how much i enjoyed it tender heartbreaking funny infuriating it focuses on the family and life struggles of members of the eapen family especially its daughter amina as it teeters between indian and american cultures and the prices paid for that journey read this book","419":" i deliberately picked up this book because i wanted a long epic tale to read on a long trip 502 hardback pages it was certainly interesting and i read it all the way through i was drawn to a story linking india new mexico and oregon however i found parts of the book odd the choice of certain medical diagnoses for characters the unique qualities of new mexico and oregon not really central to the story it could have been iowa or colorado still the main story line and characters were intriguing and i am glad i read it and would read other work by this same author","420":" jesus reading this book was like hopping on a train and wanting to hold on while it derailed beneath you it felt like it took the ground out from under me in places i have not read a book this good in a while jacob really captures what its like to live in the clutches of constant heartbreak uncertainty and above all longing there's so much longing in this book and suspense which just makes the longing that much more palpable don't get me wrong the suspense isn't meant to be mysterious it's just the normal weight of self consciousness in the face of life altering changes which constantly begs the question how much of this are we suppose to take responsibility for she's also hilarious which makes the tragedy more real and bareable everyone wants to be sarcastic these days jacob actually is i laughed out loud something i rarely do with books without once using the word sarcasm or feeling the need to explain to the reader that the character is being sarcastic or uses sarcasm as a defense mechanism i don't think i can really talk about it well enough yet to do it justice it hit me so hard i need to digest it re read it amazing debut novel i really hope jacob keeps writing i don't mind waiting another 10 yrs if this is what it produces","421":"really liked this look at a family of necessity among indian expats living in the u s","422":"just finished this book and i am still sitting here thinking about it it is funny tragic endearing and much much more recommended by staff at harvard book store in boston so glad i purchased it","423":" i wanted to love this book right from the start because it was written by a relative of one of my college roommates in truth it took a bit of time for me to appreciate it the family at the center of the story was so dysfunctional aren't we all but i found them a bit off putting and the main character annoying but by the end of the book i wished it could go on forever i wanted to follow amina for the rest of her life i don't think i'll forget thomas and his circumstances trying not to accidentally put in a spoiler for a very long time the loveliness and loving way that his story ends is truly remarkable and comments on all the great unknowns about life and death and on our choices to believe or not believe whatever gets us through the day","424":"barely a 3 5 this book just petered out to a nothing ending 2 5 5","425":" received this book from goodreads giveaway character driven page turning make you stay up way longer than you should just so you can find out what's happened this book is fundamentally about family about family connections relationships that are not easily cast aside no matter how strained they can become it is about grief yes but the book still has its joyful moments the book goes through three time periods with more of a focus on the 80s and the 90s towards the latter half of the book the protagonist is primarily amina and through her eyes we witness family in the 70s when she is a child in the 80s when she is in high school and in the 90s when she is an adult although it is 500 pages the story itself moves quickly seamlessly weaving in these three different time eras providing just enough information to develop the characters and to leave you wanting more ultimately this book provides a private glimpse into family life mira jacob has written the novel in a such way that we ourselves are part of the family we are not on the outside looking in we are inside living it experiencing every event that has happened excellent writing with the perfect balance between showing and telling and beautiful character development i look forward to reading more from mira jacob","426":"i loved this book so much i love the way the story of her family is revealed slowly and it felt very cathartic i love the adopted family it's just a sad happy great story about a family my favorite thing","427":"beautiful rich prose from a master storyteller what a tremendous literary debut","428":"i admire the author's way of putting forth a story compelling the readers to experience the emotions behind the words an intense read written in a beautiful manner","429":"i really loved this book its bizarre title likely would have kept me away from it if not for a personal recommendation from a fellow book loving friend thank you bernadette when you boil it down it's a novel about grief quirky lovable flawed characters i especially loved the mother i laughed out loud at her slightly off english phrases funny sad touching poignant hopeful loved it","430":" if half stars were possible i would give this one 4 5 i'm often put off by book blurbs that include family dynamics and loss which make me expect syrupy nostalgia and heart to heart dialogues but i'm so glad that i dove into this novel's layers of memory dreams and the connection between generations yes and loss too as hamlet said there are more things in heaven and earth horatio than are dreamt of in your philosophy some of the other reviews here on goodreads say that the book was too long but i didn't feel that it lagged and i say that as someone who has become a very lazy reader in recent years highly recommended","431":"ashamedly i broke my you use the f word more than once i quit the book' rule because i was so intrigued by the characters the rich story line and yes the above average writing f bombs notwithstanding don't start the book if you don't do the bombs otherwise i thought it exceptional","432":"wow 4 5 stars i loved this i was pulled in from the get go and always wanted to get back to it then towards the end i slowed down because i didn't want it to be over jacob's characters are so alive so vibrant i so wish i could join them for one of their incredible sounding dinners she goes into her characters' feelings so deeply and yet she can always find humor lurking somewhere in there","433":"this was a great book enjoyed it immensely great story of family relationships and an emotional mystery fast easy read perfect for summer","434":"dialogue is hilarious story is poignant characters are flawed relatable and people you want to hang out with","435":"i wanted to like this book i really did but i found the chapters choppy and the apparent lack of seamlessness hurt my sensibilities as a reader much like blaring music or disco lights hurt the ears and eyes respectively","436":"its a good though uneven read an immigrant story characters are good not a wonderful story might be a good book club book sort of getting tired of this genre","437":" the sleepwalker's guide to dancing is quite an amazing debut novel it's a family saga spanning some 20 years the eapens are a dysfunctional family originally from india and now living in the us each family member has their own demons they are dealing with as the story begins daughter amina once was a successful photojournalist is now doing mostly wedding photography for reasons which we learn later in her 30's she is living in seattle and is called home to albuquerque nm by her over bearing and religious mother kamala her mother is concerned because amina's father thomas a brain surgeon has begun to act somewhat strange he awakens during the night and carries on conversations with his deceased mother and others who have died the story pulls the reader back into the family's history the immigrant experience thomas's desire to come to america so that any children born to him and kamala would have a chance for a better life for kamala her heart remained in her home country a place she would have preferred to stay from albuquerque to seattle to india readers will learn of the tragic events experienced by family members which include the loss of the couple's son akhil i found akhil and amina's story to be very compelling fortunately there is humor peppered here and there so that for me this story never felt depressing despite some of what occurs sleep and sleepwalking surface throughout the novel and i think the title of this book could not have been more appropriate the writing is very good but i thought the beginning was a tad confusing it took me about 40 50 pages to begin to feel like it was a book worth continuing there is a lot that happens in this book so i was happy i did feel fully engaged after the somewhat rocky start i found the last 150 pages or to be the most engrossing it's a story that was very different from anything i've read in a long time it is clear that this author is a newbie worth watching for moving forward try it","438":"beautifully written beautifully sad and real all at once","439":"i was fortunate enough to win an arc of this book from goodreads it has been in my to read pile for weeks i finally had free time from my editing work to read this and i couldn't put it down to be honest i did put it down over this past weekend because i didn't want it to end a story that grabbed me from the beginning about families and friends and friends that become part of your family it made me laugh and cry which is what i love about well written books this is one of the books that i will recommend to all my friends and anyone else who will listen to me i am looking forward to mira jacob's next venture although i read that it took her 10 years to write this one i would really hate to have to wait that long for her next novel thank you goodreads com for introducing me to this amazing author","440":"beautiful poignant and surprising characters stay with you a long time after finishing the novel and you are hungry to know more","441":"very goodvery enjoyable read the family relationships feel authentic and as do the family's struggles i recommend this book to all","442":"i enjoyed this book partly because it was such a departure from the non fiction book i read just before this one one thing i particularly enjoyed was the dialogue was funny enough to make me laugh out loud the family history was believable and the story took a twist i was totally expecting although the author went back and forth between time periods i didn't find it very difficult to follow a good book for a rainy weekend or when you are looking for something a little lighter","443":"a truly unique excellent book i'm sad to say goodbye to these characters wow","444":"enjoyed reading the sleepwalker's guide to dancing i liked how it was written through the eyes of amina who was born in the us with an indian background basically dad thomas was sent the america to study medicine he didn't return back to indian and became a brain surgeon he did support his family in indian by sending money this is something that does really happen because my parents did this but are european and yes my mum is the best greek cook just like kamala and makes us eat if you want to read a book on family dynamics throught the eyes of indian culture this is a book for you it kept me reading to know what happens to eapen family","445":"i love indian indian american novels a lot so maybe my expectations were too high especially with all the hype the plot was jumpy and didn't flow well the family interactions were the best part and the mother kamala was great fun an ok read but nothing special","446":"good really grows on you as you read it","447":"in addition to being a great story this book also made me want to eat indian food 24 7","448":"spanning india in the 70s to new mexico in the 80s to seattle in the 90s the sleepwalker's guide to dancing is a winning irreverent debut novel about a family wrestling with its future and its past when brain surgeon thomas eapen decides to cut short a visit to his mother's home in india in 1979 he sets into motion a series of events that will forever haunt him and his wife kamala their intellectually precocious son akhil and their watchful daughter amina now twenty years later in the heat of a new mexican summer thomas has begun having bizarre conversations with his dead relatives and it's up to amina a photographer in the midst of her own career crisis to figure out what is really going on but getting to the truth is far harder than it seems from thomas's unwillingness to talk to kamala's born again convictions to run ins with a hospital staff that seems to know much more than they let on amina finds herself at the center of a mystery so thick with disasters that to make any headway at all she has to unravel the family's painful past my thoughts magical sometimes books come along and you sigh pure magic why do they end so soon i didn't think i was going to like this book that much but i loved it each minute i was thinking this is why i am a reader for her debut this was an ambitious novel but she not only pulled it off she outdid herself will be expecting great things now watch out world references to some great shows like hill street blues and things i loved too told in time periods back and forth it is a bit different but i love that style happy reading i can't wait for more by this wonderful new author i received this book from goodreads first read program in exchange for my honest opinion","449":" i liked the scenes and main themes of the book having spent time in both seattle and new mexico i like the settings seattle in particular is such an up and coming and yuppie place and amina is such a yuppie compared to the surface and the deeper levels of her indian parents the themes of guilt and regret of leaving your birthplace and talking with spirits whether real or a manifestation of guilt or a brain tumor photography as documentation of both the surface and the underworld etc are all interesting i listened to the book so editing could have revealed the repetitions and the sameness of the tags the actions between the conversations the characters shrugged a lot in some ways amina was very irritating and didn't seem to grow throughout the book overall i did like the book i always like reading about people from india who choose to live in the us","450":"this 500 page novel is about an immigrant family from india that comes to the united state in 1968 settling in albuquerque the novel goes back and forth in time giving the reader a sense of what things were like in india as well as during the early years in new mexico along with what is happening currently amina is the primary character in the novel she has left albuquerque and now lives in seattle where she is a wedding photographer out of the blue she gets a phone call from her mother kamala who is worried about thomas amina's father kamala asks amina to return home to new mexico thomas has been hallucinating and talking to akhil amina's dead brother thomas a respected neurosurgeon has been acting out of sorts for awhile there has even been an incident at his hospital that has concerned his colleagues and the board amina has always had a difficult relationship with her parents kamala and thomas have a marriage fraught with anger and pain amina feels like she's in a maelstrom when she's with them as she navigates her time in new mexico she is also dealing with problems that have propped up with her job in seattle though a wedding photographer by trade she is actually an art photographer and some of her recent photographs have come to the attention of her boss who does not approve of them the dialog can be riveting but overall the story moved too slowly for me to be entirely engrossed i think mira jacobs' debut novel shows a remarkable talent and i look forward to her future writings","451":" this book was given to my sister at our annual book club book exchange i read it as a possible selection for our book club however i didn't really care for it the story is very confusing at the beginning going back and forth in time and subject the main character amina eapen is a young indian woman living in seattle working as a photographer however there are flashbacks as the entire family and their ties back to india and new mexico are described for the majority of the novel the focus is extremely unclear is it the family structure and catastrophe is it the strange photos amina takes and the effect they have on her is it her brother's story is it a story of love the end of the book changes to a focus on amina's father who is dying and the various ways the family reacts to his strange behavior it seems like the author was not sure where to take her book she says she set it aside for 3 years while her own father was dying and threw bits of various ideas together and called it a novel this one did not work for me","452":" i loved this book really really loved it i read it quickly devoured might be a better word because i couldn't stop thinking about it whenever i tried to take a break i'm a sucker for stories that change points of view or change time frames locations this book did the latter flawlessly i'm still thinking about the characters and their complicated relationships with each other and the world around them i'm still thinking about bobby mccloud still thinking about the mural on akhil's ceiling this book and the utter joy it was to read won't soon leave me","453":"i loved the author's idea of shifting from decade to decade rather than a smooth flow of the story it was a breathe of fresh air but there was too much adversity in this book am sure given another 512 pages mira could have killed every character in the book throw some good and happy once in a while","454":"reviews i read mention this book as a comical lahiri i found it yes with humor but also with poignancy and sorrow all very real and beautiful","455":" i went into this book totally blind not having read anything about as i would usually with my reading choices and i wasn't disappointed i love the eapens i found them to be such a real family with problems and issues like the rest of us and they rallied together when needed like families should kamala was my favourite character what a strong woman i found her hilarious i loved the way she was written with broken english how stubborn she was and especially how loving she was toward her family even though i felt like she didn't quite want everyone else knowing just how loving she was i was all set to give this 4 s but then i found it dragged a little towards the end it was almost as though i knew what was coming but it took a little longer than i'd have liked to get to it other than that fab book that had both sadness and joy leaving me happy and sad all at the same time","456":"a wonderful book not what i'd call a beach read it's too well written for that but i did read it on the beach and found myself so engrossed i forgot where i was","457":"though this book had its moments it was a bit of a slog whenever it moved away from amina it stalled she was the only character with any depth","458":"i really liked this book i felt like it left some things up in the air at the end most notably her photography but is as poignant a treatise on the experiecnes of grieving as opposed to a more philosophical approach as i have read","459":"this was a great read i couldn't put the book down after i got about half way through initially i chose it as a random selection from the library because of the title then i didn't end up reading it before i had to return it to the library eventually i came across it again and read it immediately after reading the jacket flap links to seattle and albuquerque initially drew me in and then of course family stories always get me keywords grief acculturation india death hallucinations new mexico seattle love brother sister relationships husband wife relationships extended family relationships","460":"go and read this book now","461":"this book had so much promise but it really just needed a huge amount of editing the premise was great and i love me a flash back style novel but this just didn't get there","462":"this is one of those books that i had before publication but didn't get to there are many books like that and i only end up reading a small number of them once they're out in the world i heard a lot of good things about this book and kept it in my mind as something i should check out ultimately i was tempted by the audiobook which the author reads herself i love that kind of audio experience because i know the author reads things as they're intended i enjoyed this book very deeply even though amina is the kind of character who can frustrate me a lot that person who does very little and spends most of the book stuck in stasis ultimately the story of her family sucked me in this is a book about loss and grief but also about the way families can be pushed apart by love that is too fierce and demanding or by love that stays too quiet below the surface the structure which flashes back from 1998 where amina visits her parents to her childhood worked really well for me it did that thing i love where a book slowly unfurls its story and characters lets me explore them deeply but lets me know it may be hiding something that i don't know about yet the audio is excellent honestly i would have assumed it was read by a professional narrator if i hadn't known better i enjoy hearing accents in audiobooks it helps me feel more in touch with the characters and the voices of thomas and kamala in particular bring so much to the experience of the book","463":"here's the review i gave on amazon immediately after finishing the book it's rare that i read a book and am not at least a little anxious for it to be finished to see how the story ends but in this novel i was afraid of it ending of my connection with amina and her family being severed both the love and the loss i felt throughout the book was so palpable if jacob takes another 10 years to write her next book it will be well worth it if it's at all like this one as you can see i give very emotional reviews right after finishing a book this is about a family originally from india that settled in new mexico thomas and kamala have 2 children akhil and amina akhil was a young boy when they moved to the u s and amina was born here the book takes place in the early 1980s with the children as young teens then fast forwards to 1998 there's a lot of discussion about living in a country that is very different culturally but also the connections you immediately make with those with the same cultural background as your own the eapen family met other indians in new mexico and those people became their family and primarily that's what this book is about family the book is filled with many laugh out loud moments but there is also this blanket of grief that covers you as you read the last third of the book and even with that feeling i didn't want it to end","464":"loved this book made me laugh made me sad felt so much and enjoyed it all","465":"received this book through a goodreads firstreads giveway thank you this book from page one captured my attention the description of scenes is exceptional and it is quite easy to fully emerge oneself in the story given the time i could have finished this book in one sitting i have always loved books which switch back and forth between the past and present and this sentiment certainly held true for this book jumping back and forth seamlessly the reader further understands each character the choices they make and their reactions to the events around them despite dealing with heavy themes this book remains light clever and a joy to read fantastic first novel","466":"very nice story now i need an indian cookbook for all the food that was cooked throughout","467":"this was a fabulous read very compelling quick reading with amazing characters brilliant emotional insights to our human existence lovely rewarding experience highly recommend","468":"i'm glad i read this book this was a very enjoyable read but i was a little let down by the ending it just didn't live up to the quality of the rest of the book","469":"very rich tragic and humorous lots of food would definitely read another by this author","470":"some poignant moments but overall a disappointment the main character was not that likeable and seemed have things happen to her rather than own up to her choices and this didn't change by the end which frustrated me the family drama was too sensationalized for my taste and made the story feel unrealistic and soap opera y however the writing was strong enough that i might be willing to try out future books by this author","471":"i loved everything about this book that's all","472":"powerful clever thoughtful about an indian family in transition between india and us about grief love ghosts of the past i would enjoy hearing what a first generation american from india thinks about this book","473":"a book that stays with the reader for days","474":" the book starts with a phone call and ends with an airplane flight the story in the middle is just wonderful it's not only about two generations of a family it is about their lives their lives begin in india and finish up in the usa seattle is where amina lives and her parents are in albuquerque her mother kamala longs for india but her father thomas wants to remain in albuquerque where he is a neurosurgeon amina is almost thirty and her stubborn mother is determined that her only daughter will find a good indian husband this family has been touched by heartbreak more than once and now there seems to be yet another tragedy hovering on the horizon they are supported by close family friends who over the years have become their family in new mexico how they cope with each other and how they each cope with the lives they have and the lives they want and what happens to them is what makes this story so interesting there is so much more to this story but i won't spoil your read the character's personalities are extremely well written in this dialogue driven book the language is so rich with description it is easy to picture the characters and their home in new mexico this was truly a pleasure read for me this book was won in a first reads giveaway","475":"though a bit long this novel drew me with with well drawn characters and moving story about love loss in an indian immigrant family it made me laugh and cry","476":"an absorbing and touching family drama about an immigrant indian family that goes back and forth in time from the 1970's and 1990's","477":"this is somewhere between 2 and 3 stars for me the book certainly has its moments i laughed out loud had a lump in my throat on more than one occasion and could relate to a lot in the book at times though the book strayed over the line from authentic to cliche i also think i would have liked the book more if i had read it instead of listened to it as an audiobook with the author narrating the passages that are her darlings we're too obvious and grating","478":"alright for a first novel complicated family stories with loose strings never attached in the end","479":"3 5 stars i feel so conflicted i completely enjoyed the story despite so many ideas going on i enjoyed the family dynamic and liked the back and forth storytelling of it so much was put into all the details that i feel the end was completely rushed and brushed off as unimportant what happened next with the art show with jaime did she move back to albuquerque stay a wedding photographer i guess i just need more closure in my books","480":" i want to write a review but i'm too tired right now maybe i'll come back to this but my track record is not great with that sort of thing suffice it to say that this was a really great read the type of book that if you don't take your commuter train to the last stop you might forget to get off the train if you read in the morning over coffee before work you might curse your coffee for disappearing too fast and be late for work if you read before bed you will need two such cups of coffee in the morning and be late for work you get the idea disclaimer i was never late for work because i was reading this book i also took so long to read it because the six month old in the house severely limits the times of day i can read this was actually a pretty perfect book to read when one's opportunities are so limited","481":"i liked this book i liked the back and forth chronology and i really liked the descriptions of first generation family life culture and food however i found it a bit under edited with a few too many storylines and predictable plot points","482":"family culture traditions what a great combination for a good story loved it and don't want to give away too much","483":"a random find but well worth the time","484":"so beautiful i listened got the audiobook and the stories of a family their heartbreak tenderness community and place making was beautifully told as a child of albuquerque now living elsewhere i especially enjoyed the details of the city that could be snipped from my own memories","485":" i really enjoyed the intermingling of indian and american cultures in this novel the voices of each generation were quite distinct and throughout the novel the theme of generational differences and struggles was well expressed and vividly described the main character ami is a young girl who grows up in new mexico during the 1970s 1980s she is the daughter of indian immigrants but was born in america unlike her older brother much of the novel focuses on her family's strained dynamics there is a lot at play from family secrets to cultural assimilation to basic coming of age struggles this novel shows ami's family in a lot of situations and go to create a highly faceted view of a complicated family life one of my favorite parts of this novel were all the different voices kamala the mother of our main character has a rather distinctly accented voice i could literally hear her talking in my head as i read along which was great she is a caustic but interesting character and her critical remarks often had me laughing i also really liked the eccentricities of ami's father thomas as we got further into the book it is a sad story towards the end but the odd little elements and situations that he introduces helps keep things a bit lighter and not as sad there was a kind of mystical element to this novel as well which didn't do much for me i don't want to give much away but i didn't feel that it really added that much to the book there was enough mystery and family secrets as it was i just didn't think it was necesary but then again it didn't detract much either so i guess it was fine overall i rather enjoyed this novel the writing was really well done and i found myself getting lost in the story quite a bit i do have to admit though i had serious cravings for indian food for basically the entire novel though since the descriptions were done so well you have been warned","486":"truthfully i would rate this book at a 4 5 but since that rating is not available i opted for the 5 as it was so well written i did receive this book for free and was surprised by the size of it when it arrived i thought the read would be daunting but was surprised how easy it was to get caught up in it because of the beautiful writing i was swept right up and didn't want to put it down as the book began i found it a little confusing keeping all the characters straight i find this often happens when i am introduced to names i am unfamiliar with once i straightened that out i was drawn in ms jacob does as amazing job describing the nuances of everyday life i had no difficulty picturing myself there experiencing things right along with the characters the main characters are very well developed and likable i especially found myself enjoying kamala the only thing that kept me from giving this a full 5 stars was the ending with such beautifully written and descriptive build up i found that the conclusion lacked the punch that i thought it would carry instead it just kind of drifted off to sleep","487":"i adored this book the characters were delightful although this focused on indian culture and second generation immigrants i felt it rang true for any child of an immigrant this book made me laugh and captivated me enough that i did not find it hard to get through the 500 pages i finished this book within a week","488":"this is well with 3 and a half the characters are very vivid and it's fun to be a fly on a wall of an extended indian family which also made me crave indian food i also enjoyed reading about seattle in the 90's the dialogue is bit too realistic and immature you know","489":"fabulous read crushingly sad yet has a sense of levity throughout","490":"story of a indian family from their roots in india in the 1970's to their transition to new mexico in the late 1990's the patriarch is a re known brain surgeon who begins to talk to dead relatives his daughter returns home to help at the risk of losing her job i found the story easy to follow although there are many characters in the family i loved the author's description of the localities the indian culture and especially the characters you can almost smell the curry u0026amp spices when kamala is in the kitchen you can guess yourself about what the title means the only thing that i thought could have been improved was the ending which felt rushed overall an enjoyable story and i look forward to reading more of this author's tales","491":"the focal point of this book an indian immigrant family in the u s seemingly calls for a comparison with jhumpa lahiri's literary style however i think in terms of cultural context depiction of family dynamics and in essence the sleepwalker's guide to dancing has its own distinctive flavour through her powerful debut mira jacob takes you on a journey across the world and through time to introduce you to the eapens a south indian syrian christian family from a seething summer at their matriarchal home in salem tamil nadu to their chaotic life in albuquerque new mexico you are drawn into a web of situations and relationships that seem only too strained to resolve the protagonist amina eapen is the quintessential contemporary 30 year old with a job financial freedom and a mother who can't stop pestering her to get married amina has made peace with the unforeseen turn her career has taken and is leading a near sanguine existence in seattle when one day her mother calls to convey a strange piece of news amina's father is displaying baffling delusional behaviour and amina must rush to albuquerque to intervene she reaches her parents' house only to discover that her week long leave isn't going to suffice to get to the heart of whatever it is that lies ahead fate seems to spare the eapens no respite for even as they grapple to come to terms with a turbulent past their present day lives get increasingly fraught but what keeps this drama from turning into histrionics is jacob's impeccable comic timing and perceptive portrait of interpersonal equations without resorting to stereotypical caricatures she picks up on specific idiosyncracies to create relatable and genuine characters and circumstances be it sibling rivalry an adolescent at loggerheads with his father or a mother's sometimes irrational refusal to accept her child's flaws jacob presents some nuanced amusing and realistic scenarios that go to make a heart rending yet rib tickling saga i did find some aspects of the story a little unconvincing but then again if there's anything i've learnt from life in the last few years it is that truth indeed is stranger than fiction so i don't begrudge the author her creative liberty also her interview at the end of the book makes you see a few things including the book's title in a new light giving a better understanding of her perspective intense insightful and insanely impactful the sleepwalker's guide to dancing could very well be a storyteller's guide to great writing i strongly recommend this read albeit with a statutory warning of it's emotionally disruptive potential it haunted me for quite some time after i'd put it down i'm definitely looking forward to more from mira jacob","492":"this was a slow burner first third of the book i wasn't gripped then i really enjoyed the last two thirds keep with it and like me you may well love it","493":"ti received this book through the librarything early reviewers program i had left a prior review after reading half of the book and now i am rewriting it because i have finished the book i loved it so much more than any book i have ever read it is mostly dialog and it moves along in such a crisp and flowing way you can hear the very voices of this incredible indian family adjusting to the american way of living it had everything i enjoy in a book fabulous writing style sad moving with an underlying humor that is at times laugh out loud funny i am unable to come up with descriptive words that do justice to this incredible debut novel it is one book that i will never ever forget i just know that if someone asks me in 10 years what is my all time favorite book this will be among my top 5 i loved loved loved it and i am recommending it to everyone i know especially those friends who enjoy excellent writing i predict a best seller here","494":"beautiful and poignant i cried a lot but was so sad when it was over i highly recommend this book such a great debut novel","495":"i was at a lost yesterday on what to write in the review as i was sleeping i realized even though i was put out by the intro which was very asian and didn't seem to match the title and the cover of the book i enjoyed the narrative from the third chapter onwards it was fun getting to know the characters after finish reading the book i realized there was no proper ending to the book maybe the author could have had akhil give out memory that others didn't know this would have left us wandering whether the apparitions were real or a fragment of the mind the same thing goes to the main character maybe touch on the gallery showing and her realizing she show have done things differently i felt the characters didn't grow throughout the book","496":"i loved it great characters and life situations","497":"i received this book as part of a goodreads first reads giveaway i loved this book it drew me in immediately and i didn't want it to end amina eapen is summoned home to albuquerque by her mother ostensibly because she's worried about amina's father but possibly because she wants to set amina up with a doctor or maybe she's worried about amina a photojournalist turned wedding photographer with problems of her own the story alternates between amina's childhood and adulthood and chronicles the unraveling of the eapen family which begins after an ill fated trip to india the sleepwalker's guide to dancing was funny smart and ultimately heartbreaking highly recommended","498":"i have more feelings than i know what to do with","499":"interesting and informativealthough i have friends of indian heritage i did not know much about their culture i wish there was a glossary to explain all the indian words i loved the relationships of the friends and family and the verbal interchanges that had me laughing aloud or feeling tearful","500":"long meandering story but really liked it listened to cd read by author her voices were wonderful","501":" the sleepwalkers guide to dancing is sure to be the summer literary hit of 2014 this epic novel spans over 500 pages and is set between the 1970s 80s and 90s even though that seems big it felt as if the pages were just flying by in this one sometimes a big book is just the thing you need and gives you a message that you needed right at that moment that cleansed your mind and made things feel straight the words making your world turn straight and blue again this book did that for me when thomas eapen cuts his visit back to his mother in india short a series of events are set in motion that will haunt the family waiting in the shadows for many years to come when late comes his daughter has to fight the same old thing finding herself at the center of the mystery the writing in this one was

inspiring it is everything i highly recommend anyone to read this book mira jacob this book was well worth the ten years put into it","504":"this story spans about 20 years of the life of amina and her family and friends the story begins in 1979 in india and moves forward to 1998 in albuquerque it tells of amina's family's hopes of the future the heartbreak when the family is killed in a fire in india and her father's illness amina finds depictions of life through the photographs she takes throughout the story the story starts in the present when amina's mother kamala contacts her in seattle to tell her her father thomas is talking to dead relatives when amina comes home she finds out there is more to the story than what her mother is saying thomas has been doing strange things like burying things in the garden to trying to save a dead boy he refuses to explain himself and the only way amina can help him and her mother is to come to terms with the family's painful past the deaths of family members in india and the death of her brother ahkil this was a good story and the only problem i had was with the one part being in the past the next in the present then bouncing back to the past it was a difficult to remember where i was at in the story i won this book in a goodreads giveaway","505":" what it means as an immigrant to make a life in a stolen country the sleepwalker's guide to dancing is as much a story of a family away from home as it is a story of a home away from it's inhabitants it would be unfair to divulge in the story as it would mean taking away from the delicious reading experience that this book has to offer various themes of belonging longing cultural differences sorrow love teenage rebellion come together in play mixing up humorous goofy tragic paranormal tones as the story of an immigrant family takes shape while flowing from salem to seattle to albuquerque somewhere at the very start of the book the characters connect with the reader almost instantly never of letting go through out the book mira jacob does a fabulous job with her characters her 10 years that went in writing this book seem to have paid off in form of effortless language and fictional events characters that feel real an engaging read","506":"excellent portrayal of what it's like to live in an american indian family as a family whose ancestors immigrated rather recently to the states i related with the author's struggle to maintain tradition while embracing new experiences and cultures while my family is not of indian heritage i saw my aunt grandma and mother in these characters who parallel their roles in multiple cultures based on food sharing and love great writing and pretty interesting story dragged in a couple places but overall gave a strong enough emotional connection to make it a worth while read","507":"unusual story but i had to finish it too see what happened","508":"intricately and brilliantly constructed one of the most beautiful stories about loss i have ever read","509":"loved this story and its characters the dialogue was a delight well written and fresh","510":"more like a 4 5 but since there are no half stars 4 will do since i can't give it the same 5 star rating as 'a suitable boy' the definitive dysfunctional indian families novel nevertheless this is a strikingly assured debut with a compelling narrative thrust intriguing characters and some luminous prose if it sometimes veers dangerously close to 'chick lit' territory and some of the 'supernatural' elements didn't quite work for me it was still an enormous pleasure to read just hope it doesn't take the author another ten years for her second book","511":"i took this book off the library shelf and put it back several times feeling desperate for something to read i checked it out i loved it the author has a fresh young voice that rings true to me as she describes how a family soldiers on through the worst that life can throw at them i loved the protagonist hell i loved everyone in the book so glad i finally brought it home and gave it a try","512":"i had some trouble getting through the character development back story in the beginning but i am so glad i made it through it gave the story so much more depth at the end and gives the reader a better understanding of how each character is going through the events one of the better books i have read in some time","513":"this book was amazing it had me glued to it told from the perspective of the narrator as both a child and an adult it looks deeply at the issues faced by first and second generation indian immigrants to the united states pulled between two cultures it looks at life and death and that place in between not supernatural necessarily but not quite reality for who among us hasn't caught a glimpse of a loved one long departed","514":" it took me the first 50 to 75 pages to warm up to this novel hence the 4 stars rather than a full 5 this novel spanned a good slice of the globe from india to new mexico to seattle and was largely about life through a successful though troubled immigrant's eyes it's clear from the start that this is a troubled family but that there is love at the core the conventions of going back and forth in time was effective and was probably a more compelling way in which to tell this story than in conventionally chronological order i found the daughter amina's character the most interesting and sympathetic but grew to like most of the characters even amina's difficult mother compelling and interesting the whole family's reactions to the father thomas' serious illness rang true overall this is one to take a seriously good look at","515":"i loved this book could not put it down it was rich the author said it took her ten years to complete i would tell her it was worth the wait i will happily share this book with my friends","516":" the realness of the characters in a novel usually makes it or breaks it for me in this beautifully written story of an indian american family that immigrated in the late 1960s to albuquerque new mexico the main characters all felt incredibly vibrantly real the poignancy of their pain their regrets their sorrow for what is and will be lost made me cry for them and for the ways in which we all experience some version of what they did i loved reading their story and didn't want it to end the story pans back and forth in time between amina eapen's childhood and her late twenties when her mother beckons or maybe guilts her back to albuquerque to help her address the lately strange behavior of her brain surgeon father thomas while amina is the main character of the novel and the story is told from her viewpoint it is at least as much thomas's story as hers in the far reaching span of the novel a lot of tragedy befalls the eapin family - just as sooner or later a lot of tragedy befalls most every family each member of the family feels the effects of these tragedies but perhaps especially thomas since his feelings of loss are tainted by regret thomas seems like many men before him to stifle most of his unpleasant or overly complex feelings though his love for his children is clear he immerses himself in his work to avoid dealing with the more complicated emotional workings of his family life when an uncomfortable situation arises while the family is visiting his mother and brother in india his solution is to leave he eventually confronts all of his pain and regret and this is the beginning of resolution and maybe even an inner sense of redemption for him and for his family the author handles this part of the story so beautifully in a way that completely works as realism but also seems maybe to be delving into magical realism i finished the book five days ago and i am still moved thinking about thomas and the ending of the book though thomas spoke to me the most or perhaps captured my heart the most the other characters in the book are equally compelling kamala amina's mother also faces seemingly insurmountable grief and is in so many ways a perfectly real mother intense love flights of rage and all but she is also strong unique and quirky her lonely fervent devotion to jesus comes to mind and is the vehicle for a lot of comic relief amina's initial untethered float through her late twenties life will probably be familiar to many readers even if hers is propelled mostly by the loss experienced in her early life as will the maddening way that home and family are simultaneously enticing suffocating and liberating for her i nearly developed a crush on amina's brother akhil who is another vibrantly realized character thomas' family back in india will be perhaps forever etched in my mind and one of my only gripes about the book is that i didn't get to know them more aside from the incredibly well drawn characters i also loved this novel's true ringing dialogue and the author's wit even in the face of so much gritty reality or perhaps because of it in short i loved this book and would highly recommend it","517":"the sleepwalker's guide to dancing by mira jacob was an enthralling and enjoyable read this debut by mira jacob is about india and north america and the spaces in between inside of us when home is there and here it's a book for the modern reader the sleepwalker's guide to dancing contains well developed characters and an interesting perspective over the time of decades portrayed through one family i was lucky enough to receive an advanced copy through goodreads' first reads program and i am so grateful that i did because i truly was delivered a fantastic new book for 2014 i will definitely look forward to the other works this author creates mira jacob has got herself a new fan verdict go get yourself a copy u0026amp savor it just as much as i did","518":"hum i started reading the sample available through amazon and didn't finish it it was too convoluted and the characters were not speaking to me i also didn't like the dialog i understand jacob was writing as indian natives would speak however it wasn't ringing true to me","519":"really disliked this book i feel especially bad as i suggested it for my book club professional photographer gujarati 2nd gen texan and brits in our member canadian mix i thought this was a winner reading the reviews and halfway in i knew it was a disaster i listened to the author narrate this horrific she could capture the east asian accents well but the one note shrill yelling dialogue and lack of voice training made it cringe worthy whoever produced this audio version should be fired the storyline lacks depth with a promising indian back story from the outset which gets completely forgotten and underdeveloped in the u s instead the plot premise was trite and the author's writing style relies too heavily on simile and cliche with dialogue from a poorly scripted american teenage soap the 2 main female characters were cynical and offensive in their lack of respect and love for their parents though they hypocritically seem to show an immature unappreciative love for by the end go figure fluff and bother i won't be reading another mira jacob anytime soon","520":"the characters felt familiar maybe because my mum's side of the family is malayalee and my grandmother refers to her as koche reminded me so much of my jacob family thank you for this beautiful story","521":"i liked this just fine but i felt like there was something missing i can't quite explain what i mean","522":"great book it has humor and family descriptions that i couldn't help but love with all my heart the part where the author writes about what paige feels after losing akhil is so very beautiful and touching that it actually made me physically feel her pain","523":"it's not very often that i find a book the keeps me up all night to finish it with a job two very busy children i just don't have the time or energy anymore so when i do find a book that compels me to continue reading lost past my bedtime and into the wee hours of the morning 3am to be exact i find myself absolutely joyous if a bit exhausted i had heard wonderful things about this book but what i heard pales in comparison to actually reading it it goes back and forth from the past to the present in order to not only describe the life of new immigrants to the united states but to also explain what is happening and why the characters are so finely tuned that they were real within the story i laughed in parts i cried in parts and i was truly sad to have to say goodbye to them they aren't perfect each has their own trials their own strengths and weaknesses but they make do push past and live and love large to me this book is more about family its strengths and its weaknesses than anything else family can simultaneously lift you up and throw you down harder than anyone else sometimes when one makes a choice absolutely inscrutable to everyone one family will be all you have left so far i would have to say this is my favorite book of the year and i don't often say that i tend to be one who has too many likes to come up with a favorite lightly this is also a book that you could come back to over and over again for the nuances that will change as you do i can't recommend this book strongly enough it's heartbreaking in its beauty and in its humanity","524":" the sleepwalker's guide to dancing is a wonderful exploration of how the past shapes and haunts a family this is a common theme for novels including my own but this book stands out with its unusual situations vivid characters and perceptive narration it joins my list of recommended heartbreaking family stories amina is a photographer in seattle who earns her living shooting conventionally gorgeous wedding photos but fuels her passion by capturing the ugly moments her clients would never want to remember when her mother calls with concerns about her father's mental health amina returns to her new mexico hometown to investigate flashback chapters present important events in the family's past starting with a disastrous visit to relatives in india when amina and her brother were young as the story shifts between time periods the reader comes to understand how a series of tragedies changed the lives of amina and her parents near the beginning of the book i was less engaged with the story of adult amina and her career issues but once she reached new mexico the story became more compelling and i was soon fully invested i loved the characters who are all well developed with strong personalities and distinct ways of speaking the family relationships are believably loving and frustrating and there's a good sibling dynamic which i always appreciate while the overall story is quite sad humor and beauty are sprinkled throughout this novel is full of moments i'll remember","525":"the relationship dynamics of a syrian christian family from india told through three interwoven time lines holds your attention with enough foreshadowing turns and depth to conclude that it could end no other way wonderful writing coupled with a story that pulls you in further with each chapter makes this an irresistible read","526":" i'm not sure why i picked up this book i was really excited to read it initially but i came back to it and was as excited it became available at my library so i got it i was really happy i read this book it was a easy read i thought the beginning had some really suspenseful parts but those tapered off toward the end of the book it slowed down a lot toward the end and i wish the conclusion was a bit stronger when i discover the book was going back and fourth between the late 70's to the mid 90's i thought that would be a huge turn off for me the author pulled it off very well i liked most the characters some of the scenes seemed unnatural and a bit confusing kamala was the mother of the main character in this book she was probably my least favorite character she never really seemed consistent mostly goofy in some parts of the book humor was written in i really appreciate that in books because that seems like a hard quality to come by it was annoying how the family almost ignored problems for such long periods of time or put there rose colored glasses on the charm about this book was that it is relatable this isn't a book i would recommend to a friend unless they were already interested in it","527":"i enjoyed the theme about the struggles of an immigrant family but this story could have been tightened up after a while the dramatic tension seemed to dissipate and i stopped caring","528":"a very promising start but that's about it the author lost me halfway through","529":"sometimes amina comes off like a spoiled brat and i found her unlikable","530":"this book renewed my love for fiction over the past few years disappointed by an overwhelming number of mediocre novels i've increasingly turned to non fiction my rationale was even if the book is mediocre at least i'll learn something what's the point of spending time with a mediocre book that's just a story someone invented this book though reminded me of why i used to be a fiction addict i don't want to oversell it it was a long book and the narrative occasionally sagged not every detail of every interaction was necessary and thankfully the romance was peripheral because it left me pretty cold now that i got that disclaimer over with i will rhapsodize this book pulled me in completely i felt like i was right there with the characters feeling what they were feeling the writing was great the themes natural and multilayered the characterization dimensional and interesting the plot wasn't exactly fast paced but it wasn't non existent either i loved the family members i loved their relationships and interactions i loved their dysfunction painfully real but not over the top and clearly interwoven with genuine love for once i'm not alone here 4 goodreads star rating actually well deserved which is also nice so i feel comfortable saying though not a perfect book highly recommended","531":"family saga revolving around the tight eapen family thomas dad kamala mom amina and akhil kids the hues of jacob's writing are varied but seamless she weaves in such heavy hearted moments with humor both light and dark and the theme of seeing what we want to see and other times not seeing what we wish we would was compellingly done","532":"a good writer easy to read even though it is pretty long i wasn't quite as moved as other reviewers were but i enjoyed it and i think i'll remember the story and some of the characters for a long time","533":"not my favorite book the narrator was good but the story felt like it wandered all over the place and was a bit dull","534":"i loved the characters in this book loved the story and was sad to finish it the start was a bit slow but the book overall was excellent","535":"one of my favorites in quite some time","536":"listening to the audio version of this book was very entertaining due to all the indian accents great capture of family dynamics and how we connect with others both good and bad","537":" disclosure i received a copy of the advance reader's edition'the sleepwalker's guide to dancing' is a story of three generations of a family spanning two continents and decades of time it follows the point of view of the protagonist amina from childhood to adolescence and young adulthood i honestly loved this book as an indian american i found myself in all too familiar situations as amina experiences the characters felt genuine and the storyline was put together very well it was difficult to put this book down as i became emotionally invested in every character the transition from one time period to another was done very smoothly and i was not left feeling the sensation of confusion as some books contain when shifting scenery the themes in this novel are very powerful and well incorporated the information is definitely accurately researched including historical and scientific elements of the story there are a few editing errors hopefully corrected in the final edition the only part i disliked is that sometimes new elements are introduced and not expanded on or perhaps just extra information that i do not feel add to the story but these are only a couple overall i highly recommend this book and i've already put it on my husband's reading list","538":"this review has been hidden because it contains spoilers to view it click here this is one gorgeously written novel rich in themes wonderful prose complex u0026amp real characters and evocative of landscapes and emotions that made me feel as though i was right there with the eapen family i have a plethora of random questions after reading this 1 who is mira jacob and how come i've never heard of her before not only is she an exceptionally gifted writer but she is an outstanding narrator i had the pleasure of listening to the audio book narrated by her and her readi this is one gorgeously written novel rich in themes wonderful prose complex u0026amp real characters and evocative of landscapes and emotions that made me feel as though i was right there with the eapen family i have a plethora of random questions after reading this 1 who is mira jacob and how come i've never heard of her before not only is she an exceptionally gifted writer but she is an outstanding narrator i had the pleasure of listening to the audio book narrated by her and her reading was plain exceptional and lifted my rating of this book to a 5 star experience her voices and indian accents were fantastic never silly and massively complimented and already brilliantly written dialogue 2 what does the title of novel mean i have no idea yes there is a sleepwalker and there is dancing but i don't get it someone please explain catchy though given the many mouth watering food descriptions i may have preferred a cooking reference in the title though i want to eat curries and samosas for a month now to let the book linger in my life a bit longer 3 do we ever get over the grief of losing our loved ones prematurely if we don't deal with grief adequately does it fester and rage under the surface this novel dealt with the layers and evolution of grief in such a raw yet sophisticated way it took my breath away at times having to turn off the book and pull myself together 4 does the restaurant frontier in albuquerque still exist or is it made up though distinctly not indian cuisine it sounded like fun and i feel like i want to visit in fact as if i didn't have enough good reasons to want to visit abq and seattle now i really want to go to both places 5 why has this book not enjoyed more attention since its publication in july i understand it's a debut novel but it's sooo good and i have heard noone bar one friend whose goodreads review drew my attention to it talk about it totally underrated in the light of other 2014 pubs a five star review is in order simply to raise its profile me thinks 6 how has the research on narcolepsy progressed since the 1980s is there a cure yet i know google is my friend but i am just wondering out loud i don't actually need to read the latest studies on it it's just so mind boggling that a bizarre disease like that can cause such devastation to someone's life i hope it's rare 7 why do we use the term dysfunctional family aren't all families dysfunctional to a greater or lesser extent isn't that normal family life to have problems issues secrets and taboos i do hope that mira jacob is already writing her next novel because i want to read more by her the comparison with jhumpa lahiri is inevitable given the subject matter except this is a much more engaging novel to me than the lowland for example the back and forth in time was so smooth and effortless in jacob's book that i had no preference to either storyline the setting in india in the late 1970s was an added bonus i really did love this book an immensely gratifying read more","539":"loved it good story and some beautiful writing","540":"this book made me love to read books again","541":"i can tell mira jacob is going to be one of my favorite writers she just released her first novel and already i can't wait to see what she writes next fabulous it's not often a writer stuns me with her eloquent spot on turns of phrase wonderful wonderful wonderful i loved this book","542":" it took me a while to get into this book and to like it the first part as read by the author felt like an unsympathetic characterization of indians who immigrated to the us it felt disrespectful to me however the last part of the book delves more deeply into the characters and reveals many of the trials conflicts and secrets that motivate them the characters become more complex and likable as the story progresses and the close relationships shared by indian immigrants in albuquerque brings forth the caring that lies under the surface of testy relationships","543":"absolutely delightful i laughed and i cried i enjoyed every minute of this story","544":"a little too frenetic for my liking layers of family history and pain but at times i felt that it was slapstick and dark humour","545":"an author's debut novel about an indian family wrestling with its past and its future the journey ranges from 1970 1980 india new mexico and seattle a story that will touch your heart and told with humor and sympathy for its characters","546":" wow a fantastic book a very emotional book this is a book about immense grief of losing a loved one it is also about family in all its glory this book worked for me on so many levels i could see the various characters so clearly and understand their motivations perfectly the author has nailed the immigrant experience felt by so many of us the feeling of never feeling completely being part of this society but also accepting the fact that we can never go back this book reminded me of the quote i heard in the serial podcast when an parent dies they are buried in the ground but when a child dies they are buried in their parent's heart","547":" i found it an average read i struggled a lot to take an interest but the story began on page 150 the book caused me annoyance in several places where the author made references to events and did not explain i felt i was being told how obvious it all was while i had no idea what was going on for example when akhil is told he can no longer drive and his father on page 291 states that facing challenge head on is about becoming a man the author continues saying akhil looked away sucking on a secret which amina immediately knew what it was that was never explained i did not get it and was left hanging this type of vague assumption we know what she means bothered me 5 6 times throughout the book i kept reading hoping for an explanation that never came the reporter who spoke to amina about billy mccloud and her photo asked several questions in which amina gave other answers unless you read the book a second time the conversation did not make sense ben kingsley for the love of god page 108 none of this made sense i did find it rather odd that sunhil had a mental disorder akhil had a brain malfunction called narcolepsy and the brain surgeon thomas has an inoperable brain tumor male hereditary problem all the worry about talking to grandma in the beginning came to naught why did granny show up in the photo and why did amina tear it up why did amina see akhil it served as the device for her own father's undoing why did her father stop treatment when the tumor was shrinking why give up father had little concern for his family and was a workaholic the title the only sleepwalker in the book is sunhil who also loved to dance reference again to dancing on page 260 says that thomas and kamala moved like dancers thru the house never touching never bumping into another choreographed over many years of practice would i recommend it not really i was unimpressed and would not have finished it except it is for our bookclub that i read it","548":"lovely tale of families both those you are born to and those you choose for your own and a story of life love and loss halfway through this book i took issue with the author's slow pacing but in the end i appreciated the slow rhythm and wonderful storytelling","549":"this book blew me away i read it while flying home due to my mother's heart attack and so i could really relate with the whole notion of facing a parent's mortality i am also an immigrant myself so that aspect really resonated with me as well jacob's prose is so good i just really enjoyed reading every word she wrote and let's talk about the food oh my goodness i wanted to eat everything kamala made i've never been a fan of indian food but after reading this i'm changing my mind and can't wait to go out for indian read this book","550":"brilliant marvelous definitely one of my favorite books i've ever read the writing is fantastic the characters are rich and deep and the story is compelling and a touch suspenseful with just the right amount of magical realism love","551":"superb writingthe story is a difficult one at times to read but filled with every emotion including joy regret and steadfast love the characters feel so real that it seems you know them personally family love is never simple but there is nothing g else that compares with this emotion","552":"this review has been hidden because it contains spoilers to view it click here this novel started out strong but went downhill after the addition of the trite love story it didn't add anything to the main plot so i'm not sure why it was there it just felt like a device to make it more appealing to the masses i've noticed many promising novels by female authors have always have this thrown in like some editor suggested like you know what this is missing a love story worse still the story between jamie and amina came off particularly contrived what real perso this novel started out strong but went downhill after the addition of the trite love story it didn't add anything to the main plot so i'm not sure why it was there it just felt like a device to make it more appealing to the masses i've noticed many promising novels by female authors have always have this thrown in like some editor suggested like you know what this is missing a love story worse still the story between jamie and amina came off particularly contrived what real person is actually attracted to someone they liked in high school 15 years later when they visit home for a week who the heck still lives in their small home town i also hate this trope where a woman acts crazy raw and vulnerable three weeks into dating someone and this somehow leads to an insta relationship with perfect guy it would have come off better if it was more real like she was using sex as an escape this was hinted at a couple of times but then the realness was derailed when after some actual thoughtful introspection the next paragraph amina inexplicably thinks to herself that she was falling in love with him wtf there were also a few anti feminist comments thrown in here and there that totally unnecessary more","553":" i have to admit i strongly disliked it at first it took over 80 pages for me to get into it the downfall was that too many characters were introduced at once and going throughout different times was very confusing once you understood the characters and their relationships traveling back and forth through time became much more manageable and the point of the story became more evident despite being so long i felt like i still wanted a little more closure at the end with so much storyline i need more closure","554":"i won an advanced reader's edition of this book from the goodreads first reads program and i'm so grateful because i love discovering talented debut authors mira jacob is clearly among the best i can honestly say this book - weighing in at about 500 pages - was worth every word that's something i can't claim of the longer books i've read this year jacob took the time and the pages to develop realistic flawed but lovable three dimensional characters i can't say enough about the character development and realism of the dialogue oh my kamala the main character's mother ... the author portrayed her so well through dialogue alone kamala's continual calling of everyone \"dummy \" in a somewhat affectionate but also terse manner spoke volumes of her character and then there were kamala's physical reactions and the author's subtle descriptions of kamala's body language ... this truly is show don't tell at its best the story unfolds with an adult amina and her 'cousin' dimple who both moved from new mexico to seattle amina a photographer and dimple running an art gallery we sense that they are trying to find their place in the world not only as the children of immigrants but also as young independent women caught between cultures through alternating chapters that take us from the present back to india in the 1970s when amina was young then to new mexico in the 1980s with a high school aged amina we learn of her family's cultural struggles personal struggles and triumphs leading up to the present day story those chapters reveal so much about the family's dynamics and personalities i don't want to reveal too much about the storyline itself for fear of ruining it for the reader so suffice it to say that for me the simplified essence of this story is family yet this novel is far from simple while it focuses on a father daughter relationship at the surface it is also about those people we adopt as family - who become a part of our 'tribe ' it's about the pull and tug of familial ties - the heartbreak the love the laughter the sadness this book is a lovely literary accomplishment also containing themes about \"place\" and connections to the past this is the kind of story i love as it allows the reader to read for story only or to embark on those fun \"treasure hunts\" i enjoy so much seeking metaphor symbolism and thematic connections that are there if only the reader will look what's more even though this is a \"quiet\" story the tempo is heightened by a series of 'mysteries' that will entice you to keep flipping pages perhaps my biggest accolades are reserved for jacob's gift of writing incredibly poignant scenes - not overstated or overly sentimental - yet heart tugging toward the end of the story i can't count how many times the realism of the scenes the true emotional truth of them snuck up on me pooling in my eyes i'd recommend this book to anyone who appreciates literary fiction but even for those who are drawn to ya since many of the scenes are written from the teenaged amina's perspective i hope this book does well and continues to earn praise it is so deserving","555":"wonderful characters wonderful plot wonderful use of language jacob is a fine storyteller","556":"i enjoyed this book but was disappointed by the ending it felt like she needed to finish the book so she wrapped it up too quickly","557":"all i want is for a book to make me laugh or cry and this one did both these characters these families and their heartbreaks and squabbles and hilarities were real to me i imagine that there are invisible pages out there in which they are still taking care of each other lifting each other up and driving each other crazy i loved this book","558":"3 and a half rounding up theme of deaths in family with unresolved struggling relationships fractured worse by the deaths that occur author makes you look at places we would prefer not to","559":" this book started off with so much promise the first 50% of this book really pulled you in you were invested interesting and dying to see where this ride would take you i love indian characters and jacob really started this book giving me everything i wanted in a good book unfortunately i felt the book was entirely too long about 60% into the book i just wanted it to be over i stopped caring about the characters i was no longer enthralled i was more annoyed about hearing all these details that didn't seem all that important to the characters or plot progression i really wanted to like this book because it started off so strong but i have to say jacob really lost with me with the length of this book","560":"my favorite for a while wonderful story vivid characters great book","561":"an absolute gem beautiful prose captivating characters and subplots that weave together effortlessly","562":"i really wanted to like this book but i found the story overly busy too many plot lines too many time periods back and forth the storyline to which the title refers is lost in the mess there is much to like interesting characters bittersweet poignant tone just not enough for me today while she's not a bad narrator i don't think the author does herself any favors reading her own book","563":"it took awhile for me to get into this book it switches time periods each section which at first was confusing but i enjoyed it by the end i liked the main character but i wish some of the stuff at the end went into more detail there was a lot of detail in the beginning pieces and then not much at the end","564":" this was a well written novel with a nicely developed main character that mostly suffered in my estimation because it just packed in too many awful things in a strange way too i felt like amina was a relatable and pretty likable main character she was uncomfortable with the situations she found herself in and jacob reflected the way grief works differently in different people in a way i found compelling i can't really talk that much more about the book without giving away some key plot points so spoilers below view spoiler i know there must be people who have this many truly tragic and awful things and their lives and i feel awful for them but in a novel it just felt like putting way too much tragedy in the grandmother uncle sil and cousin all burned up in a fire which also destroys the family home back in india jesus the brother has severe narcolepsy is finally confronted about it and then dies that night in a car crash it was never clear to me if this was suicide or an accident and i was also bothered by the fact that i didn't know whether paige was in the car with him for like 100 pages after the accident is described the father is dying of an inoperable brain tumor and spends his days conversing with the dead i don't know the death of akhil and the death of amina's father sort of worked together as akhil coming home is so central to the degradation of amina's dad but coupled with the total awfulness of what happened in india i couldn't help but think it would leave amina way more messed up than she was another major complaint i feel like the book was largely trying to show how non traditional the women were which i liked both dimple and amina are having sex with various people though this was confusing with amina because she seemed generally so closed off and weird around other people it was unclear who it was that she was sleeping with they're smoking they're arguing with their parents but the way the book was constructed was basically to give them a happily ever after by both falling in love and therefore being happy with their lives it was just sort of gross and jacob addressed that a bit dimple not wanting to tell her mom about sanjeev because then her mom would just gloat her brains out but that was a novelistic choice that didn't work for me at all i was pretty frustrated by the whole love story i thought there were too many sort of drifting threads that i thought would be picked up so much detail about that first wedding shoot and it seemed like that was going to go somewhere but no other than the photos being included in the show at the end another major thread was ammachy and her general awfulness that never really got addressed she just kind of got killed off and then comes back at the end for thomas i don't know the whole india section was so interesting and then all those people were basically killed off and ignored for the rest of the book that was problematic for me hide spoiler","565":"an incredible debut novel","566":"all i can say is amazing now i'm going to go dry my tears","567":"a beautiful read while it could have been at least a few chapters shorter i loved the way the story was told in layers the symbolism of what was happening and why only fully came to me at the end","568":" i love this book i don't know who recommended it to me or if i picked it up off the shelf at the library but i didn't know anything about it before i started listening to it the audiobook edition i enjoyed it on so many levels it's a very interesting to me window into east indian and indian american culture with the complications that arise between parents who grew up in india and their american born children it was also a very believable story about a family's response to the accidental death of one of its members and although this is a debut novel for this author i thought the writing was very good with some lovely descriptive passages and very realistic dialogue the recorded performance was very well done the reader managed several different character's voices with degrees of indian and american accents i recommend this book i flew through it not wanting to stop listening until it was done","569":"i would've liked to give this a 4 5 but i couldn't go any lower","570":"hmm this one was enjoyable funny at times relatable and well observed but it doesn't make me feel like running out to tell everyone to read it i enjoyed it and clearly others do as well and some of the humor and dialogue is do great but the stunted nature of some of the family dynamics made it a bit meh for me","571":"this book grips the reader from the opening sequence as it jumps from brain surgeon thomas eapens hallucinations in new mexico to his daughter amina's misadventures as a talented seattle photographer and then delves deep to his very divided and very crazy family back in india as the author mira jacobs weaves in and out of these three unrelated stories and travels back and forth in time place and cultures we are drawn into the tragedy of amina's intellectual brother's 'big sleep' episodes and tragic death all this is held together by amina's mother a constant figure with her comfort food and incessant nagging it is a 500 page book but the complex emotions and family dynamics make it a page turner","572":" i'm a slow reader with an infamously short attention span so it says a lot that i read this book cover to cover in two days it is an imminently enjoyable read strongly felt and deeply human at once painful and uplifting adorable and sexy pensive and playful it could be described as an exploration of death its processes and its myriad repercussions in those it leaves behind but it is also necessarily a celebration of life of those moments of warmth and kindness in all its forms about how we grow as individuals and as families and learn to appreciate each other despite because of our flaws and sure there's all the technical stuff beautiful prose thoughtful structure pacing blah blah this stuff is all there but it's not what i remember i remember experiencing this story as if it were my life these are characters i grew to love and found myself talking about as if they were real people the richness of this family makes it hard to believe that they don't go on bickering at the dinner table even after i've closed the book this was a family i felt invited into a part of i laughed aloud at them and with them i cried for them and alongside them their tragedies were mine as were their triumphs it's quite a ride and more than worth your time i cannot recommend enough","573":"a few things were a smidge predictable but i truly loved this book","574":"must read absolute love for this book the style is wonderful and the format of the book reverts from present to past in building foundation for describing and reporting the effect of a tragedy on the victim's family family love culture communication illness afterlife it's all here 4 stars this is among my most favorite reads recommended","575":"just read this it's tragic gorgeous and you won't be disappointed","576":"pretty formulaic some funny bits too drawn out","577":"great book best i've read in a while read it","578":"there's a lot going on in this book but stick around because anything challenging of confusing in the first half pays off a hundredfold in the second this book is gorgeous and shines so brightly i really don't want you to miss it","579":"wonderful writing although i find it harder and harder to always follow the author's jumping from one time frame to another and then back","580":" as william faulkner once wrote \"the past is never dead it's not even past \"this line is certainly true for amina a once promising photojournalist who was traumatized by the events leading to her most famous picture - a native american activist deliberately plunging over a bridge since then amina has been navigating her own bridges into adulthood at 30 years old she works as a wedding photographer deals with her dysfunctional parents kamala and thomas and struggles to integrate core tragedies of her past with a keen eye towards the messiness of family interactions ms jacob weaves her narrative back and forth from seattle - where amina currently lives - to albuquerque the home of her parents and to india the land of their ancestry some might embrace the overused term \"immigrant experience\" but for me this was the experience of any family who struggled with ties that do not let go and relationships that cannot be forgotten the novel - tenderly written and often page turning - tackles the themes of familial bonds grief survival and self forgiveness there is not only plenty of food kamala never ceases to create sumptuous meals even during the most stressful occasions but also food for thought in this beautifully written novel at times kamala and thomas are written a little too broadly and comically for the most part though the characters are authentic and lovingly rendered and the sleepwalking yes one of the characters quite literally sleepwalks but the broader theme might be how we all must eventually stop sleepwalking and take hold of our visions it's a most delightful debut 4 5 stars","581":"one of the best books i've read i usually stray away from indian american books as the plots are so predictable however mira crafts an enticing and page turning story that truly brings together career family love and finding identity themes in a relatable tale especially more so if you are a first generation indian american well written highly engaging and unforgettable characters","582":" to me the best thing about this novel was its title i am obsessed with titles so it's not surprising that i picked up this book as soon as i came across it also encouraged by the great reviews it sparked somewhat undeservingly it's not a bad read it's just with few exceptions mediocre very little about it challenged me or took me by surprise or wow ed me in any way it's for the most part simple and undemanding packed with easy to follow dialogues but lacking in substance thoughtfulness or reflexivity although in all fairness it does pick up towards the end despite being a lively book and even refreshing at times the connection between characters themselves or between me as a reader and the characters was flimsy on a more positive note thumbs up for jacob's ability to write a story centred on grief and guilt without descending into bleakness all in all if you're in for an easy unsophisticated read part family drama part romance this book would prove enjoyable","583":"this review has been hidden because it contains spoilers to view it click here i wouldn't

and her older brother jostle with the demands of looking after elderly stubborn parents who are still dealing with their own memories of the past this is one of those books that you feel you shouldn't read too fast as you don't want it to end it's warm and funny with some wonderfully drawn characters that just jump off the page and into your heart with grief and loss echoing through its pages it's also heart breaking a wonderful read for dark winter nights more","584":"just won this book from librarything giveaways thank you this debut novel was a little slow to get started but by the end of the 500 pages i fell in love with these quirky characters spanning 20 years is a story of family heartbreak and acknowledging the painful past coming full circle to the healing present","585":"i really really enjoyed this book it came recommended as a book for summer reading my summer reading got pushed back to october but wow i could not stop reading this book it was quite long but it was a real page turner i was suffering from jet lag and i think unable being to put it down made it worse very well written very good story","586":"3 1 2 stars a sleepwalker's guide to dancing is a big hearted story about a family coping with loss that's well written laced with humor and full of love i always enjoy first generation immigrant stories an very good debut novel and looking forward to reading more of her writing","587":" the title is the best thing about itreally it is an excellent title not merely because sleepwalking is a feature of the book along with some more serious mental aberrations but because of what it suggests about waking up to the full embrace of a life half lived such at least is the trajectory of the protagonist amina eapen aged 30 when we meet her she is a former photojournalist who scared by a brief brush with national celebrity has retreated into wedding work taking her own candid pictures strictly on the side for me the novel first came to life when dealing with amina's profession and in flashbacks the training of her obviously special eye but these scenes are a relatively small part of the book the main emphasis is on her family this is an immigrant story of a kind the eapens are indian though members of the small sub culture of malayam speaking suriani christians in the south--a group dating back more than a millennium before british colonists imposed their own versions of christianity this is not explained in the book you have to look it up--and an early reference to syrian christians though correct is even more confusing indeed i found the opening of the book confusing in more ways than this i could only get my bearings by making a family tree of all the various generations well over a dozen parents grandparents uncles and aunties many of them called by nicknames as well as their given ones fortunately once the preliminaries are over only one family is really important amina's father thomas eapen a brain surgeon in albuquerque her mother kamala and her elder brother akhil to all intents and purposes they are a normal middle class family living in an upscale neighborhood and sending their children to private schools but a family whose kitchen is redolent with the aroma of delicious curries not normal in other respects however when the book opens in 1998 kamala calls amina in seattle to tell her that her father is spending his nights on the porch talking to his long dead mother she comes home to see for herself we soon learn that while the talking is new the nights on the porch aren't thomas and kamala have been living separately in the same house for years we also learn of a great grief in the family and of their various ways of dealing with it there is a suggestion too that whatever is troubling thomas now may be something in the bloodline for akhil has had his own problems also all the time i was reading this after the first 50 pages at least i was thinking i was in four star territory at least jacob writes well and amina is an engaging protagonist but now i am not so sure generally when i finish a book and sit down to write a review i have a clear sense of some aspect that i want to pick up but not so here the novel is really a juxtaposition of three things an immigrant story somewhat downplayed an increasingly bizarre story of people suffering from strange mental conditions and an ordinary but well told story of growing up finding a profession and opening oneself to love each is good but i said juxtaposition rather than combination because i did not feel that jacob succeeded in tying one theme to the others certainly not in any causal way so her novel though excellent in parts remains strangely unfocused i enjoyed reading it but know i shall forget it quickly a high three stars but not quite four and certainly not five","588":"more like 3 5 at times i loved this book but was ultimately ready for it to end i found it very depressing but it has great moments recommended based on the beautiful writing","589":"beautifully written and intriguing","590":" read the full review here http thereandtheir wordpress com 20 when i bought the sleepwalker's guide to dancing i got it solely because of its beautiful cover and an interesting title i knew nothing about it neither had i heard about it but it looked so lovely on my shelf u0026lt 3when i got to reading it i realized that what was inside the book was even more beautiful than the outside if that was even possible the book felt so good because it was so real there was no romanticism of india nor were there any of the nostalgic \"indian ties\" paragraphs that most books that deal with indian citizens living abroad seem to thrive on the characters are real their struggles are portrayed in such a way that one can't just not empathize with them","591":"this is character driven compelling and thoroughly entrancing the writing was great and the family disfunction felt achingly real flawed but believable characters enhance this multi generational and cross continental family saga a great debut novel","592":"this is 400 pages of pure reading joy every moment of this beautiful book feels real and so gorgeously crafted ms jacob spent 10 years on this novel and it is perfection i recommend it to everyone","593":" there are books that grab you from the beginning ones that won't let you go until you've finished i've spent more than a few late nights engrossed in this book amina is a wedding photographer living in seattle she is actually a talented photographer who was working for a local newspaper and snapped an iconic photo of a suicide the book takes place just before the real dawn of digital everything amina is assigned to take pictures at a microsoft party that's where she takes the suicide picture that haunts her now she has retreated from that world still even at a wedding she can't resist taking the shots that nobody wants to see a bridesmaid having drunken sex with the father of the bride a lonely man in a wheelchair in the middle of the dance floor a ring bearer who wets his pants she is pulled away from her life when her mother calls to tell her that there is something wrong with his father he is seeing dead people her parents live in albuquerque where they arrived as young immigrants in 1964 and goes back and forth in time from the present to the past and back again her father is a talented brain surgeon who found his passion it's all he ever wanted to do he lost his extended family because of it and has spent years as an absent minded husband and father now there is something wrong he makes a mistake in the er his assistant is worried soon it becomes obvious there is a serious problem this is a wonderful book that takes the reader on a journey of understanding the only thing that would have made this better would have been a chapter of recipes at the end","594":"i liked all the characters and the story about parents and adult kids","595":" the eapens immigrated to america from india thomas is a surgeon in albuquerque and he begins to sink into bizarre behavior involving hallucinations of his dead mother and other people amina his daughter lives in seattle but goes to albuquerque when he gets sick akhil his son died several years ago the family including the extended family is loving caring and a bit dysfunctional amina and her mother kamala care for thomas as best they can he is waiting for akhil to appear good story with aspects of indian culture and family dynamics","596":"overall i did enjoy the book and the story line probably a 3 5 star book for me i enjoy reading about other cultures well developed characters and serious emotional situations the first 400 pages drag a bit with the last 100 pages exploding in story development imo the book needed to be shorter and the main character taken to the same depth as the supporting characters","597":"i simply cannot get past 50 pages of this book and i literally almost fell asleep trying to read more of it the writing style doesn't intrigue me at all too many moving books lately to waste my time slogging through this one i don't recommend this book at all given i could barely get to 50 pages","598":"i love the voices mira brings out in this book it is very like many of my indian friends living in australia and their family ways love it","599":" somewhere between it's okay and i like it definitely not an upbeat book view spoiler death by house fire intentionally set grandmother parents and son death by suicide death by car accident death by brain tumorlet's not forget infidelity teenage angst and familial dysfunction oh and the ever present word fuck and its derivations fucked fucker fucking after a time it distracted maybe i noticed more because i listened along with reading the book but still enough already hide spoiler least liked characters dimple and thomas though he has his moments view spoiler his relationship with his daughter amina can be sweet when he deigns to be present he disappears from home life when it suits him that infidelity thing and returns when it suits him he downplays his son's symptoms beginning narcolepsy mainly because he's not around enough to be aware of them yet in he roars with diagnoses he's the catalyst for most of the bad stuff that happens in both india and america hide spoiler i felt sad while reading just because one and all seem so unhappy a somewhat different feeling than saying i read a sad book if that makes sense","600":"the plot and the character development is well done in jacob's first novel i loved everything about this book","601":" this is one of the best books i've read in quite some time i didn't feel like i was reading another immigrant story but it was so relatable pulled at my heartstrings and i was in love i couldn't put this book down i started on my way to the caribbean for a beach vacation and finished within 3 days the writing is light and deep at the same time there was so many themes interwoven the relationship between amina and dimple reminds me so much of my relationship with my cousin the universal term for family that isn't blood family highly recommend this book great job mira jacob","602":"3 75 stars for me despite the self conscious title darkly funny with wonderfully paced dialogue and compelling characters' lives you can get lost in beautiful meditations on allowing oneself to be haunted by the past or embrace its everyday presence in your life accepting fateful choices and their ongoing impact carving out an identity that both encompasses and is separate from a family's immigration ethnicity and familial ties and letting go","603":"excellent really enjoyed this book","604":" with the numerous positive reviews in both goodreads and national newspapers i was expecting to love sleepwalker's guide to dancing unfortunately the novel was a disappointment the voluminous length was its first problem the many superfluous characters and details were distractions second the plot driven story narrated by a third person was not the best format the novel would have been more interesting had the chapters been voiced by the main and even secondary characters this would have enabled me to understand the characters better and even connect to them on the plus side i liked how the story vacillated between past and present the transitions were fluent and smooth i also enjoyed the descriptions of indian food served i am undecided if i would recommend","605":"normally i like losing myself in a sprawling indian saga but this one never held my interest a storyline teetering on the edge of melodrama made it never seem real the jumping around in time made me lose focus on where the characters were in their arc and wholly unlikable characters never allowed me to care what happened to them so all in all a big miss","606":"beautifully written","607":" there is so much here i don't know where to begin amina's parents are from india and she grows up in new mexico we watch her life through trials and tribulations to put it mildly she settles in seattle as a young woman and talented photographer amina is all of us even men to me she is the crux of the book putting up walls after hurt and grief an american girl affected by two cultures of her parents and one in the us and so many ghosts real ghosts and the ghosts we all see everyday i love books that move from past to present and vice versa and jacob does this one seamlessly jacob says so much in this book that i have thought in my lifetime i recommend it highly it hit a chord in my heart that will forever be felt","608":"magical and engrossing i couldn't put this book down mira jacob is an incredibly talented storyteller weaving together tragic loss and family and humor in a beautiful way","609":" i loved this book it's one of those books that was largely ignored in my part of the world but something about it caught my attention and i wanted to read it and it found me in a bookstore and i bought it then it languished on my shelf until the perfect time to read it reading the author interview in the back that is somewhat how the book was written too and i think books that are written and aged and put back together are the best this is the story of a photographer it's the story of a daughter a sister a lover an indian an albuquerquean a lost girl in seattle a first generation a marriage a family illness and loss love hope it's funny and it's sad and it's wacky and it's realistic it's life and i want to share it with you if you've been there and you've found your sense of humor again i hope you'll read it","610":"one of my 2014 favorites","611":"i loved this book the characters the dialogue the perspective lovely","612":"very good book 3 1 2 stars this reminded me a lot of my big fat greek wedding but only an indian version","613":"so many beautiful elements to this novel at the core it's a story about a family but it's also about loss and art and redemption and the big bubbling mass that is grief it was a little slow to start and the ending felt a little rushed but the book was a joy to read looking forward to more from mira jacob","614":"this is by far my favorite book to date this year","615":" mira jacob has a knack for writing interesting characters as a debut novelist she has some work to do on developing story arc but what this novel lacks in plot it makes up in identification and that's no easy feat when what you're trying to get readers to identify with is a dysfunctional east indian family i never thought of albuquerque nm as having a vibrant east indian community but what do i know this sense of fish out of water sets the stage for the rest of the novel where the protagonists never feel like they truly fit in decisions made by thomas the patriarch of the family have startling repercussions but who is to say what would have happened had his decisions been different overall there is a sense of close knit relationships which though neglected never are far from the surface jacob gives a detailed and nuanced picture of that culture however accurate or inaccurate it may be i love debut novels and this one is exceptional i look forward to ms jacob's sophomore effort","616":"this book is funny and sad and touching and i just loved it by the end i feel like i know this family deeply and fondly highly recommend","617":"really a 3 5 i enjoyed this book but there were some holes in the story warning it makes you crave indian food","618":" i won this book through a goodreads giveaway thanks again goodreads sleepwalker's guide to dancing opens with protagonist amina eapen receiving a worried phone call from her mother concerning her father's recent penchant for engaging in full on conversations with deceased family members concerned amina decamps from seattle where she has established herself as a wedding photographer to her hometown of albuquerque the story then spans through three decades and two countries to help paint the picture of the eapen family as they cope with immigrating from india adjusting to life in america weathering the challenges of growing up and dealing with a collective broken heart this sprawling historical novel is both effortlessly spellbinding and deeply profound i read that it took mira jacob ten years to finish this and the depth and tenderness she thoroughly developed the characters really shines through she courts powerful emotions with precision and lovingness sleepwalker's guide to dancing is an impressive debut and a fabulous read","619":"author flows well with humor and sadness not my favorite but a good read","620":"a pleasant surprise i saw this on a list of forthcoming books sometime in 2014 added it to my library queue left it there for months and actually checked it out by accident thinking it was a different novel i picked it up was immediately drawn into the story and devoured from there i liked the voice of the main character adored her father shook my head at her mother and enjoyed most of the other characters and story line give it a try","621":"i was worried that this book was going to read like some sort of horrible romantic comedy the fact that the main character is a photographer and a strange reference to kurt cobain combined to be off putting at first but it actually reads like a pleasant romantic comedy family drama it was a fun read and perfect for this busy end of school year time","622":"this review has been hidden because it contains spoilers to view it click here i want to like this book more than i actually did i feel like the characters could have been developed further and i had a difficult time with the flow and pace of the book i think it was an interesting story and shows the long difficulties that parents have to face when loosing a child but i just wanted more from the book overall i wanted it to be more captivating slightly more magical and i feel like there were too many loose ends when the book ended i was really bothered by the fact th i want to like this book more than i actually did i feel like the characters could have been developed further and i had a difficult time with the flow and pace of the book i think it was an interesting story and shows the long difficulties that parents have to face when loosing a child but i just wanted more from the book overall i wanted it to be more captivating slightly more magical and i feel like there were too many loose ends when the book ended i was really bothered by the fact that akhil did not have a narcoleptic episode when he was arguing with his parents about giving up the car keys i don't know much about narcolepsy but how it was portrayed at other parts of the book i would think that would trigger one i suppose that would not add to the story but seems not very realistic more","623":"heartbreaking and hopeful in turns with beautiful writing i loved this you need to maybe return to your past sometimes to put it to rest and head into the future","624":"best book this year it took a couple chapters to get into it but then i read the rest in two sittings","625":"nice story but didn't leave a lasting impression just a nice read i'd give it a 3 5 stars","626":"i thought this was excellent and i really hope jacob writes more books i gave it a 4 over a 5 because it took me a while to get into the story but once i did i was hooked and couldn't wait to see how it all unfolded i found the look into first generation indian american culture very interesting","627":"food photography and a family that makes you crazy in sickness and in health","628":" this was a selection for book club i wasn't sure what i would think of the book and then i started reading wow the characters immediately drew me in and the author's ability to jump back and forth from calcutta to new mexico to seattle as well as between different time periods was fantastic this is a story that makes one really examine family loss and the meaning of truly living a good life it also causes questions about death afterlife and how we react and handle both situations when they become unbearable loved it","629":"is it just me then all those glowing reviews and i found the book extremely boring its a long not in the least bit funny story about a dysfunctional indian family who never mind the storyline is just stupid the characters are so one dimensional none of the characters communicate properly if they did the book would have finished 300 pages earlier the ending aaargh i am so mad at myself for putting myself through this i am just not a literary buff maybe thank god for that","630":"this was an engaging engrossing book about a family from the kerala region of india who settle in new mexico the title is perplexing only one character both sleepwalks and dances and he is not fully drawn in the novel although i think the author wants him to loom larger than he does","631":" i got this as a goodreads giveaway i'm between 3 and 4 stars on this one i loved the characters and was deeply attached to them to an extent that astonished me it's been quite awhile since a book made me cry they are wonderfully written and jacobs has a fantastic ear for dialogue the people in the story are so wonderfully realized that you almost don't mind the flaws of the story they are in and yet i wish jacob had a better editor there is enough material in this book for two novels and while the added detail helps to round out the characters the way that everything converges ultimately with somewhat unseemly rapidity makes it feel a little too neat what is worse the many unique and creative aspects of the book are frustratingly counterbalanced by occasionally stock plot devices and a tendency towards a simplistic sentimentality it is an enjoyable read and i certainly look forward to whatever she does next this book definitely has its flaws but given the chance the characters in it are so wonderful that they will eventually win you over more detail on the blog","632":"great audio book not sure if i would have enjoyed reading but really loved listening to it","633":"i'm giving this a solid 3 5 stars it was good not great","634":"this review has been hidden because it contains spoilers to view it click here i listened to this as an audiobook and mira jacobs did an amazing job of narrating her own book i fell in love with every character the connection of family through miles and years is amazing most compelling what would you do if you could connect with those who have left you me when the appear the come to you as they were on the best day of their life i can't do it justice it is an honest beautiful story","635":"i really liked this book the language in the writing is wonderful and there are some really hard wrenching moments","636":"i am so glad i listened to this book the characterizations had me laughing out loud mira jacob's narration was unbelievable i went into this expecting a light fun immigrant adjusting to being torn between two cultures kind of story i wasn't expecting the rich characters and emotionally charged situations jacob's writing was very similar to lahiri but with a little bit of weiner thrown in i hope it doesn't take her as long to write her next book","637":"i feel as though i shouldn't have liked this book so much given that i decided to read it based on an overhyped blog from brooklyn who am i i also think i judged it by its cover it shouldn't have such a light and fluffy cover when it's really quite complicated and sad i tore through this one partly because i loved the characters and wanted to see what happened to them and partly because the writing is the fast kind where you can roll through a bunch of chapters really quickly totally recommended especially for those not currently struggling with family illnesses","638":"i tried to read this book so many times eventually i gave up i could not make myself waste any more time on it when there are so many good books out there also such cliched writing about india most indian authors i avoid but then those who i do like feature on my top 10 always i had to give it a shot and i was bored","639":"this book reminded me why i use to devour fiction when i was a kid completely engrossing and wonderful complex characters i slowed down the last quarter of the book because i did not want it to end","640":" this is one of the better books i've read in awhile amina is the daughter of indian immigrants she has moved from new mexico to seattle and is working as a photographer after photographing a tragic event she is shaken to her core she gives up on photojournalism and turns instead to wedding photography she is called home when her mom becomes concerned about amina's father the story unfolds in layers with some sections flashing back to amina's childhood the layers are sometimes tragic sometimes funny but they help shape a beautiful story the characters are believable and well developed the plot is also believable in all its complexities i love the relationships that come and go especially the one between amina and jamie a boy she knew from school and runs into again as an adult really good book","641":"thoroughly enjoyed love books that flick back u0026amp forth btw present u0026amp past","642":"a wonderful story woven with likable characters that presents the dance that families perform with one another of words unspoken and wounds left open over the course of a lifetime it's beautiful and sad and happy all at the same time","643":"published dallas morning news 16 august 2014 03 26 pmnear the end of the sleepwalker's guide to dancing an indian american woman named dimple tells her mother that she and her fiance want to elope her mother can't believe it \"fine fine not coming home and all busy girl with a busy life but a wedding without family might as well have a zoo without animals \"in this funny moving debut novel jacob gives readers the gift of the full family zoo with animals included amina eapen dimple's cousin and the book's protagonist has been living her professional life in seattle off stage from the drama of her family still nearly everything important that's ever happened to her has taken place at home in new mexico near her loving voluble and often difficult family some of them are relations while others are fellow syrian christian indian immigrants marooned in albuquerque who forged bonds as strong as blood amina's parents thomas and kamala eapen emigrated from india to albuquerque in 1968 \"when the city was nothing but eighty miles of hope huddling in a dust storm \"as the book opens in 1998 kamala calls 30 year old amina in seattle to tell her she's worried about thomas an eminent brain surgeon who has been talking for days out loud to family members who died years earlier \"i am thinking he's on his way out \" kamala tells her daughter although amina is a professional photographer and it's june the height of wedding season she begs time off and flies home to albuquerque to get to the bottom of thomas' troubles amina didn't quite live up to her family's expectations for her career rather than becoming \"a vet for puppies and kittens only \" as she declared when she was a child she became a news photographer for the seattle post intelligencer in 1992 when she was on assignment to photograph a microsoft party on a yacht she captured an image of a tragedy unfolding a photo that became famous embroiled her in controversy and rendered her unable to continue her journalism career as the book unfolds jacob reveals that amina's extreme difficulty following this event is related to two tragedies that punctuated her childhood and teenage years amina becomes a wedding photographer as a way to stay financially afloat without having to feel too much about her subjects still when dimple a gallery owner decides to show some of amina's photographs kamala plays it up for the new mexico crowd calling it \"an honor of her artsmanship by the authorities of seattle \"as amina realizes the gravity of thomas' health problems the narrative moves back and forth in time from india to new mexico to seattle revealing all the struggles this family has been through and making it clear how talking to dead people or seeing ghosts makes perfect sense for the eapens page by page this book delights with its spot on humor evocation of empathy and its endearing characters such as kamala \"all sari and tennis shoes and braid and scrutiny \" a world class cook of indian specialties who expresses displeasure by cooking french or american food that leaves the house smelling \"insistently of american restaurants of heavy meat undelighted by real spices \" it's a novel filled with glorious bickering of an intensity that has amina worrying at one point that her parents will split up but she shouldn't fret \"indians don't leave \" her brother tells her \"they're into the whole live forever in misery thing \"the sleepwalker's guide to dancing is a big hearted triumph for those of us who come from families that might sit around late in the day after a funeral drinking whatever alcohol friends and neighbors brought and cracking each other up by remembering the funny things that the departed said and did the eapens will feel like relations even if we weren't raised on appam and chutney jenny shank's first novel the ringer won the high plains book award http www dallasnews com entertainme","644":"i gave this book an extra star because of the food besides being an amazing cook kamala was also a great character she loved furiously and lived fully regardless of the trauma or pain in her life she also provided comedic relief throughout the book usually unintentionally","645":"actually going for a 4 5 on this one i so loved this book flawed but lovable characters the book had some dark themes but was so overwhelmingly optimistic loved the family loved that food once again brings everyone together beautiful first novel","646":"i loved this book and purposely read only a few pages a night this week so that i would not have to say goodbye to these awesome characters i enjoyed this book from the beginning to the end the plot centers on the eapen family indians who relocate to america but are tortured by the history that they left behind in their native land years later thomas eapen begins to converse with dead relatives and exhibits strange behavior at the hospital where he practices neurosurgery his daughter amina is called home from seattle to help her mother kamala determine what is ailing thomas amina struggles with events from her family's past that are thrust into the limelight as she deals with her father's odd behavior this story is both sad and happy at the same time it highlights the struggles of immigrants and also how much a family can and will endure but still make it read it","647":"stunning heart wrenching and honest and witty and so on point with the characters it's not at all preachy but certainly has a message i devoured this book and will continue to turn it over in my mind definitely definitely recommend","648":"loved this book great characters definitely recommend","649":"this book is breathtaking and i hope everyone reads it","650":"loved favorite read of the year thus far life difficult beautiful life made more bearable u0026amp more meaningful by love","651":"i didn't want to like this book didn't want to finish it but promised myself i'd give it 50 pages... somewhere about page 49 it grabbed me and then didn't put it down for 2 days until it was over and now so sad it's over the characters are well defined fascinating and real i miss them and this book already i hope whoever makes it in to a movie doesn't massacre it","652":"if possible i would have given this book 3 5 stars i felt their were some inconsistencies in the writers style that usually would make me dislike the book however the story is so compelling it almost didn't matter","653":"this review has been hidden because it contains spoilers to view it click here i don't seem to be liking any books lately i'm not sure why this book is on so many people's list of books that stayed with them long after reading i struggled to get through it","654":"one of the best depictions of life as an indian growing up in the us i've ever read funny and sweet although it at times felt like the writer was trying to cram a more complex story into the mold of a hollywood rom com i recently heard mira jacob read 2 scenes from this book at the texas book festival and her impression of the mother character almost makes me want to experience the book again via the audio version","655":"not sure what to think of this book i didn't love it but i didn't hate it either i felt like parts of it dragged on and on and then the ending was so abrupt it felt disjointed","656":"3 5 stars way too long and could have easily been trimmed down by about 200 pages a great story overall but the author didn't know when to edit to make the story tighter","657":"i really enjoyed this book it was a quick read although not necessarily light material i loved the characters so vivid and real highly recommend it","658":" the novel took author jacob ten years to write and it's obvious by the involvement of the characters with each other and their indian heritage i would rate this read a 4 5 it's a great first novel moves fairly quickly displays a wonderful darkly humorous and quirky content and a plot that works pretty well it is a bit overly long with too much emphasis on dialogue and the wrap up is possibly a bit over the top but it is fun and telling and all those good things worth the 500 page distance","659":"this is a wonderful book about family differences love and a multi generational saga couldn't put down this first novel by mira jacob you'll be up late reading it enjoy the sleepwalker's guide to dancing","660":"i really enjoyed this book i felt like an outsider looking in an indian family in nm both culture and place not familiar the story told in flashback kept me guessing a good story","661":"enjoyed this more than i thought","662":"i just loved this book for some reason great escape liked all the characters somewhat predictable but just a nice escape","663":"this was a quick read that kept my attention and i enjoyed it a peculiar family but then aren't they all","664":" the whole time i was reading this book i was thinking it was about amina a daughter a photographer a friend a 30 something trying to find her way in the world i was wrong it is a love story it is about a man a loyal and wise father husband and doctor who puts his family first no matter what and no matter how dead they may be it is about a woman an always hilarious but not always rational wife and mother who is loyal to her husband through everything he goes through and loves her children and only wants what is best for them it is about a maybe not so happily married couple who stay together through everything and i mean everything no matter how bad things get they stay together for their kids they stay together because it's the only option they stay together because ultimately they love each other and need each other they are inseparable they may not have the happiest marriage it's true but that doesn't stop them they stick it out because they truly do love each other they are a great example of a strong relationship also thomas is my favorite character his wonderful words of wisdom were so inspiring especially towards the end you were there when she died you have nothing to regret and you will see your daughter married you will see her children isn't that enough brought tears to my eyes was so glad he and amina were invited out to the dance floor for the daddy daughter dance i cried so hard for that one lonely sentence loved it a fantastic look at life and family both blood and otherwise and holding on to the things that matter","665":"awesome really rich characters and narrative that switches back and forth in time","666":"this book was fantastic i was absolutely immersed in reading it falling in love with the timelines and narrative and especially the characters highly recommended","667":"sad but clever at times i loved the characters but wish it had ended a little later i wasn't done learning about the character's lives post funeral","668":"loved it view spoiler i would have loved to know more of how amina and kamala's relationship changed didn't change after what the book tells us though i basically didn't want it to finish i wanted to know more and more about this family and how or if they were able to make the wounds of the past heal at least to some extent i like to think they did hide spoiler","669":"this book was stunning absolutely beautiful all the characters were completely drawn out and i am always in love with books that move from the not to distant past to today along with a little mysticism if it weren't only just january i would make this my book of the year","670":" an engaging and powerful novel about an indian immigrant family the novel takes place during three pivotal times in the family's history a visit home to salem india a year when high school brings enormous change and tragedy to the family's children and the late 90s as many threads in the story come together the story is told from the point of view of amina the daughter whose life work is observing as a professional photographer the novel explores themes of family how they are formed and how they fall apart i especially love the family formed by the indian immigrant families in albuquerque it examines the big questions what is a good life a good death i loved this novel i already miss the colorful eccentric characters i hope that the 1998 setting means that mira jacob might consider following amina into the present","671":" some sections of this book were so lushly fleshed out that reading them was like taking a bite of a perfectly constructed pani puri a little sweet a little sour a little salty but thoroughly satisfying sadly to get to those sections required hiking through some incredibly bland exposition and back story if i could have read those parts in a sort of fast forward montage style i may have forgiven them more easily but i regularly found myself flipping pages thinking to myself yeah but what about akhil what the heck happened to akhil","672":"well written and sweet and painful","673":"i loved this book it was so well written and a very fresh premise each character was well developed and i was completely drawn into the world of amina and her family and friends part of me feels like i should read it again to catch some of the subtler details that help make this book as masterful as it is i highly recommend it","674":"it was a great read well written full of surprises and kept my attention throughout","675":"beautifully written novel that i couldn't put down for a variety of reasons very descriptive which lead me not only on a journey but also into the characters themselves loved it","676":" i received this book for free through goodreads first reads first time novelist jacob has written a sensitive family saga that touches upon the universal emotions tying all families together anger frustration guilt and shared joy and grief the story of an immigrant indian family focuses on daughter amina and her parents by jumping between the years 1983 and 1998 although the adjustment to a new culture and the desire to maintain an indian identity adds atmosphere to the book the interaction among the family members as they deal with tragedy is the heart of the book told with both humor and insight the family's efforts to accept each other while coping with both the past and an uncertain future makes a compelling read althought the novel is about 500 pages it is a fast an enjoyable read jacob expertly creates characters whose reactions to events are shared by us all the dialogue is realistic and the generally simple prose sometimes evolves into beautiful imagery other have compared jacob to lahiri or mona simpson for me there were similarities to anne tyler","677":"these are interesting characters true family related or not it took a darker turn than i expected but still the humour peeked through strong writing","678":"despite working for an audiobook company this was the first time i've listened to a full length fiction title i listen to tons of podcasts and i've listened to autobiographies and freakonomics style nonfiction but never a novel h t to laura hogensen for the rec and she was right the author does an excellent job with the voices and i found myself taking the long way home just so i could listen for a few extra blocks if you've ever wondered if audiobooks are for you this should be your gateway listen","679":"it took me forever to get into this book once i did it was interesting but i feel like it ended very abruptly","680":"this book was 10 years in the making and worth the wait at its heart it is a story of immigration and different family members' ways of bridging the cultural divide but other key themes are relationships and how they are forged and sustained grief in the face of family tragedy and ultimately of love and forgiveness","681":"this is a book about a family dealing with many issues in the past and as well as in the present","682":"the characters all seemed so true there was a quiet compassion grief and even humor that was interwoven in the story i truly enjoyed getting to know the eapens i really hope mira jacob writes more novels","683":"very good storytelling generational story i especially liked the alburquerque and seattle connections since i have ties to both interesting characters and well developed","684":"a very moving debut novel about an indian american syrian christian american family's experience dealing with tremendous losses deaths in india deaths in new mexico i was completely convinced by akhil and amina's brother sister relationship and the way that the family deals with akhil's narcolepsy the novel reminded me in style of something by j courtney sullivan looking forward to more by mira jacob","685":"started off slow but i gradually felt the characters tug at me to finish the story and find out how it ends","686":"absolutely amazing no other words for now edit i ended up reviewing this book on my youtube channel check it out here https www youtube com watch v mpncd","687":"awesome beautifully real and emotional absolutely loved it","688":"wonderful story about first generation children from india lots of sadness in this book as well as some great laughs at the expense of amina's mother and her use of english vernacular","689":"i liked this book which is about an indian family living in the states it gives the old country new country immigrant story quite a shake up it wasn't at all what i expected from the title it was a much deeper sadder and more convoluted story than i thought it was going to be involving ghosts visions of the past thwarted ambitions death loss and family obligations","690":"beautifully told heartwarming story with a community of wonderfully drawn characters that slowly drew me in and kept me caring","691":" yes this book was too long i probably wouldn't have kept at it if i wasn't listening to the audiobook at work however it was written with much care and for the most part interesting characters it started to feel very chick lit ish to me by the end which i'm gonna guess wasn't how i was supposed to feel and my last complaint i'm ticked off that there was so much description of food and yet i never got fed that might have been too much to expect esp from a first time author maybe someday books that use food almost as another character will somehow be able to provide the reader with a large sampling of said cuisine","692":" i really liked jacob's hefty debut the book recording almost twenty years of the eapen family that immigrated to new mexico from india told in several books within the larger work jacob sends us back and forth in time slowly revealing an overall story that is at once just theirs but universal too amina is a good daughter and comes home when her mother kamala calls and says something seems to be wrong with her father back in new mexico many family memories and events eventually all lead to the family backyard and her surgeon father thomas it was hard to decide between the 4 and coveted 5 star rating i wish jacob had extrapolated more on the thread that i felt connected thomas his brother sunil and his son akhil but perhaps that would be better left to book club discussions","693":"solid 4 some places in the middle seemed to drag a bit good immigrant story","694":"this book made me want to eat indian food but also it was a lovely tale of family bonds and ties and webs and knots","695":" sometimes your whole world can change with a phone call when her over bearing mother calls to tell her that her father is talking to his dead mother on the front porch and she should come home amina doesn't know what to think amina goes home to new mexico only to find herself facing the past told in flashbacks that travel from india to seattle and new mexico over the course of twenty years the book is a thought provoking book about loss family and the pressure of being a second generation immigrant the descriptions of seattle are right on and took me back to 1998 before the bubble burst give to readers who enjoyed the namesake and where'd you go bernadette for those who like reading about seattle","696":"i really enjoyed this book i was slightly distracted by the inconsistent quality of the narration on audible but the story itself i liked a lot","697":"amina returns home to new mexico from seattle because her mother hints that her father might be ill there are flashbacks to amina's childhood both to the last family holiday in india where her parents were born and to a later period focussing on her brother and his tragic death finally there are references to amina's adult past and to a famous photograph she took which led to her turning to work as a wedding photographer i found the various shifts in time clear and they gradually built up to a picture of what led up to the present crisis i liked the description of amina's love for but frustration with her mother and the chapter dealing with the holiday in india was so well done that i found it excruciating along with the characters jamie was sweet and i thought the relationship between him and amina convincing some of the detailed descriptions of photos amina had taken were hard to get as enthralled by as i think we were supposed to be but overall an excellent novel","698":" this is a lovely debut novel spanning several generations as well as a multitude of themes such as the immigrant experience and sense of displacement and generational divide parts of the novel deal with very difficult themes view spoiler death and memory loss in particular hide spoiler always very tactfully the slice of life format works very well and the characters are well constructed delightful the novel is bittersweet in parts but hopeful and vibrant i am very much looking forward to reading more of jacob's works in the future","699":"an absolute winner for me this story of an indian aamerican family is filled with the whole scope of life death family disfuncions personal eccentricities and the power control issues in every family the fammily conversations were at times hilarious at times tragic but always true for the characterss i loved reading this book","700":"really enjoyed this debut novel which centered on a first generation indian american protagonist and her somewhat dysfunctional family appreciated that the ending wasn't too tidy but still felt satisfying","701":"so finally i found my type of author mira jacobs just like george r r martin has lots of content to offer her readers yet never does she succumb to the temptation of filing in pages with useless titbits to increase pages of her novel a thing most authors do today this book will win mira jacobs millions of fans just like the kite runner did it for khaled hosseini the story is based on immigrants who settle down in foreign land wiping out their families their culture from their life thomas a brain surgeon settles down in us with wife kamala sending back money to his indian family just like any other nri when he comes back to india for a vacation his mother forces him to settle down in india which he refuses his brother sunil too gives him a rough treatment he packs his bag u0026amp returns back to us one unfortunate day he comes to know that his family is dead due to a fire which broke at their home everthing changes after that mira jacobs just like a master storyteller blends in humor grief horror supernatural elements with ease the characters are so rich so real that you fall in love with them no matter how bad they are the naration is so addictive that i completed this 512 pages book in 4 hours flat the climax makes sure you remember this book for a long time ps beg borror or steal but make sure you read this book","702":"this is not a well written book the main character is a wimp i did not care about and i found the characters boring surprised so many readers give it a high rating mystified in fact yawn wah wah wah i have to curl up in bed and drink because i got a great photograph of a suicide i should have stopped reading then","703":" lyrical but not predictably so mira's similies are like aspen trees on a mountainside in september they shine against what could be a dark background the irreverent touches i'd challenge readers not to hear the voices in their heads give the book a light touch one might not expect from what could be a very heavy premise i'll cop to a bias because i am familiar with at least some of these places and people at least sort of but it should be a credit to point out that now i feel like i know more sides of these places and people and it's made me a little homesick","704":"awesome premise and rather well written but the characters seemed to make a lot of abrupt u0026amp weird out of character decisions","705":"loved this book loved this family loved the many themes of their story and will have to visit them again sometime","706":"my preference is often for debut novels and this one did not disappoint it was complex tender funny sad and redemptive","707":" this book hit all the right notes it's not all that new the family saga but mira jacob executed this flawlessly amina eapen gets a phone call from her mother saying that her father is talking to dead relatives is he delusional maybe he is sick this is followed by a flashback to the 70's where we meet the eapen family on their visit to india to visit the family thomas eapen left behind when he moved to the u s to say that this is a loud family is an understatement there are arguments at every turn but there is also a lot of love there are so many story lines in this book sometimes it's hard to believe that it all works grownup amina is a former photojournalist turned wedding photographer haunted by a career defining picture she took of bobby mccloud's suicide a respected native american indian leader of the puyallup tribe she is also haunted by the past the years growing up as the child of immigrants in new mexico with rebellious brother akhil and dimple a character you will come to love akhil's death as a teenager haunts all the eapens and their extended family and it is this grief that runs as a thread throughout the whole novel and at times it seems like it will pull them all down as is noted in the novel it is a kind of grief that pulls the living closer to the dying or something like that everyone copes in their own way amina seems to spend more time immersed in her photography thomas in projects around the house and kamala finds comfort in faith this is the first time i am learning about the saint thomas christians ancient community of christians from kerala india they are also called syrian christians according to wikipedia they trace their origins to the evangelistic activity of thomas the apostle in the 1st century the writing is good here and it is effortlessly readable the author does a good job of evoking a certain mood with her descriptions whether it is kamala's kitchen filled with the scents of indian spices or the dusty mesas of new mexico or the scent of vidal sassoon shampoo in the halls of mesa prep all through there are paragraphs that you find yourself re reading according to the author's bio it took 10 years to write this the character of thomas eapen is also informed by her own memories of her father who lost his battle to renal cancer she rewrote some of the scenes after his passing and the time and effort shows comparisons will be made to jhumpa lahiri whose writing is also steeped in indian culture and the immigrant experience the note at the back sums it up the book is an interesting exploration of the intersection of the indian i e native american narratives and what it means as an immigrant to make a life in a stolen country one note some of the characters in this book use the f word a lot which might be a problem for some readers still this was well done and is worth recommending 5 stars simply superb","708":"beautiful writing i really liked this book except for the gazillion f bombs","709":"wonderfully rich character development so it was nice to hear about how their day went but the plot lacks substance and ends in a whimper","710":"genuine family dynamics page turner for me","711":"one of the better debut novels i've read in a long time lyrical haunting and moving i'm willing to suspend disbelief for these characters","712":"this book was beautiful the prose was wonderful and the story was simple a story about a family nothing flashy or over the top but very well written the characters felt like family after a while and the dynamic of all three families together made me miss home a little bit i thought the book would drag on because of the length but i enjoyed it the entire time would definitely recommend also it's nice to not read about white people once in a while just saying","713":"undoubtedly one of the saddest books i've ever read up there with a little life but also one of the most well intentioned and well done the writing is beautiful the narrative is strong and even though it clocks in at 500 pages nothing feels too much or out of place i will be thinking about this one for a long time","714":" i enjoyed aspects of this book including the family dynamics the interesting characters and the contrasts between indian and american culture overall it was a good story the problem i had was with the length of the book the writing style was excellent descriptions were vivid and i found it easy to picture everything happening it just took too long to tell the whole thing i found myself waning and considering putting it aside however i stuck with it to find out what happened in the end spoiler alert here so stop reading if you haven't read the book the other thing that i found a little confusing was that thomas's tumour was shrinking without the aid of the chemo but then because he abandoned the chemo he died it is possible to heal from cancer without chemo and i loved that the story was headed in that direction and then it seemed that the philosophy changed","715":"good understanding of other culturei had preconceived notions about indian culture it was good to get a different perspective the characters were flawed and human very believable","716":"this book had it all humor sweetness heart and some really interesting and authentic characters kamila's cooking made me so hungry for good indian food i loved this one excellent audio production read by the author","717":"this is mira jacob's debut novel amina eapen gets a call from her mother kamala in albuquerque saying that something is seriously wrong with her adored surgeon father thomas who keeps talking to family members who are no longer alive putting aside her wedding photography assignments amina flies home to investigate although amina and her brother akhil were born in america their parents were raised in india and came to the states over the objections of thomas's mother","718":" i had been wanting to write for a while but when i read it i realized unless i can a story that significantly alters me it will just be an exercise to humour myself the sleepwalker's guide to dancing shifted something in me read it for the clear narrative and read it to feel what most of first generation indian americans go through the live of the protagonist is weaved so beautifully through her experiences mighty impressed with mira jacob's writing and what she has achieved in her first book","719":" a big fat time jumping novel about a family lots of well drawn quirky and interesting characters here who i quickly became invested in which is probably the thing i admire most about this book along with jacob's lively prose and vivid descriptions i did wish that amina the pov character had more going on especially in the present narrative often it felt like she wasn't doing much like everything was just happening to and around her i wanted her to have some kind of dilemma not that the book lacked narrative pull i couldn't put it down especially of the last 200 pages or so","720":"i don't think i would have rated this book this high except i liked it so much more than the book i read before it i had started it about 2 months ago put it down to read a few i got from the library and just picked it up last night i was immediately drawn into amina's past and present as she was remembering the tragedy of her brother's death in high school while moving home as a 30 year old to take care of her ailing dad the description of indian family and community as well as the truth of loss was deep and haunting and beautifully written","721":"this book made me laugh and cry i loved the characters and their crazy family interactions the chaos i loved how amina finally seemed to wake up and become herself when she went home finally facing her truths so sad to be finished this one i will be thinking about it for a while","722":"this book was fabulous i am stingy with stars but this book was heartfelt beautifully written perfectly paced it was a coming of age story in more ways than one a story of tragedy and family forgiveness and longing i am sad that it's over i just reread the book's synopsis and it does it absolutely no justice it's not a mystery to be unraveled no one knows more than they let on i can't believe someone read this book and then wrote that synopsis","723":"beautiful book jacob does an extraordinary job weaving humor grief and dysfunction with plenty of chutney","724":"while i liked some of the characters kamala for one and the crazy auntie this book did not grab me i had no patience for the major character's troubles and gripes neither did i feel sympathetic for her friend dimple i liked the family interactions with the relatives and friends who were adopted as relatives i found thomas' behavior towards his family before he got sick puzzling and not explained i did not like the predictability of the pairings dimple and sajeev and amina and jamie","725":"it took me some time to slog through this one i can see why some people loved this book but it just wasn't my style i really hated how frantic the dialogue driven story was back and forth back and forth with no pauses no breaks i longed for some more descriptive passages more moments of thoughtfulness from the characters and yet even without much description the book went on forever my god it could have a few hundred pages shorter in my opinion i do think i was able to appreciate the book more as i read on but it was never enjoyable to me it didn't help that i didn't like many of the characters kamala was so irritating and i agree with another reviewer who found amina and especially amina's romantic relationship to be somewhat confusing inconsistent and unrealistic i know i am in the minority here but ultimately i just didn't care for this book","726":"my view 500 pages of the best contemporary fiction you will read this year and probably next year too i hesitated before writing this review actually i did more than that i procrastinated...for weeks let me explain i read this book i fell in love with the writing the dialogue the stories and the family and when i finished this book i didn't know how i could possibly express my feelings and do justice to this book maybe i'll start with the writing - so realistic flows appears effortless and beckons you to keep turning the pages the narrative is complex yet reads beautifully and simply the dialogue is natural full of humour full of meaning and spoke to me the multiple story arcs of family life of growing up of immigration of life with children of shedding skins and discovering who we really are and what is really important of love of death tradition ghosts of the past and the present ...so many stories within a story amazing delightful engaging there is something in this novel that anyone can and will relate to all i can really do is suggest you read this powerful book i know you will enjoy it you can thank me later for the recommendation","727":"this is a beautiful book a meditation on grief and longing and on parents and children amina the daughter reminded me a bit of codi in barbara kingsolver's animal dreams unmoored forced back home by an ailing parent confronting high school relationships which only made me appreciate the novel more kamala the mother was such a fantastic character so richly drawn and alive i could have done without the epilogue but otherwise i enjoyed every bit of it","728":"you know how it feels when you're fifty pages into what you already know is going to be a five star book no more than that a story you know is going to stay with you forever and you feel like you're coming home to old friends that satisfaction that creeps through your whole body as you want to linger on each perfectly crafted sentence but also you are compelled to read faster because you just have to know how it all turns out this is one of those books this is by far the best novel i've read this year and it is making me rethink the other books to which i've given five stars as it has completely blown away almost everything else mira jacob has given us the story of amina eapen a talented photographer living in seattle who comes home to new mexico after her mother calls to tell her something is wrong with her father the story is woven beautifully through three decades of this family's life and by the end i was completely attached to each and every perfectly developed character i actually woke up this morning missing my new friends and am a bit upset that i have finished this story so quickly it's not my fault that i couldn't put it down though the author is extraordinarily talented her prose bright witty and marvelous i don't want to give any of the plot away and i am jealous of those of you who will be reading this for the first time soon my hope is that i don't have to wait too long for her next novel now who wants samosas i'm absolutely starving for some indian food full disclosure i won this as advanced readers edition and i hit the jackpot six stars","729":"amazing heartfelt debut novel revolving around the daughter of immigrants this is the story of how one couple came to leave their family home in india and settle in the american southwest enduring tragedies both in india and in america their daughter amina suffers with depression this is conveyed through her photography through the main character's eyes we see the guilt her father carries in leaving behind his country we see the richness of the indian culture they bring with them in the mouth watering descriptions of the food preparation and the descriptions of the saris u0026amp jewelry although each generation is at odds with the next we see a deep abiding love of family portions of the novel are very dark and were difficult for me to read but i loved amina's relationship with her father i loved the cultural references and i loved the last 100 pages of the book u0026amp couldn't read fast enough by then the beauty of reading books about other cultures and races is that there is often a commonality that everyone shares we identify with each other and differences are breached we learn that our lives have more in common than previously thought for example the quote it wasn't that she expected the world to stop for the funeral but certain things like the country music blaring from the car next to them or needing gas to get to the church or having to pay anyone for anything seemed cruel i understood that feeling of wonder that the world hadn't stopped even though i was going through something momentous and sad in my life i remember thinking the same thing when i experienced my first funeral portions of the book are funny too references to worshiping the band air supply the greats painted on the ceiling the intellectually belligerent student's reply to the english professor a dog named prince phillip etc don't be discouraged from reading it by references to portions being dark a high 4 rating for me","730":"my main problem with the book is that it is way too long and the story could have been told in a lot fewer pages i often found myself bored with the excruciating details of the lives of these characters i know i am in the minority as the reviews indicated that many people really enjoyed the book i was just glad i was done with it it will be interesting to see if i am the only one who didn't care for the book at our book club gathering","731":"an interesting story for it's peek into the lives of an indian family in america and also for the it's depiction of family tradgedy coping healing and letting go the only thing i didn't like about this book was the main character's romance a little to sappy implausible and chick lit for my taste the character would have been more of a heroine if she stood on her own and struggled through her trials by leaning on friends and family and ultimately herself","732":"quirky funny u0026amp sad an introspection of the main character after a difficult loss u0026amp a look at a family trying to come together when the loss u0026amp more anguish is causing them to break at the seams","733":"wow what a book and what a colourful characterful family this story will stay with me for a long time i'm sure last pages and other parts of the book brought tears and tears to my eyes could not avoid beautiful melancholy sad funny tragic loving and highly recommended","734":"an impressive debut novel about family loss and love","735":" i never put it down if i could and that is saying something in my current state at first i was put off by the heavy handed ness with the indian english that the author used in dialogue i couldn't get through without thinking each time really who talks like that then mira j seemed to settle in a bit more comfortably with the characters and it got better the author is brilliant with dialogue i could see and hear every single characters staying true to their voice the narrative flows peacefully between the different time spans but the most interesting part is how convincing jacob is in asking the reader to believe in the absurd and pulling it off rather well i did find the end a bit abrupt and rushed despite the whole thing being a good 500 pages it's saying a lot when he characters continue to stay with you well after a novel has been put down and here i am still thinking fondly of the eapens","736":"following amina eapen as the loss of her brother akhil affects and changes the the life decisions of the entire eapen family the story's told in past and present india to america and is a very detailed and cultural tale about a typical family and the trials and tribulations life throws at them i found the start of the book quite confusing and slow as the story jumps from past to present once i had got the hang of this i loved every minute of the book the raw emotions close family support and friendships had me hooked to the end i highly recommend this book for when you want to get your teeth into something it isn't a light read but it is well worth making time to enjoy the story looking forward to the next book by mira jacob big thanks to goodreads first reads where i won a review copy of this book","737":"i really liked this book a lot and thought it was lovely","738":"this was a book that was introduced to me via my monthly book club it certainly started out strong but got muddled as it dragged its way to the end a terrific cast of characters that i think the author could have done more with especially given the book's length i simply wasn't satisfied by the time the book ended","739":"this book is an epic of sorts very strong start and i stayed with it and was compelled by the characters but very close to the ending i started realizing there was quite a bit to wrap up and i think some parts got short shrift some of the beginning her photography career and her boss jane i wanted to circle back to a little more fully than was done still this is a very good book and it is beautifully written this is mira jacob's first book and i look forward to many more","740":"i just can't spend this time anymore being depressed about other people's fictional lives yes this had funny bits and good writing and heart blah blah blah but here are the trigger warnings suicide death of a child cancer really","741":"beautifully written i would give this book ten stars the characters are like all the people you know or wish you knew it is like a great big greek wedding but sad sweet powerful full of color and light somewhat like the photographs taken by ammie","742":"beautiful writing weaves and binds a story of familial love cultural assimilation and loss ms jacob eloquently portrays grief and letting go through her well fleshed characters looking forward to her next book","743":"listened to this beautiful story on audio and it is narrated by the author beautifully read with her alternating between the younger american indian generation and older indians with beautiful accents i miss these characters already","744":"beautiful book weaving gracefully between multiple narrative strands with the characters sliding off the page into my memories i loved the characters settling into them their grief and their lives one that will resonate with me having just read lost u0026amp found i'm feeling slightly exhausted wrung out by the family grief story i may decide this is a five star book later with some distance devastating haunting and real","745":"really enjoyed this author's first novel a young woman returns to her parents' home due to her father's illness flashes back in time to india where the family is from and to her high school years well written funny in parts also would definitely recommend","746":"loved this book warm touching story great read","747":"entertaining insight into another culture some quirkiness but a solid family saga","748":" a great story but not a fresh idea that is okay it is a well told story of one family over several decades the book jumps from a present time late 90's to the family's past i have to admit the author description of albuquerque where i currently live really pulled me in to book it was well done the author capture the many levels of the city from river boque to high desert the small hole in the walls that are still here and are a favorite there was loss and the growth that one tries to gain from it realization of old pain and new losses all in all a very nice read","749":"really enjoyed the characters and story it's a bit long but held my attention","750":"there wasn't anything i didn't love about this book beautiful story with characters that will stay with me for some time i made myself slow down reading near the end because i didn't want to finish the book i loved the shift from past to present the family dynamics the culture there is heartbreak in this book but also humor and a sense of hopefulness highly recommended","751":" at first i was frustrated reading this book the flashbacks and quick subject changes were confusing and i had to scroll back to check dates and events i soon caught the rhythm of jacob's writing and was hooked she describes family and other relationship situations tragedies happiness and togetherness with tenderness humor and love one caution the book could be difficult for anyone who has watched a loved one make health and life decisions that they felt weren't in the person's best interests on the other hand it is in some ways a lesson about letting loved ones control their own destinies","752":"one of the best books i've read in awhile this is mira jacob's debut novel and i can't wait to see what follows yes it deals with the immigrant experience trying to assimilate into american culture but it's so much more than that it's the story of family and relationships and grief and joy i guess it's ultimately about finding one's way finding what makes you happy but it's more than that too jacob is a wonderful storyteller","753":"riveting style and a very engrossing read i will keep this book on my bookshelf for awhile","754":"a beautifully and intelligently written novel bringing the reader into the lives of an immigrant indian american family steeped in the food and culture of india kamala and thomas come to america to get away from ammachy and her expectations for thomas as her son their children amina and akhil are at the heart of the novel amina is a strong but vulnerable character i loved this book and if you like lahiri or umrigar you will love this book","755":"loved this book great characters great story","756":" this is an epic book covering three different time periods 1970's 80's 90's and settings india albuquerque seattle it's the story of amina and her family their rich and troubled history and how that history shaped the people and events of the present i loved all of amina's families - immediate extended and constructed such a sad event had such a lasting impression on all the members of all of amina's families no matter how hard she tried to move it out of the way while at the same time not forgetting heartwarming and deeply touching from beginning to end","757":"wow great book i loved it","758":"i loved this book best book i've read in a while","759":"this review has been hidden because it contains spoilers to view it click here this book was so beautiful i loved the ending and thomas' peaceful passing there was a lot of peace and reconciliation the part where thomas and jaime discuss jaime's mother death and how he was with her when she died and thomas tells him that he should have no regrets that part was so incredibly touching to me this book at first was hard for me to get into but i'm so glad i finished it beautiful book","760":"this is a sweet and funny and heartbreaking story with hopeful ending it is a beautiful portrayal of families both genetic and chosen","761":"i really like the story for this book and it started really strong and enthralling but i could barely read the last few chapters i was so bored by the book the characters move from engaging to cardboard simple there are pointless repetitive scenes that drag and drag what could be touching emotion is heavy and melodramatic i wanted to like this book so much but it needed a better and more ruthless editor and several notches down on the saccharine","762":"i love a family saga could've done without the epilogue but it was full of life and so satisfying one of those books that so immerses you in its world you forget you're reading","763":"very solid 4 star read interesting jumble of characters that i'd really like to meet that's when you know an author has fully developed the story","764":"a heart touching and thoughtful read amina opens the story as an adolescent visiting her grandmother and extended family in india and the story continues through the time she is about thirty having gone to high school in albuquerque and living in seattle as a young woman amina's childhood home was in new mexico after her father thomas went to medical school in the u s and he and her mother kamala stayed amina's life rolls out in alternating time sequences including her high school years and some of her professional years along the way there are tragedies and serendipitous moments the depth of this story comes from how jacob handles the crucial issues in our lives primarily family relations but also friends and adopted family jacob's exquisite touch with emotion finding pinpoint balance between telling and showing from characters' actions particularly stands out also handled beautifully and delicately are how the characters heal and how they make choices sometimes the choice of what's the most loving thing to do when faced with unpalatable options kamala and thomas and others are strong support my ebook came with an interview with the author in the reader's guide that was worth reading altogether a beautiful book","765":"i received this as part of goodreads first reads initially this book was hard to get into and it may be because of the indian names and the way the author discussed the indian family structure which seemed rather confusing but i eventually grew to enjoy the story presented and her description of how family is what you make it and how you can stick together it turned it a great surprise read","766":"really enjoyed this one i was confused for the first few pages with all the various characters but they all got squared away quickly","767":"absolutely enjoyable a page turner 500 pages long that i didn't want it to end wonderfully written with interesting characters the story weaves together events of the past into the current day plot line","768":" while i love the indian family in america story i've read many so wasn't looking for more when i stumbled across sleepwalkers guide it was the title and debut status of the novel that coaxed me into reading this story the author said it took her 10 years to write this book and i imagine that is partially due to it being such a subtle tale vs a plot driven fast tempo piece thus readers who require clear early movement and direction i suspect will find this book slow and boring to be honest i am not sure what kept me reading so complacently but i suspect it was the feeling of underlying messages being channeled through the characters which after reflection i found to be life is short don't move through it on auto pilot~fear is a prison~don't let others define who you are while sitting back silently~people who love you will tolerate the crazy you do if that's what you need for happiness~in the end this is an introspective novel for the reader as i am quite sure the characters would still continue on unchanged in their approach to life despite the events they have shared","769":" i was annoyed with anyone who interrupted me while i was reading this book the plot seamlessly spanned across different places and time india in the 1970s alburquerque in the 80s and 90s and seattle in 1998 i loved the overbearing intrusive but well meaning indian mothers you will have your babies before your uterus dries up like one turkish apricot i loved the intricate sometimes confusing family relationships my only wish is that more loose ends were resolved in the end the author leaves me wondering about a lot still this book has inspired me to read more about indian culture","770":"i didn't want this book to end lovely realistic portrayal of an extended family and all of their flaws an interesting plotline involving photography a touch of mysticism loads of great writing so good","771":"loved it definitely lived up to the hype","772":"i had a hard time getting into this book it seems that everyone is angry at each other the motive behind all the angst is not apparent but implied while switching back and forth in time at times confusing to follow it wasn't until the very end that i could understand the dynamic between father and daughter","773":"i enjoyed this book a story well told characters i cared about what more can one ask","774":"an interesting exploration of how a child's death impacts the family","775":" so much going on in this great novel i knew when i started reading it it would benefit from a good long weekend but instead it had to travel for the christmas holidays and suffered from start stop sneak away reading even with that disjointed reading process it delivered wonderful memorable characters i learned to really care about several plot lines intersected nicely and i was genuinely sad when i hit the final page the 498th i can't remember who was raving about this one on facebook or twitter but i sure owe that friend a thank you mira jacob is an author i will be eager to read again","776":"it took me 200 pages to get into it and by that point it was all about seeing my daughters name in print amina is a rarity family dynamics are certainly interesting i loved the cover meh i had such high expectations and it was a disappointment","777":"if you like books dealing with family dynamics you will enjoy this story about an immigrant indian family to the u s i loved how the author's weaving of the past and present actually propelled the story forward","778":"although i had a difficult time getting into this book i ended up loving it this story of a big messy family dealing with at least two tragedies the loss of akhil son and brother and the brain cancer of thomas the father depicted grief in a way that felt so true to me it sometimes reawakened my own the author caught the moments that feel impossible to bear and the simplicity of her writing at those moments let them carry the necessary weight after a prologue chapter 1 goes back to india and depicts the pretty terrible dynamics of thomas's family his harridan of a mother his siblings various other family members and i expected to encounter those characters in the book to come they reappear rarely in a couple of places and as ghosts i did not like that and it was partly the reason i had a difficult time getting into the book other women in my book club disagreed and thought that chapter provided critical information but i felt that the bits that were needed could've been slipped in when if necessary after that i struggled to engage the book and found some of the writing kind of false also discouraging but somewhere around the halfway mark it all came together for me and i battled myself to linger or race through linger or race through there were three aspects of the book that made it wonderful for me 1 the depiction of grief 2 the glory of this extended family who barged in and forced the central family to allow them to help and take part because they are family as a person with no family i felt such deep envy and 3 the way kamala opened herself to allow thomas to live his life as he needed to as he approached his death even though his choice all but ensured his death and a quicker death i thought that was deeply beautiful and because i've recently read being mortal medicine and what matters in the end her approach to the end of his life had even greater resonance quite a good book especially for a debut novel i look forward to reading her next book","779":"well written but too depressing","780":"i listened to the audio book and enjoyed it very much it's not my preferred way of reading a book but it felt like it worked well in this case somewhere between a 3 5 and a 4 so indecisive","781":" i received this book as part of the goodreads first reads programi am biased because i grew up in the same small town as mira and we overlapped in high school so many of the places referenced in the book bring up many memories although the book is 500 pages i read it in a single weekend when i woke up in the middle of the night thinking of the book i just had to finish it right then i found both the plot and the characters quite compelling in particular the way the challenges facing the family who stayed in india were juxtaposed with the challenges that the narrator's amina family faced in moving to new mexico","782":"after a bit of a slow start i fell completely in love with this book definitely one of my favorite books of the year and one of my favorites ever also i love the title","783":"the sleepwalker's guide to dancing a novelby mira jacobwhat it's all about a family from india living in the united states thomas father and doctor kamala mother akhil son amina daughter the book is divided into stories that are filled with love and hate and trauma and tragedy and tons of descriptions of indian food this is a big bold and massive book about this family that spans twenty years it's written in such a way that you can read it digest it think about the way this family interacts and lives with each other and then rest a bit until the next thing happens my thoughts after reading this book i did enjoy reading this book although i am sort of at a loss to describe it thomas has issues with his strong willed mother in india issues so deep and destructive that he rarely visits akhil what can i say about this son and his tragic life kamala i don't think i ever really understood her and amina perhaps the most normal and yet i am not even sure about that what i loved best i loved the stories and i did enjoy this book i thought at first that i was not attached to these characters but at the end i was what potential readers might want to know steeped in indian food and familial dysfunction if you are a reader who enjoys a big bold book you might enjoy this one","784":"for some reason this book was just not for me i found the book confusing to follow at times and much longer than it needed to be even the pronouns were occasionally wrong within the text making me reread it multiple times before i felt confident about what was intended parts of the book drew me in only to hit a lull which i would struggle through leading to the very abrupt ending this one just did not resonate with me","785":"excellent book hope she writes more","786":"longer and sadder than it maybe needed to be but sweet and funny and interesting","787":" we arrive in this world connected to people to places to cultures just because we move on with our lives emotionally intellectually or geographically this does not mean that our connections are all left behind in mira jacob's debut novel the sleepwalker's guide to dancing her characters all struggle with connections to each other to their past to their culture and ultimately to themselves for some that struggle includes a connection to reality the story looks at three places india albuquerque and seattle and three times the late 70s early 80s and 1998 when we meet the eapen family in 1979 they are visiting the place and family they had left in salem india thomas eapen a surgeon had sought a better life for his wife and children in america home still has power though and his mother also a physician tries her best to persuade her son to remain we meet the family members who had remained and see some of the strains that might lead one to seek a life elsewhere the motherland still has a hold though and thomas's wife kamala would like nothing more than to remain amina eapen is a photographer working in seattle in 1998 she had been a successful photojournalist but has stepped back from that for reasons i will not go into here and is now shooting events amina has a gift for capturing telling moments and is our camera into the history and struggles of the eapen family dr thomas eapen is seriously ill seeing things that are not there talking to people who are long dead it has affected his work when his wife calls amina she returns home to albuquerque eapen's illness is the maguffin for examining the experience of the eapen family in addition to the strain of emigrating from india and constructing a new life on the other side of the world the eapens suffered a huge loss we learn early on that amina's brother akhil died young the story goes to the early 1980s where we see amina and her brother in school beginning to have relationships struggling to grow up akhil shows some odd behavior sleeping for vast stretches falling asleep in inappropriate situations believing that something glorious is in store for him if only he can complete a particular task it is not entirely clear whether this is eccentricity or a condition and neurosurgeon thomas dismisses it the author from her web siteso there is a bit of mystery here what happened to akhil what is going on with thomas it also takes some time to learn why it was that amina stepped away from photojournalism it is in peeling back the layers of those stories that we learn about the characters there is a bit of romance as well but thankfully it does not at all take away from the story while this is not a laugh out loud sort of read there are plenty of light even delightful moments that will make you smile of course there are very sad ones as wellmuch is made of attachment to place when thomas cedes his ownership rights to a family property in india there is a direct connection to be made to a story to which amina is connected of native americans in the northwest ceding land to the extant society in return for the hope that a large amount of cash can improve their lives there are also smaller scale elements relating to territory to live in the eapen's house was to acknowledge the sharpness of invisible borders the separations that had divided it like two countries since 1983 it had been years since amina had seen her mother wade into the yellow light of her father's porch and as far as she knew thomas had never once crossed the gate into kamala's garden one of the connections made is in the similarities between the old world and the new between generations just as thomas's mother schemes to try to keep him in india amina's mother schemes to try to keep her in new mexico just as thomas's brother spoke to people who were not there in india thomas holds his own conversations with the dead in america both thomas and akhil balk at the limitations inherent in their conditions food is used as a way for old and new to connect cooking was a talent of her mother's that amina often thought of as evolutionary a way for kamala to survive herself with friendships intact like plumage that expanded to rainbow an otherwise unremarkable bird kamala's ability to transform raw ingredients into sumptuous meals brought her the kind of love her personality on its own might have repelled bonds are made through feeding as a way of loving another element is secrecy amina maintains a private cache of her special photographs non commercial ones that epitomize her skill at catching important moments thomas keeps his medical situation secret and a few other things besides and that ties in to feeling like an outsider whether one is a native in a land now dominated by european invaders or a new arrival in america whether one is a black sheep in a family or an ostracized teen at school amina has a wonderful relationship with her cousin the wonderfully named dimple and there is a supportive non parental adult the cool aunt sanji who is able to bridge the gap between the young and the not so young offering understanding and support along with adult wisdom as for the sleepwalking element there is a character who literally sleepwalks and his connection to dancing is revealed at the end thomas's visions might be seen as a form of sleepwalking akhil has big issues with sleep but sleepwalking is not among them and there are other characters who see things that are not there which may be a form of sleepwalking there is a mention in the book of a sleepwalker's disregard for her surroundings it is unclear if the author is suggesting that we are all sleepwalkers in a way or that we should pay more attention to our effects on the world or should attend to our visions did not get it doesn't matter though there is plenty to go with here even if one is not able to cross every thematic t or dot every metaphorical i gripes i would have liked to have seen more well anything actually on the eapen family's experience when they had first moved to the usa we only get to see them once they are already settled amina is engaging definitely worth caring about family is family is family whether the family in question is from india or indiana and you are sure to recognize some folks in amina's clan who remind you of members of yours the story is interesting one gets a strong sense of the warmth and humor as well as the struggles inherent in these multigenerational family connections awake or asleep the music is playing here and it wouldn't hurt to step out onto the dance floor for a while i received this book through gr's first reads program -

america in her thinking children just didn't do that to their parents she couldn't blame thomas he was her son so she lashed out at kamala sunil couldn't cope with his mother so he blamed thomas thinking all would have been fine if only thomas hadn't moved away akhil born in india and raised in america felt he didn't fit in anywhere this caused a lot of underlying anger would all this anger fighting and accusations finally tear the family to shreds this is a very confronting yet normal raw open look at one family's life as it moves from one country to another so beautifully written jacob got it all right the anger the despair the loneliness and the love of family thomas wanting a better life for his family yet working so hard he never saw them kamala disconnected from her culture and

lot of people can't imagine moving from one state to another in the u s much less to another country with a culture radically different from theirs the strength and courage it takes to do that and what becomes of families who take such risks are just a couple of the things that drew me to the sleepwalker's guide to dancing by mira jacob this novel is all about families and their push pull relationships it's also about the disconnect from one generation to the next but it's even more about love hope reconnection and letting go sound interesting be sure to enter our giveaway at http

showed up in the mail however i was wondering why i had wanted this book in the first place the premise and the cover no longer enticed me i set it aside and put off reading it until the last minute i believe the fates must have been looking out for me when i originally requested this book because it was great one of my concerns was that this was going to be yet another story of the indian diaspora in america that's a great story and all but it's been played out there are certainly elements of that story here but they're minor and it's not the focus the sleepwalker's guide to dancing is a delightfully written story of career family and destiny--all those things that make people love star wars seriously people should be standing in line to read this book the prose is fantastic the story remains interesting and poignant through all its 500 pages it's wonderful and it does so much mira jacob goes back and forth between places and time and she does so without a hiccup there are so many subplots going on yet they all fit together and are not only terrific in their own right but relevant to the larger story it flows so seamlessly that you have to applaud the author and her editors the characters are detailed the dialogue is witty the story itself has moments of humor and heartbreak i really enjoyed this book the biggest problem i foresee this novel facing is that it is being published in a year with so many great novels if it doesn't get the right publicity doesn't hit the target audience doesn't attract enough prepub attention this debut may be ignored on the lists of the year's best i'm here to make sure that doesn't happen take note this is one of the most compelling breathtaking and lyrical books to be published this year it's full of life put it on your to read list now and if you want to thank me you can do so later","802":"i'm pretty stingy with my 5 star ratings might have gone with 4 5 stars for this one but considering it is a debut novel i'm going with 5 stars what a terrific book from beginning to end and it's long at 498 pages which is always a bonus for me i was completely engrossed in the story of the eapen family the main character is amina a 30 year old woman living in seattle who is a talented photographer struggling with unwanted fame and attention after a photo of hers spawns a national debate she receives a call from her mother who informs her that her father a brain surgeon in albuquerque is acting strangely and talking to family members who are dead amina reluctantly returns home and there begins a lovely detailed and nuanced story of the eapen family through decades of memories as she tries to help her father and also come to an understanding of her role in her family and her future she's been caught in a standstill due to family tragedy helping her father also nudges her forward the story follows not always in a linear way the eapens as they travel to india for a disastrous family visit when amina is 11 then back to the present and then back again to amina's adolescent years daily life within this family reflects most sibling squabbles parent children disagreements shifts in family dynamics as amina grows older and moments of joy trust and utter love yet the eapens face more tragedies than most and yes they make mistakes but their individual behavior is well so human and believable wonderfully written and believable by the end i felt i had gotten to know amina and her family very well congrats to mira jacob look forward to her next novel","803":"i loved this novel every emotion was felt the characters were lovable and flawed like we all are i really enjoyed the division of different sections of the book bouncing back and forth between the two time periods very well done for a first book and i look foreword to more from mira jacob i received this book as part of the goodreads firstreads program in exchange for an honest review","804":"$1 99 i met the author in austin after i had read and

grief delicious chutneys and sumptuous meals and characters all easy to relate to from india to the states its easy to fall intimately under the spell of 'the private world of reading' the rest of you can go away now the family bonds in this story are powerful we feel connected with all of them i won this book from goodreads give a way thank you congrats to mira jacob on her first novel pretty miraculous i do have a 'few' comments yet i fully enjoyed this book some of the sentences in mira jacob's book felt awkward i was not sure if i was struggling with cultural differences or not words that were chosen to describe a situation did not flow effortlessly yet the story in its 'entire' was wonderful monster's dentures jogging meatballs carnivorously is 'not' a word i'd use when looking at a bride a question that stayed in my mind was will people 'pick' this 500 page book books compete with one another i was surprised to see such a long book by a first time author my fear for the author and publisher is its a 'risk' being this long stephen king and ken follett can write books as long as they want but a new author this book was great but could it have been as good with 200 'less' pages i hope people do take the time to read this 'gem' its a story that that feels real this story matters","805":"although this book involves narcolepsy hallucinations dementia and cancer there is no sleepwalking but at its core sleepwalking is the act of traveling somewhere without conscious knowledge or reason many of the characters spend the book traveling from india to seattle to new mexico not knowing quite why but trying to put aspects of their culture their family lost relatives or lost opportunities in the past eventually most come to grips with their personal demons and tragedies and learn to move forward consciously and with happiness to dance this is a great debut novel with shades of jonathan franzen jonathan tropper barbara kingsolver and abraham verghese","806":" at two pages shy of 500 too long not that this would put me off in itself but i'm afraid combined with the minute print of this bloomsbury 2014 edition and the superfluous hour by hour day by day ramblings reading the sleep walker's guide to dancing proved to be something of a chore unhappy resentful angry dysfunctional obnoxious ok so i didn't like any of the characters arguably not something that should have mattered and i dare say it might not have done had they been well written but i'm afraid i didn't find this to be the case jumping around between america and india between the 1970's and 1990's i found this compounded by the fact that once read i found the words instantly forgettable meant that for me novel didn't flow well hoping if nothing else to come away with a better knowledge of indian culture customs even in this i came away disappointed finding everything about the novel a bit of a cliche perhaps merely too ambitious for a debut novel perhaps i just wasn't in the right frame of mind for a book that despite its attempts at humour i felt was essentially a depressing read a bit nonplussed by the 'ghostly' and 'gourmet' elements and definitely a tad disgruntled that rather than letting the characters themselves tell us their stories and the emotions these elicited we were somehow informed by the author ultimately this just wasn't my cup of tea copyright tracy terry @ pen and paper","807":"mostly great a many layered story of family and cultural tensions well paced and structured for a quick read and a compelling and touching journey through several decades the author piled on superfluous scenes and conflicts in the last qtr but a decent ending always tricky","808":" oh wow this book is something else what an amazing debut novel i live in albuquerque and this writer just nails it i know she grew up here and in fact i met her briefly many years ago at a local private school alumni function but more than anything she just gets it she captures in words on a page what the desert feels like how it becomes part of you when you live in it long enough and what it can do to you these characters are so well developed and the storylines she weaves together for all of them are just gripping family dysfunction illness death grief love marriage relationships between parents and children and how they evolve over the spans of lives maybe because this author is close to my age and has obviously experienced many of the difficult hurdles that come with adulthood and seeing your parents for who they really are and what kinds of people they become as they age and grow frail i related so strongly to her words her descriptions of how grief happens and how life directions change so abruptly and how it feels to fall for a person just resonated with me i am not indian american but i felt like she recreated the culture of indian americans in a way that lets the reader really know what it's like to grow up indian in this country to be the child of first generation immigrants there were so many things that spoke to me about this book and i didn't want it to end i hope she keeps writing i hope she has many more stories to tell","809":" this book was a selection from one of my book clubs and it is a welcome story of assimilation of east asian indians into american culture i recently finished the year of the runaways by sunjeev sahota which is also a story of assimilation of east asians into western society but a far more harrowing and compelling story i can't read tragic stories all the time without falling into a depression so i guess stories like sleepwalker's are welcome for digestible tragic moments and idyllic romantic moments at 500 pages it is quite a commitment but worth it unless you are someone who lives for moments of angst and action","810":"absolutely loved this book simultaneously gripping and touching i couldn't put it down","811":" the sleepwalker's guide to dancing is that rare novel that manages to evoke mirth and tears simultaneously unfolding through the gaze of the ever watchful amina eapen a 30 year old wedding photographer living in seattle the tale thrusts the reader into the exuberant messy lives of the eapen family within the space of a few paragraphs found this quote while googling for the name of the book says it well jacob introduces us to a vibrant group of emigres from india and their children she explores the indian american experience including american indians through their lives but the heart of the book are these vibrant characters who could come from anywhere","812":"i don't know what to say other than that this is a book that will stay with me for a very long time to come it is beautiful and haunting at the same time","813":"this is one of the handful of books in my life whose characters have so much strength and truth that i feel like they are continuing on in the world without me when i come to the end","814":"quoting an other review ...\"what it means as an immigrant to make a life in a stolen country \"this book should be read slowly but i could not help myself from reading it non stopgreat book to discuss so many characters so many questions","815":"this started a bit slow but quickly picked up speed and i ended up not being able to put it down beautifully written touching characters story rang true and wrapped around my heart i wish i could have a bookclub discussion about this one","816":"it started out well but kind of fizzled out towards the end i would be interested in reading the author's next book","817":"you can read my thoughts about this book here http leaningstack blogspot com 2015 and you can read through the whole blog by clicking here and then scrolling down http leaningstack blogspot com","818":"loved the mom loved the story loved how it pulled you in and made you care about every character and feel invested in this whole family the only part that felt forced was when one sex scene got just a touch graphic and it was just out of place read it dummy","819":"life love and death intermixed with regrets and unexpected joys populate this novel about a family from india","820":"storytelling at its best the sleepwalker's guide to dancing follows thomas eapen and his family over three decades and slowly uncovers mysteries from their family's past this book is so well written and the characters so engaging you forget its a work of fiction fantastic read","821":"debut author mira jacob wrote a charming playful melancholy story of family and loss spanning a few generations of the eapen family i adored the characters and their relationships i did feel like parts of the story weren't as well developed as i would have liked for instance amina never really grew her sightings of akhil never really explored she remained aloof and just barely let people in towards the end of the book a great inter generational tale by a debut author","822":"if you liked this book you might also enjoy the namesake","823":"i truly enjoyed this book i had to drive cross country and ended up starting and finishing this book during the journey it was mesmerizing it caused me to look at things a little different i loved the characters and really thought i knew them i docked a star only because near the end things began to drag a little and i felt like fast forwarding but that did not take from the overall joy of reading","824":"excellentstory i listened to it and maryjacobs really made the characters come alive","825":" empty yet fullwow how this author was able to convey how little was said when it should be said and how much meaning can lay in the silence of the missing words and affection between family members is amazing it is very understood by the end of the story just how much love existed between all of the characters despite the fact that sometimes you couldn't help but feel like they hated each other and made each other miserable it is a beautiful story of surprisingly deep love and fierce devotion and committment and how no matter how dysfunctional things may appear this is how normalcy and safety feels to others i feel satisfied after reading this book not at all disappointed or wanting for more answers which is really pleasing i don't like when endings feel unfinished it makes me think the author lacked the creativity to finish what he or she started so they cop out and place the responsibility on the reader to figure out the ending there are still unknown possibilities to the continuation of the characters' stories but i feel like i've been left in a good place at the author's ending and can be happy with the way things are left","826":"story of life story of death the descriptive language is amazing i read sentences over again to fully embrace her choice of words simply fabulous","827":"this is a well written and moving story of a family dealing with loss and while it was sad it also had humor and was uplifting and an authentic look at the life of a family i enjoyed getting to know all the characters i especially appreciated the way the author wrote about food in the story which sharply brought moments of the book to life for me","828":"received free through goodreads first reads i don't know where to begin at first glance i groaned and thought 'i'll never get through this one' i was so wrong i was amazed at how this story just pulled me in and never let go it is through the daughters eyes that gives you the vehicle to travel through the multi generations and their story all of the characters are an intigate part of the story i could go on and on but i would not do the story justice mira jacob is a very talented writer look for her 2nd novel please read this book","829":"note to author i think you just raped me is not funny sexy or romantic","830":"long book sometimes drags but overall quite good takes place between the 70's in india and seattle and new mexico a celebrated brain surgeon has been sitting on his porch talking to dead relatives tells the story of his wife kamala their daughter amina and the loss of their son akhil","831":"simply lovely","832":" the pressure to find a book after finishing the last one always leaves me anxious if you didn't like your last choice there's more urgency to find a winner and if you loved your last book you must raise the bar for your next one i had seen this book on goodreads and read mostly favorable reviews though i didn't know anyone personally who had read it not my favorite divided into separate books seven in total i kept thinking i was rereading chapters i had already read i thought how many times can i read chapter 3 a little disjointed in the telling with characters i felt no affinity towards i wouldn't rush to read this","833":"i love this book at first it made me wish i had an indian family to love me then it made me want to call the author a mom in brooklyn from me a mom in queens to tell her how much i love it i finally realized that what i find so exceptional is how much love is expressed between the characters often using dialogue that could in less skillful hands be construed as demeaning or critical","834":"i thought this was amazing the characters and their motivations are so real can't believe it's her debut novel","835":"i thought this story was good","836":"what a heartwarming story i was so immersed with the characters loved them and felt their emotions","837":" such a great book somehow lovely and caustic at the same time or caustic is maybe not the right word is there a word that combines caustic and vulgar like what it feels like to watch a sideshow performer that makes you feel both amazed and a little queasy which is also what i imagine the main character's photos to look like eh i don't know anyway it's very realistic sometimes bracingly so and sad and funny and i loved all the characters so so much i listened to this because i heard mira jacob speak at harvard book store when i went to see celeste ng in re everything i never told you which is really a perfect companion book well done events people and i was entranced by her reading style so i was super excited to see that she read the audiobook my only complaint was the audio chapter breaks were terrible but i grant that could be because i listened on scribd","838":" this was a beautifully moving story about an indian family trying to come to terms with its past and their present life thomas is a brain surgeon that has started to sit outside on his porch and talk to his dead relatives concerned his wife kamala phones their daughter amina who currently lives in seattle amina takes time off from her job as a wedding photographer i really like that the book also took us back in time to a very pivotal incident in india twenty years earlier the descriptions of indian life food and culture were a joy to read this family saga has a painful past to overcome but their strong family bonds help them come to a satisfying conclusion the author's writing style is extremely addictive she is a wonderful storyteller and i did not want to put this one down i received a complimentary copy as part of goodreads giveaway program","839":"fascinating but sad","840":"for a brief moment i wasn't sure i was going to like this book i am so glad i didn't follow that initial tug to set it down this is a beautiful funny heartbreaking book that made me hungry every time i picked it up in more ways than one the characters are funny full of heart crazy especially when all together in a room but not at all unbelievable or overdone just a beautiful book","841":"loved the story is captivating and the author has a gift with metaphoric language","842":"great depiction of east indian family that immigrated to the u s but maintained strong cultural traditions these traditions both supported and suffocated the younger generation in the novel the various reactions to grief and illness are nuanced and believable","843":"really really liked this book the best in a long time not your typical first generation in america story felt honest and real even though it was a work of fiction","844":"i was introduced to jacob and her first novel it took 10 years to write through her buzzfeed post http www buzzfeed com mirajacob que on talking race to her young mixed race son intrigued by her transparency i picked up the book in a parisian bookstore comparisons to lahiri's are apt but i found this book to be more approachable and particularly resonant with my own life despite the plot pertaining to like the namesake a generation prior","845":"amina is from an indian india family living in new mexico she now lives in seattle and works as a photojournalist when her father begins to act strangely she must return home and deal with his illness and with the difficult memories that have haunted her family good description of family dynamics u0026amp how trauma affects the soul","846":"i'd never heard of this book until 48 hours ago when i was looking up nick harkaway's latest tigerman which i was thinking would be my next read so bit of a lovely detour quite well written themes of family loss fathers and daughters not light fluff but highly recommended","847":"i'm rounding up to 4 stars on this review great writing compelling and touching story but the book veered into cliches at times i still enjoyed it","848":"loved it for many different reasons my favorite book in the past year","849":"this is a great companion piece to 'being mortal' the stories of grief and survival with just real life woven through is a great read terrific","850":"just finished this while on vacation in italy it really drew me in enough so that i had to tell myself to stop reading and explore rome and assisi","851":"this could have been a five star book if more of the dialogue were a little more believable","852":" soooooo i don't really know how exactly to rate this book overall it was a very good novel the characters were multi dimensional and likable it had a solid easy to follow story with loads of details that kept it interesting without overloading it into the mundane as a first book goes it was an a but for some reason my lasting impression as i finished that final page was \"satisfaction\" i liked the book don't get me wrong but nothing seriously blew me away i think this would be a perfect selection for a book club a very solid read that a number of people can probably relate to in one way or another maybe it's just me but i just found that it left no significant imprint once i finished like i had been looking out the window on a long train ride but couldn't remember any specific details of all the landscape i'd passed it was just a nice way to pass the time","853":"the chronology is a little confusing but otherwise so good","854":"4 5 stars at least wonderful book great stories characters characterizations writing i'm incredibly drawn to indian and indian american stories and this is one of the best the dialog i laughed out loud on several occasions and had to stop and try and figure out what was so mesmerizing about some of the things people let rip absolutely great talent with dialog","855":"i really enjoyed this book and it's always nice to read something set in the area i live","856":"amina eapen a successful

india buried feelings his illness is the vehicle that ironically brings understanding and peace chapters alternate seamlessly between 1968 and 1998 india albuquerque and seattle despite the lack of technology so critical for a brain surgeon in india the family there felt abandoned and angry when the eapens moved permanently to the united states in 1968 it would be easy to dismiss their thinking as narrow and perhaps selfish the stories of the extended family in the united states - cooking challenging quarreling fiercely loyal - allow the reader to understand the pull of tradition the loss of their country of origin and the desire to embrace a new world the chapters describing akhil's development are honest and searing his adolescent angst and intelligence burning \"akhil had finally found

the desert her body pulled forward by faith and dirty wind \"","857":"one of the most compelling first chapters i've read in a long time perfect blend of conversation call to action and internal narrative the rest of the book develops a strong plot switching back and forth between past and present while dabbling in a hint of magical realism i wish there had been one more flashback in the last few chapters to tie up that portion of the story in my mind but otherwise a pleasant read","858":"this review has been hidden because it contains spoilers to view it click here fantastic book i thought the ending was rushed thomas' death was really all of a sudden i guess i saw it coming but there was no funeral i felt like amina was hardly affected i wish the epilogue had been further in

really enjoyed what i read though so much so that i just wanted more good summer read more","859":"beautiful writing characters i was completely absorbed in i didn't want it to end","860":" the sleepwalker's guide to dancing is a story about family the book's central character amina was born in the us with two parents that had recently migrated from india in the present day she is a young adult living in seattle when she gets a call from her mom about her father's recent odd behavior she decides to go home to check in on her dad the story switches between current day a family trip to india during amina's childhood her high school years when the family endured a few crises and a turning point in her adult life where a photo she took deeply affected her life and changed its trajectory i personally really enjoyed this book i found the story to be engaging and the characters to be quite likable the story shifts skillfully between humorous and sad moments much like life the intermingled time periods was done deftly and added to the story there is some level of intrigue as well leaving you guessing and wondering what will happen to characters and wanting to keep reading through all 500 pages please note i received this book for free through goodreads first reads","861":"this book grabbed me right away u0026amp didn't let go looking forward to her second book","862":"absolutely loved the audio book plan to borrow a print copy and re read it soon","863":"i frankly don't understand why this book got the raves it was an o k read and i did want to know why the book was titled as it was but it didn't pull together for me at all","864":"i can't believe i haven't written a review for this book yet it's a damn good novel and i highly recommend it","865":"listened to it on audible the accents are fabulous and really add to the understanding of the culture","866":"it took me a long time to get in to this book and found it quite confusing at times","867":" this novel is the story of an immigrant family from kerala a state in the southwest region of india but is really the story of everyone whose family leaves everything familiar in hopes of creating a better life when i finished this book i wanted to hug all the characters for their courage and human vulnerability they struggle with all the ordinary challenges of modern american life but with the added complication of always being betwixt and between they no longer quite fit in their country of origin and at the same time they are never completely sure of themselves in their new home this uncertainty profoundly affects their relationships with each other the very people they need most to feel secure i loved the unhappy idiosyncratic mother whose response to any crisis is to cook a huge meal of indian comfort food the dialogue between the immigrant characters charmed me i don't believe anyone who reads this book with an open heart will close it without gaining sympathy and understanding of what it is to be a stranger in a strange land","868":"i loved this book","869":"the confusion between old world and new and it's impact on family opens disturbing vistas which i hadn't thought of before","870":"interesting subject took a long time to climax once it did it got good surprising plot","871":" this is a must read book it is full of such emotion exploration of family and lots of delicious food seriously don't read while hungry the book goes back and forth with amina as a teenager and as an adult it was beautifully done i definitely shed some tears while reading also thought it was funny how everyone threw shade at amina for being a lowly wedding photographer instead of photojournalist definitely a 1998 attitude as now a lot of photojournalists are unemployed and wedding photographers can make lots of money","872":"beautiful heartbreaking funny and a fully human story if this novel does not get nominated for some sort of major award it will be a crime mira jacob is my new standard for writing","873":" started out slowly i actually considered stopping about 15 pages in but then it really picked up i'm not sure what grabbed me about this book i just felt like i was in amina's head her interactions in high school felt so real i'm not so far removed from being a teenager that i don't remember exactly what it felt like jacob captures them perfectly even the way sanji and the rest of the family tiptoe around amina being single and yet reveal truths to her that she didn't even realize about herself brilliantly written very few flaws and i wouldn't change a single thing this is just me trying to be objective and not let the book get away with a perfect 5 star rating it tidied up a bit too well in the love department and the native american indian angle was left open when it could have been explored more deeply","874":"family saga tragic yet funny","875":" i loved this book it was bi cultural as well as looking at difficulties between age groups but most of all there were profound effects on the characters from events very early in their lives which played out throughout the book all the characters grew and developed in a somewhat loose plot that was more about criss crossed lives than about a means to an end a young couple leaves india to settle in the us and bring up their family their grown daughter looks back on her life and her families' lives as she figures out her future and her ability to move on there are many funny scenes as well as tear jerkers and we grow to love the characters as they each take on a life of their own","876":"fabulous first novel a most enjoyable read i hope the film rights have been optioned would love to see the movie","877":"one star is generous how many exclamation marks do you need to provide to make a statement too many way too many very laborious getting into a long story that isn't worth reading","878":"this was a wonderful read the characters grew on me and i did not want it to end i want to know what happens between jamie and amina and see how kamala fares the fact that this is a first novel is amazing","879":"this review has been hidden because it contains

dying and talking with akhil for days on end his whole diagnosis and treatment process reminded me of my dad's illness and death the speed with which it occurred the helplessness of the family his decisions to stop treatment it truly captured emotions i haven't felt for a few years and made me catch my breath and dry tears at more than one point for some reason i was not expecting the book to go in that direction but it was cathartic and so well done the dedication at the end makes complete sense to me i am not sure you can capture those kinds of emotions without having lost a parent yourself i look forward to reading more of mira jacob's work in the future more","880":"so beautiful didn't want it to end if you loved the namesake you'll love this","881":"almost good too long too many i'm so clever similes characters i could never get close to except maybe the hallucinating guy him i understood","882":"really enjoyable book about a family from india living in the united states dialogue is excellent their guilt over leaving india and family there is a major struggle for some of the family as wellas some family losses i especially enjoyed the daughter's photography career and how it evolved","883":"kindle audio book club i had to hurry and finish this because my checkout was ending and i couldn't renew so i listened to it a lot these past two days overall i liked it the narrator did a good job with the voices and the indian accent although sometimes it was hard to keep names straight because they were so different just my own problem with listening and not reading i thought it was funny interesting and definitely made me think just a warning there was bad language","884":" i'm really glad that i read this debut by mira jacob and came very close to giving it 5 stars it was a big undertaking as it spans continents generations and 500 pages for me the interactions among the family members felt authentic i liked the humor that was added to some of the otherwise dark spots in the novel although the immigrant experience is woven into the story it makes no sweeping statements the young adults in this story all dated and married others from india i found this somewhat surprising considering their assimilation into american schools and communities it surely did make their parents happy love to these families is both joy and a weight a responsibility no small thing amina's interest in photography led to a career passion which her father encouraged you find the thing you love the most and time will stop for you to love it her dad thomas a brain surgeon was one of my favorite characters he wanted to live life on his own terms regardless of how complicated that became he clung ferociously to relics of the past must say though if i was his wife monica would have not been tolerated amina's photographs show the gritty rather than the fantasies of life events often weddings sometimes she freaks herself out with how much her photos reveal about the essence of humanity the author does an exceptional job of writing descriptions especially smell at a pay phone at the mall she smells poop perfume and grease from the food court hmmm the dialogue rings true but i believe the story line could have been tightened up in some spots it took me longer than usual to read it as there were spots where i got a little weary of the details and time switches a couple quotes i want to remember there are small blessings tiny ones that come unbidden and make a hard day one sigh lighter the commodification of beauty is an economic trap designed to enslave the modern woman true plus this helps me understand commodification a term i've been struggling with","885":"so good beautiful writing and a heartbreaking story i loved the relationships of family in this country anyway lifelong friends who are far from their native india mira jacob is a wonderful storyteller does contain a few explicit scenes and constant use of that unimaginative and offensive word","886":"a story about life a story about death simply good","887":"this was an interesting read it was not gripping at all times but it was engaging there was not a significant plot climax the plot was not all that impressive however i enjoyed it overall for the characters and the indian immigrant culture in usa","888":" now that's a satisfying novel and a debut one at that mira jacob carries her readers into the life and world of amina eapen and her family over twenty or so years from early days in india to the us in the 1980's and 90's amina heads home to new mexico from her world as a photographer in seattle when her mother calls concerned about the erratic behavior of her father a prominent neurosurgeon what those two sentences don't capture is the lush richness of character that jacobs presents her readers to tease the palate and satisfy the appetite as the story progresses both retrospectively and in the modern day each scene each character is laced with with depth and detail that make these seem like situations and people you might encounter in your own world stubborn idiosyncratic loving funny quirky real but real people you wouldn't mind knowing and definitely wouldn't mind having a meal with if kamala raj or jamie were doing the cooking one of the things i enjoyed most was the role food and flavors played in this novel this is a novel of mind and memory and how the two can interact at different times of our lives it also is a novel of heart hope and ultimately healing as we move forward with the bumps and upheavals of life this book supposedly took ms jacob 10 years to complete i hope we don't have to wait that long for another chance to dip into the rich vibrancy of her world thank you to librarything's early reviewers program and random house for this book it is available for sale 1 july 2014","889":"i really liked this book but as it stretched on and on 500 pages i liked it less and less the main character amina is not a sympathetic character she is immature and not likable her romance with jamie makes no sense and their idea of fun is sneaking into their old high school drinking lots of beer and smoking marijuana really you make a relationship out of that and how sad that the family is so devastated by tragedy first the family left in india and then akhil and no one ever recovers and the father would really rather die and join his relatives than live with his wife and daughter sigh if she had ended the book sooner it might not have been such a downer because it was a good book but","890":" i laughed out loud for 3 minutes only a few pages into this book at the description of the mother she could and did believe anything she wanted to five stars for the first novel in a long time to make me laugh so hard halfway in and i have to gush this book is fantastic it is consistently funny and consistently sharp the dialogue is the real thing whether it's awkward teenagers or goofy aunts the characters are so well wrought i imagine them as real people in my head read this book finished the last pages of this book laughing as hard as when i first started it best book i've read in a long long time i loved that there was a tiny hint of the supernatural that was doubted but never entirely dismissed the author lets the characters believe what they want and it is a gift","891":"ms jacob can be justifiably proud of her accomplishment with her debut work i hope we will not have to wait too long for another title for those reviewers who could not connect with the characters i can only say that perhaps their cultural experiences have been limited if not shallow read the book savor the dialogue and the story if you are all open minded you will enjoy the ride","892":"i wasn't sure why i wanted to read this book when the library told me it was ready to check out i re read the description and thought why the heck would i put a hold on this it must have been on a top ten list from 2014 that's the only reason i can think of why i decided to read it nothing in the description made me think it would be a good book or anything that i'd be interested in i know absolutely zero about indian culture or traditions but i'm really glad i read it it was truly a beautiful story about families and how we deal with loss it doesn't matter that i didn't always understand the culture families no matter where they're from are all similar i highly recommend this book and now i really want some indian food so much food in this book lol","893":"loved this book every night i looked forward to reading it when i went to bed i'm not great at describing books but it had all the things i like in a book i tend to like non fiction books so it's hard for me to find a fiction book to read not sure how to describe this book sorry folks","894":" i received this book through the first reads program although it took me awhile to get to it with comparisons to jhumpa lahiri and the type of story i typically enjoy i was looking forward to reading mira jacob's debut novel it did not disappoint we follow a young amina as she visits india with her family navigates school and family as a teen in albuquerque and grapples with career and family issues in seattle and albuquerque as an adult the book makes some jumps in timeline but it helps move the story forward and i thought the narrative was effective i liked the descriptive writing even if it made me very hungry character development and themes explored i thought this was a great debut novel and look forward to more books from mira jacob","895":"i just loved this book and didn't want to stop reading it i understand this is mira jacobs first book u0026amp i can not wait to read her next the story of this large loud and passionate indian family living in albuquerque new mexico was immensely entertaining just read it i promise you won't be sorry","896":"i loved everything about this book i loved the characters and could relate to each one i loved the theme of an first and second generation of immigrates and their struggle i loved this book made me laugh one second and tear up the next to be clear i loved it","897":"beautiful story about life and death friendship family culture loved it from beginning to end","898":"i liked this book as much as i liked the title though it was an odd juxtaposition of minute details and massive gaps of story","899":"loved the language loved the somehow hopeful ending and i love the metaphor that is the title and how it relates to the plot","900":"a nice book lyrical realistic ever so slightly more beautiful than real life a long book yes but not too long","901":" i thoroughly enjoyed the sleepwalker's guide to dancing identifying immediately with its immigrant theme especially the intergenerational challenges any immigrant family faces and the guilt it harbors at leaving dear and needy family members behind in a faraway country i know this from personal experience cultural norms revered by the elders in this family from india are frequently ignored or rejected by the younger members who are inevitably becoming more american in their interests and attitudes while at the same time staying strongly individualistic the narrator is amina the photographer daughter who likes to capture the absurd and the unusual in her pictures rather than the pretty and the posed though this may put her career in jeopardy she is strong character who navigates her way through some hefty family dramas including the terminal illness of her father and this is where i think the novel shines most brilliantly we see the father himself a highly respected medical professional preferring to end his days in his own way following his own emotional needs which are fully understood by his wife to following the standard medical protocol in such cases we feel that the daughter finally gets it too leaving both her and the reader respectful of his choice is he sleep walking like his brother did so many years before or is he wiser than any of us know we are all so fascinated by the mysteries of death please read this wonderful book it's beautifully written and its mystical elements are intriguing i would give this book 5 stars less","902":"absolutely fantastic would recommend this book to anyone","903":"very mixed feelings i settled on reading this book for my long plane ride unfortunately by the time i got to it was during an early morning flight where i was already tired and there was free in flight movies to watch i chose the free movies instead feeling like i would need more energy to devote to this and i was right mira jacob's debut is a story of a family following the paths of her brother akhil and the present day 1998 family we jump back and forth through time looking at the family through these snippets of time as jacob weaves the past and present versions of this family together or not so much daughter amina is left to sort out issues of the present as well as putting together the threads of the past i don't want to give away too much but i will say she did a good job of making these time jumps without it getting too confusing or having too many viewpoints at first i was hooked an immigrant family in the us during the 80's 90's considering the current events of 2015 it might not seem like it's not topical but it's still worth a read as the eapens could easily be a family you might know and i enjoyed the portraits jacob drew of each member of the eapen family their relatives and friends i'd get lost among some of the more tertiary characters but that's also not surprising given the size of immigrant family friends circles etc but as the book went on it started feeling a little too long amina has a romance later in the book that seems a bit out of nowhere and just thrown in just because some of the details are excruciatingly drawn out and it seems like nothing happens for long periods of time i actually felt the book ended with the storyline of her brother and the present day one felt tacked on after that it could be just me although based on other reviews i'm not alone in how i feel i'll admit that there are a lot of aspects to the book that really hit home for me in arguably painful ways i wouldn't say i was looking for answers from the book but ultimately the text peters out when it could and should have wrapped up in less time and pages still as a debut i thought there's a lot going for the book and the author is certainly worth following i'll keep an eye out for her next book as for this i'd recommend a library or bargain buy for a long plane ride or a cold and snowy rainy wintry day","904":"pardon my language but i fucking loved this book i laughed i cried i understood completely mira jacob thank you for a story so vivid i could visualize every moment and a family so real i felt like i knew them all personally i would hug each of them if i had the chance every character was interesting and authentic and hilarious and tragic and inspirational in their own right i'm waiting a year and reading it again thank you","905":"jacob is excellent at jabbing her characters exactly where it will hurt them most she knows how to turn the screws in a psychologically rich way without resorting to random acts of suffering the book is largely about the undercurrent of grief in a family all the way they don't deal with it the ways it surfaces despite their best efforts so jacob's ability to map all the connections among her characters serves her very well","906":"one of the most compelling stories i have ever read i couldn't put it down once i started","907":" to live in the eapen's house was to acknowledge the sharpness of invisible borders the separations that had divided it like two countries since 1983 it had been years since amina had seen her mother wade into the yellow light of her father's porch and as far as she knew thomas had never once crossed the gate into kamala's garden this quote for me sums up the book in all its muted glory this book partly reminiscent of arundhati roy's 'the god of small things' and jhumpa lahiri's 'the namesake'talks about family identity borders and the powerful role of memory with its own sense of rich pungent earthy flavour there is a freshness which seems almost dubiously intact pervading the pages like a silk earthworm weaving its web around itself the characters are all strong without being obtuse yet charmingly complex and all with their own textured lives the dilemmas which arise are all authentic and best of all the language is sweetly redolent of yellow musting pages of an old favorite book which open onto a passage which you might have missed out on you sniff the pages first but you do read that passage only because it is something you missed out on the headiness of old wine combined with new cheese lends the flavour something which you cannot capture it seems to be hidden from the sensual tactile nature of reality overall an intrepidly layered book demanding strong allegiance yet distanced wishful longing for the surreal unknown","908":"stayed up sooooo late finishing this and it was worth it","909":"i loved this book the characters were so well written the mother especially","910":"mira jacob's debut novel is an emotional and detail rich story the story opens as thomas eapen brings his wife kamala and his two children akhil and amina for a visit to salem india to visit his family thomas is a surgeon and he moved his family to the united states in hopes to find a better life thomas' mother doesn't understand why he won't live in india where there are places he can work and it causes tension during the visit in jumping forward amina eapen lives in seattle and is a photographer she gets word from her mother that her father is acting weird and she should come home she drops everything and heads to her parents house in albuquerque while visiting she slowly begins to see signs of illness in her father but her mother seems like she is not the least bit concerned as amina is thrown headfirst into all of the family's issues she begins to uncover the pieces of her family's past the author easily pulls the reader into the story with her captivating details and raw emotion as the reader i feel for amina who is dealing with the struggles of having an ill parent and choosing the best recourse and dealing with another parent who is in denial amina has so much going on with her career but abandons it all to come home to try to help her father however she isn't only dealing with the stress of thomas being ill but with her mother trying to set her up on dates and throwing her into doing photography events without even getting her approval amina and akhil grew up with a father that was never around and a mother who was overly attentive when akhil dies it was sad to see how his death affected the family amina's parents wallow in their sadness and anger and she is left to pick up the pieces and move on as an adult amina sees that her family is still deeply affected by the loss of her brother going back to visit her hometown brings all of these memories back and it is a lot for amina to deal with on top of her father's illness i really enjoyed how the book jumps from the past to the present back and forth i really enjoyed this book i received a copy of this book for free through goodreads first reads","911":"read for our faculty book discussion the writing was wonderful the dialogue crisp and realistic i loved the family arguments and individual details of the characters they were very real to me however it took far too long to wrap up the plot and there were some plot lines that were dropped that i was really invested in the opening chapter is nothing short of brilliant but what comes after was a bit too piecemeal for me","912":" i love the ease with which mira jacob narrates this story of a family's personal tragedies weaving the past with the present in an effortless style i've only seen once before in arundhati roy's god of small things i could be biased since roy's book besides being one of my favourite pieces of fiction also deals with a malayalee family coping with death and loss at around the same time 80s and 90s albeit in different countries that being said the sleepwalker's guide to dancing beautifully takes you through the complicated family dynamics of a multi generational indian american family and the ways in which each individual copes with a common and devastating loss this is one of my top reads this year for the nuanced and flawed and therefore very real characters along with the flowing prose that floats through 500 odd pages without ever losing the reader's attention","913":" this was a beautiful book which was deeply pleasurable to read it was not without flaws most significantly its need for editing in the second half of the book and the flat and romanticized character of jamie but on the whole it won my heart with the exception of jamie the character development was excellent kamala thomas akhil and amina were so quirky and flawlessly described that i would not have been surprised if they walked into my house i was especially impressed with the author's ability to keep amina's character consistent from childhood through adolescence and into adulthood i find it irritating when authors use tragedy as plot devices and i was initially concerned that this might be the case here but as i read on i realized that the book wasn't actually about tragedy but about how we cope with grief loss and yearning and how love can bind and guide us through terrible times while there were many interwoven themes including themes of place belonging and home what spoke most to me was that despite how crazy this family was and despite the terrible times it had endured and despite the fact that many of its members were not blood related what ultimately saved it was love","914":"meh slice of life book about a dysfunctional family just couldn't get into it and didn't like how it skipped all around in time in the book just couldn't bring myself to care about any of the characters or their situations in the book of course i had a terrible head cold while reading so who knows if it was me or the book","915":"i liked a lot of it but the end left off a lot of what i found most compelling and some of the book veered a little too far away from how i would have expected characters to act","916":"it was a mostly depressing book some insights into the indian culture but the plot was one tragedy after another","917":"i would give this book a six if i could i listened to the author read it on audible com her voice and each character more interesting with their varying accents i loved each character and their relationships were so real a very moving book and i was sad for it to end","918":"i won a copy from the publisher in a first reads giveaway 4 5what a pleasant surprise i started this book without reading anything about it first i guess i entered the giveaway because i liked the cover or something is this a book people know about i don't know if it isn't it will be or the author's next book will be really enjoyed it the best thing about this book are the amazingly articulated characters without ever really describing them just putting them in situations and allowing them to react jacob makes us truly deeply know each and every player in this story writing characters like these everyday people with all their issues lovable and clueless at the same time but so real is a rare skill","919":"loved it couldn't put it down","920":"it was a little long but i was thoroughly absorbed and got up in the middle of the night to finish it the characters were well developed although it took awhile to get there i was caught up in the family's pain and struggles and was rooting for amina to overcome them well written","921":"hard to believe this is a debut novel my friend who devours books faster than i can download them called this book of the year and i have to agree definitely a must read beautifully written and thoughtfully crafted the story pace gained momentum as it progressed and i couldn't put it down now i can't stopthinking about it","922":"my book club passed on reading this book because they thought it was too long so i read it anyway just because that's a stupid reason to pass on a book and as expected i loved it and loved the pacing and length in fact my only gripe was that i wanted more loose ends tied up in the last few pages the characters were so human and well constructed and even the ghosts that appear along the way have heart","923":" the sleepwalker's guide to dancing is a sweeping family epic following the main character amina eapen and her family after they have immigrated from india to the us for a period of about 25 years it follows amina through family crises tragedy and through moments of happiness and joy amina as a young woman struggles with intermingling american and indian cultures throughout her life her parents are loving and good people but sometimes have ideas of what they want amina to do with her life ideas that she doesn't necessarily agree with her mother kamala is especially strong willed in her opinions and was probably one of the most interesting characters in the book the only complaint i had about this book was that sometimes the metaphors jacob used were a bit too flowery and it distracted me from the story mostly the language she uses is on point in the novel but sometimes she overdoes the metaphoric language it's not a major complaint but one that persisted throughout the novel i listened to the audiobook version that was narrated by the wonderful mira jacob herself i thoroughly recommend listening to the audiobook because she does a fantastic job of narrating and breathing life into the characters","924":"awful good in spots but tedious did not like the ending a total waste of my time","925":"i really loved this book funny tender credible even when character behavior surprising and often insightful","926":" wow just wow i had a hard time believing this was a debut novel mira jacob writes a novel that is luminous heart wrenching and as the child of american born parents raised in the old country oh so painfully familiar the story revolves around the syrian christian eapen family who have settled in new mexico the parents - thomas and kamala - and their children gifted akhil and the lost child amina the family they leave behind in india cast a shadow so large they seem to taint the relationships in the eapen family fast forward amina is now in her 30's and has never lived up to her family's expectations rather than becoming a vet she became a news photographer for the seattle post intelligencer in 1992 when she was on assignment to photograph a party on a yacht she captured an image of another tragedy that was an echo of the past the photo later became famous tangled her in controversy and rendered her unable to continue her journalism career working as a wedding photographer instead as the book unfolds jacob reveals that amina's extreme difficulty following this event is related to two tragedies that loomed over her childhood and teenage years and haunt her in her adult life after a phone call from her mother an alarmed amina flies to back new mexico she's not the only one being haunted back home in albuquerque thomas a brain surgeon chats and listens to the ghosts of the dysfunctional family's past thomas and kamala are two cracked plates having had their hearts shattered years earlier amina has always understood the strain her family is under and recognizes she is incapable of filling the void in two damaged hearts if her father is to be helped the enire eapen clan must come to terms with their ghosts what really stood out for me though was a theme that i didn't see until i quickly browsed through the other reviews sleep the men of the family don't sleep easily amina's father suffers from insomnia her brother appears to be narcoleptic and her uncle is of course the sleepwalking dancer of the title mira jacob shifts forwards and backwards in time telling the story with pockets of comedy and romance tinged with unfading sorrow bittersweet engrossing and completely human its a story about familial connection and having the courage to move on","927":" the story jumps between three different times with amina being the constant point of view through them all a reference through which we can see how the family members change amina is however not without demons of her own a professional photographer her claim to fame was a perfectly timed picture of a man jumping to his death her dealing with this brings back memories of her dealing with akhil's death when she had started to learn photography the story interweaves the three times intricately which is why when the story moves from thomas and his brother sunil's fights in 1970's to present day hallucinations of thomas in the 90's and back to akhil's death because of narcolepsy in the 80's it seems like a natural interweaving of story arcs a river breaking into different branches which along its length continue to meet and move away on their paths the book is an emotional telling about family one of the key emotions in the book is that of regret the regret of not being able to be a brother or son's keeper of not being able to pursue something of passion and even the regret of not being understood the reader goes through the same emotional turmoil as the characters in the book a turmoil that takes seed and slowly grows till it begins to throttle them slowly the slow descent of thomas into rejecting medical cure and accepting his hallucinations as a cure to his personal demons is moving within itself it is a moving tale of what a straight thinking person is willing to give up but to look at how his decisions affect those of his family and peel away the layers to their core is nothing short of brilliant i will leave you with some select quotes from the book \"we are all we have here do you understand that is it and we can all talk about old times and campa cola and wouldn't it be nice if we could go back but none of us ever want to go back to what to who our own families can't even stand us for longer than a few days no we are home already like it or not \"\"weddings are about fantasies--you understand your job is to photograph the fantasy not the reality never the reality if i ever see another picture like that you're fired \"\"he's fine \" kamala said \"it's not like that you're not listening \" \"i am listening you just told me he's delusional and i'm asking--\" \"i did not say he is delusional i said he was talking to his mother \" \"who is dead \" amina said gently \"obvious \" \"and that's not delusional \"","928":"this book was magical the author beautifully captures the misery of high school the pain of loss and the tenor of adult angst all at a very visceral level the book was also infused with magical realism that wasn't quite magical realism in a way tied to human desire and longing rather than the supernatural or extraordinary i was very moved by this book and highly recommend it","929":"loved the characters felt drawn into the book every time i picked it up","930":"read this book read this book read this book savor it and drink it up and be utterly moved and if you're me probably weep a little","931":"fascinating story the story was engaging and the characters fascinating lingering long after the book was read the time changes were sometimes disconcerting but understandable the storyline focuses on family relationships and cultural expectations highly recommend it","932":"an astonishing book beautifully written possibly the best i've read this year and definitely one i want to return to i think the blurb is misleading i will write a proper review shortly","933":"although this book kept me reading i felt that it didn't quite make into four star territory the family dynamics were frequently concerning and i had quite a few you've got to be kidding moments still i think this book is fine beach or airplane reading","934":"one of the best books i've ever read throughout her writing mira tugged at my heartstrings the characters are so real and felt like they are living before my eyes while i devoured most of the book by couple days i took my time to complete last 20 pages may be i didn't want to let go or may be i didn't like how the story was going to end i honestly don't understand thomas's decision but i think it's about the choice between dead and living never thought the book would affect me in such a way but i'm so glad of the experience ps mira not only made me weep like a baby but also hungry at times with her description of foods those parts were totally awesome","935":"any book that makes me cry deserves 5 stars names of foods i cannot begin to imagine but must be yummy i read because i want to further my emotional education this book did","936":"be in a place where you can cry when you're finishing this one beautifully done sad sad and sad but very true to the story i love a story that makes you feel like you're reading about a real family and like you want to go to their house and eat the food and give everyone a hug","937":"beautiful intersections between generations cultures arts and sciences jacob's series of books in this novel show us how our differences bring us together and how a thread of love can quilt a non blood family together","938":"maybe a 5 instead of a 4 sprawling muddied real it was filled with flawed characters death good food and the immigrant experience","939":"a truly beautiful and satisfying debut novel it is one of those books that you did not want to end it is about family bonds grief and challenges even though the book is 500 pages it is a fast and easy read and one that i definitely recommend","940":" in the author's note of the book she says she wanted to explore \"what it means as an immigrant to make a life in a stolen country \" and she does that well what she also does well is explore the interaction of children and their parents both when they are young and when the children are adults with children of their own dealing with their parents and siblings she explores the impact of loss of children of parents on a family it's such a good book that i want to read all of her books but this the first so there's not another to move onto sad panda","941":" mira jacob's new novel \"the sleepwalker's guide to dancing\" is sure to be a summer hit her writing is gorgeous witty lyrical and full of unique and arresting similes and metaphors \"a font so modern it looked like a digital sneeze\" was just one of my favorites amina eapen is needed at home in new mexico she leaves her lack luster life and career as a wedding photographer when her father surgeon thomas eapen begins to have long conversations with the dead all the ingredients for a compelling story are on hand here an interesting and relatable plot lovable characters romance mystery humor and pathos it's a story about family and the strange combination of love and frustration that only family can provide","942":"this book is wonderful great characters wonderful story beautiful writing i loved it","943":"difficult to follow characters","944":"wow this book is one of those rare novels where your feel like you've gone on a long journey with people you've grown to know and love closing the book at the end seemed almost wrong because i wanted to keep learning what happened to the characters this book is sad humorous poignant and heartbreakingly beautiful","945":"if goodreads allowed would give it 3 5","946":"this is a good book in need of a great editor there is no reason for 500 pages like other reviewers i loved the scene in india and the ending but the middle dragged the plot was obvious but the storytelling kept me reading i would give this 3 5 stars","947":"this book made me feel lonely the fact that kamala spends most of her adult life missing her workaholic husband seems like one of the greatest tragedies in this book because his ongoing absence is not an accident or bad luck","948":"this book is too good mira jacob is a very talented writer i really enjoyed this book mix of humor sadness love and it definitely taught me so much about relationships possibly one of the best books i have read so far i don't know how i'm supposed to get over this book everyone should read this","949":"the author states she took 10 years to write this book and the time really shows each new setting is so clearly described i felt as if i was traveling too the characters are all facing unique struggles i especially loved how families were made from friends","950":"this book tugs at your heart there is so much sadness but humor at the same time i know that i will think about this book for a long time","951":"i know it is against the rules to judge a book by its cover but it is hard not to do so with a book that has such a creative and capturing title and the book certainly exceeded my expectations the story is rich and the characters are full of the everyday joy sadness and humor of life as a young indian american i am thrilled to read a book that finally portrays the realities of an indian american immigrant family without unnecessary and untruthful over dramatization mira jacobs beautifully tells the story of a real family and the very real way in which they deal with the various tragedies of life it is a story to which any human being can relate","952":"this was hard to get into but i really liked it i did the audio version read by the author which was great because she really captured in speaking and in the writing it seems the way indian immigrants speak in the us the story was quite sad but good family story generally","953":"thirty year old amina is called away from her photography job in seattle by her mother kamala who has growing concerns that something is seriously wrong with her father thomas her father is a brilliant neurosurgeon who years before relocated the family which then included his wife and young son ahkil from india to new mexico upon arriving home amina finds much more than she bargained for thomas is indeed acting unusual doing such things as conversing with dead relatives leaving kamala beside herself with worry and cooking up a storm there is also an actual sleepwalker who causes big problems for this family this is a beautifully written family saga which spans from the family's past in india to their present in new mexico with glimpses of all the times between one reviewer called this book emotionally bountiful and i agree although i would add also that it is a bountifully magical read 5 stars","954":"heart breaking sense sational a strong gravity belied by undeniable airiness much like the physical and emotional landscapes described within its pages i loved it","955":" 4 5 stars i loved this book it was so beautifully written positively almost poetic i loved the writing loved loved through the detail i grew to also love the characters they seemed so real i was pulled right into their lives the detail given to their quirks and personalities brought them to vivid life they were all different and committed in their roles i also enjoyed the humor the story took some unexpected turns which was nice the story did lag in some spots but i didn't even care i would read this again just for the writing despite my loves with this book i did have just a couple of things i didn't like so much it bounced around in time and it was hard to figure out what time frame was currently being represented because of that i had a hard time in the beginning figuring out who was who and what was going on however once i got it all straight i loved it the author also has a love relationship with the f word and all of its variations seriously if that word was eliminated from this book it would have been pages shorter","956":"i liked this a lot it's a 2nd generation americans story which i seem to be drawn to there was a lot of complexity and depth to this one","957":"i love big sprawling family stories that span time and continents and the sleepwalker's guide to dancing does not disappoint there is both scope and minutiae here making the story a sort of mini saga condensed into quick chapters with a sense of purpose amina is a heroine with a life and mind of her own but still deeply connected to her parents her brother and her extended family which makes her wonderfully real and relatable the eapens themselves are a complicated yet endearing bunch and i felt just as much a part of their family near the end the author leaves some ends dangling that i would have liked to seen tied up and the events near the end seem somewhat forced but what matters most is the path that gets us there which is immensely enjoyable and undeniably human i received an advanced copy as part of the first reads program","958":"what a great book the characters were so real i loved them i actually miss them now that i have finished the book","959":"well developed characters interesting comments on life and death and the blurring of the line between the two i enjoyed it","960":"this story follows a complicated family that originates from india but has made a life in america the story itself is narrative but we follow the life of one of the characters while the others support the tale the author shares the experience of indian american culture with an untraditional family saga","961":" first let me say that i hate the overdrive app i have talked to two libraries about issues i have with it and no one has been able to assist me every time i stop the app and go back to listen it reverts to a previous section of the novel there is no rhyme or reason as to why but it certainly effects my opinion of the novel i found it hard to like any of the characters but i did find them interesting thomas and kamila are from india who travel to new mexico and raise their children there there is so much angst between them their daughter and their friends that it is disturbing it gets worse as thomas descends into his disease there were story lines that didn't go anywhere hints and innuendoes that despite tons of details left me wanting more","962":"fascinating this seemed so true to life it jumps from one part of amina's life to another it starts with the initial separation of the family between america and india it surprises me that the next generation is much like the last one in behavior it also deals with the way this family deals with death and dying and how the family supports each other through hard times","963":" the sleepwalker's guide to dancing is an epic family saga centered on an indian immigrant family thomas a brain surgeon immigrated from india to new mexico to start a new life with his family and to escape the demands of his overbearing mother and familial responsibilities in india the story opens with kamala thomas' wife urging her grown daughter amina to come home from seattle because thomas was talking to people who were not really there when amina arrives at home to help she discovers more secrets about her family's past and her father's condition i really enjoyed this book when i first read the synopsis and looked at the 500 page length i wasn't sure that it would hold my attention but it truly did from start to finish i was hooked it reminded me at times of cutting for stone another book i enjoyed the characters were a lot of fun the dialogue was very realistic it was funny at times it was sad at times i thought it was just a great novel in so many waysmira jacob expertly writes this story alternately using flashbacks and the present story to weave this novel together i thought the pacing was just perfect for such a lengthy novel there was not really a slow part each section ended with enough of a cliffhanger to keep me turning pages eager to see what the next section would hold i received an advance copy of this book through library thing early reviewers the novel is set to be released on july 1 2014 and i would highly recommend checking it out","964":"the short review so very much worth the time i won this as a goodreads giveaway i entered the giveaway

sudden bizarre behavior focusing on identity family and love jacob has written a touching book about embracing culture and the present and moving through past hurts i found myself immediately immersed in this book as it opened with a call from amina's mother manipulating her into coming home and dived into a visit to india that causes ripples through the rest of the story jacobs does a nice job of inserting the reader into amina's immediate and extended family however i felt the conclusion was a bit abrupt and incomplete","966":" i received a copy of this book free in a goodreads giveaway this

cooking provides passages of relief but does not diminish the eapen's family tragedy while jacob's is willing to go for comedy in a number of passages the story itself is written with naked honesty about the uneasy generation divide among indian's in america and about a family in all it's emotional stages this is a story that combines freshness and compelling characters and is a must read more","969":"i thought this would be a book about indian immigration in america and adaptation instead it was a beautifully written book about family and love and loss","970":"loved this book easily read in a few days","971":"not able to finish","972":"couldn't really get into this and was bored i may be being unfair so i may revisit it again","973":" the story vacillates between the 70s and the 90s amina resides in seattle and returns home to nm at her prone to exaggeration mother's request to address her father's medical condition while born in america amina's parents arrived in the states 20 years earlier from india with amina's brother it melds the past and the present with emphasis on the cultural differences i started this book and initially could not get absorb in it however upon giving it a second shot it is a good book especially in light of it being a debut novel the cultural differences were interesting and everyone can relate to a strong arm mother an aging and ill parent and how the sorrows of the past impact the present very well written","974":"i received this book several months ago as a first reads winner i was notified i won and was excited to read it then my world turned inside out in the moment of a horrific car crash it took me months to get to read this i tried to read it a few times but i could not stick with it too literary and my mind and body were too exhausted i apologize for not reading sooner to the author and publisher as i know they expect an honest review promptly and i could not even read it by the time the arc showed up on my doorstep i seldom give a book 5 stars i don't think i gave 5 stars to a debut author before now this superseded my expectations family drama saga immigration identity hard rock all different kinds of love healing grief karma all strung across 500 pages seemed a blend of what i liked about sometimes a great notion a fine balance middlesex and a tale for the time being even if this book has more different discussion themes brilliant i really hope ms jacob does not wait another 10 years for her next published work the only part i am not sure i understand is the title a little help please","975":"really liked this story","976":" this book was so good in so many ways it really painted a picture of grief loss family a different culture and love i had a hard time putting it down the beginning was a little bit confusing and started off slow but once the book got going it really invoked so many emotions and feelings the authors ability to really tell the story of a family and the individuals in that family was really amazing she really told the tale of a young girl struggling with her identity american born but raised in a family struggling to hold on to their culture i almost felt like i knew the whole family by the end of the book beware the end will make tears spring to your eyes","977":"very affecting book stayed with me days after i finished it","978":"it took the author ten years to write the novel and at 500 pages i'm not surprised it took her that long it was a compelling enough family drama with layers revealed the finish was disappointing","979":"this was a very interesting story and the author did a wonderful job with the narration of the auditory version her depiction of the voices of the various characters is excellent she really made each of them come to life well done","980":"i really loved getting involved in the world of this novel i loved amina and her family her real family and her extended family i thought the parts about her father and his illness were the strongest sometimes i felt like even though amina was the main character i didn't know her as well but it's a very well written book some bad language but overall a really good book that i'm sad to be done with","981":"this isn't a bad book my reasons for only giving 3 stars relate more to the style of the author than the quality of the writing i felt as i made my way through the book that the experience was more akin to reading a play than a novel long passages of conversation between the protagonists and not enough narrative context simply not a style that i enjoyed","982":"loved this book","983":"a thirty year old photographer in grunge era seattle flies home to albuquerque after her mother suggests that her surgeon father seems unwell amina is ambivalent about returning home to the town where she was raised by her indian immigrant parents after an early chapter set in 1970s india the book goes back and forth between the 1980s and '90s as amina faces her past and an uncertain present earlier in the summer i completed an ebook edition of sleepwalker's guide on my phone and felt i had not really done the novel justice there was just too much to savor too much imagery and emotion and while i love the convenience of reading on my phone the way my eyes race across the screen and quickly absorb text is better suited to chick lit and ya novels a review on this site mentioned that the author narrates the audio edition so i started again this time with the talking book mira jacob does a phenomenal job reading her own book particularly voicing the characters of amina and her parents while a well done movie version would be welcome for me the audio performance truly created a theater like experience it was freeing to listen to the book after already reading it because i could focus more on the language and not wonder where the story would go or how it would all end highly recommended and an excellent book club choice","984":"review first appeared at http www thenewdorkreviewofbooks co mira jacob's debut novel the sleepwalker's guide to dancing is naturally and almost too easily drawing lots of comparisons to jhumpa lahiri's fiction that's because it's a decades long tale of a family that immigrates from india to the u s but whereas lahiri's fiction is almost always unflinchingly straightforward and earnest jacob's contains many moments of levity that kind of sneak up on you if you're not reading carefully here's one example kamala's son akhil paints a mural on his bedroom ceiling including such important figures to his new left leaning world view as gandhi che guevara and rob halford kamala explains to friends who don't knew who halford is that he's a singing priest kamala makes quite a few of these mistakes throughout the novel and they're always amusing but on the whole you wouldn't confuse jacob's novel with slapstick by any stretch there are some weighty issues to be dealt with here and you get that sense from the opening scene kamala calls late 20s daughter amina and tells her that her father thomas is having long conversations with his mother which would be fine except his mother's been dead for 15 years so amina rushes home to albuquerque to find out what's wrong we jump back to india in the 1970s to learn about thomas's strained relationship with his mother and brother we ease into 1980s albuquerque where amina and akhil are high school students struggling to fit in as first generation immigrants and then we go back and forth between 1998 seattle where amina makes a living as a photographer and albuquerque where she tries to right the ship and fend off her mother attempts to hook her up with eligible indian bachelors the story hinges on what really is wrong with thomas have a series of tragedies over the years finally caused him to lose touch with reality are his visions simply a coping mechanism and as amina tries to keep her own sanity how does she deal with her own demons and her constantly nagging mother it's a strangely fluid story for as much as it seems to jump around and despite its 500 page length it's a story that goes by quickly highly recommended","985":"many reviewers are stating that the book is 500 pages long how did i not realize that every page every line was necessary and enjoyable it was wonderfully written as an ode to an indian american immigrant family however it could be any first generation american family or any family it describes the love grief frustrations heartbreak healing and humor that exists in every family a story which like a family warms the heart and feeds the soul","986":"an interesting book about immigrants to america from india settling in albuquerque goes back and forth from india to the us from from the past to the present good character development touches on lots of emotions and some difficulties of immigrants","987":"i loved this book i don't remember why i picked this up but am so glad i did if you want an overview read any of the reviews above because it's already been done so well i think i connected because of place since i like albuquerque because of the story because it was so well told and because of the characters all believable fun and flawed thank you so much for sharing this story","988":"it took a while to get into this book there are so many characters introduced right away and there was no explanation about who was who but it wasn't too long before i figured out the main characters and i grew to like them and wanted to know what happens to them a good book about the importance of family even though they drive us nuts sometimes","989":"there were a lot of really wonderful things about this book but in the end it lacked cohesion the title comes from an episode the main character witnesses when visiting family in india as a child but like so much in the book it makes an impression as a memorable moment that isn't really strong enough to carry the rest of the narrative the book is full of these moments but in the end i felt unsatisfied as if i'd heard anecdotes in place of a real story moving though those anecdotes were i enjoyed reading the book but it could have been much more powerful than it actually was","990":" i really loved this book i am not even sure why particularly but i just thought it was beautifully written the pacing was good for a relatively long novel and the characters were vivid and interesting i thought it was a complex thoughtful story of an immigrant family not just what you would expect from that genre it was also a really wonderful gentle story about terribly sad things happening within a family and what the members of that family do in the aftermath of those events though there was quite a bit of tragedy in this book it didn't seem out of proportion to what a real family might face and the way the characters behaved seemed so natural i found myself thinking that of course that character would do exactly that it was truthful and tender and sad and i really enjoyed the whole thing definitely would recommend","991":"she writes beautifully the problem i had was the story switched back and forth between past and present in ways that left me unnecessarily confused also the ending felt rather abrupt and did not give closure to the various stories contained within the larger plot","992":" there's not much to say that the other five star reviewers of mira jacob's debut novel the sleepwalker's guide to dancing haven't already said and much better than i can i will say that i loved this book now whether because i have always been interested in india indians and indian americans or because it is beautifully written it was a joyous read for me and will definitely be in my top 10 novels of 2014 a couple of observations about the writing style and the plot characters most of jacob's narrative is written in dialog that has always seemed to me a difficult style of writing and not many authors can manage it well elinor lipman is another excellent dialog author jacob has done this well and the book seems to flow as a result none of jacob's characters are stock all have a special twist from the caricatures of indian born doctors and their sari wearing wives settling in the united states the three children born of these parents akhim and his sister amina and their cousin dimple have assimilated into united states culture and consider themselves american teenagers as the book moves back and forth between seattle and albuquerque in the late 1990's and albuquerque in the 1970's and early 1980's jacobs characters all of them come to life in her words the sadness that amina and akhim's mother kamala seems to feel as she realises that her future is to stay in the us rather than to move back to salem india is seen by readers as the price she must pay for her husband and children's assimilation all jacob's characters are interesting but i must admit i followed kamala and her husband thomas as they struggled in their marriage and his career this is a very very special book it's long but never lost it's appeal it's the kind of book that sort of begs a follow up a sequel in which jacob returns to her characters in the years after the end of the book","993":"i love this book i fell in love with the characters and the ideas about life and death it discusses in a very down home way and the food is terrific","994":"i really loved this one of the best books i've read this year","995":"i really enjoyed this book it was hard to put down when other things needed to get done and really hard to put down at night when i should have been sleeping i love a book that makes you feel this book had me laughing at times crying at others mira jacob created characters who are warm appealing irksome contradictory - pretty much like most families i fell in love with the characters almost instantly mira jacob's debut novel was amazing and i can't wait to read more from her","996":"i won this in a first reads giveaway 4 75 stars the sleepwalker's guide to dancing opens in 1998 amina a 30 year old photographer is living alone in seattle when she receives a phone call from her mother telling her that her mother suspects that there is something seriously wrong with her father she wants her daughter to come home to new mexico for a visit reluctantly amina agrees the novel then goes back in time to a visit the family paid to india amina's parents' homeland after that it jumps back and forth in time between 1998 and 1982 when amina was in high school this book is superb really superb comparisons to jhumpa lahiri are inevitable as both write about the lives of well educated south asian immigrants to the us and their american born children i don't think jacob's writing as writing is quite as good as lahiri's however this is the author's first novel and if the book jacket and reviews didn't tell me that i would never have guessed it i think jacob does a better job conveying characters' emotions amina's are especially well portrayed sleepwalker's guide is also funnier than anything by lahiri i've read there's also much less of a sense of otherness in this book perhaps in part because the family is christian to the extent that it is anything you don't have to be indian or the child of immigrants to enjoy this novel i'm neither anyone who has ever been part of a family will identify with the characters the words amina's grandmother says to her are not that different than some my own mother said to my daughter the only parts of the novel i didn't like are the quasi paranormal incidents i thought one involving a photo was particularly trite but that's a very minor quibble i think the publisher has done a disservice to jacob in its description of the novel based on it i was expecting the novel to focus much more on a quest by amina to find out some deep secret in the family history this book is not a mystery and doesn't purport to be while amina talks to her father about his family she does it because she thinks talking about things will help her father not to try to unearth some family secret so if you don't enjoy mysteries don't be put off by the description this isn't one bottom line read this book it's fantastic i can't wait for jacob's next book i think i've been lucky enough to win an advance copy of the debut novel of someone who will become a major american novelist r characters","997":"this book will stay with me for a long time like a good friend i feel like i came to know this world and its characters intimately i know i will feel that feeling of missing being with certain people or being in a certain place not be able to think of what or who exactly i'm feeling this nostalgia for and then will realizong what i was longing for was the world of this book and the characters within it this book is timely for a young adult like myself dealing with reconciling the past and the present and choosing her path to the future reconciling her family's idea of her life versus her reality and the shifting of becoming an adult and taking on a new role in your family dynamic five stars","998":"this was a pretty good read i think the characters were well developed and i enjoyed the storyline","999":"i enjoyed this book the language the speed even the undercurrent of morbidity i do recommend","1000":"best book of summer 2014 hands down","1001":"an intriguing book with complex characters that explores what it like to live as a transplant to a new country it further explores the themes of families relationships grief and acceptance i loved this book and its characters a very great first novel for mira jacob","1002":" i've waited to give this book a review it's stayed with me a couple of days i loved this book it was beautifully written with stunning characters and an overwhelming tone i wish it hadn't ended when it did but i understand why there's so much more to find out about the people i have questions about the characters and what happened to them like kamala what happened to her did dimple and sajeev stay happily married and what about amina and jamie did that work out what about the rest of the family did thomas finally get to say what he really needed to akhil to find his peace and one final question was the sleeping problems a family thing will future family members suffer no matter how many questions i think off i will never forget this book amina was the perfect leading lady with even more colourful and inspirational family members alongside her it was refreshing to read about a non american family living an american lifestyle apart from kamala anyway i highly recommend this book if you are looking for a book hang over and if you need time to reflect on what family means","1003":"i loved this book ignore the title it's not about dancing but sleep disorders do play a compelling role this is a fascinating family saga with themes of immigration loyalty and grief woven in to a wonderfully plotted narrative i read this 500 pg book in less than a week you will not want to put it down","1004":"beautiful touching and insightful","1005":" lovely believable gracefulthere seem to be few beautiful novels being written at the moment this is one of the exceptions the story of a wildly eccentric family is utterly believable in the midst of its oddity of event and character its heroine an indian american photographer leaves her taxing seattle job as an event photographer whose job is to make her subjects look better than they do or are to cope with her father's illness in new mexico her real artistry is the secret capture of event participants' ugly unguarded moments that dichotomy forms the book's central metaphor is life more bearable if the real is hidden or is it the intimate and exquisite moments most of us try to hide that make it worth its living for fans of the elegance of hedgehogs","1006":" the sleepwalker's guide to dancing begins in 1979 thomas eapen his wife kamala and children amina and akhil are visiting thomas's family in salem india here we see the tension between thomas his mother and his brother it is clear that although thomas feels guilt at leaving his family for a career in the u s he has a strong desire to escape jump forward to 1998 amina is grown and working as a photographer in seattle a phone call from kamala prompts her to drop everything and fly home to new mexico interwoven in the present is the eapens' life in the 1980s as amina and akhil grow and kamala and thomas drift apart in this beautiful debut novel by mira jacob we see a family's struggle with assimilation tragedy and each other however jacob also weaves a worldly wickedly intelligent and humorous tale of love and acceptance despite my initial skepticism i thought i had read stories just like it before i fell in love with this book after all how could i not love a book with descriptions such as she watched her father gnaw the flesh from the bone the recent loss of weight making him look more like an animal human bones devouring chicken bones meat eating meat ultimately i loved this book because i recognized my own past and present in the pages the details may be different but the struggle and the reward is the same","1007":"loved the characters story and prose had to highlight many of the author's metaphors they created fantastic images in my mind","1008":"this book starts a little slow and the dual plot line 20 years apart makes it a little confusing at the beginning since it just jumps in however it was worth finishing as i found the ending to be pretty heartwarming","1009":"absolutely stunning the way the author made me feel so connected to a culture and a world i know absolutely nothing about is phenomenal and it was easy to get lost in the characters and their lives all the pain and the joys were readily felt the hope and the hesitations it was all just so well done the past and the present weaved seamlessly together in the narrative","1010":"delightfully wonderful this debut novel was full of quirky fun loveable characters characters full of color and depth the characters were brought to life and i felt as if i knew them very memorable characters that will be very hard for me to forget it was never boring i enjoyed reading every page from beginning to end i absolutely adored this story humor self discovery love family heartbreak loss adventure culture what didn't this book have the story was beautifully woven this novel makes you stop and reflect on your own life where we are in life where we want to be what's really important in life this story shows us how precious yet short life truly is live each day as if it's your last make each moment count i highly recommend this beautiful story","1011":"i was engaged and connected and then i wasn't repeatedly throughout this book some very good bits and some bland bits it was never a non finisher and overall a good enough read for me","1012":"this book is incredible heartbreaking altogether too real i do not know how to talk about it because it got under my skin in ways i did not expect","1013":"great characters with interesting lives a bit slow","1014":"although this family's story spans decades and continents india and the united states it's a very intimate one that is likely to captivate readers from beginning to end it's truly a remarkable novel and it shouldn't be a surprise that it took the author 10 years to write for readers it was well worth the wait for this stunning debut by author mira jacob there are plenty of family secrets among the eapens despite their outward surface of success these secrets make for choice revelations as the novel progresses from an abandonment of their traditional indian home to the tragic loss of life of one of their key family members to the witnessing of a horrible incident on the job for the youngest daughter narrator amina however the beauty of the storyline is how every tragedy is part of the onion each a new layer in a single theme the storyline is absolutely engrossing the book hard to put down the characters are relatable their humanity universal it's a lush rich telling where each one has a unique point of view and a story worth exploring the depth of exploration is akin to what one might find in a \"classic\" by thomas hardy or edith wharton yet as contemporary as \"the corrections \"don't miss this warm engaging likable debut by mira jacob and here's hoping it doesn't take another 10 years for her next novel","1015":"a beautifully written multi generational saga served indian style not particularly action packed and it was just so long which was my main beef that i had to break it up with other reads","1016":"overall enjoyed it the description made it out to be a thrilling mystery but it was really just a story about family a quirky well meaning family dealing with long repressed issues had trouble keeping some of the characters straight but overall enjoyable","1017":"oh my gosh i loved this book very evocative of the time and place the characters are engaging very real i enjoyed meeting all the people in amina's extended family i kind of felt like i learned something of indian culture and family life if that sounds pretentious sorry my mother tried to read it too but i think the jumping from time and place was just too much for her i will really miss these people from this book hope the author continues writing such good stuff","1018":"this was all well and good and i kept reading like it was due at the library but i'm not exactly sure where that hint of urgency originated the book did a number of things reasonably well but nothing outstanding i kept wondering if maybe it was meant to be therapeutic for the author i got annoyed at the shifts between decades i'd really like to figure out how some books do this in a way that absolutely suits me and others do it in a way that annoys me i wonder if the author was too close to the main character there's so much about her and yet i'm not sure now that i'm finished i really know her there were themes of family growing up dealing with mortality and death and more but i'm not sure i can pinpoint the main theme whenever i review and talk about the book i sound down on it but i read it like i liked it a lot more than that","1019":" the author's note at the end of the book echoes the overarching themes ...\"what it means as an immigrant to make a life in a stolen country \"this luminous addictive page turning character driven and first rate storytelling held me in its thrall from beginning to end yes it had echoes of jhumpa lahiri by virtue of evoking the indian american experience and it also at times echoes richard ford's canada as well as richard russo john irving and any number of master storytellers that tell an epic story about family i applaud mira jacob's decade long investment in writing this book as it gave me a few days of unadulterated bliss i didn't want to say goodbye to the eapen family when i turned the last page at times i felt them brushing against my arm cupping my elbow and feeding me samosas and chutney the nuclear family here is thomas eapen a neurosurgeon kamala his wife their intellectually gifted son akhil and their photographer daughter amina only amina was born in america through most of the novel they live in albuquerque although amina as an adult now lives in seattle and works as an events photographer after leaving the serious business of photojournalism the novel alternates back and forth between the early 80's and 1998 but the offstage history is woven in seamlessly i don't want to reveal more of the story than is told in the book jacket there's a lot of discovery that is meant for the reader to unearth and even though a tragedy is revealed early on in a handful of words the narrative keeps you on tenterhooks until you actually get there hundreds of pages later this isn't a book with political polemics or sermons about social justice--but there is a lot of delicious indian food that made me hungry it's a domestic drama about a family dealing with love loss adjustment flux sleepwalking and candid photos--a very human drama that is also witty and sharply observed it moves swiftly a charismatic unputdownable tale told with levity and moving intensity jacob's prose is astute and intrepid the kind of sentences that get into your blood and is laced with smooth and cinematic dialogue if i could give this 6 stars i would","1020":"this book is too long and that lost it some star points but when i finished it i actually read the reader's guide which was meh and considered reading it all over again to focus more on the deeper themes like the supposed parallels between the suicide and akhil but it encompasses so much that i enjoy reading india and indian immigrants albuquerque good characters yes there were times that the length really interfered but overall i really enjoyed it it apparently took 10 years to write including a 3 year hiatus when the author's own father was battling cancer this may explain why it seems like there's just too much not just too many pages but too much going on in general","1021":"the sleepwalker's guide to dancing is compelling stuff engaging the emotions from the first page and becoming almost impossible to put down it is a vibrant imaginative family saga that spans 20 years and is by turns amusing and appalling but hard to resist mira jacob manages to balance the caustic humor and heartfelt compassion surrounding this dysfunctional family originally from india and now living in the us in a way that draws the reader in as each family member deals with their own individual demons sleepwalker's guide focuses on the interaction between the eapen family kamala thomas akhil and amina as well as and their adopted extended family narrated primarily by amina a once successful seattle photojournalist who has abandoned that career following a tragic incident and is now following her passion for photography via wedding assignments having always been a daddy's girl of sorts amina returns to albuquerque when her mother informs her that her brain surgeon father thomas has been carrying on lengthy conversations several deceased relatives are these conversations merely a coping mechanism for the brilliant surgeon or is there something else at the bottom of his behavior moving back and forth in time we experience the many aspects of the family's secrets as well as the losses that have made each of them who they are today the title itself alludes to the various times when sleep sleepwalking and lack of sleep are instrumental in the outcome of various situations confronting this family despite its sometimes abrupt jumps from one time period to another as well as the swearing and sex scenes that often seemed out of place in the story this is for the most part a credible relatable and complex story whose almost 500 pages move along at a steady pace as we follow the book's protagonist as she makes surprising discoveries not only about her family but about herself","1022":" the sleepwalker's guide to dancing by mira jacobthomas a neurosurgeon his wife kamala and infant son ahil moved from salem india to albuquerque in the us half a century ago going against his mother's strong objections a multigenerational multicultural family saga that spans continents salem india albuquerque new mexico and seattle washington cultures and decades told from the perspective of their only daughter amina the only one to be born in us she is a photographer and lives in seattle when she receives a frantic call from her mother kamala saying that she thought thomas was losing his mind and demanding amina to come at once amina is suspicious that her mother has an ulterior motive to find her a husband it is about a brain surgeon with something awry in his head a photographer who closes her eyes to what's right in front of her and a wife who is excessively religious but mostly it is about grief and struggles of an immigrant family there is comedy sadness and heartbreak beautiful novel just what i needed to get my reading mojo back","1023":"somehow i came around to understanding this book its characters and their probing of life life's unfolding events family relationships and death","1024":"that this is such a poignant lovely book makes it difficult to be honest about it the characters were unusual and sad and interesting and the story had the potential to be equally special but the whole book just seemed to drag along forever somehow it manages to be both special and wonderful and excruciatingly boring","1025":"this book had all the ingredients for the type of novel that win 4 5 star ratings from me it was filled with interesting family dynamics friendship sibling love love love mystery loss and grief an immigrant story and so much more made for a gripping readable first novel by mira jacob my sisters will want to read it for this statement alone air supply she gasped with understanding they really were such a better band than anyone knew that was not the only reference my dear sisters this had me singing lost in love and here i am the one that you love for the first third of the book for the rest of the normal non air supply fans out there please don't let this fact scare you away the characters are where this book really shines they are endearing as well as being complex and layered they left me waking up in the morning grabbing for the book first thing hooray for summer and not having to get kids out the door for school and staying up late at night to read a few more pages the pacing of the book was nice transitioning between different times and settings my favorite city of seattle was a lesser but still integral part of the book this was a perfect summer read even though it was a bit longer coming it right at 500 pages it clipped along and was a great companion at the beach at the park and all snuggled up in bed i love getting packages and what could be better for this avid reader than getting a free copy of this book from random house in exchange for an honest review thanks to random house and goodreads giveaways for lots of hours of reading pleasure over here with this terrific book","1026":"i was in love with this book from page one and loved it all the way through until about 3 4 in this is a novel that just seemed to drop off maybe a find your own meaning thing this story was so vivid that i could smell the arid desert air smell the pugnacious aroma of all the glorious foods hear the sounds of india and then the feeling of huh at the ending still a very good read and a great family drama i'm sure displeasure of the ending is the readers fault and has nothing to do with the writer i recommend this novel for sure","1027":"the sleepwalker's guide to dancing is the type of book that is difficult to put down engaging story characters you care about and something different in this case the indian heritage of most of the book's cast of characters that draws you in and makes you want to spend the weekend reading on the couch and i would argue the food should get a starring role in the movie if when one gets made curry chutneys you get the idea can you smell the coriander","1028":"could not put this book down","1029":"i couldn't recommend a book more highly beautifully written with characters more real than those we see everyday this book is a big warm funny moving and uplifting novel this is the best book i have read this year","1030":" i really enjoyed this book a lot i loved the relationships among the characters i loved amina's mother with her flubbed sayings and strong convictions i love thomas's sweetness i truly loved amina's photographing the most secret shameful moments of weddings and her secreting them all away the old world new world difference is something i've seen a lot of in books that deal with the immigrant experience but mira jacob's illustration of that felt very natural this book ended up being not really at all what i was expecting but it was a pleasant surprise i look forward to its discussion but i suspect that the older generation of folks i will be discussing this book with will have a much different interpretation and reaction to it than someone my age would i think it really accurately touches on the anxiety people my age are starting to experience nervousness about the health of our parents the desperate grasping need to start a successful career outward pressure to settle down etc and i don't know that that will be as heavily felt with my discussion group i'm interested to see what other say and will continue to look for more from mira jacob in the future","1031":"well written good story but ended kind of abruptly for me entertaining but left me hanging","1032":"i loved this book apart from being pleased to read a book about a syrian orthodox family how many times have i tried to explain to people that india is not a monoculture where everyone speaks hindi i think we all play with the line between reality and fantasy in how we choose to live our lives we find a place on the spectrum that is most comfortable the father's choice to visit with his son and consequently die seemed extreme to his relatives but we all delude ourselves","1033":"i enjoyed the book not a must read but i'd be interested in what she writes next i expected more tie in to all the drama from the past that is introduced in the beginning of the book but that rich storyline is really never delved into again yet by the end i was rooting for amina and her family","1034":"wonderfully written story about an indian family and all the cultural and familial layers regardless of heritage goes back and forth between 1970s through 1990s so also kind of fun to remember 1970s and 1980s details it's not a hard read but it covers difficult issues","1035":"but i might be a bit biased","1036":"i really really liked this book moving thought provoking and about lots of things i care about not an easy book to describe to others but definitely worth a read","1037":"this book was much better than the description of it","1038":"a wonderful journey into the family life i enjoy learning about indian culture great debut novel","1039":"wow once i conquered the names i couldn't put it down i'm sure i'll be thinking about it for a long time","1040":"i loved this book it held my interest from the first page the author did such a good job with the different characters in the book i felt that i knew them and would recognize them it was so easy to become emotionally involved with them very relatable i was so sad when the book ended i wasn't ready for it to be over","1041":" thank you to goodreads giveaways u0026amp the publisher for a free advanced reader copy of this book i really enjoyed reading this novel the chapters switching back and forth between time periods worked well you get a glimpse of what informed someone's behavior i thought that the chapter near the beginning dealing with thomas's family was very effective a little disjointed and unclear just like it would be for a child who was in the middle of it the different ideas of family intersected nuclear blood related and the family we choose through friendships in an interesting way creating tension i puzzled over the title a little bit i think it refers to a character in particular but not one i would have said was the main influence of the story","1042":"really enjoyed this read about an indian family in america the drama and quirks among them and the interaction between them when dealing with family tragedy and deep rooted emotional pasts","1043":"this is a great one the dialogue is fabulous","1044":"this was a selection for my book group i was surprised by how much i enjoyed reading it hard to put down i think i would have preferred a direct sequence in the story rather than the back and forth characters were well developed the characters remain with you long after you have finished the book","1045":"it was slow to get into and way too long jumping back an forth between years without a clear understanding about what was going on in the family i slogged through it but have read much better books","1046":"jacob in her debut novel has written a provoking story filled with poignancy doubts and longings she tackles such issues as immigration alienation and family relationships thomas eapen a promising medical student immigrates from india to new mexico much against his mother's wishes this sets the stage for his rocky relationship with his two children amina and akhil these two are grappling with their own acceptance into american society a beautifully written book which takes the reader on a wonderful journey","1047":" this was not a book that i would typically go for but it kept coming up on lists of things to read and i'm glad i gave it a chance it started off a bit chaotic for my taste and i almost walked away a few times but after few chapters i understood that there was a larger more complex story being told than what was just beginning to come together i love that the main character was so enamoured with her darkness and taking photographs of the dark side that she never connected it to her early losses the last third of the book kept me thoroughly entertained touched happy and sad a great book for anyone","1048":" this book is 500 pages and just as long as it needs to be be aware this is not an action driven novel jacob writes about the current struggles facing an indian american family through the eyes of their first generation daughter amina the story hinges on the teetering health of the father it is the fulcrum from which swings a wide tale of a multi generational family full of hurts and affections sacrifice and misunderstanding running away and reunion hopes and heartbreak a family as wonderful and maddening as the best of them are jacobs characters are average people not caricatures she sculpts them with great detail and they are beautiful in their flaws and idiosyncrasies she weaves their stories back 20 years prior to the action informing their current situation with the decisions that formed their path she lays out their humanity in a way that makes you sympathetic to each kamala the mother is my favorite unwittingly funny she is energetic meddling nagging and caring she reminds me of women in my own family her linguistic quirks are adorable and exactly the kind of thing that native born children of immigrants hold on to as something particular to their story i loved this story the ending was aching and good i felt like i knew this family and i cried for them in their moment of universal experience and difficulty brava mira","1049":"what an amazing first novel i've read reviews that said it was clever and funny but i thought it was really touching especially the end it made me think about my family and it struck that as much as this novel was about an immigrant family and their experience the connections and relationships reminds me of of my close knit overbearing know it all family definitely a book to be savored","1050":"this was a 2 5 star read for me it was ok likeable at times but i felt like there wasn't much to it positive aspects it was interesting to read about all the different indian foods and the indian culture of arranged marriages clashing with the american view of waiting 'til one is older and waiting until true love i did like how the characters were well developed with distinct personalities there were some good messages and good points about family relationships starting over courage through illness growth true love guilt and reality vs perception my favorite aspect of the book i think was the talk about photography it really gave me a good sense of what a photographer sees how to analyze a photo and pick up emotions and feelings through a simple picture the power of photos and memories complaints i felt like the book focused simply on a family going through changes and hardships constant low points then healing then family disruptions again focused on family drama it continually went back and forth from 1982 83 to 1998 only two real big moments lots of dialogue arguments conversations with family and friends not much depth or action somewhat predictable circumstances and yet unusual at the same time it would have been nice to have more descriptions and reflections rather than dialogue the story didn't really go much into india only the beginning set in the 70's otherwise it's just an american based story with some indian culture here and there i wish it went back to india more i didn't like all the talk about smoking and such i didn't feel like it was necessary and i felt like the ending didn't fully wrap things up some good quotes to reflect on \"you find the thing you love the most and time will stop for you to love it pg 175 thomas\"paige believed in akhil or at least gave him the benefit of most doubts in her eyes akhil's political tirades became evidence of great passion his neuroticism belied a big heart his tendency to pick fights was a desire for honest communication his pot habit was introspective \" pg 273 amina reflecting on how paige sees akhil all about point of view and how some people fit together and understand one another fully \"it was not an oh of disappointment or an oh of surprise but an oh that amina had never heard before scraped raw with an emotion amina would not know herself until years later when she understood what it was to long for someone to ache for their smell and taste on you to imagine the weight of their hips pinning yours so precisely that you crane up to meet your own invisible desire \" pg 347 about love \"if those first days were hard because remembering things about him hurt these days the days of forgetting things about him actually hurt worse \" pg 357 about the stages of grief\"it was not the most beautiful wedding she had ever photographed... but amina understood that these pictures would be the ones she would never tire of looking at \" pg 489 about real beauty in life filled with couples dancing love peace family","1051":"this book makes me want a new reading rate on my kindle for how slowly i read when i'm savoring every piece","1052":" i picked this book on netgalley because the idea of a family that traveled from india to settle in new mexico and then seattle just seemed like it had to be interesting -- all interesting places not very often mentioned together i was especially drawn to a work that was considered perfect for fans of meg wolitzer and jhumpa lahiri pretty good company for a debut novel so i actually finished this book over a week ago usually when i read a book i like i can't wait to tell my friends and anyone who will listen about it but something happened when i read this book and i needed to live with it for a little while after i finished there is an almost overwhelming sense of foreboding and sadness accompanying this book i spent a good part of it nervous and another good part waiting for the other shoe to drop so when i finished i was reluctant to let these characters go and a little greedy about sharing their story and truthfully no matter how cliche it sounds this book will break your heart if you let it and i did maybe it's because it's about our parents aging it evoked the sadness i felt when i read please look after mom it may have been that there were characters i related to in a tangential sort of way but their life experiences for the most part were very different from my own both geographically and culturally this is a story that spans generations it is written in sharp sometimes elegiac deeply moving prose it is overflowing with strong intelligent beautifully imperfect people struggling to make peace with their past and reconciling themselves to their uncertain futures it is also a book about hope and our enormous capacity for faith in new beginnings most importantly it is about families -- the ones we are born into and the ones we choose -- and how we grow and change with them over lifetimes of joy and sadness it is an emotional journey but i promise you will not regret the ride","1053":"this was probably 2 5 stars for me i didn't love it it wasn't terrible","1054":"i love this book and highly recommend to all i received this in a goodreads giveaway and can not wait for another mira jacobs novel","1055":" my preference in books is non fiction and i have read and preferred a number of narratives by immigrants describing their reactions to life in america this fictional account started well but bogged eventually for me amina became my least favorite character her constant state of angst became wearying i finished but hurried through and did find the later third more interesting i considered the fathers choice to forgo treatment might have been handled better a great deal more weeping and wailing than necessary over a perfectly reasonable decision better for readers of fiction who enjoy high drama","1056":"an excellent character driven novel about an indian american family in new mexico it was well written with strong memorable characters the story is about a dysfunctional family you grow to love them all slow beginning but then it was wonderful","1057":"i think i would give this 2 5 stars thought it was better in some parts than others","1058":" this is a really fun and touching character driven story about an indian family who immigrates to the united states in search of a better life as with many immigrants while struggling to assimilate in a new country they attempt to maintain many of their own cultural ways which naturally causes conflict in this story the conflicts are most of the fun the characters in the sleepwalker's guide to dancing are amazing funny and full of depth and life the writing sparkles and sometimes leaves you breathless it is a wonderful book a debut no less and i highly recommend it","1059":"i thought this was a very good book about immigrants from india living in the us and the problems the family has to deal with","1060":"beautifully written and still managed to be a page turner","1061":"loved this book kept me intrigued to the very end","1062":" a deeply moving book how many times have we heard of people who seem to be able to have the remarkable ability to live through adversities or who seem to withstand emotional turmoil we give them various courageous titles but the internal turmoil which such pillars undergo is very well explored by mira in this book reading this book helps us appreciate them better and understand that there are no super humans all of us are human beings with different emotional quotient many like thomas eapen in this book are not comfortable expressing or even accepting their emotions bottling it inside only to face a volcanic impact in long run mira weaves the story around some haunting memories - the self being consumed by the memories of the some loved ones but living only to ensure that it does not repeat with others mira has also brought to fore the trials and tribulations of a first generation and second generation immigrant how the roots refuse to give up claim on the self while the self finds little connect to the root - admired but not wanted back home the fellow immigrants are the only \"family\" members who come together to support each other in any adversities the characters in the story are quite limited - dr eapens his wife kamala daughter amina the main protagonist of the story and son akhil a relatively small flashback in india but which becomes a kind of core to the story mira does a great work in terms of moving the flashback to the current without making the reader lose the thread the story moves between salem in india seattle and albuquerque in us with ease the readers may find some terms difficult to understand but that should not impact the story by the way \"koche\" means little girl a great work considering that this first book from mira i would highly recommend this book if one is headed for some heavy reading","1063":"although a fascinating study of characters and their stories this book was not my cup of tea while i can appreciate it the author's style is not one i'm used to and the end left me feeling short

finished book of 2015 this was a random library find while i was waiting for something else and i'm so glad to have picked it up the poetic flow the beautiful descriptive of gritty philadelphia i immediately fell in love with the main character madeleine and her sad story a great book","2":" i didn't think i would like this book precocious child protagonists are not my thing but i did like it it may be one of my favorite books of 2014 child is precocious but mostly she's talented troubled vulnerable sympathetic the structure of the book is really interesting light bulb written almost like a jazz riff going from person to person in a bit of a random way but not losing the melody i really liked it i'm also not a fan of multiple viewpoints but this was done really well and in such a way that each character was sympathetic and interesting some were likable and some were simply realistic and sad despite the fact that we get little snippets of them at a time each is written with depth and kindness i didn't feel like i was losing by not getting more time with them i loved this book i did get impatient for it to end though i think because i just wanted to see what was going to happen and also because i'm just kind of an impatient person definitely a book i would read again also a book for me to buy so i can read it again definitely read if you like a little bit of experiment with your fiction do read if you enjoy contemporary fiction and something a little different also really wonderful characters don't read if jumping from consciousness to consciousness is not for you also don't read if you prefer a more rigid plotline or if you like your chapters long","3":"what a charming delightful novel i was prepared to feel lukewarm about this one because i didn't really know what it was about and sometimes precocious protagonists annoy me but i was completely wrong the writing is very poetic and the pacing is cadenced i guess that's the write word perhaps i made that up it's a quick read and i wish there had been more of it it's a sweet uplifting story with just a touch of magic","4":"witty tale about lives loves adventures of characters on the eve of christmas eve in snowy philadelphia the character capturing my attention was madeleine who at the age of nine was smart mouthed rebellious and an aspiring jazz singer being an outcast at her school she seeks out philadelphia's legendary jazz club the cat's pajamas where she's determined to make her onstage debut other characters go through the day with their own funny uplifting stories lighthearted charming debut novel from marie helene bertino","5":"the characters in this novel are intriguing although at times the shift from one set to another is a little hard to follow i especially enjoyed madeleine's and sarina's stories but the explicit foul language was too much for me to be able to give this a better rating","6":" i read an excerpt of this debut novel before book expo last week and was immediately charmed so i made a beeline for the author's galley giveaway and was fortunate to meet her and bring home a signed copy my train ride home from nyc sped by as i savored this novel and quirky irrepressible cast of characters i loved the fully fleshed out philadelphia setting the surprising plot twists and the beauty and rhythm of bertino's writing as befits a book about jazz enthusiasts the 9 year old main character madeleine makes the most of her time in the spotlight she's so full of life and consistently engaging i enjoyed the way the action took place over one jam packed day on christmas eve eve and the way the characters' paths intertwined as the day went on the ending is unexpected but intriguing i plan to recommend this to my friends this would make a terrific book club choice","7":"saw this at the library and was curious about the title so i started reading a few pages decided i needed to check it out and i'm very glad i did loved this story all taking place in one day night told from many different perspectives great characters and a great story","8":"this book was well written but the characters were all so depressing i kept listening to it waiting for it to end","9":"eeh it was alright alright enough that i kept listening except the narrator's tone annoyed me from the first i didn't get the end at all","10":"i have very mixed feelings about this novel the writing is exciting quirky poetic original and touched with beautiful poignant throwaway observances at times it made me think that the author was trying to write like kerouac and maybe that was the case given that the rhythms of jazz pervade the narrative and the 'heroine' is a jazz aficionado and aspiring singer the characters are unusual not terribly likeable for the most part there is no sole protagonist most of the tale revolves around madeline a complicated damaged toilet mouthed ten year old smoker jazz lover and aspiring singer there are reasons for madeline's complexities domestic difficulties no child should have to cope with they didn't make her likeable but she was never boring other characters are much less fascinating madeline's lonely teacher sarina was sympathetic but not that interesting lorca and sonny and alex the cubanistas and all the motley cast who inhabit the cat's pajamas a jazz club fallen on difficult times couldn't engage me and madeline's unofficial carer mrs santiago was just plain dull until the end when she becomes really weird i mean what happened at the end does anyone know that came completely out of left field and unless it all has some profound and clever meaning that whisked over my head it wouldn't be the first time it completely threw me out of the groove it ruined the ending for me left me feeling confused and bemused and thinking 'that was very silly' but not in a good way rather than happy and inspired all in all a bit of a curate's egg for all its faults i definitely i recommend it it's not just another face in the crowd and that in a world filled with new books that feel like you've read them before is well worth a few hours of your reading time","11":"this review has been hidden because it contains spoilers to view it click here liked certain aspects of this book but overall their were just too many negatives pros i like the concept of following characters around in 1 day jazz the title and the cute cover not shown on this book cons too many characters felt over written and i didn't care about any character i didn't even mind what happens to mrs s at the end because i just don't care forced myself to finish the book","12":" the thing i love most about this book is almost 10 year old madeleine a modern day ramona quimby with the vocabulary of a sailor and the voice of an angel madeleine's mother has died of cancer and her father is out of his mind with a combination of grief and drugs and can't be bothered to properly care for his daughter the book opens with a very bad day at school for madeleine her teacher sarina greene feels terrible for madeleine but sarina has her own problems newly divorced sarina accepts an unvitation an invitation one extends in the hopes that the invitee will decline to a friend's party where she feels awkward and lonely attending the party as well ben the one who got away who married a horrible sounding woman named annie in the meantime madeleine has learned that there is a jazz club the cat's pajamas in town and is determined to go there the owner of the cat's pajamas lorca is having problems of his own the most pressing of which is a hefty fine slapped on him by the police and the threat of his club being closed for good if he doesn't shape up as the day progresses into night things start looking better for sarina madeleine finds a way to the cat's pajamas lorca loses several things precious to him but in exchange he gets a better relationship with his son this book is funny sad touching magical and highly entertaining even though she's just an almost 10 year old girl madeleine is one of my new favorite literary heroines","13":"this is a rare decision for me but i've decided not to write a review because i just read one by a goodreads reader named colleen that voices my thoughts perfectly click here to read colleen's review","14":"this is my favorite type of book incredible creative writing a complex cast of characters that ultimately intertwine and an ending that makes up for the harsh reality of life","15":" 2 a m at the cat's pajamas by marie helene bertino would have been a fantastic short story no book has ever made me want to be an editor more than this one i love the title and the premise of this book three disparate characters mashup fantastically in a unique setting that's essentially the premise of every ann patchett novel and i love ann patchett the trouble with the cat's pjs is that it lacks focus and bertino tries way too hard to have a unique voice when i say lacks focus what i means is there are so many characters that it's nearly impossible to track what's happening to whom at any given moment soon enough i just didn't care the three main characters all residents of philadelphia are madeline a nine year old motherless blues singing protege sarina madeline's freshly divorced teacher and lorca the owner of a nightclub called yes the cat's pajamas the entire story happens in twenty four hours and the chapters are short some as brief as a sentence or two this makes for quick reading and an easy page turner--a good thing because otherwise i probably wouldn't have finished it my biggest gripe with the book though was the improbability factor first poor madeline's widowed father is essentially comatose with grief she is being looked after by a neighboring deli owner woman who was a friend of madeline's mother madeline's house is so filled with roaches that she names them how is the father who never leaves his bedroom paying rent if madeline is so much like her mother why isn't the dad enamored with her second in the first five pages we learn that madeline is nine and in fifth grade unless she's a girl genius she's not she would be in third grade third supposedly madeline sang along with a billie holiday record absolutely perfectly before she'd ever spoken her first word wtf i could go on with more and more examples of this nonsense specifically lorca's completely unrealistic relationship with his drug addicted son alex but you get the picture bertino did scatter a handful of lovely truisms throughout the book but for each one i have a dozen passages underlined with negative comments--everything from my aforementioned wtf to this makes no sense to me to ridiculous completely unrealistic who is this character again and why are we in the head of a dog because yes the novel is written in the omniscient pov to the point we even get into the head of a dog during one chapter how did bertino's editor let that happen if they were going for funny quirky they should have referred to where'd you go bernadette a funny quirky novel that was at least well written enough said this book found an agent and a major publisher so there you go two and a half stars","16":"i was expecting more from this can't put my finger on what disappointed me about it the characters just didn't connect with me","17":"a seriously lovely book read in one sitting just vaults you along for a magical day","18":"check out the marvelous reading room's review and discussion here https www youtube com watch v 6hefj","19":"loved this book the author conveys so much in so few words for the characters the scenes go back and forth between characters sometimes not such nice situations are explained so beautifully to the reader this creates pictures with words and emotional understanding that runs deep i found myself cheering for the characters to reach out and go for what they wanted to take the risk and find happiness in those risks","20":"cute idea but quite confusing over all too many extraneous characters too much flashing forward back and off to the side i was also really heartbroken that the little girl never got i dont want to spoil the suspense for any future reader what she lost out on in class even though it seemed like everyone in the book could speak of nothing else somebody could have easily remedied that situation i won this book on goodreads and i am glad i did as it is not a genre i normally would read but it is always good to broaden ones horizons","21":"loved the author's writing style meh about the story","22":"this beautifully written book takes place in just over a 24 hour period on christmas eve eve in philadelphia i loved the descriptions of the places you really feel like you're there the last third of the book seemed to be more of a runaway train in terms of actions and characters with you can't stand to watch but you can't look away disasters going on and some unsatisfactory lack of resolution language and content r rated at times","23":"this book is a true keeper it will make you laugh and probably cry it is beautifully written and engaging the ending is a bit of a mixed bag but is realistic the characters will touch your heart and i wanted more than the snap shot i was given don't miss out","24":"i found this book about the life and adventures of a foul mouthed catholic school girl her teacher and the teacher's long lost love who all meet at a legendary jazz club on its last night to be thoroughly enjoyable the author deftly handled every element so well setting characterization the city itself is almost a character plot pacing etc a little sad gritty bawdy colorful with just the right touch of humor throughout","25":" the other day i'm on the phone talking with my daughter in law she's says \"i'm reading a book you might like...but it's got a silly title \"i'm the person who wrote a young adult novel called fatty in the back seat silly titles don't bother me in fact i gravitate toward them i say \"go on \" and she describes the plot so i decide to read the book by first time novelist marie helene bertino and love it in fact i ditched all my required reading book club for the week and picked it up whenever i had a spare moment here's what i liked about the book the author's witty observations about human behavior bertino does a great job of getting into each character's head and revealing their often quirky thoughts i liked her characters there are a lot of them in this book maybe too many however it's been a few days and i keep thinking about two of them one is madeline an about to be nine year old who is a magnet for misfortune dead mother depressed father her birthday is on christmas which in her words sucks she is foul mouthed and feisty i felt myself rooting for her on every page the other is sarina madeline's teacher who is unlucky in love i liked the setting it reminded me of my own small city neighborhood growing up oh and there is this music theme throughout the book that is lovely the cat's pajamas is a dilapidated nightclub where jazz is played and fought over i enjoyed the voice really all the voices in the book and the smartass sort of omniscience tone with a touch of magical realism here and there my gripes are few and negligible maybe not as many characters or maybe i just should work on my paying attention skills also even though i like seeing the world from various character's perspectives sometimes the transitions seemed disjointed and rough i found leafing back trying to figure out what was going on all in all i thoroughly enjoyed the novel if you want a funny entertaining book to read over the holidays consider 2 a m at the cat's pajamas","26":"fun book to read the nine year old main character is great many story threads weave together over the course of a night with an ending that is ultimately unsatisfying but i enjoyed the rest of the book","27":"this book was an ok read but it did get a bit disjointed in parts and the characters aren't too desirable it felt as though the author could decide whether to write this as literary fiction or humor or chick lit the ending didn't seem to tie up any loose ends either","28":"i really enjoyed madeleine's story and didn't appreciate the jumping around since i found the other characters pretty boring","29":" the more you give yourself over to the world of philadelphia in 2 a m at the cat's pajamas the better your experience will be you have to get comfortable with menthol smoking nine year old girls who are in fifth grade most nine year olds are in fourth grade dogs taking over the point of view and old ladies who randomly take flight over the city if you can hang with those sorts of logical inconsistencies and random flights of fancy then you can hang with marie helene bertino's whimsical novel and have a good time read more","30":"i had a hard time sticking with this book i felt like there was too much going on too many characters and it was very hard to follow comments would appear within a paragraph and i wouldn't have a clue what it's referring to very confusing","31":"this book was delightful bertino's prose is more like poetry and her images and metaphors sing the book sets out to tell a story in the form of jazz and it works beautifully the narrative riffs it soars it dives it blasts just like a great jazz jam session bertino's characters are unique and very real and her take on philadelphia is spot on i'm looking for more great things from this author","32":"loved the writing and the characters but the plot not as much ymmv","33":"there are aspects of this book i enjoyed the little quirks that round out the characters the loving but not saccharine sweet details about my hometown city the musicality of the writing and the descriptions of music being made throughout the story the honesty of love and loss i struggled with the fact that sometimes the structure of the book and the story itself felt self conscious and i wish it had all flowed together a bit more easily all in all a fun romp","34":"3 5 stars this is second time in recent memory that i've read a book where different chapters are told from the perspective of different characters and i've concluded that this format just doesn't work for me i loved madeleine and her teacher i enjoyed the ladies at the store i didn't care for the characters at the club and found myself rushing through those parts to get back to the story i wanted to read the writing is strong which is why it gets such a high rating","35":"this is a charming wistful novel with three entwined povs i adored it i love how the music u0026amp the city were characters too it made me want to live in philly again however i don't get what happens with that one character at the end","36":"this is one of those books that stun you they take you by surprise and you do not really know what got into you you do know that you loved reading it and cannot stop talking about it to people \"2 a m at the cat's pajamas\" is a book that demands your attention and once it has it it does not let go till you have finished the book i remember reading about this book somewhere and i so wanted to read it and when i did i fell in love with it marie helene bertino writes with such simplicity and makes you want to believe in all things nice and hopeful her characters are despairing but never let go of hope and what it takes to be alive there are odd moments in the book and yet what they only do is uplift you \"2 a m at the cat's pajamas\" is a magical story it is a story of three lives colliding by coincidence chance by serendipity on christmas eve eve the action takes place in philadelphia we all know how a city becomes a character in so many books and it is the same in this one as well there is a nine year old madeleine who has recently lost her mother she is clueless in the world she smokes yes for a nine year old i was taken aback but then got in the groove of the book she wants to sing she is obsessed with jazz at the end of the spectrum is her teacher sarina who is recently divorced and something is soon going to happen to her the third character is lorca the owner of the cat's pajamas - a legendary jazz club which is soon going to slip away from him these three characters come together to discover love life happiness and hope the characters that meet each other in the course of a day and night are marvelous there are other characters as well besides these three that add to the plot and drive the story forward what struck me the most about the book is the honest voice in which it is written the book is told from the third person perspective and rounds up every emotion and scene very well bertino sets the story in such a way that everything is told or not told till 2 a m which in more than one way is the crux of the book \"2 a m at the cat's pajamas\" is a charming little book that makes you reinstate hope as these three go through the day and you with them as a reader your spirits are lifted you smile and laugh with them and feel a sense of melancholy when they are sad sometimes it is also necessary for a book to have those brilliant fantastical moments like mark helprin's books do to reinforce the magic of living \"2 a m at the cat's pajamas\" is a perfect book for the time when you are down and about","37":"a strange mixture of cute light holiday fare and gritty urban sex drugs rock n roll fable i felt like this book couldn't really decide what it wanted to be or maybe it was just me maybe i didn't get it there's a strange surreal scene at the end that both raised my eyebrows and also furrowed my brow see that's what i mean","38":"just could not get into this book or its characters","39":" i would give this a 4 5 if i could i reserve a 5 for something i believe would stand the test of time as literature still being read and talked about in 100 years when i first starting reading 2 a m i thought it was clever and fresh the author seems to be making up a language all her own to describe almost everything the fresh analogies and expressions come thick and fast but i was concerned that it was kind of a parlor trick think of the most original way to say everything and ta da you have a book that stands out and the originality does seem to shade into mere cleverness at times but it turns out she can really plot and she can really create characters who grow on you and she solves the age old problem of endings by giving us a very satisfying climax but also leaving the actual ending for each character open for them to work out later for themselves how well you can handle the occasional surreal elements is up to each reader for me they worked fine and i usually like my fiction 100% realistic considering i had never even heard of this author and this may be due to just my ignorance i was pleasantly surprised and recommend it","40":"the storyline jumped around a lot that it was difficult to follow at times but overall it was a good story that kept me reading more","41":"christmas eve in new york city and our spunky 9 year old protagonist recently orphaned has lost the starring role singing in church been diagnosed with head lice prohibited from making the caramel apple and expelled from school is there any way herdreams could come true at two a m at the cat's pajamas this is a sweet and tender romp through the city that never sleeps","42":" here's the picture a little girl almost 10 standing in front of a tall mirror trying on lipstick singing to old jazz singer records and grading herself with a clothes pin on her nose why because she wants to be a jazz singer like her mother oh the clothes pin you have to read to get that some treats need to be found by themselves i like the little girl and the cat's pajamas a small jazz club and the people directly connected with both so what's with a jazz club a minor child and christmas eve clothes pins aren't the only treats hereabouts","43":"when i started the book i wasn't sure what to think about it as it kept throwing up new characters and situations but as the story continued and i saw how they would all gradually knit together i felt more and more pulled into the plot yes some of the devices are a bit weak but overall it was a thoroughly enjoyable read","44":"a quirky read not my usual choice but i had to read it for a book group i feel it was written for another generation but it did have a readability about it i wouldn't have picked it off a shelf and i don't suppose i will read another by this author from choice but it wasn't a bad read spoilt by faint praise","45":"lovable characters interesting plot and a distinctive 20s jazz overtone despite being set in the present day would all be enough to make this an interesting read but really the main reason to read and enjoy this book is the writing style vignettes that intertwine characters ranging from main protagonists to their pets to random passers by and involving backstory dreams and the present effortlessly time is marked but this is mostly ignored until the titled 2 am it is distinctive flowing and enjoyable one complaint would be that i hope the last 2 3 pages are removed before publication the book is magical enough without the need for overt fantasy appearing at the very end arc read","46":"too many coincidences mar a sweet premise and the focus flits to less interesting characters than the wonderful madeline but when it works it's completely enchanting skip the audiobook though the narrator narrates it pretty hard with each sentence imbued with false gravitas and an irritating tendency for each sentence to descend which gets grating quickly","47":" chock full of metaphory goodness 2am at the cat's pajamas beautifully weaves together three storylines gravitating around a past its prime jazz club the novel's old world feel perfectly suited the smokey barroom the secondary characters were just as intriguing as the key figures and the foul mouthed nine year old at the center of it all quickly became a favorite of mine with it's catchy title and gripping characters i can easily see this novel gaining a following maybe not in the mainstream media but underground and i don't see that as a bad thing at all this is a special novel that i'll have at the ready whenever someone asks for a solid story but without all the hype and fanfare for the full review and more head over to the pretty good gatsby","48":"enjoyable read took awhile to get into though","49":"a cute seasonal book perfect for those who want a christmas themed read but without all the hallmark movie drama","50":"if i was reading it the format probably would have caused me to give up but as an audiobook it was absolutely enjoyable the story was weird kooky and heartbreaking in a good way it's definitely not a book for everyone but a fun story regardless","51":"liked this one but not the best thing i've ever read","52":"i really enjoyed the quirky characters in this book especially madeleine all madeleine wanted to do was to be allowed to sing in public when people heard her sing strange things happened but i was never entirely sure if the strange things were real or not at times i felt the story was a little hard to follow but it did add to the quirkiness that i did like i also felt that the story had a bit of a fairytale quality overall i would recommend this book","53":"interesting definitely different lots of interconnecting stories","54":" here's an excerpt from my review of this book on my blog you can check out the rest of the review here http humpdayhardbacks blogspot com i hate cats but i love pajamas so there were a lot of mixed feelings diving in it is cleverly written in a time stamp format--rather than using chapters it is divided into consecutive time points starting at 7 a m and progressively trucking along to 6 30 a m the following day set in philadelphia on the eve of christmas eve the novel rotates through the perspectives of three main characters each character is extraordinarily likable in their own unique way but everyone seems a tad overly suave sure i can enjoy a fantasy novel now and then but with something like this something that seems intended to capture people's imperfect lives and the emotions that are tied with that--i want it to feel a little less whimsical on the other hand i have to remind myself that this novel was refreshingly experimental as an aspiring writer myself toying with the idea of producing a fictional piece she makes writing appear deceptively easy overall this novel was still charming enough to deserve 3 out of 5 stars it would have earned 4 had it not ended in a bit of a confusing bust that randomly zeroes in on a minor character should have stopped the book at last call instead because obviously that's when all good things come to an end anyway i do believe that this book was worth my time and impressive for a writer in the beginnings of her career i look forward to her next book and hope that she can still retain her cleverness and suavity without overdoing it","55":" this npr book of the year presents a wide cast of disparate characters delightfully and poignantly described first is 9 year old madeleine motherless with a grieving father who won't get out of bed and whose all consuming passion is to be a jazz singer her teacher sarina lonely and sympathetic to madeleine has her own wishful unfulfilled dreams jazz club owner lorca is facing the prospect of his beloved club the cat's pajamas closing on the eve of christmas eve these three philadelphians have their dreams culminate at the cat's pajamas the story is one thing her wildly entertaining language and wit makes this one very special book \"clouds flinch\" \"teapot whistles barge in\" \"pinwheels hem and sigh\" something follows \"a gasp behind\" \"laughter unfurls like a scarf\" and this is only a small sample there is so much truth of the human condition some of it sad but showing the resilience of spirit it was a joy to read my very highest recommendation as a bonus the book includes a jazz playlist","56":"if it were possible i'd give this 3 5 stars i pushed my rating up not down because the originality of the book's voice really captivated me even though in many ways the book was unevenly executed some characters i believed others not and i say believed not liked because i don't need to like characters to love them it was never boring and even when the quirkiness spilled over into magic at times it never really lost me definitely recommend you try it and see what you think","57":"every sentence is its own little masterwork read my full review from the savannah morning news http savannahnow com accent 2014 08","58":" i am always amazed how some unfortunately more and more americans write is it because they go to creative writing classes or is it because they just want to be judged slightly above the common man the language they use is artificial and i often get the feeling that the thesaurus or have a new word for today is more important than the telling of the story the idea of the story is brilliant and if the characters would have been developed it could have been an outstanding work alas artificiality has crept in and despite all accolades has spoiled the effort what a pity for such a good theme","59":"very enjoyable and well told tale with enchanting characters that's perfect for a much needed break","60":" madeline is one of my favorite recent characters that i've come across in fiction she is a brash foul mouthed singer and bristles at everything hardened to the world after the death of her mother and snubbed at school in favor of another inferior soloist and she's only nine despite the odds being stacked against her she sets out for the cat's pajamas a local legendary jazz club on the verge of being shut down 2 a m at the cat's pajamas follows her lorca the jazz club owner who has run his place into the ground flaunting local ordinances and madeline's teacher sarina as she attempts to rejuvenate her social life it's a messy intimate homage to the city of philadelphia which is filled with a motley crew of characters bertino adds in glimpses to many of the minor characters fleshing out their stories and painting a energetic portrait of the city in the process her characters converge in a riotous scene at the eponymous bar brimming with humor and tenderly depicted misery this big hearted novel is pure fun without being schmaltzy though not at all similar in scope or story it reminds me in tone of beautiful ruins by jess walters a great way to start my reading year","61":"beautifully written worth your time","62":" marie helene bertino's prose reads like good jazz and she creates an anticipatory christmas eve eve atmosphere expertly her heroine a nine year old aspiring jazz singer is captivating the rest of the characters however are sketchy and at times hard to keep straight the plot i feel lacks tension and stakes and the surprise ending view spoiler an elderly shopkeeper suddenly becoming supernaturally buoyant and floating dreamily above the city hide spoiler left me confused and unsatisfied this had a lot of potential to be a really great book unfortunately it's only a pretty good one","63":"phillie on a cold winter night such an interesting array of characters all quirky and fun","64":"i liked it mostly very much but there was a magical realism supernatural metaphorical element that was dropped in with little explanation or exploration that threw me off","65":"the last two pages were really weird but i liked this book quite a bit anyway","66":"i loved the characters but wasn't in love with the ending quirky","67":"it took less than a day to listen to this well written novel about a precocious but badly behaved fifth grader madeleine altamori who lives in philadelphia on 9th street with her father she is trying to make the best of her shattered life her mother with whom she had a strong bond died of cancer about a year or so ago and from that moment on her father took to his bed and remained there he ceased to run his business and depends on this almost 10 year old child for his well being she dotes on him and takes care of herself as best she can but she is losing the battle as she watches her apartment and her life slowly decay around her she was born with a voice that transcends the sound she emits mesmerizes those who hear it and often causes unexpected reactions and behavior suggesting the supernatural she sang before she spoke a word madeleine is disappointed and frustrated with the direction her life is taking and she exhibits her anger with abhorrent behavior she uses foul language and shows little respect for her elders she has no real friends except for one who taught her every dirty word in her repertoire before she moved away she depends mostly on the adults who seemed to have respected and loved her mother and who have taken over her care especially mrs santiago who feeds her at her cafe and tries to help in her upbringing guiding her day by day in school madeleine is bullied and she bullies others which came first the chicken or the egg is hard to discern from the book but it is obvious that she has been picked on and the poverty that is engulfing her more and more as her father remains in bed neglecting his business does not enhance or enrich her life she is terrified of the roaches that are increasingly active in her apartment her clothes are becoming ragged and she suffers even further when she is humiliated at school when she is found to have head lice a shining light in her life is her teacher sarina greene she is kind to her and madeleine is looking forward to the caramel apples she is making for the class to celebrate xmas because madeleine has never had one underlying the story of madeleine is the story of sarina's own unhappy childhood and unhappy romantic life on the opposite end of the spectrum is principal randles an unlikely source of unhappiness for madeleine she apparently has her reasons for disliking madeleine that have little to do with madeleine herself one of them being her own troubled childhood memories when we meet madeleine she is practicing how to shimmy on the morning of christmas eve eve when the story ends the following day we find her in cafe santiago confessing her sins to mrs santiago who tells her if she cannot be honest she doesn't think their relationship will work out she asks her to sing and then mrs santiago who has always wanted to fly away and travel gets her opportunity in a highly unusual way that very same morning listening to madeleine sing gave people what they wanted sometimes in the hours in between madeleine's shimmying and confessing there is quite an assortment of events she gets and loses an opportunity to sing in assembly at school gets suspended for speaking disrespectfully to the principal then gets expelled from school for punching a fellow student in the nose loses mrs santiago's adorable dog pedro who is apparently suffering from a broken heart as do so many of the characters steals a fruit and is rewarded with a hoagie and sneaks into a jazz club the dog pedro seems to be the catalyst that introduces some of the characters to move the story along one of whom is mr lorca the owner of the jazz club the cat's pajamas located in fishtown but there are others madeleine's voice is her one source of happiness but she also has the recipe cards her mother left her which included advice about how to handle singing and life's challenges throughout the book there is a theme about intuitive moments in life with a recurring statement concerning airplanes which is \"the way you know with your eyes closed that a plane is banking\" does it foreshadow the idea that our lives can take flight and we can accomplish our goals if we try hard enough that madeleine's life will get better along with many of the other characters if they simply feel it or believe it at the end of the book the drummer gus's model plane finally soars into the air and signifies hope to me that all will be well exactly as sarina's parents used to tell her if only she could relax stop worrying and believe our emotions rise and fall as the book's themes develop we soar when madeleine achieves success deflate when she behaves rudely sadden when she experiences the pain of loss and the bullying of others from a fifth grader's perspective this book unfolds rapidly unraveling the emotions of both adults and children complete with the petty jealousies that plague us all bullying and the sense of entitlement held by those who are more fortunate and even those who are less fortunate is exposed in the behavior of both adults and children as they go about their daily lives as snobs or caregivers the dialogue and the thoughts of the characters are \"tongue in cheek\" and will often make the reader smile or lift their brows in wonder in this short little novel every sentence is pithy and there is not one wasted word the author has a unique way of expressing things as in describing the refilling of ketchup bottles as \"the marriage of two bottles\" every contrast is perfect i e while madeleine wears ripped stockings claire another fifth grader has perfect braids and gets to sing at assembly in their school st anthony of the immaculate heart while madeleine is forbidden because of an \"unpleasant\" circumstance these two fifth graders live in opposite worlds the story really centers around the happenings in a jazz club the cat's pajamas\" and the relationships between all of the characters seems to be revealed there dreams are realized there and destroyed there the club has been cited for breaking regulations that have been overlooked for years by another police officer who recently retired the new officer holds the owner accountable for the infractions lorca has disregarded the rules allowed too many patrons ignored fire laws and served the under aged he too is a single parent of sorts who has failed and like mark altamori madeleine's father he has an extremely neglected but talented child a son out of wedlock named alexander an expert guitar player there is a mixture of characters kind and cruel some with malicious intent like principal randles and others just doing their duty like officer len thomas there are many characters and each one serves to express a different kind of person a different motive for behavior a different walk of life the nasty children the rude adults all interact and reinforce their own personalities faults defects and strengths when contrasted 2 a m at the cat's pajamas is part love story part coming of age story and part fairy tale the real important values in life like relationships are stressed while the reliance on the material world is shown to be shallow the possibility of flying and accomplishing your dreams is the thought that i found to be a happily surprising theme at the end","68":"this is a very unusual book even though i enjoyed every sentence i found myself having to pause frequently and consume it in 20 page sips each day it felt like reading more in one sitting would spoil me for all other writing as if my brain would just decide this style is the new norm it feels like both a lighthearted fun story and a very heavy and emotional tome all at once","69":" my 5 star rating is for the audio version of this book i cannot attest to how well it translates in print my review is based on the audio version this was a quirky and whimsical book that immediately drew me in told from the perspective of different individuals at different times during a single day the story centers around a jazz bar lounge called the cat's pajamas and a little girl who has been neglected after the death of her mother with a brokenhearted father madeline is pretty much on her own with her jazz music after being expelled from school all madeline wants to do is find the cat's pajamas in sing madeline's singing however is not like others' it all culminates to 2am at the cat's pajamas this book is like lemony snicket meets the movie amelie a combination of dark humor and mixed with magical idiosyncrasies i have a feeling this book will be on the top of my list this year and has definitely been my favorite audio book thus far","70":"found myself smiling a lot while reading this one charming fun day in the life story of interconnected characters madeline is a firecracker and i fell in love with all of the characters and their stories","71":"i loved the characters especially madeleine a nine year old jazz singer who spends the entire book trying to get someone to hear her sing","72":"rips your heart out then rips it out again i keep reading because the writing is so good","73":"i really wanted to like this book the writing style was quirky and fun but i just didn't care about any of the characters or what was happening to them","74":"this was kind of an urban fairy tale lively funny poignant and so original it even made me feel a rush of affection for philadelphia and that almost never happens having now read both her books i can safely say that in marie helene bertino's hands you will never ever be bored i received this arc via shelf awareness in case anyone is wondering","75":"this 1 to 5 star rating is difficult for me three stars will probably lead folks to think that i didn't enjoy this book which is absolutely untrue it was fun and very well written in a quirky way that bordered on too cute at times i loved the characters and bertino's descriptions of ordinary everyday things were rich creative sometimes brilliant i enjoyed this book but it felt somewhat shallow i'm not sure how long i'll remember it or what will stay with me it didn't particularly move me or educate me or make me feel things except this one line toward the end that almost took my breath away in the jaundiced light of a streetlamp sarina realizes why people have children to see the face of the one they love at the ages they've missed to see his eyes on a son she could teach to use scissors more of this this is what i wanted more of i do look forward to more from this author and i very much recommend it for a quick satisfying lovely little read","76":" 2 a m at the cat's pajamasmarie helen bertino2 a m at the cat's pajamas is a fast paced novel with a cast of quirky characters that is terribly original it all takes place in one day christmas eve eve and follows the lives of three memorable characters these characters all make their way to philadelphia's once great jazz club called the cat's pajamas bringing their unique talents and dreams with them some of the characters include madeline a nine year old motherless jazz singer her teacher miss green miss green's beau ben and lorca the club owner madeline is about to have the greatest day and night of her life determined by her desire to make her on stage debut at the cat's pajama lorca is in a spin as he is about to lose his beloved club unless he can come up with $30 000 these three souls search for love and dreams and discover great possibilities in one night","77":"i enjoyed this book a lot the storyline felt innocent but there was a lot of back stories that pulled different emotions out of the reader the writing in this book was beautiful and a pleasure to read","78":"i'm really ambivalent about this book on the good side lots of fun jazz references very cleverly crafted story structure funny witty dialogue on the not so good side the characters are so witty they're brittle as is the story parts of it fall into spoken word rhythms more than narrative and the text is somewhat repetitive summation i think the book is well written but i did not particularly enjoy it","79":"this review has been hidden because it contains spoilers to view it click here i was so ready to give this book 4 stars it was quirky and i really liked the characters the dialog was great and i laughed out loud a few times but then in the last few pages it turned totally fantastical almost sci fi mrs santiago goes all aunt marge from harry potter and the prisoner of azkaban and it does not fit at all with the rest of the book terribly disappointing","80":"a lyrical sometimes confusing story i loved it anyway unique and refreshing","81":"wow i really did not like this book the writing was all over the board for me very erratic i enjoyed the main character madeline and her teacher if it were not for those two it would have gotten one star now onto something that is more my cup of tea as my mother use to say","82":"loved the story but found the ending to be very odd","83":" fanciful and charming this book chronicles one day the day before christmas eve as multiple characters' lives intersect and interact madeleine 9 going on 10 longs to sing much as her dead mother did various members of the community support her truly a village raising a child her teacher ms greene struggles with her recent divorce and with meeting her ex boyfriend ben who is wrestling with his own loss lorca the owner of the cat's pajamas jazz club tries to keep his establishment alive and his relationship with his son and girlfriend in place misunderstandings abound and strange coincidences occur the conclusion is open ended and would allow an interesting discussion for a bookclub on what continued afterward at times some of the events seemed over the top but for the most part it was a sweet read with a lot to consider","84":"i received an advance reader's edition of this book at the march 2014 pla conference where it was touted as one of spring's best titles it is not it has immense potential but falls far short set in philadelphia a lead character in and of itself on christmas eve eve bertino moves hour by hour throughout the day alternating between many too many individuals madeleine a mouthy 9 year old longs to emulate her deceased mother by singing jazz through an odd series of events she ends up at a jazz club the cat's pajamas just as it is closed down for numerous violations madeleine's teacher sarina greene sarina's high school crush ben the club's owner lorca and lorca's 16 year old son alex a talented guitarist also play major roles bertino is a short story writer and this shows like alexander mccall smith in his 44 scotland street series which originated as a newspaper serial she jumps from scene to scene person to person failing to fully develop many introducing intriguing characters like louisa lorca's girlfriend only to have them disappear giving others a taxi driver a nighttime produce vendor more time than they deserve just overall providing too many distractions also although the novel is contemporary it has a definite 20's feel there's an incredible amount of smoking and the carelessness with which madeleine whose father is physically present but emotionally absent is treated reminded me of that era bertino's writing tends to be arch cute and overwrought finally there's far more profanity than necessary","85":"madeleine a sassy nine year old has recently lost her mother and her father is having difficulty coping with his wife' death she is determined to make her debut as a jazz singer at the cat's pajamas night club in the meantime her teacher sarina greene is a recent divorce who is attending a party because her previous boyfriend will also be in attendance together the two of them go to the cat's pajamas after the party the owner of the jazz club lorca is in danger of losing the club due to laws not being followed the story is written about one day beginning at 7 00 am and ending at 7 00 am the following day each chapter is short and focuses on one of the three main characters i liked the premise of the novel and immediately felt an emotional attachment for madeleine however the plot lags in the middle and the conclusion is confusing","86":"charming and magical the touches of magical realism in this book make it so much stronger the characters are likable and heartbreakingly familiar i love the pacing of the book and the touches that made me pause to appreciate them i read it fast and with a smile on my face","87":"i absolutely loved this book it might be a bit confusing to some with the jumping between the intertwined stories but it is so richly written and so compelling that it didn't matter to me there was not a character i didn't enjoy even the unlikable ones of course it did leave me wanting an individual book about each person in the story","88":"what a fun fast read plucky madeline pushes her way to her dream while dealing with sadness grief and loneliness along the way enter a cast of characters including pedro the dog with a serious case of wanderlust a jazz club jaded musicians and the next generation seriously bit with talent and a hard road ahead delightful","89":"the every chapter being a different character did not help with the story structure","90":"a riot a joyful riot and full of hilarious banner moments borne by bound and struggling protagonists somehow in all the confusion they break free","91":"i had to force myself to read this book maybe because i was reading it on my kobo and the ereader experience just doesn't do it for me the book group discussion made me appreciate the book much more but i'm still only giving it three stars","92":"a delightful colourful read about second chances the book delves into the lives of a nine year jazz singer her frustrated in love teacher and a down on his luck owner of a jazz bar over the course of one day bertino flits between their perspectives along with a few other ancillary characters including a rogue dog creating a bittersweet portrait of people living in philadelphia wise observations livid detail and just enough hope imbues the book with a whimsical urban fairytale feel fans of the ballad of west 10th street the emperor of paris and nora ephron movies will love this one","93":"i really liked parts of this book but others were so boring i might be an idiot but the last few pages totally lost me","94":"kind of liked it except that it had that reek of literary pretension that annoys me","95":"so different and quirky but clever and fun","96":" i think i agree with the general consensus on this book the writing is good unique and quirky yet it was a little hard to follow at times madeleine's story broke my heart a little she is a poor kid whose mother recently died and who is neglected by her grieving father then there are the injustices she also faces in school like being expelled sarina also hurt my heart due to her tough childhood and the insecurities she faces as an adult 2 a m at the cats pajamas took me through a rollercoaster of feelings","97":"excellent except weird last two pages","98":" i received a copy of this from netgalley this one worked its charms on me right away and was a super quick read the novel itself is a bit slight at times because the characters are underdeveloped but that's mainly because there are too many of them the three central ones madeleine miss greene and lorca are developed well enough and really shine through but the other ones probably could've been cut completely or at least bulked up a bit the novel itself might be considered contrived by some but i thought it was charming from the outset the novel feels as if it's set in the 1930s and it's somewhat jarring when someone uses a cell phone within the first 20 pages even after you realize that the novel is set in current day it still has a feeling to it and an atmosphere of bygone times the novel ends up feeling a bit slight in terms of structure as well because the denouement feels a little bit abrupt and rushed i guess maybe i just wanted more the most interesting part of the whole thing was that for as whimsical and some may even say twee this was bertino frequently gobsmacks you with a beautifully profound turn of phrase she definitely knows her way around a sentence and i look forward to what she comes up with next","99":"3 5 stars i struggled with the first few chapters because there were so many characters to meet but once i got into it it was quite an sweet story with some interesting twists at the end she used some interesting writing techniques in places and i like how the various characters were all somehow related in the end the whole story culminates at 2am at the cat's pajama's","100":"i have such mixed feelings about this book on one hand there were certain aspects of the book i enjoyed such as the young aspiring jazz singer and her phrases for things the flow of the book was hard for me to follow it seemed to jump from one character to another with no real warning i liked the concept of the book but just don't think it was executed as well as it could have been i will say that i enjoyed several of the characters and wanted to know more about them which is what kept me reading the book i was provided a copy of this manuscript from blogging for books in exchange for an honest review","101":"a nice read interesting original well written full of humor and heart","102":"after being expelled from school foul mouthed jazz loving madeleine begins a quest to sing at the cat's pajamas the famous jazz club however is facing bankruptcy the owner has a tendency to break fire codes and liquor laws the stories of madeleine and her varied compatriots are told as the clock counts down to 2 a m though the setting is present day the anachronisms everyone smokes that pepper the novel evoke a bygone era","103":"i read about this book on the npr's best books of 2014 i didn't realize that the story of a nine year old madeline altimari who wants to be a jazz singer is a modern day story it brought me out of the story to realize that this was contemporary but other than that it's a fun story where the chapters take place from christmas eve eve until 2 a m and include a broad and cross section of characters with a touch of magical realism this was a book that was objectively very good i think i just didn't connect with it","104":"i enjoyed the author's unconventional writing style while it occasionally came off as trying a bit too hard it often was very creative and original the premise of three main characters' stories unfolding in a 24 hour timeframe was interesting i would recommend this as something out of the ordinary","105":"tried but too many characters made it hard to keep my interest","106":"this review has been hidden because it contains spoilers to view it click here whoa what happened here i had major issues with the language of this book not only with the plentiful cursing but with the author's syntax as well i was distracted by the unusual way she wrote and where she placed descriptive phrases i found myself rereading sections to figure out where i missed some pertinent information for example in the last acknowledgement the author writes you say you don't wear it anymore ted yet everyday i see it why not say i see it everyday placing yet whoa what happened here i had major issues with the language of this book not only with the plentiful cursing but with the author's syntax as well i was distracted by the unusual way she wrote and where she placed descriptive phrases i found myself rereading sections to figure out where i missed some pertinent information for example in the last acknowledgement the author writes you say you don't wear it anymore ted yet everyday i see it why not say i see it everyday placing yet everyday before the subject verb of the phrase breaks up my reading and distracts me then i have to go back and see what she just said there are several more examples of this syntax distraction in the book this is just the last one that tripped me up that said i was rooting for madeleine and wanted her to sing her heart out and really make something of herself i don't understand how her singing made her principal lick her date i think that happened but had to reread the chapter three times to be sure or how it caused mrs santiago the fly out over the city what kind of an ending is that it's too fantastic for this story which seemed somewhat rooted in reality until the last two pages of the book at least lorca notices his son and gets him on the road to recovery i like that he'll help him develop his talents on the guitar more","107":"some of the characters were more interesting to me than others but overall i loved this quirky little book it's a lovely look at the connections between people and the role of coincidence fate","108":"loved it so much resonates","109":"so original and so very entertaining if you love jazz and the suffering maybe not quite suffering in this case that inspires the greats to sing and play jazz you'll love this one","110":"i wasn't sure about this one but ended up really enjoying it there are several stories interwove some better than others but an enjoyable solid read overall","111":"some wonderful characters a plot that does not hold a story that takes place in real time worth it for a quick read the author has talent","112":"a charming witty and heartwarming book taking place around the floundering jazz club the cat's pajamas you have a cast of characters running and frequening the club my favorite is madeleine the little girl who recently lost her mother and is wanting more than anything to sing and be noticed and not for the wrong reasons a quick read and a book that makes you smile","113":"so charming and compassionately written maybe steps a little far into being literally magical it would have been perfectly enchanting without going there still i find myself missing the little world it made in my head","114":"it was entertaining and i liked the characters quite a bit but the ending really fell apart in my opinion possible it was over my head","115":"bizarre magical and charming madeleine altimari stole my heart with building anticipation as the clock counts down to 2 am we speed along with everyone on their journey to the cat's pajamas what a wild ad memorable ride i highly recommend this book","116":" i just loved this book i don't know how i got an advance reader's edition i must've done something but i don't remember what it's just a wonderful and delightful book i'm not sure what you would call it set on christmas eve eve in philadelphia it really gives me a beautiful insight of what it's like to grow up in the middle of a big city i live in an urban environment but it's not the same as a big city there's madeleine 9 years old and born on christmas who wants to sing jazz there's miss green her teacher who is trying to rediscover love there's lorca the owner of a jazz club who is trying to save his club from being closed and estranged from his son and everyone meets up at 2 a m at the cat's pajamas the jazz club if you want to rediscover your faith in humanity love and joy read this book","117":"cute readable if confusing at times what was the overall point of these stories who knows","118":"sublime delicious read in day flip to the start to dive right back in","119":"a simple sweet story about madeline altimari a young girl who dreams of being a jazz singer she practices singing the great jazz ballads in her room and grades her performances her mother corrine died from cancer and her father mark is withdrawn and depressed mrs santiago runs the local convenience store and she looks out for madeline madeline is expelled from school and key people in her life lead her to the cat's pajamas a jazz lounge where she is able to perform at 2 a m which is closing time for the club because of madeline every finds a little bit of something they lost in life or love vicky randles the principal finds love sarina madeleine's teacher finds her old love ben allen jack francis lorca owner of thr cat's pajamas believes in his son alex and his talent to become a legendary jazz guitarist","120":" i received a free copy of this book as a goodreads first read the concept of a 24 hour day in the life coupled with a smooth fun writing style made this book enjoyable i found some characters to be more intriguing than others and caught myself wanting to skip past some chapters to get to the ones i liked i e madeline overall this could have been a four but the ending really created a disjointed conclusion as one reviewer stated maybe the ending will be changed before final publication","121":" it's always a bit of a risk when you read a book where each chapter takes the point of view of a different character you always tend to have one character who you just want to skip over to get to the more interesting ones this book about a little girl a philadelphia jazz club and some unique characters who cross their paths avoids that and is a fun read in the process it is a book about jazz and it has the feel of jazz fun light interesting and a great time with characters you care about","122":" the city is in a perpetual state of not being quite ready to talk about it instead it lashes its wind against the banners of the art museum moody light changes down market the cars bitch toward city hall puddles yearn toward the sewers the unrequited city dreams up conspiracies and keeps it buildings low to the ground this book is wonderful beautiful and all things a book should be it makes you feel for that motherless girl who is victimized by her peers and discriminated against by the adults who are supposed to be on her side it makes you sad for the teacher who has loved and lost and is trying to love again knowing very well that she is loving the wrong person the jazz club owner whose life is unraveling so rapidly the adolescent who only wants his dad's approval but that seems impossible even the man who lost his wife and is unable to cope with the reality of it and so fails his little daughter mrs santiago who keeps working with her dead husband's portrait for company essentially raising the little girl whose father has checked out the little girl's yearning to sing the dog pedro and his little eccentricities who is as much a character as any human being in the book 2 a m at the cat's pajamas takes place over the course of one day and what a day it is linearly told in the context of time and narrated from many perspectives bertino's characters are so vividly rendered and though some storylines clutch at your heartstrings there is not an ounce of maudlin sentimentality to the novel the writing is superlative the ending liberating even if you don't usually read lit fic read this one it is not pretentious it doesn't serve as a platform for the author's own intellect as some do what it is is powerful raw and splendid","123":"it is dark dark seven a m on christmas eve eve seventeen hours and 257 pages later in the grey damp pre dawn of christmas eve the lives of a motely crew of dysfunctional characters will be changed forever","124":"sadly this one was a no go for me it started off pretty great and i thought i was going to love it but then i got really bored half way through and didn't like the ending at all i also found the side stories to be too busy and the plot bounced around too much for me i just wanted to hear the stories or the three established characters who could have been great if we had gotten more time to get to know them","125":"i had a hard time getting into this book i felt like there were too many characters telling too many stories i couldn't quite connect the dots","126":"this is not a book for everyone sometimes it feels more like a really long funky urban poem than a novel the book follows several inter twined characters through a rather eventful christmas eve eve it took me a little while to get into the rhythm of the book i almost didn't make the effort but i'm glad i did i enjoyed the audio version but almost wish i read this one so i could back up and re read some of the lines just to savor them if you like a straight forward story line and have a need to know what's going on all the time skip this book audio version done very well","127":"i loved this book great characters and fun quirky storyline right up my alley","128":"i liked the story told in one day spiraling around the young girl but there were so many characters that having them all wrap up in one night including the incident with the guitar was too much and i really did not understand what was happening with mrs santiago at the end but there was brilliance and hope and it was a fun read","129":"this is a fun does of magical realism fabulist fiction centered around the lives of various people in one twenty four hour period and how they intertwine and culminate in one stirring moment at a jazz club great characters with lots of depth and a really solid prose style with vivid language and almost poetic imagery just a fun solid read","130":"best book i've read in years fantastic writing brilliant characters poetic pacing lots of swearing and music perfection i will buy this one so i can go back to it anytime i want to read something genius","131":"loved it very different style of story and loved the craziness of it","132":"been on my tbr list for a long time fell short for me","133":"one of my least liked books of all times the characters were awful especially the main character madeleine a 9 year old wanna be jazz singer who swore like a sailor the book jumped around with a lot of superfluous stuff thrown in don't waste your time","134":"cute easy read but nothing special liked philly references annoyed by location inaccuracies takes way more than 4 min to walk from south street to fishtown","135":"a fun romp that i hoped would pack more of a punch felt like it was set in the wrong time period but maybe that was the point","136":"not sure what i think of this book it was somewhat fragmented and some of the characters weren't developed very well hmmmm","137":"wanted it to be so much better lyrical prose interesting format but not much substance more like a novella","138":"the writing was really fun and different i found myself rereading the extra interesting lines and wondering how in the world the author came up with that particular phrasing i wish that the story itself could have held me the way the writing did i originally thought by the first couple chapters this would be a 4 star book but the story really lost me after some time so it is bumped down","139":"really quirky book and a wonderful read the characters are imaginative and likeable no matter what you really begin routing for each one's happiness","140":"madeleine altimariis obsessed with old time jazz and she wants to be a jazz singer like her beloved blossom dearie she is nine years old going on ten madeline is smart a loner a smoker and cusses like a dockworker her mother recently died and her father has vanished into his own despair the cat's pajamas is a legendary philly jazz club but it has fallen on hard times barely held together with spit and duct tape it is owned and operated by jack lorca who is on the verge of bankruptcy madeleine altimari is obsessed with old time jazz and she wants to be a jazz singer like her beloved blossom dearie she is nine years old going on ten madeline is smart a loner a smoker and cusses like a dockworker her mother recently died and her father has vanished into his own despair the cat's pajamas is a legendary philly jazz club but it has fallen on hard times barely held together with spit and duct tape it is owned and operated by jack lorca who is on the verge of bankruptcy this story is how madeline and the jazz bar come together on one long serpentine christmas eve eve there is a patchwork of engaging characters weaving in and out of this tale some touching upon the girl and others on lorca it is bright and funny and the author seems to have a genuine feel for music which only enhances the narrative what a pleasant surprise this turned out to be i hope this novel finds a wide audience more","141":" marie helene bertino's 2 a m at the cat's pajamas starts slow and continues that way it tells of the events happening in philadelphia 7 a m on christmas eve eve until 7 a m on christmas eve the chapters are the time slots covering this 24 hour day in the lives of dozens of minor characters eventually maybe half way through the novel you can pick out the main characters and be relieved you don't have to remember specific details of all the rest first there is madeleine altimari a 9 year old with an amazing ability to sing jazz it is good she has some talent because her mother is dead she might have been a singer also her father has been prostrate with grief since that time she is cared for by mrs santiago who may be a cook and has a small dog pedro who runs away a lot her school mates hate her as does the principle and most teachers except sarina green the second main character who has had a crush on ben since their high school prom but he is married of course to someone who he no longer likes the third main character is probably lorca owner of the cat's pajamas a jazz club which has to close because many of the musicians the cubanistas live on premises smoke stay open too late and let under age people mainly lorca's son alex play in their band the chapters are short flitting between 10 minutes and an hour 1 paragraph to several pages which helps because they also flit between the innumerable characters in a marvelous climax at 2 a m the morning of christmas eve madeleine sings on stage alex plays on stage sarina kisses ben and the law comes in to close the club in the conclusion up to 7 a m all go home alone but with the magical hope that their dreams can be fulfilled for more than the brief climax at 2 a m all that is except mrs santiago who floats away from dutiful reality in a dream hallucination or christmas magic there are some funny or maybe ironic spots some colorful descriptions of parts of the underbelly of philadelphia a lot of characters some of whom eventually become individuated i liked madeleine alex sarina and a few of the others but mostly i felt sorry for them their lives are going to be no better after than before or during the novel the plot is easy to follow but not very engaging","142":"amazing fun and random and quirky and thoughtful and full of some gloriously unusual but equally gloriously fabulous uses of language definitely worth a look","143":" 3 5 starsthis was a unique book the focus on the time of day moved the story along at an interesting pace i was very focused on getting to 2 am the cat's pajamas is a nightclub the narrator is just 9 years old and very much wants to be a jazz singer madeleine is a heroine you cheer for and want to take home and raise as your own and i would be eager to read more by bertino as her writing was rather illuminating see examples below sarina wants to retract her acceptance the phone call this day like the cord to her vacuum that rewinds with a powerful thwip we carry our ancestors in our names and sometimes we carry our ancestors through the sliding doors of emergency rooms and either way they are heavy either way we can't escape the way that woman walked like she was paying the sidewalk a favor in the jaundiced light of a streetlamp sarina realizes why people have children to see the face of the one they love at the ages they've missed to see his eyes on a son she could teach to use scissors the tax attorney's cheeks are the color of sheets she can't afford if you are anything other than humbled in the presence of love you are not in the presence of love","144":"the story in the book left me a little lost so many characters were hard to keep straight madeleine was my favorite by far what this book lacked in story it made up with in language the descriptive writing is beautiful it drew me in from the very start i suspect many readers will have a strong connection with the motherless girl and the adventures ahead of her i would read that book","145":"a feel good book is always welcome many readers will find \"2 a m at the cat's pajamas\" to have an overall uplifting effect if you liked \"the good luck of right now\" see also \"silver linings playbook\" you will probably also delight in this philadelphia story the cat's pajamas is a jazz club in philadelphia's fishtown - another name i like the house band there is the cubanistas led by max cubanista who tells people he is from cuba lorca however inherited the place along with the prized snakehead guitar his son alex the next generation practices guitar when he can while in another part of the city young madeleine hopes to sing anywhere since they won't let her at saint anthony's her teacher and her principle - childhood classmate of madeleine's recently deceased mother - don't know what to do with this sassy girl the things a child like madeleine worries about and isn't afraid of and the grown ups they have their significant memories and imaginings everyone has their flaws and their positive character traits one complaint i'd have is that some of the secondary characters are a little hard to sort out they are in and out usually together so telling one from another may require a closer second reading however i give this book points for the descriptions of music and for its real originality making the unnoticed details of everyday life shine and in the crossing paths of the various characters though the chapters are only an hour or less apart each passage feels like a new day showing how much can happen in a day - and a night note this book was provided through net galley and my review also appears on my blog http matt stats blogspot com","146":" marie helene bertino has a very unique writing style that is very heavy with imagery and similes the imagery in this book was so vivid i could see this book was so vivid i immediately saw this book as a better movie than book the movie i anticipate this being is mix between inside llewyn davis and love actually like the movies this book reminds me of the characters were colorful and fascinating the story follows madeleine altimari whose mother died about a year ago she lives with her dad and is taken care of by mrs santiago madeline is obsessed with jazz and is a self described jerk with no friends the b plot follows the family of the jazz club the cats pajamas who need to find $30 000 to keep the club open additionally i found it fascinating how philadelphia and music were the most important characters in the novel as stated on page 3 philadelphia wakes up in the morning and says \"good morning fuck you \" personally i love that line because we have all lived in cities like that and loved it the way the music adds a soundtrack to the story makes this book feel very interactive however the storytelling in this book is where bertino disappoints this book has so much potential that it just doesn't take the pacing and the plot was went nowhere very slowly i really wanted to love this book and i feel terrible that i was disappointed but i would love to watch this movie the best example of how this book dissatisfies is as misfortune ensues the characters they react then while i was not expecting a whole lot of development over two days it seems that backstories and personal drama do little drive their plot beyond the foundations of the book's plot madeline is told she has a chance to redeem herself at boarding school by singing is passed over gets lice punches a boy and expelled she has the worst day you'd expect for anyone including a nine year old but she almost immediately moves on and the book pivots taking a hard left turn to focus on another character and that character's drama as the reader we have no time digest the characters their drama or their plots the graphic design of the front and back covers was great it emphasized the jazzy tone and urban atmosphere of the book i look forward to reading more from this author but also hope to find better novels from her

oprah's page the writing is very good and the author does give a lot of detail but i feel that the book could have ended better when i finished last night i closed the book and thought to myself that's it it was like turning the lights off to go to bed there was no big finale no ah ha moment or aww because sarina and ben live happily ever after if you're looking for a story with a suspenseful ending or something that makes you thankful you read it the book you won't get it with 2 a m at the cat's pajamas the story is written based on the timeline of a 24 hour period which revolves around a night club and individuals that have some kind of interaction with this club","155":"thoroughly entertaining","156":"pretty prose just never got into the story","157":"loved madeline really liked the sarina ben arc and wanted to hear more the thing with the principal was weird the end i didn't like","158":"very different i liked the all the different perspectives while a child is the protagonist it's not a children's story i recommend it","159":"four stars","160":" madeleine altimari a foul mouthed chain smoking 9 year old girl with dreams of becoming a jazz singer like her dearly departed mother sarina greene madeleine's teacher who moves back to her hometown of philadelphia after her divorce and reunites with her high school love jack lorca the owner of the historic cat's pajamas jazz club who's dealing with the looming threat of having to close his beloved building marie helene bertino tells the interweaving story of three different characters over the course of one day christmas eve eve in her debut novel madeleine lives in a roach filled apartment with an absent father after her mother passes away clearly this doesn't do much to dampen her lively and spunky spirit i like how frankly the author describes her madeleine has no friends not because she contains a tender grace that fifth graders detest and loathe not because she has a natural ability that points her starward though she does madeleine has no friends because she's a jerk pg 21 22 the book goes on to describe exactly why she's a jerk she punches a boy the way her mom taught her when she gets expelled and though i admit if i knew a girl like her i probably wouldn't want to be her friend either but she was most certainly not an unlikeable character for me perhaps it's because she holds on to her dreams of becoming a jazz singer like her mother and whenever she does sing magical things happen for me she is the epitome of magical realism and for that i'm invested in her outcome sarina is helplessly in love with a man she was spurned by during her youth fortunately or perhaps unfortunately she runs into an old high school friend who invites the two of them over for dinner and her story unfolds where madeleine represents an element of the extraordinary sarina's was painfully familiar who hasn't felt the sting and lasting hurt of an immature boy i was incredibly interested in how her evening with ben turned out and hoped only for a happy one and finally there's lorca who is cited for way too many city violations at his club and fined an exorbitant amount of money else risk closing the historic club forever lorca was the character i connected to the least perhaps it's because he's not the most talkative nor expressive of people so i felt his character development a bit lacking compared to the rest of the cast of characters it's unfortunate because he has the most going on looming foreclosure of the neighborhood gem his girlfriend leaving him and his son alex seeking his approval on the musical stage the book reads a bit like a wes anderson movie whimsical and romantic complete with a sailor mouthed kid and i rather liked the jazzy tone of the novel's pacing i think what bertino does well is capturing moments feelings and characters through colorful language and imagery she fleshes out even her secondary characters like pedro the dog and ted stempel she proves with each word why her book is worth our time she paints a picture that enhances the reading experience of her novel you will laugh at her tragically clever punchlines and feel sad with the characters too while reading i've definitely stopped to mark clever one liners and thoughts i've certainly had but was unable to articulate so eloquently i did some research on bertino and it apparently took her over a decade to finish this book there's definitely a sense of this novel having been well worn in like a pair of shoes you love and fits comfortably it's clear that the author loves philadelphia and kept all the details and the intricacies of the city in mind while writing this novel it's equally clear she has a deep appreciation for jazz music fun fact bertino has created a playlist for this book that's available on spotify and it makes for great listening while reading this book","161":"i had some difficulty getting into the storyline but once that passed there was a flow it was sort of the way jazz hits some people worming it's way into your soul there is sadness here that almost permeates the air but since it is christmas eve eve the sadness doesn't smother you with christmas coming a light snow and a girl 8 years and 363 days old that can sing like billie holiday how can there not be a little bit of hope for the future maybe there will be a sequel","162":"marie helene bertino leads the reader on a merry chase with her unique writing style and large cast of characters a bit of a struggle for my elderly mind but well worth it madeleine altimari lacks two days of being ten years old she also lacks a mother she has died recently and her father is lost in despond what she has is lice a smart mouth determination and a mighty jazz singing voice her teacher sarina greene is newly divorced and still has painful memories of her high school prom lorca owns the dying cat's pajamas jazz club and does not want his son to have anything to do with jazz it will all converge at 2 a m","163":"i loved the language and descriptions through out this enchanting novel about a young girl who has recently lost her mother all she wants is a chance to sing but it seems the planets are aligned to prevent it until","164":"may contain spoilers the witty jerk named madeleine altimari is a rebellious nine year old who is aspiring to be a jazz singer like her mother while still mourning the recent death of her mother she encounters a strange cast of mishaps and characters on her way to let the world hear her singing the little smart mouth girl has to fend for herself in the world of unfairness and cockroaches she is surrounded by mean classmates rejection at school taking care of her grief stricken father all the while trying to find her spot in the world lorca is the owner of the cat's pajama who recently hit a string of bad luck and needs $30 000 to save his jazz club sarina greene is madeleine's teacher who is also going through a divorce and recently started to rekindle a friendship with a high school sweetheart ben together with madeleine they string together a tale of events that leads them all to the cat's pajama at 2 a m the story reads like a prose from a poem it is written in a span of roughly 24 hours three characters search for love music hope being lost a sense of belonging and a connection the book is a quick read as it is separate in time increments and it is told through point of views of each of the main characters majority of the time the book lapses time normally but on page 127 128 time went backwards which was a bit weird and made no sense the story seems a bit weird and hard to imagine the story ever happening and the characters are not very relatable at times the story is filled with profanity and violence while making a nine year smoke cigs and aggressive father hard to love and root for the story is filled with lapses and the end makes very little sense at all the entire book madeleine struggles to have her voice heard but when she does she causes incidents how this ties into the flashback with her mother and father and the ending is very ambiguous at best the story reminds me a bit of matilda but sadly doesn't compare to the greatness of roald dahl's masterpiece although the title is quite cute","165":"i'd give this 3 5 stars i liked the story but the writing was a little overdone at times","166":" huge thanks to blogging for books for providing a copy to review all thoughts are 100% my own 3 5 5 starsthis book took a while for me to get into it follows multiple point of views which can start off as being a bit confusing but before i knew it i had completely fallen for the characters each person is extremely quirky and fun however before i fell in love with the characters i spent a good portion of the book being thoroughly confused each pov is pretty short and the plot lines constantly switch which made things very difficult to follow despite that i managed to sort through all the characters by around mid way the writing style is as quirky as the characters it's almost lyrical at some moments and makes the book a really quick read personally i think i definitely need to reread this book again because i just flew through the story and i feel like i probably missed something big besides the writing is so nice it would be a great experience madeleine is probably one of the most interesting little girls i have ever read about her mother died and her father is drowning in grief she has a penchant for bad words and also has one dream and that is to sing in public but it has been forbidden after her last experience i wish there could have been more explanation as to what happens when she sings in public because it wasn't fully explored other than madeleine my favorite character has to be the old dog pedro his pov was just really adorable to read from the other characters kind of faded to the back of my mind and all the plot lines just somehow wound together overall the story's really fun and adorable and i definitely need to find time to reread this book in the future","167":"i couldn't wait to read this book but then what a disappointment it lost me on the first page an 8 year old dragging on a sigaret really the characrers shallow and flimsy the story difficult to follow the writing assumed you were in the author's head and knew exactly what she meant","168":"rating and review to come later but for now let me just say i think i know what everyone on my list is getting for christmas this year","169":"2am at the cat's pajamas is an incredibly beautiful inspiring and above all human novel the characters don't pretend to be anything they're not they're flawed rude gentle kind mean funny sad and real this novel shows how even the most disconnected of lives can intersect in moving meaningful ways and for that it is an absolute triumph","170":"recommendation from book riot podcast #1042 a m at the cat's pajamas takes place in philadelphia over a one day period it is the story three unforgettable characters searching for love madeleine is a cantankerous nine year old she lives with her father who is mourning the death of his wife madeleine's mother madeleine is an aspiring jazz singer and is frantically searching for a famous jazz club called the cat's pajamas madeleine's fifth grade teacher sarina is recently

his beloved club in the end they all get exactly what they need on one snowy philadelphia christmas eve eve","171":" oof this book gave me a headache at first there was an amelie like quality to the introduction of a very very large cast of characters but that enchantment got old quickly backing up this book follows a number of characters a day in the life sort of deal including timestamps leading up to 2 a m not so spoiler alert it's in the title not only are there multiple main characters to keep track of but there are multiple minor characters thrown in for good measure as well as characters who make a short appearance to add to the flavor of the story but whose existence seemed to serve no real purpose to me other than to confuse and frustrate me i enjoyed 100 years of solitude and found that book a bit easier to follow character wise just as a reference i was most intrigued by the love story and would have much preferred to get more of a history on the characters involved in that series of events but they were just another pair of cogs in the wheel chugging the story along to the cat's pajamas at 2 a m unsurprisingly all of the characters interact in one way or another before they wind up at this jazz club for the much hyped 60 seconds at 2 00 a m that the title boasts i didn't feel that this was a character study nor a particularly plot driven novel i think the zaniness of the way the story is told is meant to overshadow these elements while i think i could have been captivated by this story had it been more focused on fewer characters i have pretty good concentration while reading but i had to keep rereading passages because i wasn't sure who was who and what they were doing and what was real and what was invented the whole thing felt very disjointed to me some might find it charming again a la amelie which is my favorite movie so that's a high compliment and maybe i'm not the intended demographic but it was a relief to finally be done with this one if only because the laundry list of characters detracted from my enjoyment of the story as a whole","172":"can't stop thinking u0026amp talking in short snappy powerful sentences","173":"this review has been hidden because it contains spoilers to view it click here 4 5 5 there are several different sets of characters in 2 a m at the cat's pajamas all of whom are tied together in some way and it's only natural to have particular favorites but i found that in spite of not loving absolutely every character and not even necessarily adoring the storyline in its entirety i loved this book because it's stylistically stunning particularly in the author's distinctively quirky use of language i found myself rereading sentences so frequently that i almost feel 4 5 5 there are several different sets of characters in 2 a m at the cat's pajamas all of whom are tied together in some way and it's only natural to have particular favorites but i found that in spite of not loving absolutely every character and not even necessarily adoring the storyline in its entirety i loved this book because it's stylistically stunning particularly in the author's distinctively quirky use of language i found myself rereading sentences so frequently that i almost feel like i've read the book twice i did have some problems with the book yet i couldn't bear to take off more than a half point there is a lot of crude language in the book a lot and it's the kind that normally will convince me to close a book and set it aside while i could understand the vulgarity as one of 9 year old madeleine's characteristics to portray her as wounded and acting out she was not the only character who used such offensive language and that did detract from the prose which otherwise sparkles the other problem i had is possibly a spoiler so i'll set it off a bit here possible spoiler there is a hint of magical realism to madeleine's singing but when she sings in the cat's pajamas a jazz club everyone admires her voice and that's it no dancing silverware or chaos ensues as it has in her past that was a bit of a let down it seems the author brought that touch of magical realism back for the ending but i'm not entirely certain what happened at the end so maybe she did maybe she didn't and yet her use of language is so irresistibly unique that i didn't care about the ending i closed the book thinking i'm going to have to read this again more","174":"the story follows a single day in the lives of several characters their tales interweave and eventually come to a head at a jazz club called the cat's pajamas at you guessed it 2 a m one of our characters is madeleine a 9 year old who loves jazz music wants to sing and is still missing her newly deceased mother her teacher sarina is back in her home town and is surprised to be invited to a dinner party thrown by an old acquaintance her old flame ben is going to be there lorca owns the cat's pajamas and has managed to violate just about every building code ever and now owes the city a ton of money or risk having his club shut down his son alex wants to play guitar on the club's stage i listened to this on audio as narrated by angela goethals she is great at doing all the various voices but comes across as over earnest in her narration nonetheless i was totally sucked into the story and each of the characters' need to find love and hope on christmas eve eve also there's this tease throughout the whole book about what happened when madeleine sang at school about a year ago the pay off is surprising and pretty great 2 a m at the cat's pajamas is both funny and sweet i really enjoyed it","175":"i'm not sure how i feel about the way in which the author played with the conceit of this being set during one 24 hour period too much of the book was spent in flashbacks to explain the current action it also felt a little too crowded with characters three major and a few minors that felt intrusive because we got too many povs having said that it was an interesting look at what was probably the last night at the cat's pajamas a jazz club in philadelphia the main characters' lives intersect here with madeline and her dead mother as the connective thread why madeline's last singing performance went so badly is never answered but ultimately that doesn't matter there are no truly happy endings here just a lot of ambiguity as to what will happen the next day or the next week arc provided by publisher","176":"enjoyable slightly magical book i really liked this tale of a young girl and various other characters wandering the streets of philadelphia searching for life a good read","177":"couldn't get into this one my library e loan expired when i was at 30% and i don't care","178":"i liked the characters and their stories but the whole tale didn't come together for me in the end still it was worth the trip","179":" a story like this with multiple characters that overlap in ways that are revealed is best consumed in one sitting that and i was under the gun to squeeze it in between finishing grades and my bookclub meeting i had one or two days but once i started i found myself caught up in the gritty descriptions of lower class people just trying to make a life for themselves in philadelphia i don't necessarily have to like any of the characters in a story and some reviewers were put off by the fact that nobody was really likable there were small pieces in everyone that were redeemable if you finished the book you have to be able to hang with a smoking swearing 9 year old however we discussed the theme of being unable to do anything but what you feel called to do there are three career counsellors out of six of us in the group that was the sweetness to the story","180":"a warm and wonderful story about how three lonely lives are forever changed on christmas eve","181":"i enjoyed this book i received it as a free advance reader copy from goodreads giveaways it starts with a single character madeleine a 9 year old who just wants to sing the story expands from there until you have whole picture of a community the way the characters were developed reminded me of the tales of the city books by armistead maupin","182":"beautifully written superbly lyrical and evocative characters and scenery loved it what a fantastic debut","183":"while i enjoyed the book very much because i love books with multiple povs you're basically seeing the world through someone else's eyes haven't you ever wished to be able to do that i have to admit that it either needed to be longer i would have prefered this option or it needed more careful editing because there were plot points that went literally nowhere despite being introduced i still enjoyed it but it just didn't feel polished enough","184":"took me a while to get into it sad and dark but i loved the ending 3 5 stars","185":"i couldn't really follow the plot perhaps i should have read it instead but it offered me nothing of interest to me to hold on to","186":"i couldn't finish it i only made it half way through the language and some of the topics were just to descriptive and i found the characters annoying i wanted to like it but i just couldn't","187":" at nine madeline has a hard life with her mother dead her father crazed with grief a principal who dislikes her she does have

is worth it this book is a wonderful read it does have some cussing in it for those who mind it is easily ignorable and the book is too good to miss over this","188":"a 9 yr old jazz singer recently orphaned and caring for a depressed father her recently divorced teacher and the owner of a jazz club all spend christmas eve eve together short easy to read chapters which remind me of jazz improvs and great characters made the book easy and enjoyable","189":"i loved the writing style of this book and i'm glad i bought the kindle version instead of borrowing it from the library because i can review my numerous highlights any time i want however i felt like the philadelphia character really got beat into your head and there was a bit of overkill there i work play in the city and it became difficult for me to follow along in the story because there was always the mention of a landmark or street name and i kept trying to make sense of the geography and the pace of the story overall still a great read just don't focus too much on the where","190":" 3 1 2 stars this was a very interesting book in a lot of ways i liked all the different viewpoints shown in the story and that they all had their own connections to each other i really liked madeleine and felt for her throughout the book i thought many of the characters were strong and appreciated the relationships expressed in the book however i never felt completely engaged with the story it was fun i liked the people but i wasn't drawn into the book as much as i would have liked to it is well written and enjoyable and i look forward to reading more by this author","191":"this was a rich reading experience and a wonderful way to start the year marie helene bertino's language is delightfully expressive and a blast to read 2 am's characters are full of humanity and festivity and the i predict i'll be thinking of this book for a long time","192":"discovered this book via my local library's newsletter found it so so sentences were tedious to follow too many intersecting stories perhaps they are each a jazz rift recommendation if you are a philadelphia phile you may indeed enjoy the book","193":"this book is like a bad dream there were parts that has the potential to be good but then just turned horribly wrong the style is so jerky the plot is non existent what the hell is the author trying to say it's so jumbled that i can't even tell you what this book was about really there are undeveloped characters and loose ends hanging everywhere and it's trippy in a bad way i think the author and the reviewers were all on drugs a waste of time","194":"parts of this book are really funny and sweet and heartbreaking mostly about the character madeleine a motherless 9 year old who has just had one of the worst days of her life but i wanted more of that story and less about the adults around her","195":"the city of brotherly love is my hometown christmas eve in philly brings magic together in the lives of 3 lonely people an offbeat nine year old beats it to the cat's pajamas club to pursue her dream of playing jazz as j j johnson once said jazz is restless it won't stay put and never will madeleine has a song in her heart just like her mom and it will come out quirky hip and hot is the lingo here just like a jazz improvisation hurrah for ms bertino i was charmed and taken back to the land of the cheese steak my thanks to the author and the reading room for a complimentary copy","196":"the blurbs on the back of this book say that i will be laughing out loud well not so much there may have been some amusing moments but i think there was only one segment that i actually found funny there were a couple of parts that just simply seemed out of place including the completely bizarre ending i slogged through it but it was tough going","197":" this book really surprised me i really enjoyed the protagonist almost ten year old madeleine who is sassy foul mouthed and extremely talented all the events in the book lead up to the title of the book where a few of the characters converge in the legendary jazz club the cat's pajamas there is a lot of build up which doesn't really go anywhere so instead of concluding or being nicely tied up the story just comes to an end and the momentum just dissipates that being said i found this book poetic and refreshing and will easily recommend it","198":" i first heard good things about this book from one of my favorite bloggers she had high praise for it i had the time and the chance to listen to this book and i am happy i did listen to it i found a few places in this book a little confusing but that might of been my fault for not listening carefully i enjoyed the characters a lot i also enjoyed that you had to hear each characters story to get the complete picture the author's writing style is not cookie cutter i am glad i took the time to read this book","199":"this book had an old fashioned feel like a book called 'the pushchair war' that i liked as a child but don't remember in detail pleasant but not memorable","200":"i liked the characters and the wording of this book but found the disjointed writing confusing and unenjoyable bouncing back and forth between points of view can be a great way to explore each character but at some point you lose the reader i think the author had too many minor characters and not enough focus on the major characters i liked the time stamping of each chapter and some of the phrasing was really lovely","201":"full disclosure i received this novel as a goodreads first reads giveaway but that in no way affects this review 3 5 stars actually a day in the life of madeleine altimari an aspiring jazz singer from 7am on christmas eve eve i thought only my sons called it christmas eve eve see my blog about it on nbsmithblog wordpress com but i digress until the wee hours of christmas eve the story is told about her dream of singing at the cat's pajamas a philadelphia jazz club this is story is not just about madeleine who has her share of troubles but it's also her teacher sarina green and lorca the owner of the cat's pajamas all three of them will meet and be forever changed on this one magical night when dreams can come true will madeleine ever perfect her shimmy will sarina find love will lorca save his club and connect with his son told in chapters that divided into minute by minute sections the story is delightful lyrical and upbeat despite some moments of sadness","202":"i think this book suffered because the last book i read a man called ove was my favorite this year so i think whatever came next would suffer by comparison i just couldn't really get into the story or really care about the characters sorry","203":"i liked it once i got into it but i think telling the story of so many different characters at once prevents any of them from being really well developed and leaves us wanting more","204":" i wanted to love 2 a m at the cat's pajamas but it fell a bit short for me i liked it enough to keep reading though i didn't feel especially moved the writing was good enough to keep me engaged but the very very end just lost me what i did enjoy was how bertino was able to connect the many characters together not that they were particularly like able the three major characters were unconventional and had their own personal stories happening within the pages you've got a sad but sassy nine year old girl who smokes sings and curses a too nice teacher who has a vulnerable heart and a disheveled bar owner who is on the brink of losing it all how these characters weave in out out of each other's lives and the interactions with the minor characters on a christmas eve eve makes for a promising story i'd recommend this book to anyone looking for an easy and quick read the author's style is fun and quirky definitely worth experiencing i received this book from blogging for books to review","205":"lots of quirky characters but a weak plot some might enjoy the holiday theme but i wouldn't particularly recommend it and no cat on scene the cat in the title refers to a jazz club","206":" i received this arc from blogging for books in exchange for my honest review first of all the writing of this book was absolutely beautiful there were some passages that were so beautifully written that i would find myself trying to slow down and savor those passages the story was about madeline a nine year old girl whose mom died when she was young and whose dad is so overcome with grief that he barely acknowledges her existence i guess it really does take a village because there are so many neighbors and people in the community who knew madeline's mother and try their best to make sure she is taken care of madeline is an aspiring singer and she also smokes yes at nine years old and she lashes out with incredible anger if she is pushed the entire night is about her attempts to find the cat's pajamas so she can sing and absorb the music music is her life the problem is that the author kept going to other characters in the book and gave them stories too there was sarina who was divorced and reconnecting with a former flame there was lorca the owner of the cat's pajamas there was alex lorca's son and some random guy who was the owner of the store sarina visited at one point during the evening you see where this is going there were so many side stories and different povs and most of them were boring the main reason i actually finished this book was because of madeline i could appreciate how all the characters came together in the end but madeline was so spunky and feisty and so full of dreams that i just wanted more if the entire book had been about her i believe i would have given this book a higher rating","207":"i listened to this on audiobook i found this book very hard to follow and some of the stories not that interesting there were 3 main stories that kind of intertwined i wouldn't recommend it","208":"utterly charming equal parts imperfect well drawn characters and prose that took my breath away minus one star for that small flight of fancy at the end that was distracting and tonally inconsistent","209":"3 5 stars lots of fun to read","210":"really wanted to like this but it was more like a first draft the character of madeleine should have been more of the focus the teacher should have been cut out her middle part kind of killed the momentum liked the going through one day aspect but it got confusing when past stories were being told wanted a bit more of an oomph ending for madeleine than what she got started out good and fizzled","211":" i found this engaging novel at community bookstore a delightful indy in park slope brooklyn the book is the author's debut novel so remember her name because i think i hope we'll be hearing more from her the characters are well drawn the story moves along nicely and the descriptions of philadelphia my home town brought back some good memories the entire story takes place within the twenty four hours between 7 am on the day before christmas eve and 7 am on christmas eve the cat's pajamas is a legendary philadelphia jazz club where madelaine altimari an aspiring nine year old jazz singer hopes to make her onstage debut if she can find it her teacher sarina greene is stressing about a dinner party and lorca the owner of the club learns he needs to raise $30 000 quickly or the club will close their lives and those of some others intertwine making for an entertaining and enjoyable read","212":"love jazz and thats what makes the read enjoyable i wish there was more focus on madeline story and sarina getting rid of the bits from the principal who just didn't interest me","213":" 2 a m at the cat's pajamas seduced me into liking it immensely more than i was inclined to through its first hundred ish pages it's a lighthearted story that follows a variety of characters - a foul mouthed nine year old aspiring jazz singer an elementary school teacher u0026amp an old flame the owner of a jazz club the cat's pajamas whose personal u0026amp professional life are falling apart - through one eventful day the characters are appealing their stories are delightful cat's pajamas has all the attributes of a good and easy subway read - until the virtuosically composed dinner party scene which marie helene bertino magically brings to life through each guest's inner monologue the depth of the author's imagination and empathy somewhat sneak up on you by the time sarina u0026amp ben teacher flame are walking through the wee hours in philadelphia simultaneously flirting and hashing out old hurts she ms bertino has you completely add to this storytelling alchemy the mere prose which - though at times bordering on contrived bertino occasionally gets carried away with her own cleverness - reveals at the end of the day an eminently unique and original voice in georgina mcglynn's kitchen sarina uses wooden tongs to refresh a salad she was the first guest to arrive and now suffers through the aneurysm of the doorbell heralding another guest bella and claudia and michael so far so far things are not going well her presence has caused glances of confusion bella raised eyebrows michael and one pointed who are you though claudia this has made sarina nervous resulting in several earnest

cat's pajamas arrives at 2 a m at the cat's pajamas its somewhat predictable denouement unfolds at a deliberate pace here i was preparing for the book to end on a note of mild disappointment but after letting the night play out bertino rewards the listener with a morning after coda that absolutely soars","214":" were you impressed or intrigued by marie helene bertino's writing language reviews

these characters try to reach out to her father or attempt to better her home life do what scares you bring a scarf","215":"i don't want to discuss the merits and demerits of this book's structure or decipher the fabulist moments scattered throughout the book like lily pads or the disect the quirky way the author wielded the omniscient point of view i just want to clutch this book to my breast and love it for its music its quirkiness and nine year old madeleine who called bullshit loudly and often making me laugh out loud and lifting my spirits kay","216":" i am writing this review a week after i finished the book initially when i finished it i was very disappointed the magical realism element especially left me very confused i find however that i can't stop thinking about it for me that is generally a sign that there are good things lurking inbetween the pages even if i didn't fully notice them the first time around the title of the book really drew me in and i had to wait awhile after i heard about it before it was available to me i think during this time i may have developed some preconceived notions of what i thought it should be like which probably contributed to my initial disappointment of the book there are a lot of characters in the book and i had a hard time following the stories at first i did feel that the writing character descriptions and dialogue were excellent after reading other people's reviews more of the elements of the story are making more sense to me conclusion i want to read this again","217":"at times i felt as if the writer was writing in jazz there were moments of amazing beauty things i highlighted and wanted to share and then moments of complete confusion a mass of notes not quite making sense until the final one falls into place ok now i get it through that you practice what hurts most you do again away from the living people you practice for toward the shaking fleeting thing you only let yourself half believe in most times you do not find it but in search of it you practice scared of your ability to be so wholly alone you don't have time to boast or judge if this is the life his son wants lorca can at least help him as much as he can","218":"absolutely fabulous","219":" a book written in perspective hopping language heavy vignettes is probably better experienced in print than in audio it definitely took me awhile to wrap my head around who was who but once i did i found this to be an enjoyable but not necessarily remarkable story bertino can definitely turn a phrase however and i appreciated the elementary teacher's plotline stories about city dwelling young professionals in their early thirties dealing with lost loves and broken marriages are hard to come by or i'm just missing them all by reading so much children's lit and ya quite possible","220":"it was the cat's pajamas","221":" one of the most charming books i've read in quite awhile 2 a m at the cat's pajamas tells the interwoven stories of many characters in philadelphia on the day before christmas eve the three main characters are madeline a 9 year old girl who wants desperately to sing jazz sarina the teacher of madeline's school class and recently divorced from her wealthy playboy husband and lorca owner of the jazz club the cat's pajamas each of these three characters are dissatisfied with their current situation and are seeking something more something grander another character one with a tough no nonsense exterior but a lot of heart underneath is the city of philadelphia itself if you are at all familiar with the people and neighborhoods of philly you will find this book to be especially lovely i've lived there or the surrounding area for many years and reading this book felt like coming home i knew these characters i had fun playing the game of trying to identify the real life inspiration for certain buildings and landmarks in the book from fishtown to the italian market from old city and university city all areas of the city are involved in some way or another but you don't have to have ever set foot in philly to appreciate and enjoy the book it has a fast pace and significant plot but also enough character development to satisfy most readers the characters and situations feel authentic and honest there is conflict and adversity but also happy endings and growth i would put 2 a m at the cat's pajamas into the same charming books category as kitchens of the great midwest by j ryan stradal and the storied life of a j fickry by gabrielle zevin","222":" it's christmas eve eve and the stars are aligning this enchanting story introduces us to madeline a plucky young girl who loves to sing and will be 10 on christmas day joining her as she experiences a day like no other are miss greene the art teacher at her school mrs santiago who watches after madeline whose mother has died and whose father is practically comatose jack lorca who owns the cat's pajamas the 2nd most popular jazz club in philadelphia and a various and sundry supporting cast including pedro the dog this is a warm story about love lost and found relationships broken and mended good guys and not so good guys and confused guys and dreams fulfilled in remarkable ways hold onto your hats and get ready as you prepare to spend a day with these quirky characters who will take you for an astonishing ride i read this arc courtesy of random house and the e book courtesy of edelweiss","223":"great quick read illustrating one day in the life of a gritty city through the eyes of a feisty nine year old girl","224":"some of the language in this book was truly beautiful well structured surprising sentences that took my breath away were too numerous to count at first the story failed to hold my attention but within 50 pages i was captivated it revolves around 9 year madeleine a precocious motherless girl the characters were well developed and the action takes place over a very short period of time","225":"i don't even know what to say oh my goodness this book is a gem the author's way with words was hypnotic for a high school english class we had to carry around a nugget book in which we wrote down book passages and lyrics that moved us if i had the nugget book today i would want to write down nearly every single sentence of this book","226":"very quirky with a mixed bag of characters none of whom is happy the writing style was very different stream of consciousness meets unfulfilling reality sometimes hard to follow","227":"many sweet moments fill this book and a few sad ones too and though the different perspectives is often enjoyable it jumps all over the place some storylines feel a little unnecessary and others leave you wanting more it's a fine read just a little disappointing","228":"i have to say i would really give this book 3 1 2 stars i didn't just like it i liked it a lot 2 a m at the cat's pajamas was really three stories within a story the first story of young madeleine altimari is the story from which all other stories stem she is a 9 almost 10 year old whose mother has recently died from cancer and is looked out for by several neighbors because her father is too wrapped up in the loss of his wife to care for her properly madeleine wants to be a jazz singer and practices her singing daily the story of madeleine's fifth grade teacher sarina greene recently divorced and starting a new life in philly is the second intertwining story and the last story is about lorca owner of a failing jazz club the cat's pajamas where madeleine aspires to sing one day the book follows the lives of these three characters on christmas eve eve the prose was excellent in this book it was a free flowing and engaging read i will say while the author did tie in all of the numerous characters in this book well i did find myself having to look back a few times to remember how they fit in as there were so many of them i am a little sad the jazz references were lost on me as i'm sure they made the book a more enjoyable read lastly i was a little confused with the ending involving one of the secondary characters i wish someone could explain it to me but it would result in a spoiler and wasn't necessary for me to understand and enjoy the rest of the book","229":"this book was magical i really loved it the language was fabulous","230":"i want to write a review of this but i have already returned the book i find that i do a better job of reviewing when i have to book in my hands not just to check facts but to have the spirit of the book near me here goes nothing 2 a m at the cat's pajamas was very fun to read madeleine is a terrific leading lady who i want to hear more about she is only nine so there is time to check in again the language is bright and interesting now is the time i want to book for fact checking i search out books about music and this one did not disappoint","231":"2 am at the cat's pajamas by marine helene bertino 257pageswhat's it about madeline altimiri is a nine year old budding jazz singer living in philadelphia she is mourning the death of her mother and the loss of her father to depression her single minded determination to sing ties all the threads of this spirited novel together what did it make me think about the story made me think of how deeply love can run love of music love of family and first loves are all explored in this story should i read it i really liked this one the characters are quirky and ms bertino juggles lots of plot lines adeptly having said that the novel was spotty at times there are so many characters then the author throws in magical realism as if it was part of a writing assignment all in all though the plot and characters kept me engaged and i will look forward to reading ms bertino's next book quote madeline prefers to spend this and every recess alone singing scales under her breath walking laps up and down the parking lot madeline has no friends not because she contains a tender grace that fifth graders detect and loathe not because she has a natural ability that points her starward though she does madeline has no friends because she is a jerk question could this book have been incredible with a few more rewrites if you liked this try 7 1 2 starswww thenextgoodbook com","232":"an unusual read with various characters stories weaving around so they're all at the same place at 2 am told in one day dec 23 i liked it and all the various characters","233":"this book is well written and i liked how all the characters converged at the end but it didn't super grab me and i'm not really sure why","234":"a short and sweet read with a very spunky protagonist","235":"loved it i liked it more the further into it i got and i do love a book that comes with a playlist","236":"recieved this book from bloggingforbooks and full review on the website and my blog http anaandbooks blogspot com 2015","237":"the language of this book is beautiful it wasn't much of a hometown book for me since it takes place entirely in parts of the city that i barely knew existed until i was in high school it does a remarkable job of showing how what we do often does not express to others what we think there are moments when the story seems implausible but it's so poetic that you keep sailing along there are also moments when i think that the author's voice bleeds too strongly into the characters they are all remarkably introspective and eloquent in their realizations but lovely","238":"3 stars fitting setting for the season christmas eve eve at the time i read it with some sharp wit smart writing and a cute ending liked it didn't love it","239":"this was 3 5 i wanted to know more than the author told what happened at the winter assembly last year is alex a drug addict but mostly this was very engaging and fun to read with some likable characters","240":" i ordered this book from blogging for books with extremely high expectations i was so excited for a book that i thought was about one of my favorite things music only problem i think this book sucks a lot the story line jumps around a lot once you get emotionally involved with one story line it will unexpectedly change to a different character you know those movies like valentine's day and news years eve where it just jumps around and then leaves you unsatisfied with the story thats what this book did for me that and a lot of the story line was totally unrealistic the characters acted like they had mental problems a girl gets expelled on december 23rd whos in school on december 23rd and somehow she lives basically alone with her drug addicted father this book just sucked for me i got to page 104 out of 220 and had to put it down couldn't do it","241":" i'm not quite sure how to rate this book but i give it 4 stars for the writing style alone which is succinct but somehow vivid at the same time i did have some trouble getting into the story but i think that may have been a function of my schedule as much as it is the book itself this is a book that requires your complete attention and time to savor the story and absorb the writing and unfortunately my schedule didn't allow me but small snippets of time to read at a time this is a book i'd like to re read maybe over the holidays when i will have time to read in long chunks and appreciate the style and story more","242":"when i play the ukulele which i'm terrible at i like to play songs with hundreds of chord changes because i won't ever be playing a chord long enough for anyone to hear how terrible i am jazz anyway the thing i like about this book the ensemble cast of characters centred around a jazz club in philadelphia is also the thing that frustrated me its pace seemed off but then there i was rooting for flawed characters and wanting to save them all that ending though minus half a star","243":"this kicky book with the clever title contains some of the best lines i've ever read on the neighbourhood dog pedro is an open air pooch not prone to evenings at home his joints are nimble and his snout superb","244":"this is quite good book to be honest i've loved the style gorgeous perfect the importance of jazz the three interconnected stories marie helene bertino writes magnificently and everything seems so magic but sometimes it is a bit confusing lots of flashback and details of course sometimes necessary for the characterization the story is unpredictable and i wasn't sure of what should i expect often i've asked to myself \"what is gonna happen \" and this is not an adventure fiction to be honest this book is musical full of jazz in every words and i suggest you reader to listen to some ella fitzgerald while you're reading this story that you should read i've liked the foul mouthed madeleine and sarina and lorca i've loved the cat's pajamas it was a bit confusing this is the reason of the 3 stars out of five and some things i cannot spoil anything in the story didn't please me at all but the style... it's fantastic","245":" rounding up more like 3 5 but points for originality and verve it's very rare that i finish a book and think about reading it again immediately in the case of 2 am at the cat's pajamas i'm considering it it's partly because the writer writes some deliciously weird funny and original prose it's partly because i was often sleepy when i was reading it and i feel like i missed some things but it's also because i found the book dense and intense at times and i'd like to see if a reread would bring me more this book may feel light at times note the love actually comparisons in the reviews but there's a lot going on i don't just mean the interweaving storylines a girl her broken family a jazz bar a teacher her almost boyfriend and one night in philadelphia this is a beautifully placed book by the way as others have said the ending was jarring to me it felt like an earlier draft that got left in by mistake i'm still going to give bertino the benefit of the doubt this book isn't likely to be like anything else you've read this year i won't say i loved it but i don't think i'll forget it quickly","246":"i liked this book much more than i expected i would the little girl in it is savage i loved her it's very well written and the cast of characters draws you in instantly on a lesser note the book's cover is doing it a disservice i'm a sucker for a good cover and this book's cover leaves much to be desired as it doesn't even hint at what you will find behind it","247":" this was an interesting story laid out over the course of 24 hours the narrative for the most part set the landscape in which the characters engaged but was also dream like at times the interconnection of the many lives woven throughout the story could sometimes be rather confusing a cast of characters would have been a welcome addition to the beginning of the book personal takeaway some days life is just more fair than on other days for three people whose lives often seemed unfair this christmas eve eve was the fairest of them all","248":"did not finish didn't hold my interest too many different characters that weren't very fleshed out","249":"this was different read for me good but a little choppy for me some characters needed a little more explanation","250":" my first impression after the first page or two was that bertino was trying too hard using odd verbs and adjectives in attention grabbing ways but once i got used to her style and settled in it became easy to appreciate the quirkiness and jazziness of the composition maybe because i was reading it around christmas the book's set on christmas eve eve i thoroughly enjoyed the bits of magical realism thrown in the parts that seem to have thrown some goodreaders what happens with the cutlery in the kitchen and with mrs santiago at the end for example didn't bother me at all because both scenes seemed metaphorically apt unlike what happens with principal randles the last time we see her which struck me as a misstep regardless i also liked the way bertino incorporates philadelphia into the tale making the city itself almost another character sort of the way niffenegger does with chicago in the more ambitious time traveler's wife philadelphia is in fact more of a character than the debilitatively grief stricken dad whose lumpish lack of presence struck me as primarily a plot gap of convenience mostly though this book is just fun given its title and chronological section headings there's no doubt about where the story's heading and what will happen but there's also no way not to be rooting for the diminutive spirited madeleine the whole way","251":"madeleine altimari nine years old and determined to be a jazz singer is the undisputed star of this tale she is spunky and precocious a target for bullying at school a child who seems to be constantly thwarted in her quest to sing anywhere other than in front of her bedroom mirror as the narrative progresses madeleine learns of the cat's pajamas a local once prominent jazz club and immediately decides she needs to go there a plethora of other characters weave in and out of madeleine's adventure as they tell their own stories and interact with each other sometimes lyrical sometimes almost magical it's a charming story of searching of dreaming and of hope unfortunately there are several missteps in the school scenes that could have been avoided by a bit of research did madeleine skip a grade in order to be a nine year old in fifth grade and why is she even in school on christmas eve eve elementary schools don't have classes on december 23rd nor do their nurses check children's hair in front of other students and even in catholic schools expulsion merits a parent conference prior to a student's exclusion from class at times the telling of this tale is like hey there you with the stars in your eyes drifting through the still night but the gratuitous expletives and graphic sexual references mar the landscape and quickly become tiresome screens that hide the lyrical music of this story alternately lilting quirky and occasionally brilliant \"2 a m at the cat's pajamas\" is unfortunately ultimately disappointing","252":"2 a m at the cat's pajamas is the debut novel by marie helene bertino i read it yesterday in one long lazy sunday afternoon evening session at first i found the book discordant short declarative sentences with unusual but original metaphors and indecipherable insider descriptions of the city of philadelphia a place i've only visited once the characters were also unusual a nine year old who's lost her mother but wants to learn to sing the way she did a fifth grade teacher returning to her hometown after a failed marriage the worn down middle aged owner of a formerly popular jazz club plus other side characters each one rendered differently but each one important the steady and dependable owner of a cafe near the girl's house the girl's emotionally bereft father the man the teacher used to know who'd been a terrible prom date and regretted it a dog named pedro afflicted with wanderlust and still others at first the book frustrated me because there were many small things in it that i didn't understand and i felt like a good bit of it was literary affectation i told my husband the effect was like handling the shards of a broken window but then as the plot rolled along and the characters began to bump up against one another i began to put the puzzle pieces of glass together to reach some satisfying conclusions and i realized the whole book came together at the end in a way reminiscent of the way a jazz song comes together after all the instrument solos with their flights of fancy and atonal jaunts and imperceptible rhythms are finished and the band finally plays together in one glorious whole i don't know if any of that will make sense to anyone but i do recommend that you read this book","253":" 3 5 52 a m at the cat's pajamas by marie helene bertino is filled with an extraordinary cast of characters whose lives are all intertwined in some way and the events all happen in one day ending at 2 a m the three main cast members are a madeleine altimari a nine year old wise beyond her years who recently lost her mother to cancer sarina greene who is recently divorced madeline's teacher and looking forward to the dinner party this evening in the hopes of being reunited with her high school crush and last but not least lorca the owner of the cat's pajamas who is about to lose his jazz club unless he can find a way to come up with a lot of cash quickly 2 a m at he cat's pajamas is a well written story with intertwining storylines and a multitude of characters making for a fun and lively story bertino has crafted a highly original magical and hopeful book which focuses on just twenty four hours","254":"this jazz nightclub is where the three main characters discover what could be possible the characters are flawed and real the writing takes some getting use to the ending is great because things are not tied up into a neat bow the reader is left to imagine what is next in store for these people whose lives you witnessed over the 24 hours that the story takes place","255":"fun funky inventive with endearingly quirky characters can't wait to read more of this author's work","256":"you know that feeling you get when a book is so good that you just want to shout at every person ever who hasn't read it yep that's my experience with this book i loved it i'm currently plotting who i should give this to as a christmas gift it's a philadelphia christmas story that focuses on three different but connected narratives i don't want to spoil anything just read it already","257":"3 5 starsa solid book that begins with separate stories that are woven together at the end add a touch of magical realism and you've got this novel madeleine wants to sing but no one will let her she learns about a jazz club called the cat's pajamas and she is determined to go there to sing and man can she sing","258":"i really liked how the author writes descriptive imaginative different the eggs cussed the characters are very real u0026amp vivid in this story i liked how the entire book spans one day and how the different characters are all intertwined in the story i loved the mom's recipe box for her daughter not so sure about the last chapter it just didn't quite seem to really fit but book made up via david lynch quote u0026amp nina simone","259":"i didn't really like this book i got lost with the different story lines maybe i'll pick it up again later","260":"i truly loved some of the characters but there were way too many and i kept on thinking enough already get back to this other character such a great subject but it was too hard to keep track of everyone i listened to the audio book which i think isn't the best for this style of book","261":" it took me so long to read this book because i wanted to savor it in sips not gulps it was so charmingly written and the characters were so lovely even the ones i was a little put off by ben and sarina why couldn't they just communicate there were moments of such sadness and moments of such beauty the author used metaphors in such a beautiful way that made you feel the characters emotions with such poetry i can't say enough about this book and i can't believe i haven't heard more praise about it i have made it my new goal to force as many people to read it as possible a book like this makes me wish i was still at the bookstore where i could satisfaction from making people spend money on it","262":" this is a generous three stars for the first book of an author who shows both promise and the ability to complicate needlessly a simple story of a young motherless girl with a great voice the book was rich in description in fact it was so rich in description that listening to it felt like walking through molasses nothing was more important than anything else so the book was a blur a number of times i hit rewind because i missed the significance of something often i couldn't catch the importance even if i replayed the same portion several times finally i realized that i could easily get by without trying to catch things i missed they just weren't important the book is organized in chapters titled based on time intervals and the book is written in the present and future tenses but at any point the author jerks the reader back in time to fill in some largely unnecessary background information about one of the many many characters one such flashback included a murder yet it had virtually no significance to the plot similarly in what was a largely p or pg book suddenly there was a graphic sex scene and a gratuitous one of no value to the plot in fact a distraction from it the ending didn't really result in closure so i suspect the author plans to resurrect the characters of which there seemed to be hundreds and write a series as most authors seem to do these days if she does envision a series and just happens to read this review i would encourage her to first study the work of alexander mccall smith who is a master of series and even more important for this author a master of handling an ensemble cast of characters and pacing the narrative","263":" i for some reason really liked this book i found all three of the main characters relatable madeline was searching for her voice in a world that would not let her shine lorca was holding on to a past that was brighter than his future sarina is looking for love after realizing she never had it i would not say this book was a must read but it did make me thing and it did keep me interested i did finish it in one day note read past the first five pages they are much more heavy handed than the rest of the book once bertino settles into a rhythm with her prose the book gets a much better feel","264":"there's some gorgeous prose in many sections but i didn't enjoy following the characters so didn't have much stake in what happened in the plot i'd hoped maybe the jazz element would draw me in more but probably because i had pictured a different era of jazz before i started reading and was a little disappointed at the contemporary setting that's an entirely personal preference though","265":"great story great characters a good read","266":" raison breadernest hemingway gave me some good advice on writing one night over tequila shots in a key west bar raison bread is good but you know what's better bread so i make it a rule not to indulge every whim for excess ornamentation that flits through my mind but apparently marie helene bertino never got the memo it was fun reading her novel 2 a m at the cat's pajamas but that's because i made it into a drinking game where every time she made an egregious error in writing protocol i took a shot of jack daniels i was soon plastered musicians arpeggiate to rehearsal a man emancipates another button on his shirt a face conspires toward his nose things careen why can't they just go or why can't the musicians just walk to the rehearsal and it's not even a character trying to show off their large vocabulary saying 'look at me i've got a big dictionary ' it's a nameless third person narrator who is constantly drawing attention to itself like hank azira telling bedtime stories to his kids who are pleading with him not to do the funny voices just read the story this book was just a little bit too too cute for my taste but some people like raison bread with butter and cinnamon though marie helene bertino broke my rules that doesn't mean she broke her own rules or maybe that's her thing rule breaking she has a cute character madeleine the nine year old jazz singer but she is a jerk who swears a lot the book is constantly careening between excessive cuteness and grim and dirty grunginess between these two extremes however it wallows in the banal as madeleine's teacher tries to rekindle a romance with ben who took her on a horrible prom date there is also a few segments as seen through the eyes of pedro a neighborhood dog but madeleine is the best character in spite or perhaps because of her combination of excessive cuteness and world weary cynicism her favorite singer is blossom dearie and her favorite bass is upright that is a good line and an interesting choice for a nine year old jazz singer blossom dearie who sounds exactly like a nine year old jazz singer herself blossom dearie has a song about georgie fame my goose is cooked i'm getting hooked on georgie fame madeleine as a two year old also sounds exactly like billie holiday i can think of another madeleine who sounds like billie madeleine peyroux but why is it always billie holiday why can't it be ella fitzgerald or sarah vaughan you know what i mean it was a nice touch when they had the d'angelico snakehead guitar won from steve earle in a card game but does that really fit the timeline steve earle is an alt country singer a protege of townes van zandt who once told him that he should read war and peace steve read it and then peppered townes with questions about it until he said hey i didn't read war and peace i just thought it sounded like the kind of book that you should read as an aside hearing that anecdote reminded me that i should read war and peace and i did read it it was 1 136 pages and i loved every one except for part ii of the epilogue the very last part which was just a philosophical discussion of the concept of free will and didn't even tie up the loose end of whatever became of that psychopath dolohov major faux pas though when marie helene bertino had a random character named bill evans who was neither the piano player who played on kind of blue with miles davis nor the sax player bill evans even though it seems like kind of a common name that could occur every day of the week in a book about jazz it is just distracting did the author put that in for some reason or does she just not know who bill evans is also she has one guitar player talk to another guitar player about using his 4th finger on a bb chord and that is something that a guitar player would never say in a billion years even if she actually heard someone say that and has a tape recording i still deny that those words were ever uttered the bottom line is that it was a fun book to read and even if i quibble with some of its jazz trivia at least it was about jazz like even sub par pizza is pizza","267":"i hesitate to admit this but i didn't mean to request an arc of this book fortunately i could not have made a more pleasant mistake despite my utter lack of interest in jazz i was enthralled by marie helene bertino's tale of a precocious nine year old who dreams of singing jazz as her deceased mother did the events in 2 a m at the cat's pajamas take place over the course of a single twenty four hour period and i likewise read it in a single sitting i was surprised to find that bertino is not primarily a poet her prose has the same syncopated rhythm as a langston hughes poem or come to think of it scat singing listen to philadelphia coming to life at 7 30 on a cold december morning as the dog awakens the city awakens crust on its windshields and hungry snorting plumes of frustration in the harbor scratching its traffic on the expressway can't you hear the drum brushes and the double bass in the background at times bertino gets a bit carried away as when c louds flinch across the mackerel sky bottoms silvered by the deferring sun but such clunky notes are few and far between 2 a m at the cat's pajamas is full of life and music put on some ella fitzgerald and enjoy the day with madeleine sarina and ben lorca and alex and the cubanistas and don't forget to admire that cover i received a free copy of 2 a m at the cat's pajamas through netgalley in exchange for an honest review","268":"kirkus revew while some will find this seasonal sweetness charming others will find it maddeningly contrived i toe the line between the two with this book","269":" marie helene bertino's debut novel 2 a m at the cat's pajama's is like a love letter to philly and kindly philly even offers a reply of its own \"good morning \" the city says \"fuck you \"from 7 a m on christmas eve eve to 7 a m on christmas eve the story follows three characters as they in turn follow their dreams madeleine altimari is a precocious chain smoking 9 year old who swears like a sailor she is still mourning the loss of her mother her father stays in his room listening to music and her apartment is so infested with cockroaches she goes from room to room announcing herself just so they can scatter but she also dreams of singing jazz songs onstage and practices relentlessly to be ready when it happens on christmas eve she finds herself expelled from school and resolves to sing at the famed jazz club the cat's pajamas but will she get to perform madeleine's teacher newly divorced sarina greene accepts an invitation for a party she doesn't really want to attend but she's hoping to catch a glimpse of ben her high school crush their one night together at senior prom was an utter disaster it's been years since the two have spoken and tonight they hesitantly side step around each other hoping to rekindle their romance but will they be brave enough to ask for a second chance as for the cat's pajama's it used to be the finest nightclub in the city three owners later it is struggling to stay open the owner jack lorca has been dumped by his girlfriend has a junkie 14 year old son who wants to perform on stage and needs to pay the city $30 000 by tomorrow or be shut down his only option is to sell a rare guitar passed down in his family for generations but is he willing to part with it now you already know where this book is headed -- if you haven't figured that out yet take another look at the title -- and that sense of predestination isn't the only thing about this book that reminded me of a well written sitcom bertino's chapters progress like chain smoked cigarettes the next is lit off the last the third person limited point of view whizzes so nimbly from child to dog junkie to teacher guitarist to principal that several different consciences are inhabited in the space of a few pages most characters are dressed with an eccentricity or two thrust onto stage to speak a few quips and herded off to wait until they're called again 2 a m at the cat's pajamas is a page turner but a deceptive one it's a novel that makes me question the relationship between value and speed does a slow going book contain more literary heft does fast mean easy no as i settled into the novel i felt like i'd wandered into a modern day disney movie where even teacups have hearts the verbs are relentlessly active--\"eggs cuss and snap on the stove \" a caramel apple is \"karate chopped\" off its stick--and the imagery is pulsey peppery perky the aforementioned citation that the cat's pajamas owner lorca receives changes color--from \"emergency cones\" to \"prison jumpsuits \" a tiny nod toward the increasing gravity of the situation this language is alive and staggeringly original but my heart was won with the plainer observations so sneakily simple sounding like this one \"madeline has no friends because she's a jerk \" followed by this one a few beats later \"even jerks have mothers who die \"the ending left me a little empty - and a lot confused i'm very satisfied with the way everything worked out for the characters but the final scene was so out of nowhere and had a bit of a whimsical magical element that i normally would love but with the rest of the novel firmly rooted in reality it completely threw me off balance and took me out of the story i know what it was supposed to represent but i don't think it was needed and i felt it unnecessarily altered the tone of the story if it hadn't been for those few pages 2 a m at the cat's pajamas would have been a perfectly delicious novel chock full of metaphor y goodness 2 a m at the cat's pajamas beautifully weaves together three storylines gravitating around a past its prime jazz club the novel's old world feel perfectly suited its setting the secondary characters were just as intriguing as the key figures and the foul mouthed 9 year old at the center of it all quickly became a favorite of mine with it's catchy title and gripping characters i can easily see this novel gaining a following maybe not in the mainstream media but underground this is a special novel i'd recommend to fans of philly or anyone who likes a solid story but without all the hype and fanfare","270":"reads like an improvised jazz song story ties together the night of a few characters at pivotal times in their lives","271":"too many characters","272":" this novel has left me speechless it's rare that i've encountered a piece of fiction so poorly conceived and just flat out badly written that i laugh as i read and make mean notes in the margins first the main character is supposed to be 9 years old but she thinks and speaks like she is at least 18 but often even older that part just seemed ridiculous to me she never spoke or acted like a child not even like a mature child not even like a young teen second there are mistakes in this book i noticed a bunch but one that really jumped out at me that i double checked is about serena's boyfriend who became her husband when his character is first introduced at the dinner party and serena tells us they are divorced we are told that they dated for a long time before marrying then when his character arises again later we are told that they had a whirlwind engagement and married quickly third i never got to know the characters at the club except the father i couldn't even tell the rest apart because their characters were so poorly developed fourth no club owner on earth would be threatened with his club closing and then manage to violate every rule they were asked not to violate the very same night after the father tells his son alex that he can't play that night because he is too young he not only let's him play but let's him and all his underage friends drink he then stays open past 2am let's people smoke and blah blah blah it's just stupid fifth what the hell is up with the school principle that weird scene in the club is totally out of place it's just thrown in there to get attention i could go on and on about how utterly ridiculous i found this novel there was one part of this book i liked the parts about the mother and the messages she wrote for her daughter with little bits of advice that part was believable and spoke volumes about the mother's character i also liked that cassidy was named for the grateful dead song that's a cool song to name a child after ugh","273":" i received an arc in exchange for an honest review 9 year old chain smoking foul mouthed jazz obsessed madeleine recently lost her mother all she wants to do is sing sarina madeleine's teacher moves back to philadelphia after a divorce and is soon to be reunited with her high school love lorca the owner of the cat's pajamas tough and tender as his legendary jazz club slips away from him you also peek in on lesser characters as they are woven together in this charming and magical story christmas eve eve told in a day between minutes and hours the story is gray and silver reality with a splash of dream and lots of heart the cat's pajamas isn't heavy it's honest and enchanting with lots of great one liners and musical references i highly recommend it","274":"not a book to read when you want to get lost in a book and stop thinking but a really good book life isn't fair or easy but there are still beautiful stories in everyone's lives","275":" i received this book from blogging for books for an honest review i'm not even going to lie i didn't like this book when i saw the cover i thought oh this is adorable i expected a cute story to go along with it instead 2 a m at the cat's pajamas by marie helene bertino offered a foul mouthed little girl a kind hearted teacher and careless club owner the story's about a catholic school girl who is treated poorly by her principal refused even the simplest of school duties and a bit disheartened at the loss of her mother she wants one thing more than anything else to sing it's also about a woman who's returned home after a divorce looking to start over and possibly get together with a long lost love lastly there's the jazz club owner who's about to lose his place because he can't afford to pay thirty thousand dollars for breaking just about every rule he'd been warned against at least seven times the story spans 24 hours and tells how the three of them come togetherand help each other out to accomplish something spectacular but the way it's told i wasn't sure if i wanted to laugh or growl and chuck the book in the rubbish bin it's like the book was composed part poetry part crud i couldn't even begin to care for madelaine the 9 year old she smoked cursed like three sailors and then when she sings things happen it was ridiculous for the full review and others http tinyurl com pjwse2y i was overjoyed when i finished this book boy it was a bust on to the next read","276":" bertino has some chops i'll give her that i'm just not sure that 2 a m is the whole tomato the writing while distinctive and quirky is also juddering and uneven so the narrative is centered around a bunch of different people living in the city of philadelphia that all converge on christmas eve at the club named in the title perhaps think love actually with a lot less schmaltz only not all the characters are interesting and not all of them are essential and then the ending oy the ending marie helene i was still hanging right there with you until you pulled out the magical realism i don't have a problem with the style unless you never set it up and then jam it in inexplicably at the end and i don't need everything spelled out for me but the complete 180 made me not even want to try ah well it was diverting and quick so there's that","277":" i loved this book there were a few chapters that felt clunky i didn't like the section where the story was in reverse order but as a whole the book was great it felt like a book written by your best friend or sister the kind of book where you want to hug the author and tell her she did an awesome job because honestly the writing was beautiful i thought madeline is a fantastic character this book made me happy we carry our ancestors in our names and sometimes we carry our ancestors through the sliding doors of emergency rooms and either way they are heavy either way we can't escape","278":" so a very good book the author is a regular poet dropping at times into rhythmic finely crafted abstract nearly stream of consciousness reflections of the characters my biggest complaint of the book is the language harshly salty at times and usually coming from the mouth of the protagonist little girl however the study in class tension the internal dialogue that demonstrates the dysfunction of audible dialogue and the off kilter revelations that shatter stereotypes are well constructed at the end of the book without saying how exactly bertino sails off into a nearly magical realist episode that simultaneously enriches the narrative and messes with the flow it's beautiful but out of place with the rest of the story this is not a childrens' book and should not be approached with the expectation of cuteness instead it will make you wish you could go to this club and swing with the music","279":" overall i liked this book however i felt like there were too many characters to keep track of and i often felt confused i kept feeling like i was missing something because of the way it jumped around i often stay up late and read i was questioning myself on whether i was dozing off and missing something important after reading the reviews i am happy to see that it wasn't just me i also was totally thrown for a loop with the very end i felt what happened with mrs santiago was totally out of left field i wasn't sure what it meant and what was going on very weird ending","280":"i liked this but there were a lot of characters and i just wasn't convinced that their stories intertwined justly still a worthwhile read","281":"intriguing the fluid prose and time based structure kept me reading quickly but i never felt like the twisting plot lines and character viewpoints completely clicked in a believable way","282":"i liked this book a lot while there were parts that seemed to be randomly placed in it i loved the characters u0026amp how their lives all connected by 2 am","283":"so promising but disjointed and disappointing sex scenes from third person pov generally do not appeal to me but the two sex scenes in this book are among the worst","284":"i chose this book because of the whimsical title and it was named well each chapter forwards us towards 2 am at the cat's pajamas night club and we meet a cast of colorful ny characters along the way i enjoyed the clever writing and imagery","285":" i won this book on goodteads' giveaway program i loved the title and theme of the book that focused on jazz although i wished the book would have been set in a past era my favorite character was unquestionably madeline a girl who lost her mother to cancer and is wise beyond her years she was the absolute best thing about the book and i looked forward to the chapters from her perspective that said i found myself less interested in the other characters whose lives didn't grab me the same way i found the story to be a bit meandering and hard to follow halfway through the book i realized i didn't really care to see how the story ended the writing was vivid and descriptive but not enough for me to continue reading","286":"it took me a bit to get into it but when i finally did i couldn't put it down what a fun story that combines all sorts of delightful if not realistic characters i especially loved the love story what wonderful descriptions of the awkwardness of the first date","287":"this was an utterly charming christmas eve read excellent all the way around","288":"loved this book not only was the writing unusual in its funky use of adjectives the characters were quirky and lovable cannot wait to read more from this writer i highly recommend this book","289":" a quirky book the structure reminded me a little of robert altman's films multiple story lines about various point of view characters who are not really connected to each other and in many cases may not have met before the story opens but we watch their lives run in parallel over the course of a day and a half knowing that by the end their stories will all intertwine the characters are interesting and sympathetic without necessarily always being likeable i was surprised when late in the book a touch of magical realism came into what had previously been a mostly realistic story i enjoyed the book","290":"i liked the title the topic and the potential of young madeline i didn't like that the author changed so quickly from one character to another therefore not giving enough meat to clear main character","291":"arch precise and entirely delightful recommended for everyone","292":"madeleine altimari is a cheeky nine year old who is still mourning about the losing her mother recently not only does she have to take care of her grieving father who seemed to be lost in his own world she also has to deal with her mean classmates and rejection at school meanwhile divorcee sarina greene madeleine's fifth grade teacher who just recently moved to philadelphia feels sorry for what happened to madeleine however she too is dealing with her own dilemma lastly we have jack lorca from across the stree who is worried that he might close his jazz club the cat's pajama for good if he gets himself into trouble again the only way out is to raise $30 000 and that is very hard to do this is a well written fast paced book with witty and sometimes unfathomable words and lines that it almost resembles a traditional poetry the writing style is very unique and brilliant the story is field with mixed emotions and great story line overall i liked this book because it is definitely not cliche however i sometimes found myself lost in the story and it was very hard to connect with the characters i am also not very satisfied with the ending \"i received this book for free from blogging for books for this review \" read my full review here http ayokongaeh com review 2 a m at","293":"i received this as an arc from the publisher the title attracted me immediately the book centers on three people madeleine a 10 year old aspiring jazz singer sarina her teacher and lorca owner of the club where madeleine will sing these were all sympathetic though not particularly likable characters but they were so quirky i had to like them the novel takes place in the 24 hours of christmas eve eve and the chapters are set up as slices of time during that 24 hours the book has one of my favorite features short chapters that make it easy to find a good stopping place i did not like the magical realism ending it popped up out of nowhere and i didn't think it fit or advanced the story i'd recommend the book","294":"in the course of a single day we are treated to an insight into the lives of a 10 year old who just wants to sing jazz a teacher who meets her old high school prom date a father who has fallen into deep depression following the loss of his wife and the owner of the cat's pajamas who finds himself at risk of losing his club and his son everything comes to a head at the cat's pajamas at 2 a m and the lives of these individuals will change entertaining and original","295":"enjoyed the variety of characters in this character driven book however i wasn't prepared for the ending whatsoever","296":" i received an advanced uncorrected proof copy of this book from the publisher through the librarything early reviewers program a whimsical day in the life of a philadelphia neighborhood begins at 7am on christmas eve eve the main character precocious nine year old madeline wants to be a jazz singer her mother has recently died her father has retreated to his room in grief and she is pretty much a latch key child but she has people who look out for her a teacher a hairdresser and the motherly owner of the cafe santiago some distance away the owner of a jazz club the cat's pajamas has his own set of problems which may cause him to lose his club his cast of characters includes musicians an ex a somewhat reluctant cop and a teenage son there is also a dog that helps tie them all together it's no real spoiler to say that many of these folks end up at the jazz club during this strange twenty four romp this is a lot of fun with some silliness and a bit of seriousness too","297":"continuing my newfound audiobook addiction great little mystery i love a story where unrelated characters weave together and overlap in fun unexpected ways there's a bit of magic in there too always a good thing","298":"was there a plot there were so many undeveloped characters that i could not tell them apart","299":"a quirky fun book to read","300":"the premise of a 9 year old girl who wants to sing at a jazz club well no one is going to fall for that right i was pleasantly surprised and heartbroken and thrilled at this story madeline is an advanced 9 year old growing up alone in a world where her father is depressed and mourning the death of her mother a fantastic jazz singer madeline's first words were not in fact words but a song her mother frequently played she's given the short end of the stick in school partially due to the principal's history with her mother and partly because she's a no nonsense little kid who does what she has to in order to survive the side stories of her teacher and caretakers are just as heartwarming and heartbreaking all at the same time each character in this story was lovable relatable and sad to the point where you want to scream and cry and cheer over and over again this was a very sweet book and the only thing i would change is the amount of characters with storylines you're rooting for this could have easily been a much longer book","301":"it was an interesting writing style and a compelling story with a number of other unfinished stories intertwined interesting read i give it 3 5 stars","302":"i loved the quirky character of the precocious 9 year old protagonist in this unique story that takes place all on one christmas eve bertino tells several interesting stories that will all converge before the night is done the author's style may not be everyone's cup of tea but i found it both clever and amusing not your usual christmas tale chris dyer schererville branch","303":"meh couldn't really get into this one","304":"the writing be bopped along with the story i thought the lyrical writing might annoy me but i got into the groove into the swing i enjoyed the intimate look into this neighborhood's life i like how the people's lives wove together i won't say any more about it so you can enjoy it yourself","305":"3 75 stars while i didn't really understand the need for mrs santiago's magical ending i smiled when i finished this story i did have to remind myself at points that this was set in contemporary times as it seemed to harken back to the jazz age at times the writing was beautiful and there were sentences that i reread because of their perfectness i particularly enjoyed the sarina storyline also appreciated the compactness of it all","306":"great characters especially madeleine interesting way to frame the plot weaving many stories that will come together at the end of a 24 hour period fun to read imagine anne tyler with a more modern hip feel postmodern humor and a jaded smart mouthed child and some magical realism interesting stuff","307":" a book about jazz this debut novel reads like soul in the span of one snowy philadelphia day christmas eve eve 2am at the cat's pajamas trails three leads 9 year old loner madeleine who dances to blossom dearie's bebop piano while smoking her late mother's cigarettes and dreaming of singing like her parent at legendary jazz club the cat's pajamas venue owner lorca who struggles to keep his flailing bar afloat and newly divorced teacher sarina serendipitously reunited with her high school flame hilariously heartwarming and at times harshly realistic the sassy fifth grade protagonist invites empathy quietly comparing her precociously hardboiled know how to classmate clare kelly's perfect braids perfect life despite her flippant foul mouth madeleine has no friends because she is a jerk bertino writes of a character who relies on advice scribbled onto note cards by her mother one year passed homage to her native philly the brooklyn based author exposes both the beauty and burden of urban living good morning the city says fuck you a clever tale of missed opportunities and seized ones cat's pajamas' characters mirror the story's inspiration like jazz they're unruly improvised and endlessly impassioned http www austinchronicle com music","308":"i enjoyed this book very much the writing style was interesting and the author successfully weaves multiple stories through the book until they finally intersect at a jazz club called the cat's pajamas i loved the playlist to go along with the book and the musical references interspersed throughout","309":"a wonderful end to a bad day","310":"this was an enjoyable read filled with wonderful language and vivid descriptions","311":"despite the fact that from the very first chapter you just can't believe that madeline really is nine years old i really did enjoy this book i realize it's probably just some overrated barnes u0026amp noble book club approved glassy eyed chick book but never mind that what matters is that i enjoyed reading it alongside the snowy winter scenes forming outside my window a good winter book i'll say","312":" more reviews available at my blog beauty and the bookworm light books with ensemble casts of kooky characters seem to be all the rage recently and this one is no exception since i read where'd you go bernadette recently this book reminded me immensely of that it's a book with a child as the main character even though the book is for adults and the child gets up to all kinds of trouble when the parents aren't looking in bernadette it was fourteen fifteen year old bea who got into trouble trying to solver her mother's disappearance in this one it's nine year old madeleine trying to fulfill her dream of being a jazz singer madeleine is described by bertino as a jerk and consequently doesn't have any friends most of the people who associate with her in the book are the adults who have stepped in to care for her following her mother's death and her father's descent into a prolonged depression in which he does nothing but listen to old jazz records madeleine goes to school by herself eats at a cafe down the road by herself gets her hair done by herself and ultimately decides to find the cat's pajamas one of philadelphia's jazz clubs by herself so that she can make her onstage debut other than madeleine the book features sarina madeleine's teacher who is not enjoying her holiday season one bit for a variety of reasons and lorca the owner of the cat's pajamas who has just been slapped with a huge fine for violating a large number of city laws and codes in regards to his club sarina sets out to cheer herself up and lorca and his band of misfits at the cat's pajamas try to find a way to cover the fine and save the club as christmas eve eve creeps onward the entire story takes place over the course of one day from about 7am on december 23rd to the wee hours of december 24th despite that the narrative doesn't seem rushed at all indeed at some times it got a little too bogged down with bertino's wordiness she takes great lengths to describe scenes scenes which were intended to make the city of philadelphia seem as much a character as madeleine sarina and lorca but which in fact only seemed rambling and left me wondering where we were actually going with the words on the page these scenes took place mostly at the beginnings of chapters though there were a few two describing girls and boys specifically that were in the middle of chapters and seemed to derail what was happening around them there's also a very slight magical realism note to this story which involves madeleine's singing it's pretty strongly implied that when madeleine sings things happen things float people do weird stuff at first this seems charming levitating food and dishware isn't so menacing after all however it's later implied that madeleine's voice when she sings can cause people to do much darker things like sexually assault people yes there is a sexual assault in this book perpetrated by a woman on a man and it's hinted at there was another that occurred before the book actually again this was weird and creepy and uncomfortable in the extreme and did not at all fit with the whimsical charming narrative that comprised the rest of the book i'm not sure if bertino meant for this scene to be so jarring or if she meant for it to be lighthearted and if it's the latter heck even if it's the former i have to wonder what she was thinking sexual assault by either gender is nothing to be lighthearted about and it definitely put a damper on the rest of the book for me why this sort of thing happens when madeleine sings but not always it was used pretty inconsistently is also never explained this is a good book with good characters and setting and sometimes wonderful writing good bones but i think it needed more polish and some points more outright thought for it to be great 3 stars out 5","313":"i liked the story ok but the writer's overstylized way of writing drove me nuts","314":" i've been reading novels as if they were triple filled stella doros for as long i could read since 1st grade 60 years ago 2 a m at the cat's pajamas is quite simply the most charming novel i have ever read like the magnificent seven one of the great westerns of my youth 2 a m balances a protagonist with an engaging ensemble cast including a disaster of a jazz nightclub owner and two young lovers who have each struggled for years to get past the psychological scars left by their prom date it makes me glad that one month before my prom my girlfriend dumped for a college guy so i didn't go that ms bertino is able to spin an adult ensemble like a top around the narrow lyrical tip of a protagonist who is still a child says a lot for her future as a novelist i wanted to continue reading the novel forever so after my daughter reads it i shall read it again","315":"i read another reviewer describe this novel as a quirky urban fairy tale set in the space of 24 hours in philadelphia the novel tells the interconnected stories of a 10 year old aspiring jazz singer who is practically an orphan after losing her mother to cancer and her father to grief her art teacher who is reconnecting with the one who got away and a jazz club owner in danger of losing his club and his teenaged son with segues into the lives of other supporting characters the writing is absolutely poetic and hypnotic making me laugh out loud in places and marvel at the beauty of the author's descriptions the city of philadelphia with its sounds and accents almost acts as a character on its own i listened to the book on audio so it gave it an added dimension as the narrator's accents were spot on the only drawback was the confusing magical realism elements added that i felt were unecessary as well as some bizarre scenes that remained unexplained lorca's encounter in the restroom with the girl from the bachelorette party i'm usually a fan of magical realism but they seemed almost an afterthought and one of them almost ruined the ending to an excellent story i still am at a loss to explain that ending","316":" i received a copy of this book from bloggingforbooks org in exchange of an honest review and i am so overwhelmed with their gratitude to give this amazing vivid piece of fiction as a review copy the book is yet to be released and the expected publication is august 5 2014 the title 2 a m at the cat's pajamas by marie helene bertino is as provoking as the book itself it's a story set on christmas eve's eve a day in the lives of three characters madeleine a 9 year old who is mourning for her mother's death and just wants to sing her teacher sarina who has just moved back to philadelphia after a divorce and is nervously hoping to reconnect with people from her past and lorca owner of the cat's pajamas a legendary jazz club in danger of closing as these three lost souls search for love music and hope on the snow covered streets of philadelphia together they discover life's endless possibilities over the course of one magical night many writers believe in plotting a story with the increase in the number of pages taking their time such that a reader will find it easy to immerse himself in the story though marie helene bertino debut novel starts with a boom she defines a plot and her difficult looking storyline consisting majorly three point of views which might be the difficulty but as you keep on reading you will understand how wise and essential it is to maintain the connection between all the three characters it turns out quite enrapturing after reading it and giving it a brief thought i somehow ended up in favor of her style of writing and her sentence formations which are not cliched she knows her words well and with the definite use of them she creates a vivid story that is funny lively with naturalistic looking characters and quite pleasing to a reader's mood no matter whatever the mood you are in before reading it this book will try to cheer you up that's how i also ended up reading it in one day however at a point the theme ending becomes predictive since there is no other possible outcome of this story but that does not disrupts the interest a reader immerse in this book its kind of an urban fairy tail i am enthusiastic about bertino's future works will definitely be looking forward 4 out of 5you can check the review here http amandeepmittal wordpress com 2","317":"a little girl struggling with life and obsessed with jazz what could be better the whole book reads like the lyrics of great song","318":"way too good couldn't put it down","319":"this review has been hidden because it contains spoilers to view it click here in the presence of genius here short highly stylized but big deep full of powerful moments a lot of magic and a lot of soul a few very small false notes one bathroom barely almost sex scene seemed completely unnecessary wasn't there for the sex clearly but to show loss and lack of hope i think there may have been a better way ended beautifully not for 9yr olds certainly though the protagonist is 9","320":"hoping the ending gets changed for publication i was really into it except for the random magical realism that was never really explained i liked all the interconnectedness of the characters but the repeated like a plane banking was jarring to get from at least 3 different points of view","321":"i feel like i was a bit unfair to this book with my first rating 2 5 but i bummed it up to 3 5 stars as i thought back on the novel the characters in this story were strong in the sense that they were human and flawed and interesting and contradictory and human i wish there was an entire book written just about madeline i think i would have enjoyed this book more if i had a passion strong knowledge of jazz music it was a quick read though","322":"this was an excellent read great characters","323":"i love this book so much in fact that i'm starting it all over again","324":"i really enjoyed this book but definitely would have enjoyed it more if i were able to read it in larger chunks of time for some reason i only got to read it a few pages at a time and i found that it is much harder to dive into a story that way","325":"i really enjoyed this book the way bertino gives such a clear picture of each character in a single day is amazing and the characters are incredibly well developed for such a short book the way the all come together manages to not feel cheesy overall the flow of the book was comfortable and well paced","326":"it took me way too long to read this a fun little book written with some quirks and magical elements magical surrealism it is written in vignettes so try to read the whole book in 1 2 sittings and it will flow much better it reminded me of an edward hopper painting comes to life a tom waits song whiskey","327":" i was not the right audience for this book i don't know that it deserves a 1 star rating as a book it's just a 1 star rating of the book's match with me the book takes place over roughly one day it's a snapshot of the lives of several people who eventually all cross paths even if unknown there is vulgar language throughout the story characters continue to make mistakes and bad choices i couldn't relate or understand many of the characters it is only one day so though there is a conclusion there isn't much resolution","328":" not your usual book several vignettes that don't seem to be related then they slowly weave together i became invested in only madeleine altimari the 9 year old girl whose mother has died whose father has checked out and no one else seems to notice except to punish her for things that are not her fault but happily the ending was upbeat if you like quirky stories and excellent writing pick this up if unpredictable story lines and unusual character development does not appeal to you leave it","329":"the writing was good easy to read but intelligent i felt like it was a bit anti climatic","330":" this was delightful and unexpectedly poignant despite the wholly unexpected leap into magical realism about 3 4 of the way through i'm a sucker for any found family found avocation narrative and despite my rage of the author's state store mistake pa when will we be able to buy wine at the corner store as occurs in this novel she clearly knows not only philadelphia topography but also its chip on its shoulder and its capacity for clumsy unexpected grace as i mentioned the hard turn into magical realism caught me a bit by surprise and i found some of the language more florid than i probably would have chosen but any book that can refer to the roxborough of your soul is going to end in the win column for me","331":"okay book about a group of people treated badly by life their lives intersect preliminarily by virtue of growing up in the same city but their lives converge and reach at least some form of resolution when they all decide to attend a jazz club the cat's pajamas on the same night the book had the typical relationship issues marriages gone bad poor family relationships yearning for a redo of the past naturally there's a lot of bad timing that results in delaying any resolution to any issue e g one of the main characters a young girl doesn't get to sing at church her life's ambition because the girl slated to sing makes a miraculous recovery from a car bike accident one character's ex shows up just as she is thinking she might want to recommit to a high school boyfriend who is now separated the high school boyfriend has a lifechanging moment when he finally makes a decision about telling his girl how he really feels and then sees her dancing with another guy the only time she danced all night etc you get the idea of course the bad timing is written into the book to prolong the resolutions and get us to 2 a m at the cat's pajama's but sometimes it was a bit much to take i also thought the book should have ended at 2 a m or shortly thereafter with an epilogue but it goes on and actually gets kind of strange in my opinion anyway i sort of thought this was a book that was slated for a cookie cutter happy ending and the ending did not quite wrap up that way to me the book wasn't one that should have been written in such a way not to give everyone a neat even if not realistic happy ending i suppose it leaves the door open for a sequel but the ending that was written didn't cry out for a sequel either","332":"i enjoyed the writing so much and it was a good character study kind of book though somewhat unsatisfying in that aspect because i wanted to delve deeper it felt like broad strokes without a lot of depth and the characters and their stories were so interesting that i wanted so much more so while this sounds like it should be a bad review it's only so because i wanted more because what i got was so good like getting a spoonful a heaping one granted of your favorite ice cream you're so happy that you got it but you're a little sad that it wasn't a whole heaping bowl","333":"this is a very magical book interesting that i read it after dean koontz's the city because it's very representative of a little section of city and how everyone is interconnected i'd really like to know why things happened when she sang","334":"an enjoyable simple read that is somewhere between a character study and here's some stuff that happened perhaps a more consequential plot would have made me feel more invested in the path the characters took me on but it was fine nevertheless","335":"my reviews are primarily for my fellow book club sisters if you need a good beach read this is a quick fluffy read i really liked it as i love book that have children as the primary characters on the topic of characters however there are way too many characters in this book imo each chapter is the voice of a different character with the main characters having several chapters and of course at the end all of the character's storylines culminate at 2 am in a jazz bar in new york city on christmas eve i would recommend this novel for fluff not as a book club selection","336":"i would give it 3 25 if i could quirky madeleine wants to sing more than anything her mother is gone her dad is so depressed he rarely gets out of bed neighbors help madeleine a cussing smoking 9 year old sarina is a teacher who grew up in town and has now returned after years away she had a crush on ben but their pride didn't let it happen after tonight it may be a new beginning lorca owns a bar the cat's pajamas and the new cop in town is closing it down for many violations it all comes together at the cat's pajamas madeleine sings sarina and ben may become a couple and lorca has to close his club but his son can play the guitar and lorca has found he is proud","337":"with ms bertino's exceptional use and lyricism of the english language she puts the visual in visualization i listened to the audio book and the choice of narrator was excellent definitely worth a second read","338":"loved it except the weird ending little miss sassy pants was my favorite character","339":"i won this book for free on goodreads first reads unfortunately i had a very hard time getting into it it wasn't bad but it didn't snatch my attention and hold it either the story just seems to mosey along i have to admit that the author did a superb job of filling her book with colorful characters each with their own quirky personalities madeleine is a young girl with dreams and aspirations of being part of the jazz industry pedro is a wonderful little dog with his personality filled up by wanderlust and then the smallest bits of everything else pedro's owner is rose santiago who had promised madeleine's mother that she would help watch over her sarina greene happens to be madeleine's 5th grade teacher at school sarina has spent her adult life thus far trying to be loved and included she wants to no longer look at her adult high school peers and feel left out or different she is tender hearted and has a soft spot for madeleine the book has built up to a point where all must collide and that collision happens to occur smack dab in the cat's pajamas a once famous jazz club all the quirky characters seem to adjust to their places in life after this huge collision and the book just proves that music is the beat of life","340":" i came to this book because the author is a friend of a friend i am not sure if i would have read it on my own i found some parts wonderful and others tremendously confusing the whole book felt uncomfortably out of rhythm to me and i really have no idea at all what happened in the final chapter it is late right now and i am tired so i hope to give the end a reread in the morning when the cobwebs have cleared there is much to like about bertino's writing and i look forward to reading her short story collection but this novel left me mostly unsatisfied update it's morning and i can't stop thinking about this book i still don't get the ending i need to search the text to see if i missed an important early reference to charlie or if that's just another unexpected curve ball i'm so confused about the principal and whatever was going on with her at the club and the winter assembly i'm frustrated because i liked a good chunk of this book probably 3 4 of it but the parts i don't like i really don't like","341":"this book was amazing wonderful descriptions awesomely flawed characters i wish i could give it more stars","342":"i fell in love with the magical atmosphere of this story the deeply flawed characters the sharp dialogue and and unexpectedness of it all it would be such a treat to re read on christmas eve eve and in fact i think i will","343":"i adored this fast funny novel with intersecting stories across one day in grey philadelphia a precocious 9 year old girl with a dream of singing jazz just about killed me the writing echoed that music and at times made me read passages aloud delightful","344":"a magical story with wonderful characters that takes place in philadelphia in neighborhoods i know very well the author marie helene bertino attended our american association of university women's book group meeting yesterday her mother belongs to our book group hearing her read sing part of the first chapter and discussing the book with her was very special and a great learning experience i highly recommend the book","345":" 2 a m at the cat's pajamas tells the story of three lost souls who search for love and meaning over the course of a 24 hour period on a snowy philadelphia night nine year old madeleine altimai is mourning the loss of her mother her father is emotionally absent while he deals with his own grief school is no solace or safe and happy place thanks to the meanness of some of her classmates but madeleine is resilient she has a wise mouth so she can give what she gets even though she finds herself expelled from school after an incident this christmas madeleine's luck is about to change madeleine is by far my favorite character in this story clinging to the few things left for her by her mother a love of singing and jazz music and a recipe box full of practical things madeleine needs to know in life in the box her mother left she tells her daughter how to write a thank you card for a gift you hate how to fix a flat tire and gives her the encouragement to do the things you are afraid to do this spunky girl with a terrific voice is determined to find the cat's pajamas and to sing onstage another character in this story is madeleine's teacher sarina greene sarina is newly divorced and is invited to a dinner party she has no interest in attending she forces herself to go in the hopes of seeing an old high school crush named ben as for the cat's pajamas in its prime it was the place everyone wanted to go but now it may be forced to shut down notice unless lorca the club owner comes up with $30 000 to pay off a fine i had a little trouble with this novel although i loved the whole madeleine storyline and thought that the author did a good job weaving three story lines together with the jazz club center stage there was a surreal element which put me off a bit the author's writing was good and the theme second chances appealed to me although i enjoyed most about this book i'm not sure it will appeal to everyone but it certainly was still a pretty solid read the audio book was read by angela goethals who did a very good job","346":"1 a novel about jazz 2 the main character is a nine year old girl madeleine whose mother a jazz singer has died and her father has had a nervous breakdown 3 madeleine is a likable jerk 4 the ending is incomprehensible 5 too much coincidence 6 good change between lorca and his son alex who is an exceptional jazz guitarist 7 it reads so quickly i was caught up in the story throughout","347":"oh my what a truly unique and beautiful novel one to savour full review here http ifthesebookscouldtalk com 2014","348":"i loved the playlist for the novel at the very end of the book with billie holiday nina simone blossom dearie and others if there were a race among all artists to the human heart my money would be on music to win it knows a shortcut marie helene bertino","349":" this was like watching a camera zoom in on one character after another as the disparate threads of experience gradually come together in a philadelphia neighborhood over one 24 hour period on the eve of christmas eve for a long time i wasn't sure what time period this took place in because the students of st andrews mostly go home for lunch to their mothers what their mothers aren't working so many of the characters smoked the importance of jazz and the strong bonds of the community i was thinking early 1960s yet there were some slight mentions of cell phones many of the characters live lives of quiet desperation but when the worst happens at the denouement it ends up okay after all touches of magical realism","350":"characters are not well developed relationships awkward and themes not finished romance was fun but unfinished","351":"a night when one person gets what they want is not a bad night especially when it's christmas eve eve i loved how the characters are drawn the way various ones step up for their solo then seep seamlessly back into the combo count me in for marie helene bertino's next book","352":"really enjoyed this audio book other than a few characters there is not a lot of background on them yet you feel like you know them the narrator was very good the timing and story line flowed easy some of my friends wouldn't like it but i found it very enjoyable","353":" almost 4 starsi really liked this short quirky novel set on one very eventful \"christmas eve eve\" in urban philadelphia the 3 memorable main characters have each had plenty of heartache the recent death of nine year old madeleine's mother has caused her father to retreat to his bedroom neighbors are helping to mother madeleine recently divorced sarina has returned retreated to her philadelphia hometown to watch her own mother die and to try forget her ex husband lorca owns the cat's pajamas a once famous jazz club that he can barely manage to keep afloat though life seems bleak each character has enough toughness dream passion to keep the novel hopeful best read in big chunks to fully appreciate the unique wordplay the book has a sometimes smooth sometimes jumpy sometimes improvisational poetic prose style like jazz that may not be for some readers but the style is one of the very things i loved most about the book and helps to give the book an upbeat feel","354":"i enjoyed the pacing of this book and the fact that it took place in philadelphia on christmas eve eve ending in the early morning hours of christmas eve the main characters around which the plots swirl are madeleine a 9 year old well almost 10 who can sing jazz like the great ones a gift she inherited from her mother after her mother died madeleine's father became reclusive so madeleine raises herself with the help of mrs santiago who runs a small eatery and has a dog pedro who is filled with canine wanderlust sarina has moved back to philadelphia and happens to be madeleine's fifth grade teacher lorca owns the cat's pajamas but won't for long if he doesn't come up with $30 000 to pay a citation the story flows smoothly and time designations serve as chapter headings while there is back story to help the reader understand why the characters are where they are at this point in time it fits seamlessly in the narrative i do not know children who are as self reliant as madeleine although i suppose they exist the characters who swirl around the three main ones are also important and flesh out the story as expected the three do interlock near the end of the book while their stories are not tied up with ribbons the reader does have an idea as to where they will each head as the new year approaches i did read some of the other reviews and was glad to see that i was not the only one who found the last few pages confusing i believe the technique is called magic realism i would like to know what bertino was intending with that piece about mrs santiago your comments on that would be greatly appreciated","355":"taking place over the span of 24 hours this inventive novel follows a rotating cast of raucous characters through the streets of philaelphia the book centers around madeline altamari a chain smoking badass aspiring jazz singer who is nine years old and left to her own devices after the death of her mother nearly a year ago leaves her father incapacitated throw in madeline's principal who has it out for her because she is her mama's daughter her favorite teacher miss sarina green recently returned to philly after a divorce and the owner of the cat's pajamas lorca who is facing the club's imminent demise among several other colorful characters and you have a highly entertaining whirlwind romp through the strees of philadelphia with a heavy dash of magical realism to round out the whole affair highly recommended","356":"one of those books that is such as easy read you can do it in one sitting like i did","357":" i loved the cover of this book it was so cute and engaging i expected the story to be the same unfortunately i was disappointed i found it hard to get into the beginning of the book the characters didn't seem that interesting and the story seemed a bit flat and if i'm honest boring nevertheless i plowed on and by the middle of the book i found it a bit more interesting i did at least want to know what would happen to the characters enough to make me continue overall it seemed to suffer from too many stories within the main story which left it short on character development to me the numerous stories took away from the main character's story madeleine the nine year old who wants to be a jazz singer is at the heart of the story and the thread that pulls everyone else together but the development of this character seemed slow and somehow i just couldn't get a feel for her it may be a personal preference but i didn't like the style of writing which seemed forced and artificial at times having said that there were a few interesting bits which helped me get to the end i enjoyed the conversation madeleine had with a roach during a dream at 10 05pm and a few scenes containing sarina madeleine's school teacher and her high school friend ben were interesting but by and large i found the book rambled too much and because of this it was hard to feel much for the characters or the story itself thanks to bloggingforbooks com for allowing me to read this book in exchange for an honest review","358":"good book with a strange ending","359":"i really really really wanted to like this strange little story about a unique little girl doing what she do to hell what anyone else says and i did like it love it even until the end just like how i really really really didn't get the ending of grease i even less got the ending of this book","360":"3 5 it was alright not one of my favorites but i didn't dislike it either","361":"a very creatively written story a little hard to follow at times but the uniqueness of the format and the inter connectedness of the characters was something special","362":"serena i liked you but you were rather extraneous to the main plot and that wacky ending no spoilers sorry","363":" this one was in my currently reading list for way too long because of the holidays and reading it on my phone i had a few issues with the book there is the comparison of knowing when an airplane is banking cited three times why is that the episodes of magical realism reactions to madelieine s singing twice by the principal and once by rose and quite different reactions strange and for me unnecessary but i like a story in which random events intermingle and we see unlikely relationships between characters and i thoroughly enjoyed lorca and madeleine","364":"disconnected quirky but strangely addictive and entertaining","365":"2 a m at the cat's pajamas the plot is what initially drew me to the book it's one of those stories were lots of characters' lives intersect in unexpected ways i liked that the author shared the perspectives of even minor characters connected to the story because it made the world she was building feel more real to me all of the main characters were quirky and flawed unique and believable i loved that madeline wasn't your typical protagonist but a there were a lot of things i loved about 2 a m at the cat's pajamas the plot is what initially drew me to the book it's one of those stories were lots of characters' lives intersect in unexpected ways i liked that the author shared the perspectives of even minor characters connected to the story because it made the world she was building feel more real to me all of the main characters were quirky and flawed unique and believable i loved that madeline wasn't your typical protagonist but a child misbehaving in ways that made sense given her circumstances none of the other characters were likeable in a typical way either all of them with definite flaws but the author managed to make me sympathize with all of them anyway the writing was beautiful and descriptive and occasionally a little jazzy it sometimes became poetic enough i wasn't sure what the author was describing but that was rare the magical realism was something i was excited for but surprisingly ended up being my least favorite part of the book there were only three times i noticed anything magical going on two of the three times the magic behaved in believably similar ways but one of the effects of the magic didn't seem internally consistent to me only one of the three magical occurrences had any effect on the plot the book ended with the biggest display of magical realism in the book in theory this should have been a fantastic climactic ending however the magical realism only affected a relatively minor character who i didn't think needed much help and left the major plots less resolved than i would have liked up until the ending this was easily a four star read for me but the ending really let me down this review was originally posted on doing dewey","366":"a really great book i would have given it 5 stars except for some of the language and some sex i get tired of seeing all that in nearly every book any more","367":"this book is somewhere between 3 and 3 5 stars i haven't yet decided parts of this book were amazing and wonderful especially those about jazz but parts of this book were trying way way too hard ah well i enjoyed it nonetheless and look forward to checking out some more of bertino's work in the future perhaps","368":"i really really enjoyed this book however the next to last scene almost lost me completely it is a quick quirky smart read and an absolute must for any who has lived in philadelphia","369":"the short book is a well constructed look at one christmas eve eve for a group of intersecting lives in philadelphia it has the feel of the city as it examines loss and dreams in a twenty four hour period around a jazz club and neighborhood","370":"very interestinggreat characters moving through a single day touching the lives of each other in surprising ways a quick and enjoyable read","371":"this book is the cat's pajamas a lyrical romp of life surrounding a nightclub full of wonderful characters and a common love of music madeline is the book's heroine 9 years old and coping with more than any little girl should deal with she has lost her mother and must take care of her mad father it is the caring souls of her neighborhood that guide her and the desire to be a singer like her mother that will save her at the other end of town is the nightclub that could save them all if it can be saved itself as the hours pass reading you will begin to hear the haunting jazz melodies and feel you are in it's smoky depths even the homeless dog will work his way into your heart my thanks to the publisher for the advance copy","372":"great great writing even though i thought this took place in the 1930s and it turns out to be contemporary fun read","373":"i liked the story for the most part and i liked madeline she's a tough little girl the book was wordy in places i skipped a few pages in the last third of the book the author revisited a couple of characters from the beginning of the book for just a page or two but it was for no reason it did nothing to advance the story four times the author used the phrase the way you know on a flight even with your eyes closed that a plane is banking if i have to read that four times i expect it to be leading to something in the conclusion it did not i don't plan on reading more by this author","374":"3 5 stars enjoyable quick read i felt like i was left hanging at the end mrs santiago floating in the air was probably something they could have left out made no sense and i really wanted to know what happened to the father","375":"book club book we were split between likes and dislikes i thought the characters were interesting and i wanted to see what would happen to the little girl as the story went on","376":"what a great book i listened to the audio read by angela goethals which was excellent several story lines come together so beautifully you feel that you know and understand even some of the characters on the sidelines highly recommended","377":"i have mixed feelings about this one i loved the characters but found the unfolding of the plot to be underwhelming overall it was just okay for me i received a copy of this book from blogging for books in exchange for an honest review","378":"2 a m at the cat's pajamas is the debut novel for marie helene bertino bertino has us following the lives of several characters on christmas eve eve in a neighborhood of philadelphia we first are introduced to sarina greene a fifth grade teacher planning a special treat for her students on the last day of school before winter break in the middle of her planning she runs into an old high school class mate that invites her to a dinner party that will be attended by her married ex boyfriend next we meet madeleine altimari a nine year old searching for connections and meaning in her life after the death of her mother she wants nothing more than to sing at the school assembly and eat a caramel apple finally we meet lorca the owner of the infamous the cat's pajamas jazz club who is struggling to keep his club afloat and his private life intact as the day progresses and each character faces one disaster after another we find that all of their lives are intertwined and fated to collide at the cat's pajamas later that evening the book is about finding ourselves the many possibilities in life love music hope and the connections we make daily in our lives i had a difficult time getting into the novel at first only because i was appalled at some of the language and habits of the nine year old madeleine after i got past my shock i found the story to be heartwarming funny and hopeful i highly recommend reading 2 a m at the cat's pajamas check out marie helene bertino on facebook and twitter i received this book from blogging for books for this review http knowjnt blogspot com","379":" if you like stories with rough heroes societal villains and moral lessons on what to do after life throws you a curve ball you can't go wrong choosing 2 a m at the cat's pajamas marie helene bertino weaves together three narratives and four protagonists in this tale of a fateful christmas eve eve in philadelphia lifehacker says you should read 50 pages before you dnf 2 a m at the cat's pajamas doesn't require half of that i knew roughly 22 pages in that it was going to be a delight describing her youngest lead bertino writes madeleine has no friends not because she contains a tender grace that fifth graders detect and loathe not because she has a natural ability that points her starward though she does madeleine has no friends because she is a jerk if i ever had any doubts about 2 a m at the cat's pajamas' capacity to entertain that quote smashed them madeleine is bertino's shining star still reeling from the death of her singer dancer mother the 9 year old catholic schoolgirl has taken up a smoking habit and a bad attitude after her chance to sing in front of an assembly is cut off by a prejudiced principal who calls her the daughter of a prostitute madeleine winds up expelled and sets her sights on gaining entry to the legendary jazz club the cat's pajamas of course the club's owner is trying his damnedest to stay on the right side of the law he's broken more than a few city ordinances and now the cat's pajamas is facing permanent closure as punishment for its next infraction which letting in a 9 year old no matter how precocious would be 2 a m at the cat's pajamas saunters back and forth between these narratives and more at times it became difficult to organize the large cast but never so much that i backtracked to find out who a particular character was although it isn't the best novel i've read this year 2 a m at the cat's pajamas still gets a wholehearted recommendation from yours truly it's a quick read a jazz book for a rainy day that will appeal to tales of the city fans and anyone who loves to hear or sing a few blue notes i received a copy of this book from blogging for books in exchange for this review","380":" this book takes place in one day and night the day before christmas eve and shifts between mulitple perspectives which are all linked ultimately to the cat's pajamas jazz club the pacing was quick and i appreciated that each brief chapter is marked by a time that progressively move to and past the 2 a m of the book's title which mark's the novel's climax the characters are likable especially aspiring young singer madeline and her teacher sarina but with the quick perspective shifts they can be difficult to get to know and connect with in many ways too this novel felt that it was trying too hard to be coy i was irritated not amused by the repetition of lines that clearly bertino though were good enough to re use verbatim multiple times in the work and similarily irritated by her lifting of and slight twisting of lines from other writers' works lifting the brilliant last line from a masterpiece like the great gatsby and plopping it into the middle of your novel with no allusion to where its pilfered from ugh overall though this was a quick enjoyable read that ends with a sense of hope of a day less grimy but equally as full of life as the last","381":" i have no idea what this book was about even after finishing it especially after finishing it i love interconnecting story lines as much as the next person but this one missed its mark it wasn't that it had too many characters but that it lacked tightness and focus i wish it was just about the music the club and madeleine i even enjoyed the interactions of the feisty madeleine at school but ben and sarina who might actually have had the lion's share of the page count took away from the rest of it i thought their story was really boringly developed and went nowhere kind of fitting i saved it to finish on christmas eve eve though which is when this book is set 2 stars for a mostly disappointing book i received a copy of this book for review via netgalley","382":"i read about 70 pages and couldn't finish this book i just didn't care about any of the characters sigh","383":"quirky but cute with a little bit of magic interesting chapter breaks doesn't end at 2 am can't help but cheer for madeline and yes sometimes when life throws you a bone don't you just feel like telling clare kelly to shove her caramel apple up her ass","384":"the format of the book was unique each chapter was set at a specific time and you learn what the 3 main characters were doing at that time when the story's fictional tale went into a dream world it lost me i had to read the interview with the author to get insight into the strange and abrupt ending","385":" 2 a m at the cat's pajamas delightfully describes the lives of three separate characters while creating deep anticipation for how will intertwine in the end this debut novel by marie helene bertino delicately depicts three largely isolated individuals each with a few of their own rough characteristics yet you find yourself enjoying the realism and being drawn into the honesty of their stories while i was initially befuddled by the conclusion of the novel i soon realized it kept me thinking and pondering the underlying meaning of each character and the story as a whole i recommend reading the extra libros notes included at the end of the copy i read to gain insight as to bertino's significance of the patterns evidenced in her characters and the intended overall themes of the text i had a renewed appreciation for the final outcome after reading this author interview my only true grievance against 2 a m at the cat's pajamas is the fact that there is a bit of vulgar language and dispassionate romance scenes that i don't personally feel contributed meaningfully to the storyline i received this book from blogging for books for this review 2 a m at the cat's pajamas","386":"this book gives you characters to root for and fall in love with without being sappy or melodramatic allison collection developmentreserve a library copy","387":"2 a m at the cat's pajamas is a delightful look at complicated urban life bertino deftly moves between several povs as the characters work towards and away from their ultimate destination we enter the story on christmas eve eve the cat's pajamas is a famed jazz club which as jazz popularity has declined in the modern era has become a pitiful remnant of what it once was jazz greats such as john coltrane used to frequent the place which while still able to pull in a crowd doesn't have the same spark that it once did a young girl who's mother has passed away and who just wants to sing jazz is expelled from school the girl's teacher is struggling with her own lot in life as well young lost scurrying back to her home town after a divorce a common theme throughout the novel is one of disillusionment madeline is disillusioned with her peers her teachers her guardians and her father all of whom are standing in the way of her ultimate dreams of being a singer and who can't fill the space left by her dead mother serena a shy woman is disillusioned with her place in life feeling empty and vapid after her divorce and in her job out of pity and chance she is invited to a christmas eve dinner with some old high school friends but finds she doesn't quite fit in with them any longer and is looking for some new spark in life club owner lorca is disillusioned with music and life seeing his failing club and his own failings as a father all these twisting threads weave together to bring everyone together in the cat's pajamas on christmas eve where they each find a bit of magic and christmas spirit to help pick themselves dust themselves off and dive back into life marie helene bertino does a wonderful job of illustrating both the hopelessness and hopefulness of a situation showing how a bad span can be interrupted and changed by just a little bit of happiness pacing was quite good and each character has a distinct voice which brings life to the various povs their motivations and their struggles great dialogue throughout if you have a chance the audio book is wonderfully narrated certainly well worth the read","388":"couldn't give this book 5 stars because i was totally confused about the magic parts in it loved the writing style and characters especially madeleine the 9 year old jazz singer i can see this book as a book club favorite just hoping the ending might be spiffed up before release date in august 2014","389":"rating 1 5 charming but ultimately forgettable","390":"meh it started off interesting but ultimately with numerous plot lines involved i found it irritating and dull","391":"where is social services amazing girl totally left on her own by depressed dad has goal to sing to nightclub in title listened with pat on maine trip would not recommend","392":" on christmas eve eve three main characters will cross paths at the cat's pajamas a faded jazz club madeline altimari is a smart and independent nine year old girl who just wants to sing she's not allowed to sing at the school pageant and she's determined to get to the cat's pajamas to make her stage debut i loved madeline's sassiness with the loss of her mother the previous year her father is despondent so she is on her own most of the time she doesn't have any friends her own age but there are some adults who look out for her one such adult is sarina greene her teacher sarina is recently divorced and despite her better judgment accepts an invitation to a dinner party where she knows she'll run into her former flame the dinner party scene was one of my favorites in this book the dialogue and subtext were spot on the narrator steps back a bit and makes interesting commentary about the guests and their motives then across town at the cat's pajamas lorca is about to lose his club the fines from numerous violations of city codes are mounting and lorca doesn't have the money to pay his debts a middle aged man who has seen one too many late nights lorca wonders how to be a good father to his teenaged son and a good partner to his girlfriend he comes up short again and again using these three point of view characters was a great choice because they span the age and experience spectrum each looking to grab the brass ring and find some hope for the future a very enjoyable and fun read","393":"a wonderful read with a fascinating main character the young girl madeleine altimari is sassy smart and a talented singer the writing style is akin to the rhythms of a jazz song a great story set in philadelphia","394":" oh i so wanted to like this book i'll admit the cover design drew me in immediately and gave me an impression that the book would somehow match the vibe of the cover jazzy retro sharp witty and poignant i see now that this is a rather big preconception to put on a book all based on the cover the title and the description on the book jacket alas although i did like the first few chapters it let me down quickly i liked the idea of the book better than the book itself the writing just seemed so very self conscious i've used that phrase to critique a few other books lately and it's a hard thing to put my finger on but basically i know it when i see it and i don't like it for me the character of the little girl madeleine doesn't work she's kind of unlikeable and the problem is she is supposed to be likeable and sympathetic we are supposed to understand that her prickliness is not very lovable but is easily explained by her rather sad circumstances but it seemed like the author was aiming for one thing and got another i don't know maybe i'm just not in the mood but i also didn't like the multiple subplots i didn't feel they wove together smoothly enough and i found them irritating some of the other characters were ok lorca and louisa were interesting to me but i just could not get invested enough in most of the characters i feel that overall my expectations perhaps unfair did not match the reality of the book i had to force myself to slog through to the end and the payoff did not seem earned too bad","395":"perky fun writing but a little unfocused hard to follow all the characters and minor plot developments a bit like an elongated mish mash of short stories while charming and sweet i'm not sure what this book was trying to say about life read for atmospheric fun","396":"the best part was the use of unexpected verbs in the writing the last page i listened to it was incomprehensible to me but i enjoyed the rest of the story","397":" i gave this 3 stars because it's so uneven on the plus side i loved many of her descriptions and felt as if i were in the city depicted in the book i also really liked the general story and air of what i would characterize as whimsy on the negative side too many plot points that are hard to accept how does a girl w no friends at home or school manage to get lice and too many characters thrown into the mix with parts of their emotional lives revealed and then never heard from again perhaps a sequel is planned","398":"i really liked this writer's style in the beginning very unique but i got halfway through and just couldn't stay engaged with the numerous characters and the shifting story lines","399":"fiction adult complex characters and intriguing storylines i just wish it'd gone through another editor one or two poorly written sentences paragraphs can really detract from an otherwise great book","400":"kind of a kooky book took me a second to get into it but really glad i stuck with it quirky characters in love with pedro the dog bertino really has a gift for language she writes sentences that you go back and read a few times just to fully digest it","401":"i feel that perhaps i just am not quite getting it that there is something i am not quite appreciating adequately others have rated it quite highly i loved the title the simple but very striking cover the overall storyline and the intertwinement the quirky characters the courage and resolve of madeline the smoky mystique of the jazz club and the transcendence of jazz music and history the magical realism sprinkled in here and there yet somehow it just fell a bit flat for me","402":"a love actually style novel it reminded me of my thoughts of the movie bits and pieces i liked but i really didn't like it as a whole and the literal fly off into the night ending just didn't fit for me some of the characters and moments were heartfelt and rang true but others felt contrived bonus points for a gorgeous cover however","403":"this review has been hidden because it contains spoilers to view it click here loved the writing style and was interested in the characters even enjoyed the bit of fantasy imagery in it perhaps i have a bit too much of a prudish reader's sensitivity in terms of the profanity u0026amp anonymous sex in it","404":" i received an arc copy of 2 a m at the cat's pajamas from readers giveaways and random house the title of the book was what attracted my attention and made me want to read the book i really enjoyed the story of madeleine all through the book i was hoping that madeleine would get to sing at the cat's pajamas i wish that more had been said about her strange ability like the time she sang in church i was rooting for sarina and ben to become a couple and for lorca to save his club i am a sucker for happy endings and i feel that this book ended too abruptly maybe there will be a sequel to finish the story lines i also would have been happy for no bad language from madeleine","405":" have just finished 2am at the cat's pajamas club by marie helene bertino it had its ups and downs quirky different but did not really enjoy it madeline is the feisty nine year old who has dreams of being a jazz singer she hears about the nightclub the cat's pajamas she excels at cursing as well as singing sarina recently divorced elementary school teacher who has traveled so far only to wind up back where she started jack lorca failed lover failing father trying to keep from become a failed jazz club owner each of these characters are a little odd and each has had his or her share of heartbreak the sections of the book are divided by times that start at seven in the morning on christmas eve eve and end at 6 30 a m on december 24th with the climax happening at closing time the 2 00 a m of the time the book is full of similes hyperbole metaphors and personifications that i often needed to reread passages to figure out the meaning it is the fair lady april edition book of the month","406":"enchanting lyrical endearing plus a lot of other charming adjectives i thoroughly enjoyed this novel and look forward to re visiting the characters over and over","407":" if i could give this book 3 5 stars i would what i loved it's quirkiness the characters the gritty philly backdrop and much of the writing what i didn't love the feeling that this was more of a story treatment than a fully realized novel there were some beautiful phrases and then some awkwardly repeated ones there were characters whose back stories i yearned for but what i really did not love at all was the ending where she suddenly and inexplicably threw in some magical realism which left me flipping back to see if i had missed something and i believe i noticed one or two spelling errors which should have been caught by the writer or her editor but because there were some odd turns of phrase through the book i couldn't quite tell if they were errors or not","408":"this book is smart in ways you don't even realize are happening the flow of the book the comings u0026amp goings u0026amp interconnectedness were fun and exciting none of the characters are ones you love or even like but that's beside the point the books bops along to a jazz song one where you sometimes find yourself wanting to shimmy too","409":"beautifully crafted prose wonderful imagery and wordplay ... but the plot is a bit unfocused and the wrap up of the many disparate threads and characters seemed a bit rushed and not quite satisfying","410":"vivid characters though not too credible their interaction and back stories didn't hang together enough for me but better than ok","411":"i couldn't get into this book at all","412":" i was immediately charmed with this book from the first page the narrative style is musical and playful the characters varied and full of personality and the heart of the story emotional without being cloying set on christmas eve eve in philadelphia the novel follows a variety of characters who are interconnected in a variety of ways all colliding together over the course of twenty four hours our stars are many but focus primarily on three madeleine altimari 9 years old ingenue in training whose mother a jazz singer recently passed away virtually abandoned by her bereft father madeleine has taken up smoking practicing her shimmies daily and gets into constant trouble at school i was in love with her from the start bertino makes her childish and mature in realistic ways and she's both darling and maddening madeleine has no friends not because she contains a tender grace that fifth graders detect and loathe not because she has a natural ability that points her starward though she does madeleine has no friends because she is a jerk p24 the other two primary characters are sarina greene fifth grade teacher to madeleine and a new divorcee who ends up in an unexpected reunion with a married high school crush and jack lorca the owner of the cat's pajamas a formerly famous jazz club now facing a death sentence from fines and a watchful cop the handful of other tertiary characters are vibrant and distinctive like lorca's son alex gifted and desperate for her father's approval or mrs santiago an elderly shop owner who is one of the many locals who cares for madeleine after her mother's untimely death the cast is large but easy to keep straight colorful and delightfully chaotic the whole novel is written in present tense which i didn't really notice while reading the immediacy of the day ticking by captured me as well as bertino's prose like michael chabon her narrative has a musicality to it that emphasizes and enhances the action and events there's a bit of a magical realism element to the story too which i didn't anticipate it surprised me at first but fits with the story's fairy tale like arc all madeleine wants is her happily ever after on stage a lovely zippy read this was fluffy enough for my pre move brain but intricate enough that i was captivated while reading a little twee a little sweet a little precocious this is a great contemporary read for fans of slightly improbable but magical days ensemble story lines and love songs to our wildest dreams","413":" i adored this book it tells the story of well what happened at two in the morning at the cat's pajamas a formerly prominent jazz club in new york and how all the players came to be there the club's owner trying to stay afloat a third grade teacher whose life has not exactly gone to plan a nine year old girl who dreams of singing like her dead stripper mother... the characters are interesting the writing is dynamic the story has you tripping over yourself to get to the end this is a funny engaging story that i would recommend to anyone and will definitely be revisiting myself more than occasionally","414":"this was a great book quick easy read the chapters are broken into times such as 7 am 7 15 am etc some chapters are just a paragraph while others are several pages it jumps between various characters but eventually they all intersect it was an enjoyable read","415":" i thought this was one of the liveliest and unusual novels i've read in years the characters are quirky and engaging and even when they surprise the reader with their actions it just deepens them the character of madeleine turns our preconceived notions of how little girls are on its head for sure i would have given this five stars except right at the end the author threw in a bit of magical realism that seemed wildly out of place and left me feeling a bit disjointed overall though i would still strongly recommend it and this author uses verbs in descriptive ways that show a boundless vocabulary imagination look forward to reading more from her","416":" i'd glanced at a few reviews of this book before deciding to read it i'm not supposed to be taking new books from the library instead reading the parenting ones i will need in just four short weeks but i saw mention that this was a love letter to philadelphia a town i am trying really hard to love since moving to its suburbs two years ago so i slid it in the queue it's more a love letters to the communities that form in a big city the power that will rally behind a motherless daughter bring two adults who have circled each other their whole lives back together and keep a jazz bar in a family whether or not the physical bar is actually operational it took me a while to really dive in as the pacing felt a bit gilmore girls aaron sorkin fast everyone from the kid on up is witty and fast and so is their story my third trimester brain just couldn't take it but a long saturday evening with it resolved that and as the threads of the story came together i found myself very satisfied with the genuine heart of this tale and the dig of the very last line","417":"precious but not in a cloying annoying way i liked this so much more than i expected to really charming and unusual","418":" less 1 star because of excessive profanity i do not describe this as a children's ya book even though our central character madeline is 2 days from being 10 that said this is one of those books that i started before i even left the library i am a slow reader but was able to finish these 271 pages in 3 days every descriptor marie helene bertino used placed my eyes into the center of the woven stories she describes philadelphia like a man alive with restless movement and yearning and fear describes the city streets where the cars bitch toward city hall and puddles yearn for the sewers and there are so many encounters that are described with melodic outburst just beautiful i jotted down many phrases that just captured me you may find some that touch you too thanks to youtuber effusionsofwit for recommending","419":" i received this book for free through goodreads first reads i thoroughly enjoyed this book about three extraordinary characters and what happens to them one christmas eve's eve madeleine is a wise beyond her years nine year old girl who recently lost her mom and desperately wants to sing jazz no less sarina is madeleine's teacher and recently divorced lorca owns the jazz club the cat's pajamas in philly this is a wonderfully entertaining story written with wit there were so many brilliantly worded sentences where i thought hmmm","420":"this is the first book that my book club bibliomancy for beginners is going to be reading this year i chose to experience it as an audio book and i am glad that i did not only is the books very funny and touching but the audio book is well performed and let me read while driving back and forth from home i don't want to say much here because i will be talking about this in great detail tomorrow if you want to hear my thoughts you should check https www goodreads com group show for the vod of our discussion tomorrow night","421":"quirky characters crazy story line sad but believable i loved this novel","422":"2 5 stars rounded up to 3 sweet and adorable and funny at times but at the end of the day i can never be a huge fan of a plot with more than a couple deus ex machina situations i fell out of the story several times because i just didn't believe it i feel like the author was trying too hard to be quirky and original and at times it worked but not always and the magical realism segments didn't work for me at all but it was still entertaining and definitely a quick read so no real regrets","423":"i wanted to like this and i wanted to finish it but i just couldn't keep the characters straight or figure out what they were trying to do i enjoyed the playful writing style but i put it down at about 40%","424":"one of the most original and interesting books i've read this year the authors choice of words the pacing and the language of the book was fresh and original also one of the best acknowledgments section by an author i've ever read makes me want to meet her very enjoyable a definite recommend","425":"such a fantastic kinetic fun book","426":"loved parts of it liked parts of it and then felt let down by the ending sigh","427":" hmm it's still too early to tell on this one but so far i like how the smoking and shimmying catholic gets rewarded with a singing solo while the self righteous good girl gets creamed by a speeding bicycle nice one d'oh singing solo denied for now redeemed yay this was a really cute book and i enjoyed it it is what a visit from the goon squad should have been like if it had been a good book still i found myself wanting more gravitas somehow the author spun a good yarn but i wanted a warm sweater","428":"bookclub book from dev cute and touching","429":"the story lines and characters were compelling and fun but most exciting about this book is bertino's voice and style all adjectives unexpected and remarkable turns of phrasing a completely new way to use language so that as a reader you are not bored and as a writer you learn a few things about language so much fun","430":"this was my first read for 2016 and i'm pretty sure it will be one of my favourites this year the story unfolds on christmas eve eve in snowy philadelphia utterly charming witty moving delightful and packed with surprises i fell hopelessly in love with each character especially spunky nine year old madeleine each exquisitely crafted sentence had me shaking my head in amazement i found myself slowing down as the end drew near i just didn't want this story to end a great winter read","431":"i cannot even begin to describe what a schizophrenic piece of nonsense this book is i detested her descriptive passages and the way the story was structured","432":"tender funny charming carefully structured beautifully written and full of the possibility of magic around every corner this novel is a pleasure for fans of karen russell julia stuart michael chabon jazz philadelphia christmas childhood happiness","433":" this book had a whole lot more profanity than i usually put up with but i stuck with it because the writing was really good i don't often find myself stopping in the middle of reading thinking wow this writer is really good but the end darn it had to throw in metaphors had i known about the metaphors at the beginning the skill of the writer would not have kept me in that book when i read for entertainment i do not want metaphors substituting for a real ending metaphors remind me too much of school","434":"i absolutely loved madeleine's character her teacher and their connected story unfortunately the other sub plots became tiresome and dragged i'm a big fan of jazz so the musical side of this novel truly spoke to me her writing is quirky and clever dotted with notes reminiscent of jd salinger's catcher in the rye i think this will be a great book club selection for discussion","435":"i had a tough time getting into the book and eventually couldn't put it down i really enjoyed sarina's story and ben i found madeline to be endearing but too annoying for me i was thoroughly confused by the end and slightly disappointed maybe someone more clever than me will understand it so it is worth the read","436":"wildly inventive book about madeleine altimari a tough nine year old with a magical voice and the adults whose worlds intersect with hers teacher and her teacher's ex husband and high school beau principal father deceased mother caregiving neighbors salon owner and world weary jazz club owner and his family and musicians bertino's use of language is unusual and vivid great read","437":"this was one of the worst books i've ever read foul pointless and it just ended with no real closure sorry i wasted my money on this one","438":"utterly remarkable sharp and funny with prose so rhythmically striking it feels like the strongest character of them all i am head over heels in love with the writing it is a mainline into the source it is pure uncut gold","439":" full of quirky characters a la anne tyler i cannot quite believe madeleine the main character an aspiring singer is nine years old it seems quite unlikely to me that a nine year old would leave home at midnight unaccompanied and hurl herself onto a stage in a club where she has never been before and sing her heart out but it is part and parcel of the unusual characters and fantasy of the story vthe cast of characters thrown into the mix confused me for a while and i also had difficulty with the role and purpose of the principal who happened to be in the jazz club at the same time as madeleine and madeleine's teacher and her boyfriend but these are all part of the whimsical quality of the book i especially love the advice on recipe cards that mdeleine's mother left for madeleine to use as a guide for life after the mother s death a year or so before the story begins the fantasy thrown n here and there is disconcerting at first but entertaining nonetheless i would like to give this book a four but did not like it that much and probably will find it forgettable","440":"this book has potential but i feel as though i spent much of it just waiting for it to take off it only really got its legs for me at 2 am loved the magical realism and would have liked more magic","441":"sweet multi layered stories the family stories etc are good but the depiction of phila could be better i'm not sure the author understands the geography of the city","442":"the book takes places over 24 hours on christmas eve in downtown philadelphia chapters are divided by time of day and the view point switches among the numerous characters some characters are much more interesting than others there are exciting points in the day and then there are boring hours that dragged on the concept is cool but the overall work is forgettable to me","443":"bertino's quirky debut novel had me laughing out loud many times and near tears at others her prose approaches poetry throughout the book","444":" an enchanting original debut novel about one day in the lives of three unforgettable characters madeleine altimari is a smart mouthed rebellious nine year old who also happens to be an aspiring jazz singer her fifth grade teacher sarina greene who's just moved back to philly after a divorce is nervously looking forward to a dinner party that will reunite her with an old high school crush afraid to hope that sparks might fly again and across town at the cat's pajamas club owner lorca discovers that his beloved haunt may have to close forever unless someone can find a way to quickly raise the $30 000 that would save it as these three lost souls search for love music and hope on the snow covered streets of philadelphia together they will discover life's endless possibilities over the course of one magical night","445":"what a fun fun read the voice of madeleine altimari is wonderful as a character and as part of this story and oh what a day she had the story starts at 7am on christmas eve eve and ends 24 hours later chapters or breaks in the story are given by the time of day a quirky fun and altogether entertaining cast of characters","446":"the story moved slower than i was expecting which i think affected my enjoyment i liked the characters but i did struggle with the pacing","447":"loved the 9 year old protagonist in this one when the book opens she is practicing her shimmy smoking a cigarette and practicing her jazz solos the urban setting didn't resonate with me quite as well but the imagery and the characters were wonderful","448":"i really liked this story of a precocious girl who seeks out the fulfillment of her dream to sing the story weaves in the stories of her teacher who meets up with her high school crush after many years the owner of the cat's pajamas nightclub who is facing a financial crisis that threatens the nightclub and a dog named pedro the characters were interesting and the author did a good job of bringing the nightclub scene to life","449":"i'm not sure which i fell for first nine year old madeleine or ms bertino's writing they both happened in the first few pages of this book i reread many passages just to enjoy them again and i have already borrowed her previous collection of stories safe as houses","450":"i took so long to get a chance to get myself into this book with everything going on in life once i finally got into the pages i found that i related to a lot of the characters and felt better about having taken so long to get started the thing about life is that you never know what's going to happen and how the actions of others will impact your life this book was very believable and written in a beautifully poetic way all of the characters developed well as the day progressed but left me wishing i had gotten to spend more time with them and learning more about them i found their struggles and triumphs relatable and it was very easy to identify and empathize with the conflicts of the novel overall a very easy read well written well flowing with beautiful descriptions that made you feel as though you were watching from afar and an intricately woven storyline that all pulled together in a way that makes you believe in the impossible be kind to others for everyone you meet is fighting a battle you know nothing about","451":"not bad not fabulous","452":"this was a good not terribly long story a little on the depressing side but it had some funny parts as well all in all i enjoyed it and would recommend it","453":"it's nothing against the author i am just tired of writing that sounds like a wes anderson movie for the record i love anderson's movies i just dislike books that are too precious precocious nearly every paragraph had a little cute joke and it got exhausting","454":"this was a tough book to finish the best part of the book was the title i did like the madeline character","455":"brilliant fast paced darkly funny and very moving loved this book","456":"loved the sassy and talented youngster i loved the writing style and the sass on madeleine and her story line but the story between ben and sarina was tired and uninteresting","457":"the gathering together of one day in one community all kinds of flawed broken unique ready for change young and old all centered around a broken down jazz club nice pace but also somewhat frenetic very quick read","458":"2 a m at the cat's pajamas was full of characters in fact there were so many i became confused a few times of all of them there were only a couple that were exceptionally vivid and engaging the main character madeline was precocious and worldly beyond her 9 years but in a sort of tragic and sad way the cat's pajamas was a quick read that was enjoyable enough and in places read much like a screenplay but fell a little flat in the end and became confusing with the sudden magical touch i wasn't expecting at all too many characters who took too long to intersect but a good read for the most part","459":"loved 99% of this book no spoilers that is it","460":"amazing book with compelling characters and an examination of lives very unlike mine highly recommended","461":"for me this book is the present under the christmas tree that you are so excited about and then you open it up and are disappointed to find socks i loved the characters and the unique presentation of the story but the ending left me confused and unsatisfied so the book gets 3 stars from me 4 for most of the book and a 1 for the ending","462":"this review has been hidden because it contains spoilers to view it click here it was written kind of jazzy really unique it was not a long book but yet you come to care for several characters as you follow them through one day i really liked this book and will be looking for more of this authors works","463":"this book captured me and led me to the end light and easy i really enjoyed it","464":"2 1 2 starsthis was a chaotic mix of characters that i cared nothing about i found madeline enduring but she was not in it enough about 1am i really got interested in the story but by the next morning the book is told in time sequences i was just left feeling empty wondering why i picked it up at all","465":"i received this book through goodreads first reads i received an audiobook and had to say i was quite surprised i haven't ever listened to a book and this was my first time but i really enjoyed the book and loved the narrator on the audiobook","466":"to some degree i don't think i was in the right frame of mind for this title it was billed a 3 lost souls discovering life's endless possibilities over the course of one magical night i found it rather depressing","467":"i'm torn between 4 and 5 stars i'm not saying this is great literature but i loved this book the characters are well developed and fascinating and i wanted more of them when i finished the book which i had a hard time putting down i immediately looked for a sequel to find out how their stories continue sadly none exists but what better compliment can an author receive or for a book to end than with the reader wanting more","468":" this book defies category and description i don't even know how to begin to review it it's rather amusing i've mentioned before that i take my books for review as they come to me and some have been in my calendar for months and some have only been listed for a couple of weeks and yet they still manage to align in a weird order of similar books in a row this is one of three back to back that defy genre madeline is a 9 year old girl living with a father so overcome with grief at the loss of his wife that he does not leave his bed not caring that madeline has also lost her mother she is left to live in a house full of roaches and only thanks to the care of the neighbors does she survive her mother was a jazz singer and madeline longs to follow in her footsteps and she is determined to sing the story opens on christmas eve eve and madeline might just get her chance to sing thanks to a horrible accident but it does not come to pass her teacher tries to nurture her a bit but she is newly divorced and back in her hometown and feeling a bit insecure madeline learns of a jazz club the cat's pajamas and she also finds out that her mother once sang there she is determined that she will sing on its stage no matter that she is 9 no matter that she has to cross the city she doesn't care she is going to sing there is more a lot more but it's better you find it out for yourself this is probably the strangest book i've ever read i think that much of it went right over my head the ending included no pun intended it's a book that needs a second or even third reading i suspect to fully and completely understand what is going on that is not to say that i didn't enjoy it because i did it was a refreshing change from the ordinary","469":"didn't love it didn't hate it","470":"with a title like 2am at the cat's pajamas i thought this book would be jumping and fast moving no this was slow and boring it takes place over one day and i thought that that day would never end","471":" i try not to judge a book by its cover but this cover is so cute and the synopsis sounds so charming the book wasn't at all what i expected madeleine isn't just smart mouthed she's foul mouthed ugh she's also supremely unlikeable madeleine has no friends not because she contains a tender grace that fifth graders detect and loathe not because she has a natural ability that points her starward though she does madeleine has no friends because she is a jerk i felt sympathy for her virtual orphan state but the impression was that she's always been a jerk sarina and lorca are both more likeable than madeleine until they have inexplicably disturbingly horrible scenes of their own it's as if bertino can't let anyone be too nice in addition to these 3 main characters we also see the povs of every other character no matter how small it's annoying it's overkill it's a hallmark of a debut novel when the synopsis mentioned a magical night i made the mistake of not taking that literally i assumed magical meant mysteriously enchanting nope it meant actually magical this book is magical realism one of my least favorite genres sigh the one thing i did enjoy was bertino's affinity for jazz music and the way her prose reflected that that's a drummer's love story if you want a prettier one you'll be waiting forever if you could separate your body into four distinct rhythms you'd be cracked too","472":"there are books that stay with you for me this is one the book takes place over just a couple of days madeline is a 9 year old little girl who has lost her mother to cancer and her father to grief her parents loved jazz so does she as a baby she sang to billy holiday records i loved that part all she wants to do is sing she goes to st anthony's school and would love to sing but clare kelly gets to sing because her parents are big donors her mother was according to the principal just a strip tease dancer she was actually much more than that madeline is not your story time sweet little girl she's arrogant prickly and unfriendly when the story opens she is looking forward to the caramel apples her teacher has prepared but fate gets in the way first head lice then an arrogant classmate not only doesn't get her caramel apple and is sent home for having head lice she is also expelled for fighting with that arrogant classmate meanwhile her teacher sarina has returned to philly from connecticut after a divorce she is invited to a dinner party and both dreads and looks forward to seeing an ex boyfriend who is in the midst of a separation from his wife then there's the jazz club the cat's pajamas when madeline learns that it exists she just has to sing there the owner is having his own problems the club is at risk for closing after being fined for numerous violations somehow everything comes together just hours before christmas it's kind of a christmas story that's not at all sweet with a gorgeous undercurrent of my favorite music jazz","473":"2 a m at the cat's pajamas is a saucy bit of entertainment with a terrific title that promises a good time for many this novel will be a nice change with its current day dreams and an older era feel it's precocious feisty and jazzy just like its protagonist","474":"like other reviewers i fell in love with madeline the little girl in the book for her story i kept reading the book had many different characters and stories that all tied together all entertaining but for me confusing i didn't understand the end of the book at all and i felt that many of the scenes throughout the book had two meanings and i could only understand what was on the surface kind of like there was an inside joke through out the book and i wasn't an insider and thus could not understand it was not hilarious as promised by one review i read but in the end rather sad","475":"interesting characters sweet story about family life's challenges and connection with others","476":" as i was reading this book it reminded me a bit of love actually not because of any similarities to the story lines of that movie but more because of a sprawling cast of interconnected characters whose stories weave together around christmas time unfortunately i feel like the massive cast works better on film where you can put a face with a name it took me half of the cat's pajamas just to keep the characters straight and how they were all interconnected although the story takes place over the course of one day christmas eve eve several of the characters flash back to earlier times which just adds to the confusion for awhile i wasn't even really sure who the story was supposed to be following so many characters were introduced that it was hard to feel much of a connection to them however toward the end of the book it becomes clear who the main characters are and i became more invested in their stories i found the ending satisfying but didn't really feel like the magical realism elements added much to the story","477":"beautifully written fun exciting wonderful to read each character's story as told only in the course of 24 hours","478":"2 a m at the cat's pajamas is a sad book that takes place on christmas eve eve the story is told in a present tense narration that skips from character to character which is a style that takes some getting used to but which really suits this book i love stories about many characters whose lives are interconnected unfortunately 2 a m at the cat's pajamas features some characters that i couldn't bring myself to care about the book would be much more compelling if all of the characters were as interesting as nine year old madeleine altimari a highly independent and super snarky amateur jazz singer oh how i love stories about audacious little girls but 2 a m isn't just about madeleine it's about lorca the owner of the cat's pajamas club and it's about madeleine's teacher sarina greene and it's about a whole slew of other characters none of whom are as interesting as madeleine so i was bored through much of the book unfortunately in the beginning there does seem to be one clear plot the potential closing of the cat's pajamas club to give structure to the interconnected characters and occurrences but the plot seems to become minimally important as the book wears on also the climax is pretty disappointing i waited through most of the book wondering what would happen at 2 a m so when that moment arrived it didn't feel like enough so it is certainly flawed but i still did enjoy reading 2 a m its greatest strength is its illustration of the emotional instability of everyone even the adults who are supposed to have it together that caught me by surprise over and over and i thought it was beautifully done and i don't think i'll forget madeleine any time soon thank you to netgalley and crown publishing for providing me with a copy of this book in return for an honest review","479":"for me this novel was a very mixed read i quickly fell in love with nine year old madeleine a motherless child whose father is sunk into himself with grief madeleine is used to taking care of herself she is foul mouthed very determined and her only wish is to sing in public strange things happen when she sings and i really wish this concept would have been more fully explored the secondary stories and characters i did not find as compelling with the exception of the dog whose thoughts and antics made me smile all stories and characters are joined together on christmas eve although set in the present day this reminded me a bit of the old jazz novels the discussions of music and an old guitar and a jazz club holding on by a thread there is much to like in story the prose is solid although there were things that i felt confusing and could have safely been left out of the plot madeleine though was such a vivid character she alone was worth the full price of admission the title is brilliant and is what drew me initially to this book the ending was a little strange and i am not sure exactly what it is supposed to mean","480":"kind of a random collection of people and stories just kind of meh not great and not terrible set just previous to christmas","481":"the cat's pajamas is the center of a whirlpool that is drawing the characters into its vortex an excellent book with great characters the only annoying thing occurs in the first half of the book the phrase the way you know on a flight is so often i found it glaring from the page the book is a marriage of prose and poetry i look forward to ms bertino's next","482":"enjoyed so much of this book the characters' voices the writing itself the quick vignettes that work together to form the narrative the novel follows the lives of several interconnected characters leading them all in one way or another to the cat's pajamas bar some characters only get a chapter or two others are given more attention and detail by the omniscent narrator sometimes the language got a little too precious an action being clean as a poem and some of the characters' stories didn't feel quite resolved by the end louisa my biggest quibble however is the ending it veers into magic realism not apparent in the book before and is intended i'm assuming as metaphor but this is never made clear to the reader i'll definitely read more work by bertino","483":"like the jazz that runs through this story sometimes i found the tune discordant and hard to follow but mostly it was transcendent music that made my bones vibrate","484":"i really enjoyed the author's unique punchy narrative style it was rhythmic and quickly paced with interestingly woven plot lines that span only one day the small elements of magical realism kind of surprised me but in a good way to me it seemed like the 9 year old was actually a 16 year old but it didn't pull me out of the story overall very enjoyable","485":"my favorite book of 2014 maybe ever","486":"this book has a slight crisis of time for so much of the book it feels like a mid century story with its whimsy and tenderness but then something surreal happens and you realize there are no rules here in this version of philadelphia the final 30 pages are so incredibly rewarding in the way that books so rarely are tidy that i would almost recommend this book to anyone","487":"the language in this book is beyond beautiful i fell in love with the characters and couldn't help but cheer them on there was something timeless about this book that added a bit of movie magic and twisted it out of the 21st century and into another time","488":"i liked this book like it was a nice book it felt special and unique but at the same time the more i think about it the more problems i have with it 2 a m at the cat's pajamas is about lots of people but mainly about madeleine a nine almost ten year old girl who loves to sing just like her mother but madeleine no longer has her mother yet she still persist with singing whenever she can i don't want to say much else because this book is pretty short so if your interested i think you should go read it what i truly loved about this book is the writing marie helene bertino writes as if this weren't her first debut novel but instead someone seasoned in the art from years of experience she describes even the most undescriptive and unextrodinary things in a fascinating way her phrasing of words and the order she wrote everything made you feel as if you were there the characters were also a staple to the story probably even more than the plot in my opinion the transition between points of view could be too sudden and confusing at times as well as there being a lot of minor characters that sometimes blended together at the same time i loved how we had an \"insiders\" look of the person and their lives as well as an \"outsiders\" look of the characters what i wasn't particularly fond of is the plot it just seemed like there was no tension or suspense if it weren't for the writing and characters it would have been a really bland book but what really hurt my experience with the book is the adultish content between the frequent use of curse words and the mention or even action of sex really just left a sour taste for me there was no need for anything of that in my eyes as least not as often as it occurred that's probably just me a teen who can't look too long at a make out scene from a movie but as i said that's just not my jazz","489":" i'm not really sure how i feel about this book mostly because the ending was so confusing i mean what happened i'm still very unclear...i don't think i actually liked any of the characters that much it wasn't my fault though i promise they just weren't very likeable i felt bad for madeline but i still didn't like that she was pretty much a brat most of the time there were too many story lines going on there were way too many perspectives to try to keep up with and to be honest i really didn't enjoy reading from the perspective of a dog... at all i guess i'm not all that confused about my feeling toward this novel after all it wasn't one that i would recommend to anyone and i wouldn't want to read it again not my favorite at all note i received a copy of this book from blogging for books in exchange for an honest review","490":" i really loved this book there were so many creative interesting beautiful or funny turns of phrase that i would read several times i didn't anticipate liking this so much it's a great little story and the only thing that kept me from five stars was the foul language and one or two club scenes that didn't sit well with me other than that i was eager to get back to this story it has so much momentum going at all times that i didn't want to put it down and would think about it when i couldn't read","491":"everything about this book appealed to me that is why i picked it up but it did not live up to my expectations there are 3 story lines that we are following with what feels like endless supporting characters madeleine the 9 yr old jazz singer who has a non active father a father drowning in sorrow through madeleine we meet mrs santiago the woman who looks out for her we also meet sarina her teacher and a recent divorcee we are also introduced to lorca the owner of the cats pajamas we follow these characters on a very fateful day much happens to all of them all are hoping for love and security a sweet story but nothing i will hold on to","492":"enjoyed this lil ditty i liked that it covered the span of a day and involved many characters love the writers style very beautifully written imo even the cursing lol i must admit the end threw me off and i had to read it twice fun lil getaway cat try it on for size","493":"this book is like a citrus scented hug bertino writes like a catchy rap beat and the story is quirky and unique and funny and most importantly heartwarming also it features a lot of things but not cats unfortunately","494":"3 75 starsgood audio reader got better as it went along a little hard to follow at some points but overall pretty entertaining some interesting characters","495":"this book is great--except for the magical realism element as someone who loves magical realism i was turned off by bertino's addition of it in this particular story almost all of the sensory details and actions in this book are beautiful though and three particular sentences in the book actually made me pause to appreciate bertino's excellent writing skills i'd definitely read another book by her","496":"3 5 stars and i spent this review debating a round up or down you can see i threw caution to the wind and rounded up to 4 the horror i loved the characters excepting lorca and his cat's pajamas club crowd because that didn't really play into the novel's true self at all it's funny because the club actually plays the music but the novel reads like music and i didn't need musicians to literally play for me the best part of the book is the tension of every moment the back and forth ups and downs repetition it felt like jazz music itself it's beautifully done edited to add i read a few reviews who down star bertino for various things mostly the odd viewpoints there are side characters if you could even call them that that don't directly relate to the three main plots sarina and ben madeline and lorca and also some parts that seemed abrasive sarina yelling at the bachelors for example i've been thinking about it and i think that all of those oddities are what make the book and contribute even more to the jazz like feel of this novel the side characters like pedro the dog are scatting scatting seems like nonsense at first but it slowly builds the rhythm and the story through those strange viewpoints it fleshes the song or novel out sarina losing her cool and sexually harassing the men when provoked made me hear that slow build up of a song that vocal explosion and ultimate release i don't know i know it's strange to hear all of this in a rather strong armed little scene but i do i don't really have a strong background with jazz to be honest i have that basic jazz band band girl experience but when i think of jazz i think of my dad when i first picked up the clarinet my father made it his mission to school me in jazz armed with my new music tapes cds i would shut myself in our basement storage also known as my makeshift walk in closet listening to george lewis blast from my boom box i would perch myself underneath the under stairs and pretend to understand the swells of the music this music made me think about that strange dark closet and the clarinet and i love this book for bringing back that moment some lines i liked georgie thinks about the dishes the joint she will have after everyone leaves the quick hush of the extinguished candle had he perceived her wounded tone he could have recalibrated the alignment of his tactics however the insight ben needs to fix this situation is the insight he will gain after screwing it up his voice is professional with sorrow 'you certainly couldn't do that ' he means because she is precious sarina hears that she is snotty and unkind he means because he is not that lucky she hears he is bored no one says i want you to wait and no one says i'll wait","497":"it's like an american not quite as good _the elegance of the hedgehog_","498":" in the interest of full disclosure two of the main tropes of this book are not my favorite magical realism and chapters of disparate characters who intertwine and separate throughout the book i will say though that they are used to great effect in this book i was left understanding if not necessarily liking all the characters my particular favorite was the interaction between sarina and her high school crush and the moments of what was left unsaid despite a rocky start i ended up really liking this book","499":"although set in current day this book brings to mind the heyday of jazz i loved the spunky foul mouthed 9 year old madeleine though i think more of the story could have focused on her sometimes the multiple story lines seemed unnecessary and some characters were less compelling i thought the writing was lyrical though descriptions were real and relatable not so sure about the ending","500":"it took me awhile to keep track of all of the different characters and how they related but i ended up enjoying the motley cast of characters and how the story took place over the course of a day","501":"oh i loved this book the language was so beautiful it took a while to get into the rhythm of the book but it was worth it","502":"if you are looking for a christmas book this is it it's not painfully saccharine and christmassy its just enough i loved it","503":" i'm hovering somewhere between 3 and 3 5 stars on this one i was looking for something on the light and airy side after a string of intense reads and i recall seeing a review somewhere probably lj that compared this favorably to where'd you go bernadette which i really enjoyed while i can understand why this comparison was made lots of quirk a plucky young protagonist it didn't hit quite the same notes for me there were 3 main characters madeleine a foul mouthed 9 year old that just wants to sing sarina her fifth grade art teacher and lorca the owner of the struggling jazz club the cat's pajamas and the book toggles between their perspectives over the course of a single day i listened to this on cd and by the end i started skipping lorca's parts because i just didn't care about him madeleine was vivid and fresh but there just wasn't enough of her and i would prefer if sarina was written into her own separate book i liked her fine just thought she was kind of distracting to the madeleine sections it probably didn't help that i thought this was historical fiction at first either from the old fashioned cover to madeleine's obsession with jazz music more believable of a child in the 60s it wasn't until a reference was made to a cell phone that i realized that this was contemporary","504":"a fun read mostly because it all takes place in philly however i am skeptical that walking from the italian market to fishtown in the dead of winter is actually an enjoyable stroll","505":"beautifully written book i really loved the author's style of writing everything was so descriptive i also enjoyed how the entire story took place over one day there's three main characters madeline is a little girl who has lost her mother whose dad has just checked out and who isn't having the easiest time at school she dreams of singing but has never gotten her chance sarina is a teacher madeline one of her students she is divorced and gets invited to a party that her old crush will be he's both less and more than an old highschool boyfriend then there's lorca who owns the jazz club the cat's pajamas it's immensely important to him but he has just been given a citation so lofty that it's hard to imagine it's possible he could pay it the book sees all of these characters and a few more throughout the course of this day before christmas eve it just might be the most exciting night of some of their lives even if one night can't make all their problems go away i loved it up until the last couple chapters i still think it was an excellent book but the last two chapters were a bit confusing and didn't necessarily wrap everyone's stories up","506":"i love bertino's writing and characterisation the characters are so vibrant you feel as if they are in the same room as you i really enjoyed the storytelling and bertino's literary voice but i found it quite hard to keep track of all of the characters in such a short book there are a lot of lively characters but they are introduced in such a quick fire way","507":"this was an enjoyable read that centers on a segment of time on christmas eve from several different character's points of view and life experiences let me preface this by stating that i do enjoy jazz and that aspect of the book appealed to me immensely almost as much as the hope embodied in the event at 2 00 am no spoilers here the book is nicely constructed by labeling the segments of time as the plot builds and the background stories becomes more clear overall this was a fun romp that shows hope for all of us in achieving our dreams at any age or circumstance things may not always be exactly what we want in life but life can still be packed with great moments and turn out well","508":"as is only appropriate i stayed up until past 2 a m to finish this genuinely charming slightly magical throughly transportive novel the flurry of characters got a little hard to parse out once in a while but the primary ones always shone through","509":"while she is flawed you can't help but love the damaged young girl that is this books main character this book follows many storylines that may seem confusing at first keep going it's a book about friendship love and so many other things especially to not give up on your dreams","510":"i really enjoyed madeline's sassy character and her teacher miss greene however the rest of the book fell flat for me the whole jazz club story line was boring and i didn't even understand the ending she floated away","511":" i was surprised by how much i liked this book it follows around various characters and flows between character thoughts without any kind of transition something i usually hate but it all comes together towards the end in a way that makes such a style acceptable the characters were lovable the plot was quick and though there was no one overarching plot or any major problems that were solved the end gave the reader just the right amount of closure i put it down feeling extremely good about what i had just read","512":"delightful and deceptively simple story with multiple characters in philly on the day before xmas eve all leading up to a significant performance at 2 in the morning at the beleaguered cat's pajamas jazz club such a light touch but enough emotional weight to leave me wanting more brava","513":" what a wild fun read the bertino's prose is witty and brilliant and i was hooked from the first page if you want a lively quick read with quirky characters combined with a bit of magical realism and jazz you can't go wrong here particularly as a philadelphian i thought the setting was awesome bertino's experiments with an omniscient narrator who weaves in and out of myriad characters' consciousness at whim works incredibly well at one point she delves into the perspective of a dog then later a cockroach i'm telling you it totally works my favorite aspect of the novel is bertino's incredibly crafted sentences which make this book almost read like a hybrid poem novel as the dog awakens the city awakens crust on its windshields and hungry snorting plumes of frustration in the harbor scratching its traffic on the expressway bone cold and grouchy from the toes of its stadiums to the strands of its el one by one each main line town revs its city bound trains against the light of dawn their track lamps are as worthless as rich girls 14 this is the voice of the city this is your tireless doubt the rope that tethers you to the hydrant your half permission your limiting maddening jawn this voice comes from the northwest pocket the roxborough of your soul 257 of course i had to include the roxborough passage here there's also an amazing pair of passages about girls and boys in the context of high school prom that read as their own little prose poems but fit seamlessly into the narrative the characters are engaging though i was less interested in the jazz band crew than madeleine's crew and i could not put this book down i can't wait to see what bertino does next spoiler alert my only critique of this novel is its use of magical realism it seemed inconsistent and at times unexplained during the 2 am moment at the cat's pajamas the writer had set me up for what i thought would be an explosion of magical realism but at this moment there is just intense realism instead i liked the rendering of the scene but i felt a little betrayed i also never really understood what happened in the school assembly but against all odds i truly did love the magical realism at the end overall bertino is experimenting with a lot of literary elements and i like that she takes risks and breaks rules these little critiques are almost not even worth mentioning because the overall novel just sings","514":"disjointed and confusing at times much like the jazz music that the book revolves around i'm pretty sure that was on purpose overall it was an enjoyable read","515":" loved the characters and the descriptive writing it made me laugh out loud a number of times i liked it and would have adored it were it not for the ending if madeline's voice indeed induced magic then other than her teacher's uncontrollable urge to devour her date why didn't the cops float out of the cat's pajamas and forget their duty why didn't patrons leave their shoes and dance in the air in the end while madelaine achieved her dream to sing for people and was allowed back in school she was still living with her lost father in a roach filled apartment with her sometimes caretaker mrs santiago floating above the city like a human hot air balloon that part of the ending totally lost me i enjoyed the read but longed for that traditional ending where madelaine becomes a sensation the cat's pajamas is saved and the future is bright","516":"loved this fun sad unique and magical all mixed in to create a truly wonderful story","517":" i wanted to like this book a lot more than i did i did like two of the main characters 9 year old madeline an aspiring jazz singer and her teacher sarina one of the problems with the book is that there wasn't enough of them and there was too much about the large cast of supporting characters most of whom i could not have cared less about even sarina though confused me a little if a guy treated me the way ben treated her at the prom i wouldn't give him the time of day let alone swoon over him 15 years later or however long it was i can't even remember sometimes the writing was beautiful and awe inspiring other times the odd turns of phrase and overuse of adjectives was just annoying all i will say for the ending is that it was unsatisfying and i don't think it did justice to any of the characters as i said i wanted to like this book a lot more than i did i'm glad i read it but it won't be one i'll look at in a couple of years and say oh i loved that book","518":"when i think of this book the first word that comes to mind is delightful review to follow at http bookgirl co vu","519":"this really reminded me of the elegance of a hedgehog but with less tragedy","520":" i loved 2 a m at the cat's pajamas at first i wasn't sure marie helene bertino's prose seemed a bit choppy as the short sections jumped back and forth among the various characters and settings and then i got it this is the syncopation of jazz yes and layered onto the jazz score is a vague surrealism could any of these people exist or do what they're doing no matter it all fits together just read on and enjoy the ride madeleine the nine year old jazz singer is one of the best characters i've met anywhere the adults in her world are a motley crew but bertino presents them as they are and as we begin to understand them we care about them too just not as much as we care about madeleine the story is set in philadelphia and begins at 7 00 a m on christmas eve eve it ends at 7 00 a m on christmas eve in these 24 hours all the characters travel great distances all within a few blocks sometimes the greatest distances are traveled in the fewest miles","521":"a delightful little novel which speeds along and delivers plenty of smiles and heart string tugs i really enjoyed the sentence level craft displayed by the emergent marie helene bertino and i look forward to her future work \"that's a drummer's love story if you want a prettier one you'll be waiting forever if you could separate your body into four distinct rhythms you'd be cracked too\"\"if you are anything other than humbled in the presence of love you are not in the presence of love \"","522":"marie helene bertino writes in a very vivid style just like the way her characters go through life madeleine altimari has a voice that stops people in their tracks when she belts out jazz tunes all she wants is a chance to sing in the legendary jazz club the cat's pajamas the problem is her age nine years old is a bit young to be in a bar sarina green recently back in philly fresh from a divorce teaching fifth grade for a living and learning to live alone wondering if she will meet the right guy again jack francis lorca gets hit with a $30 000 bill and the fact that his beloved cat's pajamas may have to shutter it's doors if the bill isn't paid what events occur to these three people on christmas eve eve that causes their paths to cross and what is the final outcome that will impact their lives forever a magical night that weaves its spell around these three people while they are searching for what they hope to find","523":" i found the characters and there were many in this book to be memorable and lovable madeline a foul mouthed 9 year old singer and victim of neglect and her elementary school teacher were my personal favorites the story weaving numerous characters together culminates in a jazz club in present day philadelphia i couldn't help but think the narrative should have been set in the 1960s it just had that mid century feel to it there were a few awkward moments i wish were edited out and i wasn't sure about the ending it didn't seem to fit with the rest of the book but that's me being picky marie helene's writing is great and the plot moved quickly making her book quite enjoyable","524":"like this book for the writing more than for the storyline although the storyline is rather fun u0026amp thought provoking","525":"really great and inventive writing fell in love with a lot of the characters","526":"a very unsettling book detailing a day in the life of a 10 yr old aspiring singer and the people who live in her orbit the characters are wonderfully imperfect","527":"read it a great read period a lovely book that allows you to trace direct correlations between the reader and most of its protagonists","528":"well written feel good lit fic","529":"so disappointed in this book thought it was going to be good determined to finish it such a waste of time","530":"i received a free paperback copy of 2 am at the cat's pajamas by marie helene bertino in a goodreads giveaway i gave this unusual book by marie helene bertino four stars the well defined cast of characters is what captured my attention madeline is the feisty nine year old who has dreams of being a jazz singer she hears about the nightclub the cat's pajamas she excels at cursing as well as singing she decides that is where she's at last be able to sing without the snarky judgment of her mean spirited peers it's a quirky tale of a few days out of madeline's life u0026amp her determination to make her singing debut link to purchase http www amazon com gp product 0804","531":"i really don't know what to make of this book it's like a collection of short stories of intertwining characters instead of a novel nothing really interesting happened at 2am in the cat's pajamas club to be deemed worthy of recording in a book there were so many characters that i wanted to get to know better but were ignored through the rest of the book the stories were just all over the place","532":"i wish i knew proper music terminology because that it what is needed to describe this book the writing is a jazz song or perhaps jazz songs would be better since it goes through fast and slow riffs and trills and all those other things that make me love jazz even if i can't talk about it properly what i will say is listen to the audio version of this book narrated by angela goethals the narration is brilliant and goethals is able to work through all the different tones and paces voicing half a dozen main characters and hit all the right notes the book tells the stories of three people over the course of one 24 hour period two days before christmas in downtown philadelphia madeleine is only nine years old but growing up way too fast after her mother's death and her father's complete withdrawal from the world her one desire is to follow in her mother's footsteps and become a jazz singer lorca runs the second best jazz club in philadelphia he's barely scraping by and even that is in danger after the city writes him up for a string of citations his girlfriend has left him his son wants the one thing his father doesn't want him to have a life as a musician and the odd assortment of musicians and servers in the club are making him nuts and then there is serena madeleine's fifth grade teacher she is still trying to find her way after a recent divorce and unable to forgot the boy who took her to the high school prom with disastrous results when said boy ends up being invited to the same party she is the stories weave in and out as the hands of the clock slowly circle away the day there are moments of humor and moments of sadness the ending is a little strange the other thing that struck me repeatedly about this book is that is seemed to be in the wrong time it is supposed to be contemporary but while there are a couple of mentions of cell phones it just didn't feel right if it were modern day lorca's 16 year old son would be glued to his phone everybody smokes including the 9 year old the whole book would have made more sense placed in the 60s","533":"3 and 1 2 great characters and very original takes place in philadelphia","534":"madeline santiago smokes cigarettes has the mouth of a sailor and is very serious about being a jazz singer she's only 9 years old though so each of those things can be a problem her mother passed away a year ago leaving her father in a depression so deep that he rarely leaves his room so madeline is basically on her own with help from a few people in her philadelphia neighborhood 2 a m at the cat's pajamas covers just the span of one day christmas eve eve in the life of madeline her teacher sarina greene and lorca the owner of the jazz club the cat's pajamas madeline's story was the most interesting to me and the reason that i chose to read this book her desire to sing the music that her parents loved so much keeps her motivated despite all of the obstacles thrown in her way her determination is inspiring moving back to her hometown after a recent divorce sarina is reconnecting with old friends and navigating getting back into the patterns of those relationships lorca is faced with losing the jazz club that has become the most important thing in his life at the expense of his son and girlfriend i loved the interconnected of the stories of these three along with other people in the neighborhood as everyone moves through what turns out to be a very special day bertine manages to tell this tale and provide enough back story without the reader getting lost there was a section about 3 4's in and also during the ending of the book that left me scratching my head i wasn't sure if it was a dream sequence or not and it really distracted me from the story and left the ending a little off to me aside from that i did enjoy the book and was mostly satisfied with how events played out i recieved a complimentary copy of this book from the publisher in exchange for my honest review","535":"well written in a funky way great characters and wonderful story very enjoyable","536":"i was disappointed in this i was hoping for charming though i enjoyed the nine yr old madeleine i wish the author had concentrated more on her to be fair the book probably deserved a better amount of reading time which was only at lunchtime some books don't survive being read in only ten minute increments and though the descriptions are sometimes exquisite i didn't appreciate the author's hopping from one character to another","537":"interesting but didn't like the back and forth of characters","538":"this book didn't make much sense to me and about 90% of the time i had no idea what was going on however i liked the author's style and the frequent references to classic jazz which is one of my favorite genres","539":" if you're like me you've been waiting for a book like this for a long time hoping for it every time you open a cover certainly ever since you closed your last favorite tom robbins novel marie helene bertino is brilliant fresh and funny a sassy rule breaker who sets the formulaic forms of fiction on their ear and slaps on an irreverent cockroach and random daisies just to prove she meant it reading her book is like being taken by the hand through an ordinary life transformed into a landscape of delights even the heartbreak becomes a kind of magic beginning with the sensibilities of the lovely cigarette smoking lice infested lonely ten year old madeline we're introduced us to a succession of irresistible tender rag tag loners over the course of a single extraordinary day which ends in a victory so sweet and transcendent it puts ickiness to shame you hopeless run run away for the irreverent the slightly cynical the tired bored flippant weary of artifice and pseudo wisdom this book is for you buy it buy one for your favorite sister too","540":"as unpredictable as a jazz scat it took me about half the book to start liking it but this is something for an achy breaky heart read the full review on my blog guiltless reading","541":" i thought that tonally this book captured the chaotic tumbling sense i have when i listen to jazz which fits given that it's built around a jazz club but the various storylines were of varying interest for me i loved madeline's story and wished it had been fleshed out more same with sarina but i didn't care about principal randall and some of the club members were less interesting to me as were some of the lesser characters who would get a small segment also due to the formatting of this arc the transitions between storylines were often confusing things that should have been paragraphs or even perhaps new chapters were jumbled together forcing me to re read passages to figure out where we had segued to thanks to crown publishing and netgalley for a copy in exchange for a fair and honest review","542":"this book is an absolute delight the characters are compelling the plot is well paced and surprising yet satisfying and the prose is lively and unexpected","543":"2 a m at the cat's pajamas by marie helene bertino begins on the morning of christmas eve eve and everyone's day is beginning on a sour note there's the fifth grader maddie who wants nothing more than to sing but is banned from doing so at school for mysterious reasons then there's sarina maddie's teacher who has just moved back to her hometown after a divorce and feels like an utter failure there's also a chapter devoted to pedro the dog who is running around town searching for the she dog whose scent has left him head over heels in love and those are just a few of the entertaining characters we are introduced to in this book and whose days will end wildly different from how they started i fell in love with this book on the first page with maddie practicing her shimmy in the mirror for exactly 30 seconds and then grading herself with a c from there it only got better managing to balance humor with seriousness each chapter is arranged chronologically by time on christmas eve eve starting at 7 a m and ending at 7 a m the next day the chapters are just short little snippets of what is happening in a given character's life at that moment they're such brief glimpses that it never gets boring but leaves you wanting more and wondering what will happen next in a good way i also enjoyed that the author obscured the era in which the story was taking place the soundtrack of the book consisted of oldies one character not a drug dealer still used payphones to make calls and then there was a lot of outdated language like the use of the words 'co ed' and 'billfold' but then there was an appearance of a cellphone once or twice playing wonderwall that brought you back to the present and there was even a little magical element thrown in there which i am always a fan of so if you can't tell i give this book two thumbs up www harperreview com","544":"i think i liked this book but i'm not sure yet i might need to let it sit and give it a reread in a year or two to make my mind up about it","545":"this book is set in one day--philadelphia on christmas eve eve--and follows several different characters including madeleine a nine year old aspiring jazz singer who recently lost her mother to cancer madeleine's teacher sarina the cat's pajamas club owner lorca and his son alex and several others madeleine and sarina are the most engaging and madeleine's feisty independence made her a fun character to spend time with as the book gradually winds all the characters closer and closer together they all benefit becoming more important and interesting to the reader it's a strange book to describe--the story is very literal at first but it becomes fantastical or fairy tale like at unexpected times this felt a little off putting while i was reading it now about 12 hours after finishing the book i think the fantastical elements were a good idea the entire book feels a little magical so what's one more magical thing among the rest if you're looking for a new book club read this would be a fun option it's also short and fast enough not to be a burden to club members who drag their toes it has plenty to talk about in terms of plot and characterization and there are a few passages in the book that are really really delightful and worth marking to come back to later the best way i can think to describe this book is to tell you how i felt after reading it did you have a childhood movie or book that you would watch or read often and it left with you this little warm feeling in your stomach that made you feel like everything in the world could be as fun and magical as what you just saw or read about after turning the last page of 2 a m at the cat's pajamas i recognized the happy contented feeling as one i'd had before it was like the childishly optimistic happy afterglow that would stick around after a favorite movie or book i didn't think 2 a m was the perfect book but it did make me smile that counts for a lot when it comes to books these days","546":"reading the flap prompted me to read this book it reads in part a vivacious charming and moving debut 2 a m will capture your heart and having you laughing out loud none of this happened although i finished it i wanted to stop many times too many unnecessary characters gratuitous sex moments text fillers and an odd finish rethinking my rating changing from a 2 to a 1","547":"in 2 a m at the cat's pajamas we meet 9 year old madeleine a precocious child beyond her years she dreams desperately of becoming a jazz singer after being embarrassed at her school concert the previous year all she does is practice and she knows that she can be great even if no one else believes that this is a wholly original story that made for a good read the book definitely took awhile for me to get into at first i was sort of wondering where it was going with a 9 year old girl who loves to curse at its center the entire book takes place in just one day christmas eve eve and each chapter is titled with the time of day that the events following took place we meet several different characters including a dog with a penchant for wandering all over madeleine was definitely my favorite character we definitely get to know her best throughout the story the book has a very large cast so we don't get to know everyone quite as well in the story and i wish that we did or i wish that there had been more of a focus on certain characters in order to prevent some confusion in a way this story is also a love letter to the city of brotherly love philadelphia you can tell that the author put a lot of thought into how to describe all of the places that madeleine and the other characters go i really liked all of the descriptions of the city you can really feel the frozen dark streets overall this book does take awhile to get into but i really liked the way that bertino ties everything so neatly together as one of my very favorite teachers was so fond of saying it comes together like a hot kiss at the end of a wet fist","548":" this is one of those books that found me at the wrong time as i definitely should've enjoyed it more than i did it has all things i love in a book good writing interesting characters with criss crossing narratives and a setting so vividly captured it almost becomes a character itself i also enjoyed how the author captures that unique feeling of anticipation and potential that can only consume life the way it does on the eve of christmas eve still the book never stuck for me i'll have to revisit somewhere far down the line when i'm in a different time and place","549":"what's worse than chick lit chick lit written with an ear for poetry bred by a kink for magical realism heaven help also the lazybones who designed the cover needs career counseling possible job retraining","550":"what even was this","551":"fun book a quick read the whole story takes place over the course if one day and has a whole six degrees of separation thing going on","552":"a debut novel from marie helene bertino that works very well with an interesting cast of characters 2 a m at the cat's pajamas starts christmas eve eve or two days before christmas one of the main characters in this book is 9 year old madeline madeline hopes to be a jazz singer that will perform at the cat's pajamas in philadelphia pa one day madeline is of course precocious is there any other kind when a child ends up being one of the main characters who is doing her best to deal with her depressed father while trying her best to live by her late mother's advice a second character is madeline's teacher sarina is worried about attending a party where she will see her love from high school the third character in this book is the owner of the cat's pajamas jack francis lorca who is going to be forced to close his club unless he comes up with $30 000 i can honestly say i am not familiar with jazz at all so this book really did stretch my comfort zone some the author marie helene betrtino tells this story from the third person point of view she also has all of the chapters broken up showing the time at the very top until the reader gets to the before mentioned 2 a m we also go beyond 2 a m to read about the characters we have come to know as well which was nice the chapters were short and i found myself very surprised to get to the end of the book the ending was a little bit too twee for me but it works","553":"seemed trite with simplistic characters also too many references to cooking eggs","554":" this book takes the place in the span of one night although we get flashbacks from each character to different events that shaped who they came to be on this one night it's from several perspectives following a few man characters and several smaller ones overall i enjoyed the feel of the book and the writing it evoked a jazz era feel for the first chapter i wasn't sure if it was set in modern day or in the 1920s i was rooting for most of the characters particularly sarina i did find the madeleine's story highly unbelievable but that's because my experience is nothing like that this doesn't mean it doesn't exist i guess there's something magical about her voice that was mentioned a few times in the novel and definitely at the end but it didn't make sense to me the ending took away from the rest of the book in my opinion taking it to a level of silliness that wasn't present for the rest of the book maybe it was supposed to be silly and it just didn't resonate with me i thought otherwise the writing was well done and again i enjoyed the jazz era feeling that was well crafted","555":"nice and light not as emotionally rewarding as love walked in but a similar type of book to that and school of essential ingredients 3 intertwined stories taking place in one day","556":"i didn't actually finish it it wasn't that bad i just got about 90 pages in and didn't think it was that good either","557":" what i loved was the sassy brash husky voice of madeline she made me cringe as a parent her profane language and the gusto with which she killed the cockroaches that infested her apartment made me want to rescue her from the hell of her kitchen but then it would have taken away the rich experiences that made her so curious and fierce in the first place all the characters are vivid and i found that relating to lorca mrs santiago or sarina equally easy to accomplish madeline surrounded by adults somewhat preoccupied with their own trials survives and finally realizes her dream of singing something i can remember being a goal during my own childhood sadly i didn't get the powerful response from my audience that madeline did but perhaps that is for the best the hedonism that madeline's voice encourages might have been my undoing","558":"do you ever wonder if as life goes on we're going to run out of ideas for stories does it seem like a lot of the books out there are too similar i don't think that'll happen the world is constantly evolving which alone will garner endless ideas but i think the author of 2 a m at the cat's pajamas does think we're running out of ideas and she tries way too hard to create something original resulting in exasperation on my part marie helene bertino you have the bones of a great story you don't need to impress us with clever wordplay weird dream sequences confusing time flow etc etc come on admit it isn't that an enticing title doesn't the cover have a cool 60's vintage feel ok you've got me i'm in the story features three main characters and opens with madeleine altimari a nine year old aspiring jazz singer shimmying and scatting in her bedroom how could you not love a character who's described in this way madeleine prefers to spend this and every recess alone singing scales under her breath walking laps up and down the parking lot madeleine has no friends not because she contains a tender grace that fifth graders detect and loathe not because she has a natural ability that points her starward though she does madeleine has no friends because she is a jerk and she is with good reason madeleine's mother has recently died and her grieving father refuses to get out of bed and take care of her she takes care of herself the best a nine year old can fortunately she's surrounded by loving neighbors who promised madeleine's mother they'd take care of her and they do still she's friendless and dirty perfect reasons to children why her classmates should torment her she's smart assed and spunky and she's by far my favorite character the second main character is madeleine's teacher sarina who sees the aching little girl underneath her tough demeanor she's recently divorced and hoping to connect with her high school boyfriend the one who got away she's decent and kind and a good teacher the third character is jack lorca and he's the owner of the cat's pajamas a legendary jazz club where all the main characters will converge so far this sounds like a story with good bones then the author starts trying to get creative and clever and the whole thing goes off the rails and now i'm out all three main characters are vibrant and interesting so why does the author have to throw in chapters with a dog's viewpoint a random conversation among people in a hair salon that has nothing to do with the story sarina's ex husband a pointless character who adds nothing to the story and on and on why do they merit entire chapters and sarina who the author has already established as a shy kind person is asked by some guys at a bachelor party to take their picture and bam this is how she responds grab each other's cocks and let's go jerk each other off so this is worth my while what i'm looking at is a bunch of worthless pussies and i wanna see cock excuse me but along that vein i say wtf i don't believe for one minute that sarina would actually say that she seems way too smart to think that might impress the person she's with in fact i think he's horrified then there are about faces in time and weird dream sequences that are plopped in for who knows what reason and so many minor characters popping up that i can't remember their places in the story then it all ends with a very minor character bursting then floating up into the sky and flying over the city yes you read that right again i say wtf what is the purpose of that chapter by the way i don't consider this a spoiler because the story has already had a satisfying ending and this second pointless ending has nothing to do with the story i wish the author would go back to those good bones the three main characters are great the setting of philadelphia which really could be considered a fourth character good morning the city says fuck you is great but this author looks young and i guess she thinks she needs to establish her unique voice in order to stand out from the crowd next time please don't try so hard","559":"i wanted to like this book more and i think i might have liked this book better if i had read instead of listened to it i wasn't enamored of the narrator and her cadence although some of her voice characterizations were quite good the writing was very good and certain phrases stood out as excellent the characters though not all lovable or even likable were empathetic and believable i'm not sure what to think about the bits of magical realism they were somewhat unexpected and a bit out of place because none happen until very close to the end but again if i had been reading and not listening i might feel differently about them i'll try this again next december and see if i feel differently about it","560":"it was a fun read but as it told the story from different characters it at times was hard to follow if i had read larger chunks in one sitting it would have been a better read the star chart here does not allow for doing 3 5 which is where i would honestly place this book","561":" reviewthe story begins at 7 a m on christmas eve eve in a seedy part of philadelphia there is quite a cast of quirky characters not the least of which is madeleine a smart mouthed rebellious nine year old whose mother has died and her father is absent with grief madeleine loves to sing and she hears of a jazz club called the cat's pajamas that she wants to go to time progresses in increments as the cast of characters are introduced until it is 2 a m at the cat's pajamas there were parts of this story i really liked but then other parts i felt lost on overall it was a fun read if a little bit off beat","562":"i heard about this book on npr and found it to be really interesting the way that it was written was a little off balance in a good way where i didn't have any idea what to expect next but was looking forward to finding out","563":"the rhythms and drifts of this story are like the intertwining notes and melodies from jazz musicians the story is an urban fantasy that reminds me of the magical realism in books such as like water for chocolate there are the real everyday parts of the story and then there are moments that take off into the unbelievable but like a good jazz session the story doesn't really have to follow the rules it has to capture your attention and your imagination 9 year old madeline wants to be a jazz singer like her mother as madeline tries to navigate the world after her mother's death she bumps up against the rules of life in a philadelphia catholic school madeline has allies and guides in mrs santiago in the local cafe bodega her art teacher miss green and others she also has a recipe box of cards written by her mother filled with odd and wonderful advice in her quest to sing at the jazz club the cat's pajamas madeline's story interweaves with stories of the club owner and the jazz musicians her teacher trying again at love and the others just trying to get by in her gritty philadelphia neighborhood i want to really love this book but sometimes the writing tried to hard and that pulled me away from the characters and the story sometimes the descriptions were too much or too carefully crafted this also can happen when a jazz solo goes on for too long and the listener just wants to get back to the melody when the story works marie helene bertino creates memorable characters she gives them real voices so you feel as if you're listening in on their conversations when events in this story slip away from reality it feels like times when you're drunk when you're listening to amazing music or when you're deeply in love","564":" this is a very quirky book about what happens one night at a jazz club called the cat's pajamas as a result it depends not on this involved plot line but on the development of all its characters who come together in a variety of ways and are juxtaposed one after the other in various chapters in that way it's kind of a mystery to figure out how one character is related to another personally i had to take notes because there were so many names the whole story takes place in the music world of philadelphia something i have never read about so i found that part of it very intriguing the characters for the most part were fun i found the teacher and her childhood boyfriend and the little girl madeleine who wants to sing in the club the most interesting the least interesting to me was the group of people sleeping illegally at the club a little too much info on them to me but the high point was well done and i esp loved the dog and mrs santiago the sausage maker i recommend it to anyone who is looking for a really different read and who loves music cute book","565":"2 a m at the cat's pajamas is a story about a little girl named madeleine and a jazz club called the cat's pajamas told over the space of 24 hours on christmas eve eve in philadelphia her mother has recently died and her father spends his days in his room wrapped in a drug induced haze the mellow sounds of jazz on his record player madeleine has one ambition to sing and she's good at it if only anyone would give her a chance to prove it she is hoping she will get the opportunity at school however things don't go quite as planned and madeleine ends up expelled for fighting not only losing her opportunity to show her singing chops but her first taste of a caramel apple provided by her teacher sarina greene however if she can't have the apple she can still find a way to sing when she hears about a jazz club called the cat's pajamas madeleine is determined to find a way to make her debut there but madeleine doesn't know how to get to the club so she mentions it to sarina who has just reunited with ben her long ago high school prom date when they decide to check this club out madeleine will follow them the club which is owned by jack lorca was once the most popular jazz club in town but times are tough his club has numerous code violations and the new police officer isn't about to give them a pass - which is a problem because alex lorca's sixteen year old son is determined to play guitar in the club even though he's a minor not surprising given the title all of the disparate strings of this tale will converge at 2 a m at the cat's pajamas since jazz is the tie that binds the characters it is only fitting that there is a kind of syncopation to the rhythm of the story - short staccato bursts of prose beside longer more mellow descriptions alex lorca enters the club hollering clapping popping his knuckles kissing sonny on the cheek kissing his father on the cheek...alex sings tonight most holy sacred night 2 a m at the cat's pajamas is a sweetly witty tale full of quirky but extremely likeable characters the kind of book that should be read more than once because it is even better the second time around","566":" i'm on my honeymoon i sit on my kindle i'm forced to read actual paperbacks left at the hotel reception that i can find in english loved the title so i picked this up in the morning as i made my way to an ocean hammock i could not put it down 3 major characters that suck you in and you hope beyond all hope that something good works out for them before this is all over intermixed are random minor players including a dog that all come together in the end her sentences are short and descript the kind that you slow down to savor miss greene smells like a tangerine and madeline likes that she never wears holiday themed apparel like the other homeroom teacher who today wears a holly leaf track suit today i'm back to the reception bookcase","567":"this was really more of a 3 5 star book for me what really drew me to this story is the characters despite facing tremendous loss exploring these characters doesn't feel heavy or slow in fact what's most interesting to me is how quickly everything happens in the books it tugs at your heartstrings view spoiler like madeline's desire to sing and the brutal retelling of madeline and the candy apple that gets lost in conversation hide spoiler and creates a complex yet captivating narrative while i found the end a bit more ambiguous than i'd like this book is a surprisingly easy read that moves quickly and reads like meeting new friends and immediately catching up with them","568":"probably the best book set in philly that i have read","569":"my favorite passage madeline has no friends not because she contains a tender grace that fifth graders detect and loath not because she has a natural ability that points her starward though she does madeline has no friends because she is a jerk i finished that last line and thought why don't i see things like this in kids' books wouldn't child readers appreciate this kind of observation excerpt from original content","570":"it was interesting but as an audiobook it was a bit hard to follow","571":" i absolutely loved this audiobook 2 a m at the cat's pajamas follows several characters through a single day in late december on this day the characters' lives are turned upside down as they face their own dreams and demons head on the characters' paths cross and intersect and each person has some effect on the other making this a classic ensemble based story narrator angela goethals does a stunning job creating diverse characters with range and believability i found myself invested in each character and rooting for their own small triumphs and successes the novel is in ways very poetic and beautiful but does so without compromising the rhythm of the story i highly recommend this audiobook if you are looking for a good story","572":"quick quirky and charming i'd love to see this turned into a made for tv christmas movie but i felt the large cast of characters hard to keep straight at times and that most if not all of them were underdeveloped so this is more a 3 5 3 75 for me","573":"this was a very sweet book i enjoyed the characters and overall plot even though it was a bit slow at times i must say that i liked madeline's character the most i've got a soft spot for books about kids who are jerks with a tragic backstory","574":"2015 reading challengea book set during christmasi'm recommending this one good characters and i loved the writing style it's fanciful and fun but also sad and gritty good read terrible listen get the book not the audiobook as the narrator kills it with an over dramatic delivery maybe she went to the william shatner school of acting","575":"i loved the setting and the characters it was a bit jumbled and confusing though i liked the theme of love and the focus on relationships","576":"i really really did not enjoy this book neither did the 9 other people in my book club and here's why of the broad assortment of characters none of them were likable or relate able i felt completely unmoored as i drifted through the story with them there was nothing to tie me to any of them a sad fact that was enhanced by the lack of description the writing style was jumbled in my opinion it often veered far past stream of conscious and seemed downright incomplete it left me with the impression that this book served as a draft and the author intended to go back and fill in major descriptions and plot points later she however did not and there were many passages actions and events that made no sense and or seemed completely out of place her inclusion of the surreal and near fantastical made the book incomprehensible the themes brought to light in the story were dampened by a very clear notion that the author had no first hand experience to add complexity richness and a dose of reality to the situations faced overall this just added to the underwhelming lack of redeeming value in this story there was nothing funny or touching as promised by the reviews and front interior flap mercifully it's a short book that's easy to read so long as you don't spend too much time re reading passages to try in vain to figure out what the heck the author had in mind and was trying to convey","577":"loved it this is a book that will bring a soft smile to your face whenever you stumble across the title it leaves you happy that you read it the 5th grade motherless aspiring jazz singer main character will grab your heart a very satisfying read","578":"not what i expected but it was ok","579":" did i like this book because of the way it captured the city where i now live did i like it because madeline captured my heart from the very beginning or did i love the fact that sometime you need a little fairy take mixed into a story whatever it was i enjoyed this book at times it jumped around a bit too much for me possibly because i listened to it as an audiobook at times i kept waiting for something bigger to happen but in retrospect it did but just not with all the fireworks i expected and that is a good thing what did happen is i was captivated by the authors turn of phrase and her delightful characters and the city i call home and knowing everything is going to be fine","580":"fun book interesting writing style that for me took a little getting used to but somehow made the book all the more enjoyable i truly enjoyed getting to know all these characters hearing their stories and seeing how their lives come together and impact each other will definitely consider other books by this author","581":"some of the same elements as on the road but very different in execution also where on the road took me weeks to read this one took only a few hours i read all but the first ten or so pages in one sitting","582":"a sweet and quirky book about the intersecting lives of a ten year old her teacher and a jazz club owner told over a 24 hour period good book made great by a charming narrator for the audiobook","583":"a very warm engrossing novel a soulful voice throughout with a clever way of telling this particular philadelphia story the characters help illustrate the love and loss and loneliness of the city i admire the ability to shape a novel from a particular time and place to really put your thumbprint into prose \"welcome o life i go to encounter for the millionth time the reality of experience and to forge in the smithy of my soul the uncreated conscience of my race joyce's quote popped in my head when the spell bertino casts in the book makes magical images and voices definitely a read for city goers phiadelphia people and readers on christmas eve eve this is the voice of the city this is your tireless doubt the rope that tethers you to the hydrant your half permission your limiting maddening jawn this voice comes from the northwest pocket the roxborough of your soul","584":"i loved this if you like the character flavia in the alan bradley novels you'll love madeleine she cracked me up highly recommend this one","585":"my review seems to match that of so many others in sentiment i loved the characters to start appreciated the interwoven vignettes adores the effortless beauty of the writing such gorgeous but simple descriptions then the ending came and it all felt a little incomplete i'm not sure whether the concept was just too lofty for me or if it really does just leave something to be desired again major kudos for the language and for the real unpolished characters","586":"i am not really sure how i feel about this book it could have been the audio making it difficult to follow along after a while i found myself not really paying attention but tried hard to focus on what was happening for me this one did not grab my attention as much as the title did","587":"it takes a certain book to garner 1 star from me and this book fits the bill it takes place in 24 hours but this was the longest day i have ever had there was not one character i liked except for maybe the diner owner who is quite a minor character in the telling of this story i truly wanted to like this book but unfortunately the only part i liked was 10 pages towards the end not to be confused with the end which was just as insufferable as the rest of the book","588":" copy received for reviewkind of a weird book feels like the '40s and yet takes place today main character is a smoking swearing bully of an almost 10 year old that was hard for me to get past i have an almost 10 year old and no just no also a weird paranormal vibe except that in 258 pages there are only 2 incidents and a vague referencing of a third so the book didn't feel paranormal and they just felt weirdly out of place my copy is an uncorrected proof though so it's possible that some issues were resolved before publication certainly hoping the punctuation spacing spelling issues were all caught lol","589":" if you are anything other than humbled in the presence of love you are not in the presence of love initial thoughts this is my first book by marie helene bertino follow her on twitter here and i had no idea what to expect i read the summary and i thought it sounded interesting so i picked it up without really reading any reviews i'm a sucker for christmas books i think the cover is rather adorable i love the snowflakes and the inclusion of the main characters story i thought some of it was unrealistic which made me unable to take madeleine's story line seriously i've met quite a few 9 years between cousins and campers where i used to work and none of them acted like her i know it's technically possible that there's someone like her out there but i felt like she should have been a little older i liked how the characters connected i liked the idea of the story centering on many people it's kind of like those movies new year's eve and valentine's day except less characters the chapters were broken up by time i liked that each chapter was a new time until 2am it was a good way to label the chapters end thoughts i liked that it took place in philadelphia because i used to live outside of philly and recognized most of the street names u0026amp areas so that was cool bertino has talent that's clear enough however her style of writing was not my favorite i think i would give bertino another chance if she wrote another book because she's a good writer she deserves that maybe i'll try reading this again next year there were moments that i really liked but the book over all was not my cup of tea by no means do i think this is a bad book thank you blogging for books for a copy of this book in exchange for an honest review","590":"great fun thought provoking read","591":"2 a m at the cat's pajamas reviewlistened to angela goethals ugh read 2 a m ugh and am sorry i wasted my time it was a slow stupid story poorly developed and read too 'matter of factly' to be enjoyable","592":"christmas eve eve in philadelphia is not a festive cheerful place for many of its inhabitants yet there is real magic in the air 2 a m at the cat's pajamas by marie helene bertino examines the events of december 23rd through the experiences of three disparate individuals madeleine altimari a smart mouthed nine year old whose mother has recently passed and whose father is in deep depression wants nothing more than to become a jazz singer sarina greene is a divorced young woman and also madeleine's teacher who has returned home where she finds she is constantly haunted by her past jack francis lorca is the owner of the legendary jazz club the cat's pajamas and december 23 is shaping up to be his last day of business slapped with fines totaling $30 000 for code violations lorca is desperately trying to find a way to save his club and his way of life as the day transpires these three characters will experience the highest highs and the lowest lows and readers will be in for the treat of a lifetime combining wit heartbreak and a touch of magical realism marie helene bertino has created an urban fairy tale complete with characters that will touch reader's hearts and remain there forever 2 a m at the cat's pajamas is a life affirming read that should not be missed","593":"this was really charming and fun sort of similar in style to jennifer egan's visit from the goon squad it lost me at the end a bit but it was enjoyable","594":"i would actually rate this a 2 5 if i could i think it's difficult to cover one single day over the course of an entire book the story breaks for necessary flashbacks to help us better understand the characters madeleine's storyline is the one i liked the most even if she is a jerk and a gritty foul mouthed 9 year old anytime we were with lorca or sarina i kept thinking about madeleine and wanting to go back to her the fourth character is the city of philadelphia itself the whole novel is imbued with that city's particular brand of attitude i don't know what else to say except that there were parts i found enchanting and parts i found disgusting not really a middle ground","595":"a small story with a big heart and a dog named pedro","596":"this review and others can be found on cozy up with a good readthis book had me intrigued with the idea of bringing together such an eclectic cast of characters and i can definitely tell you that the people that star in this book are intriguing but make the story a bit confusing the story jumps around between all these characters and it takes place over one night so there is a lot happening that i found myself lost during a few points the characters that marie helene writes in this story are not all the most likeable characters they all have their own issues to deal with but that is what makes this story so interesting i always enjoy a story where it is hard to like the characters because it gives a reader more hope to see where their lives will go i will say that madeline was my favourite character to follow she has a very tough exterior and you can see that she is dealing with some tough issues for a child each character's actions affects those of another one of the characters which is what makes this story work so well as it switches between stories sarina's was one plotline that i wish i had more of her story she is a quiet person who is being reunited with an old crush and where the night takes them had my heart but i felt like there wasn't enough of them i can say that even though i had issues with how quickly the story would change perspectives the way bertino wrote this story has characters that will capture your heart i do wish that this could have been a bit longer because i think bertino could have gotten more out of the story than she did in the less than 300 pages that she used here i just felt that the storylines were not as fully fleshed out as they could have been yet at the same time it was supposed to be over the course of one night so it is difficult to really get into the story in such a short amount of time this was definitely an interesting book and i can say that despite my few difficulties i enjoyed how bertino was able to intertwine so many lives at once","597":"this reminded me of a certain sort of holiday movie think love actually or 200 cigarettes the 1999 movie about hipsters on new year's eve that covers one day's happenings and follows the actions of a large linked assortment of characters but then add a hyperverbal 10 year old lots of quirk and whimsy several off key notes a few too many characters and a very strange conclusion there are some great sentences here which i regretfully failed to mark not staggeringly original at all but okay","598":"i really wanted to love this book unfortunately the only character worth engaging in was madeline the other characters lacked depth u0026amp there was little to enjoy about them particularly lorca the weird metaphorical dream like ending was lost to me","599":"philadelphia","600":" ahhh i absolutely loved this book even including the bits of magical realism which seemed to turn others off of it madeleine is a 9 year old jazz singing cigarette smoking foul mouthed aspiring entertainer who dreams of performing live at the cat's pajamas her teacher sarina greene has recently relocated back to her hometown and has made plans with acquaintances she hasn't seen or talked to since high school and even then she didn't seem to fit in well the owner of the cat's pajamas jack lorca struggles to pay off his accruing fines for violating city ordinances while also trying to get to know his son over the course of christmas eve eve all three converge in memorable exciting and funny ways i enjoyed the characters the writing style the plot points though i thought it would be predictable i mean look at the title i wonder when they'll all come together i was pleasantly surprised when the book was over i was genuinely a little sad","601":" i really really liked this book serious and yet whimsical at the same time a step into another world into the neighbourhoods of philadelphia into the hearts of people who each carry their own disappointments and lost dreams who are all in some way tied together madeleine altimari is perhaps the main character but she is by far the least madeleine motherless and father deprived just wants to sing sarina greene just wants a second chance at love alex wants understanding from his father and to play at the club and so it goes bertino does a great job of letting each of her characters fully come through no matter how big or small their starring role in the book i am wavering between a 4 and a 5 for this book if i devour a book in one day it's usually an indication of a 5 star book i'll stick with 4 5 for the easy reason that there are some words some sentences that bertino needs to refine and rethink in order to avoid that little bit of confusion that pops up now and then and also the ending it was a bit of a huh moment i'll have to think on it for just a while longer","602":"i just loved this book the whimsical atmosphere of the city at night the secret night lives of the city's inhabitants the yearnings of ordinary people who wish for more it was a joy to read","603":" madeline is almost nine and is barely coping with the death of her mother when things get worse the opportunity to finally hear her sing and she is good does not make up for the series of dark and uncomfortable situations outlined in the book a young girl on the way to school gets run over by a guy on a delivery bike is she dead hilarious young man adores his pit bull puppy a crowd of people watch as it is mauled by a rottweiler named grace a bar owner is forced to sell a family heirloom which is destroyed before he can save his bar merry christmas everyone","604":"i want more about madeline although i don't think this story lends itself to having a sequel good read","605":"without the last chapter or so 4 stars","606":"the cat's pajamas is a jazz club the plot and characters are like jazz riffs playing off each other and expanding the melody","607":"i didn't love it too many loose ends probably a decent choice for a book club an easy read","608":"the author has an original sounding voice and there is a zany cast of characters but the story seemed to lack the warmth and charm that endears this kind of tale to the reader still love the fun title though","609":"maybe i should wait to start reading a new book until after we open the southwest regional library i'm only enjoying the english patient on audio everything else is eh","610":"it isn't often that an author's writing style immediately hits me in a good way but here it is i absolutely adored this book and marie helene bertino's style is so clever and witty this will be a definite re read","611":"2 a m at the cat's pajamas begins at 7 a m on christmas eve eve 9 year old madeleine altimari has a lot on her plate for such a young child her father has sunk into a pit of despair after the loss of her mother he drinks and medicates and listens to jazz music in his room she takes care of him the best she can and she's a pretty tough little cookie but she's not alone mrs santiago who owns the little cafe she goes to every day watches after her her mother's best friend a hairdresser keeps watch over her teacher sarina greene has her eye on her she even wants her to sing in the christmas pageant despite what happened last time she sang madeleine has dreams of being a jazz singer and when she finds out about the club the cat's pajamas she's determined to head there the story also follows the owner of the club lorca the cop who overlooked the many violations at the club is gone and a new cop threatens to shut it down if fines aren't paid my problem with the book is that there are so many characters all intertwined that i got confused at times it didn't just follow the two i wrote about it followed more than that i know that it is really telling the tale of the town and the people in it how we are all connected in some way i did enjoy that aspect but i had to remind myself who certain people were i loved madeleine i enjoy a child character with spunk but not to the point of disrespect it really does take a village to raise a child and maybe also to keep each other in check","612":"3 5 stars hard to keep up with everyone","613":" 2 a m at the cat's pajamas is unlike any book i've read before this woven narrative explores the relationships dreams and desires of many characters as they experience the 24 hours of christmas eve eve and as you can imagine all these moments culminate together into 2am at the 2nd greatest jazz club in philadelphia the cat's pajamas it's a hard book to put a solid finger on genre and character focus seems to change with every page turn over one jam packed day we see the three main character's lives get completely turned around the format of this book is semi diary in nature each chapter begins with a different time of day all moments slowly inching forward in time and slowing helping each character see their world differently but these three characters are not the only ones we intersect some of these additional characters we meet once and never hear from again some return in a semi recurring basis all in all this book felt a bit unfocused to me we jumped to new characters in the blink of an eye new perspectives and timelines were introduced with little explanation the language bertino used was sometimes beautiful sometimes ugly and always mimicking the feel of music it was easy to get lost in the rhythm of the words but sometimes it was hard to understand why we were reading what we were reading was this important or a throwaway moment lastly the magical realism didn't make any sense to me until i remembered this one line view spoiler when madeleine sang everyone got what they wanted this one line completely changes the ending of the book from something i was confused about to something i appreciated but this goes back to my constant wonder if the words i was reading were relevant to the story most didn't seem to perpetuate the plot hide spoiler that said the ending did make me really happy in retrospect this is just a really changing book to talk about please if you read this book let me know what you think this book is quite an enigma to write about","614":"i received this as a good reads first read book giveaway i did try very hard to get into this book but after the first 100 pages i just simply couldn't get into what the author was trying to get across she has several 'main' characters and some are similar to others so i was having a hard time keeping what storyline i was reading separated from the others maybe it was just 'me' but i just couldn't get into it","615":"this is one of the most surprising and delightful books i have read in years the writing is stellar i can't wait to read more from marie helene bertino my mom picked it up in an airport bookstore on our way to philadelphia for christmas and we each read it in a day magical fast paced and secretly substantive one of those books that will stay with me for a long time","616":"uneven is the best description including story line and character development i had high hopes at the beginning of the book but lost it during the long night walk through philly the ending is totally incongruent with the story great title and use of time to indicate chapters","617":"a very charming story for christmas eve eve","618":"quirky and fun but confusing at times i loved the characters and would have liked some of the story lines to continue i felt a bit confused at the end what was going on with mrs santiago","619":"perfect portrayal of what is possible when one has an adventurous spirit and youth in philadelphia may marie helene please write long and often","620":"the cover caught my attention her style of writing kept it the story itself not so much an ordinary day which seems just how the author intended it to be madeline a precocious young ten year old growing up absent parents was captivating for certain","621":"this little book was wonderful the tools the author used to write made me giggle at times in the beginning i was a bit confused by all the stories but as the chapters clicked by i loved how much they overlapped and weaved together pulling you into each character wonderful book wonderful storyteller","622":"loved the characters and much of the writing was lyrical the ending just dropped off the edge of a cliff with no warning or resolution didn't seem to belong to the rest of the book disappointing","623":"i enjoyed this book and the characters it jumped around a bit much for my taste quick read though u0026amp worth the time","624":"i like the format of this novel with lots of characters and moving through the hours of one day quirky phrasing kept me engaged too","625":"wonderfully structured with amazing descriptions bertino's language is terrific and her characters are fully formed spunky nine year old madeline is clearly the sharp tongued product of a blunt and spunky city where love is mostly inferred and moments of belligerent frankness provide a bracing counterpoint to concealed tenderness the story moves well never gets boring as you bounce around philadelphia on this one extraordinary day in the city","626":"some of the best prose i've read in quite awhile","627":"entertaining first novel by a high school friend of my daughter quirky but not too quirky for my taste she does philadelphia very well","628":"tiresomely quirky i like quirk but quirk for quirk's sake is just infuriating i threw in an extra star because i love the cover","629":" this book was such a pleasure to read i especially loved the quirky and poetic phrasing which took me by surprise by how well it captured thoughts ideas and descriptions i also loved the characters especially madeleine although she isn't especially likeable her story is so real and tragic that you can't help rooting for her and cheering when she gets to live her dream for those few perfect minutes at 2am like most of the other characters she will have a hard road ahead of her before things can work out well but you get a sense of hope that she will get there i loved the way the author wove together so many different stories to all culminate at 2am at the cat's pyjamas which is a fantastic title as well as the most important scene in the book i came close to rating this 5 stars but the ending just didn't work for me it was too unreal and impossible without there being any hint of magic or fantasy earlier in the book so it was just too jarring and unlikely and left me feeling unsatisfied overall the book was excellent though and i highly recommend it","630":"a light read but i enjoyed it independent 9 yr old protagonist wants to sing in a jazz club good characterization","631":"this story was about three characters whose lives intersect at the end of the book the main character madeline was a sassy 9 yr old she was the most interesting character by far the story meandered and there were a lot of strange incidents many which seemed to have no real bearing on the story lines i read this book at the beach which might explain why i kept reading it beyond the normal point where i would have lost interest it was easy to pick up and read a bit and lay down it certainly wasn't compelling was i interested in the characters maybe a bit interested in madeline the others not so much was the plot interesting not so much why did i keep reading i can't explain it","632":"this book has a lot of beautiful quirky phrases that really painted a picture in my mind of what was going on but at the same time characters and story didn't fully grab me a lot of times i felt there was just too much filler but i would be interested in reading the author's next novel because she does have a way with words that makes you want to hear more from her and if audible has this on sale someday i'll probably buy it","633":"i had heard of this book as a possible contender for the rooster a few years ago so i gave it a try it's a feisty music box of a book sort of frank capra meets the 21st century in philadelphia the author uses a few devices the time as the title of chapters repetition of a phrase the same scene played from different points of view a bit of magical realism here and there but they were so well crafted that they fit in i wish the author had let us spend just a little more time with sarina and madeleine and i would love to know how it worked out with ben and what will happen to the cat's pajamas i'm looking forward to what's next from this author","634":" what a fun story about a little girl with an obsessive desire to sing a jazz club and two lovers who have always regretted how that prom turned out twenty years ago but still have trouble getting it right this novel has its own flow it switches between settings and characters in a free floating style connected mainly by timestamps letting us know what order it all occurs in it takes awhile to see how all the characters relate to each other there are a few spots where the time stamps get annoyingly 'clever' telling a joke backwards for example there is also a fantasy element alluded to more than explained of the ways people react to the experience of hearing madeleine sing the ending in particular is odd i liked the spirit of it the sass pretty funny","635":"such a fun sweet book here's my review on my blog http bookaliciousbabe blogspot com","636":"charming characters brought to life by fantastically fun writing each sentence was a joy to read","637":"beautifully written i just wanted to know more about the characters i would have loved it if it had been twice as long","638":"loved this book even though the language got away from her sometimes the opening chapter is one of the best i've read from the viewpoint of a young girl george saunders has done some dillys a boat load of characters some more interesting than others but all in all a terrific read","639":"i really enjoyed this woven narrative it brought me back to my own days of being underage but singing in jazz clubs the atmosphere of the club falling in love with the community and losing yourself in the music beautiful i did feel that it could have been tighter in the ending post 2am but it's a small criticism in my overall enjoyment of the book","640":"what a ride if you like jazz eccentric characters of all sizes and ages this is the book for you","641":" perhaps 2 5 this title grabbed me i totally thought it was going to be fun but it was a major disappointment the dust jacket states that madeline is about to have the most extraordinary day and night of her life this christmas eve eve madeline will be 10 on christmas day story is about three lost souls searching for love music and hope however far too many pages were on so many characters that i couldn't keep them straight nor did i care to read about them including sarina and that weird principal who expels an elementary student christmas eve eve also states that this book will capture your heart and have you laughing out loud not did laugh when madeline talked to the roaches i kept thinking this will get better right i am such am optimist and but this book just did not deliver i found myself frowning most of the time trying to figure out why i was reading it i know we all have different unique tastes i find i like a book if i like the characters i did like madeline","642":"the city of philadelphia is a a character in this novel about jazz and longing","643":" review by joanne 2 a m at the cat's pajamas is a fast paced novel with a cast of quirky characters that is terribly original it all takes place in one day christmas eve eve and follows the lives of three memorable characters these characters all make their way to philadelphia's once great jazz club called the cat's pajamas bringing their unique talents and dreams with them some of the characters include madeline a nine year old motherless jazz singer her teacher miss green miss green's beau ben and lorca the club owner madeline is about to have the greatest day and night of her life determined by her desire to make her on stage debut at the cat's pajama lorca is in a spin as he is about to lose his beloved club unless he can come up with $30 000 these three souls search for love and dreams and discover great possibilities in one night","644":" this book felt like a collection of jazz tunes and i'm sure that was the intent i was enchanted by the way madeleine sarina and lorca's lives wound around each other felt almost improvisational in this one day i finished it in a bout of midnight insomnia and really the ending was about perfect in that setting though i'm still not sure what i really think of it it's been a while since i've read anything that was as much about the writing as it was the characters and plot so this was fun","645":"charming","646":"you can find my review of this book here http leaningstack blogspot com 2014","647":" i have to admit the title and the topic of the jazz club is what led me to this book surprisingly enough for me the parts of the story dealing with the jazz club itself held my attention the least madeleine's character is so interesting and i couldn't help but to imagine her as the professional's mathilda the haircut the smoking the maturity for a young kid the teachers in the story are told through such an interesting lens and its one that brings humility and humanity to a profession so often seen through a one way portal the descriptions of jazz lifting everyone out of their sadness really drove it home for me the way bertino describes every grimace and melody of the city keeps the story afloat sure there are some portions of the story i didn't like so much and one really wonders how madeleine's father will end up but overall one of the most enjoyable books i've read this year the story takes place in one day and i think i read it in almost that amount of time too","648":"if you liked love walks in by marisa de los santos or gilmore girls you'll like this one it has the same kind of quirky clever humor with lots of cultural and musical references thrown in it was an enjoyable read but one that i'll probably forget soon","649":"i question the sanity of the must read summer reading list i mean some of the books are as amazing as the list writer claims and other times like this one i don't get it i did love madeline the 9 year jazz singer who desperately wants to be heard and loved but for me at least the storytelling was choppy and the beginning was slow i would file this under quirky reads","650":"this story weaves around a young girl with a strange gift for song a sympathetic teacher facing her own insecurities and a man whose nightclub is on the verge being shut down by the city there are heartwarming moments and odd coincidences and everyone feels better at the end sometimes you just want a story like that","651":" this was more of a 3 5 3 75 on the rating scale overall i enjoyed this book a lot at times it even had a bit of an absurdist feel like cheever's the swimmer --which i like i thought the different characters were fun to read about and i especially loved how philadelphia was almost its own character in the story the only place i really took issue with the book was sometimes certain characters felt underdeveloped but with multiple perspectives it can be difficult to give them all equal attention however with that said this book is an entertaining quick read especially for lovers of multiple perspectives cities and jazz music","652":"http treviansbookit blogspot com 20","653":"very unique writing style with excellent phrases but the story circled around too much without finding a strong landing spot still worth a read though","654":"thoroughly enjoyed this look at 24 hours in the lives of these characters and it all happens on december 23","655":"this book was a bit like a sundae that has every single item at the sundae bar on it fun and silly and sweet but at times there were so many characters that i couldn't keep track","656":"i loved this one beautiful verbs gorgeous sentences and best nine year old protagonist ever highly recommend","657":"this book was hard to start as it was hard to keep track of the characters the book bounces between them and some of the transitions are not clear they also seem like random characters until the last 1 4 of the book i totally disliked the ending it felt like i had read the entire book for nothing","658":"it's a very good book but when i was a third of the way through i bet myself a glass of wine that the author lives in brooklyn i enjoyed the wine but it didn't help with the smug hipster tone","659":"indescribablebeautifully written but confusing at times i had a little trouble keeping the secondary characters straight but my favorite characters are a 9 year old girl a woman who looks after her and her teacher this book is essentially about love and loss and growing up about first chances and second chances and about hope for the future it's worth reading","660":" 2 am at the cat's pajamas by marie helene bertino is a quirky book about one night - christmas eve eve - in philadelphia i thought it was going to be set in the 50s or 60s based on the cover which i love btw and the jazz club setting but it's not - it is set in the present with references to facebook and cell phones and dating profiles there are basically three subplots that are threaded together in the story 1 madeleine a 10 year old whose mother died of cancer and who has a rebellious streak and a penchant for cursing gets expelled from school and wants to sing onstage at a jazz club 2 sarina a recently divorced woman in her late 20s is invited to a party at the home of one of her old high school friends where she encounters a man for whom she has harbored feelings for many years and 3 lorca the owner of famed philadelphia jazz club the cat's pajamas risks losing the club due to several municipal violations including musicians living in a back room at the club then there are a host of tertiary characters who pop up in intermittent chapters throughout the book 2 am at the cat's pajamas is told in an unusual style each chapter takes place at a different time of day and the narration rotates among the storylines bertino's writing is more poetry than prose at times and there are some jarring non sequiturs and bizarre stretches of dialogue and actions that kept me from really getting into the book i enjoyed some moments of real power and insight - especially in the sarina chapters - but there were long passages that were confusing and boring too i didn't feel any connection to lorca or to mrs santiago the woman who cares for madeleine and they appeared too often for my liking there were also random characters who popped in and out only adding to the choppy nature of the book i wanted to like 2am at the cat's pajamas but it was kind of a chore to get through some people love this book so give it a chance if it sounds like your type of read","661":"nice little book i had a little trouble following the plot lines at times i found myself going back to reread passages to make sure what was what but it was worth the effort enjoyable tome","662":"i liked the writing but there were to many characters to keep straight","663":"enjoyed the story and characters but it did get confusing i'd be interested to know if native philadelphians enjoyed the way the setting is used in the book","664":" i would have given this 4 stars but it only gets three and right now that's feeling like a gift no wait 2 stars that's all it's getting because i'm just so ticked off i love the writing and even the flawed characters i loved it right up to the very last chapter i don't mind magical realism i love sara addison allen's books but that ending made me mad i felt like i'd been ripped off the real ending stolen it made absolutely no sense to me the most stupid ending since the particular sadness of lemon cake which ranks right up there as one of the worst books i've ever read that and atonement and the book thief sadly as much as i enjoyed the book along the way i wanted to throw it across the room at the end it's getting donated won't pass it on to a friend even","665":"what a strange little book this was i honestly picked this because it fit into the reading challenge i'm doing this year a title with a numeral in it i'm glad i did i love stories that overlap and intersect there are mini stories that somehow all connect this was one of those stories it is sweet it is strange it's down right bizarre at times it's magical it is sad it's hopeful the book is short and could easily be read in a day or two if you wanted to","666":"i was attracted to this book because it was set in philadelphia my city at christmas time what could be better well as it turns out a lot i found the shifting between characters to be very disjointed and i didn't even like lorca and the people at the cat's pajamas much sarina and ben's story became interesting in the end but it took a long time to get there i rarely abandon a book but i was tempted to give up on this one several times the writing is wonderful and that's what kept me from giving it only one star","667":"i have never had my opinion of a book so thoroughly destroyed by an ending before i enjoyed almost everything even though very little actually happened until the ending left me disconnected from the characters the story and the mood in my opinion the way the metaphor was written was jarring and didn't fit the rest of the story honestly a cliche it was all just a dream would have been better prior to the last chapter i was thinking 4 something stars","668":"i adored this book based on the spunky main character and philadelphia also acting as a character in the book","669":" originally published at reading reality2 a m at the cat's pajamas contains an interesting trio of contemporary stories that feels like there's a touch of magical realism or fantasy mixed in with some very gritty problems it's also possible that it contains just a bit of christmas magic taking place as it does just a day before christmas eve in this story christmas eve eve becomes a special day with a magic all of its own three stories all centered around a jazz club that used to be absolutely legendary but the cat's pajamas has fallen on hard times as has its owner while it used to be the best club in philly now its just hours away from being closed due to multiple violations of the city code not the health code but much more damning things the house band is living in the club and it definitely isn't zoned that way one guy has made his bedroom in the old walk in freezer that gave me the shivers on a hot august day all the band members and the owner are just one drink or fix or code violation from living on the streets there's been way too much bad luck to go around the club's other problems are that they can't manage to shut themselves down at 2 am and they can't seem to keep underage musicians from trying out with the band including tony lorca the owner's son lorca sr wants a better life for his kid than chasing music and bars to play in but tony is already on the slippery slope to addiction and only music has a chance of saving him sarina greene finds herself at the cat's pajamas with the one man she never got over on a magical night that is almost but not quite a date because he's still married to someone else last and most important madeleine altimari doesn't merely want she actually needs to become a jazz singer a great jazz singer it is her only real escape from her mother's death her father's all encompassing depression and her need to follow the box of instructions for life that her mother left her and she knows that she can make her debut at the cat's pajamas there's one little problem madeleine and her very big and marvelous voice is only 9 years old she needs a little magic and a whole lot of sneaking around to make her splash and help the cat's pajamas' go out with a really big jazz bang escape rating b this is a story that takes a while for its disparate threads to come together madeleine grabs the reader's heart from the very beginning she is loud brash foul mouthed and very smart in some ways while completely naive in others the more her father sinks into despair the further out madeleine gets in bravado she's covering up just how bad things are because she knows they can always get worse a hard lesson for a nine year old her aggressiveness is all defense and everyone knows it but madeleine herself her voice is very real magic not just because it's big and utterly fantastic but because magical things happen when she sings her ambition is quite real even though the effects tip into fantasy sabrina greene's story is easy to sympathise with the man she has loved since high school really does love her back but he keeps following bad instincts or terrible advice and never manages to tell her how he feels they've been dancing towards each other for years but never quite get there it's sad but so so real lorca's story is the one that doesn't quite gel the situation with the cat's pajamas has been steadily trending downhill for years but we don't get quite enough of lorca's perspective or the sad decline of the \"boys in the band\" to really understand how he got into the fix he's in but madeleine's story carries the book she schemes she connives she stalks people in order to make her dream come true and when it does she gives everyone just a bit of magic","670":"one of the best books i've read in a while rooted in realism but not without a flight of fancy like a female centric garcia marquez it's at the same time tragic and funny but grounded in today's world","671":"i loved this the writing is excellent very descriptive and poetic i'm still puzzling over the ending but the book was delicious","672":"i won this book in a drawing at goodreads this novel was good enough to finish reading it but ultimately unsatisfying for me the worst part of the book was the touches of magic that seemed out of place","673":" loved it the writing is fresh edgey and musical without being pretenious or hard to understand a taste of the writing madeliene has never had a caramel apple and she wants to taste one more than she wants god's love just because your mother is dead doesn't give you the right to suck sabrina wants to walk with ben more than she wants a peaceful old age madeliene is finishing a hoagie in the electric air across the street from the cat's pajamas meeting place of witches and ice cream men","674":"i'm not sure what i expected going into this but i don't think there's anyway i really could have understood what i was getting into yes the book is about a little girl who goes to the cat's pajamas a jazz club in philadelphia but yet it's really about so much more than that the story is told from several different perspectives which could get a little confusing but really seemed to work the three main ones were that of madeleine a 9 year old who recently lost her mother sarina greene madeline's teacher and lorca the owner of the cat's pajamas there's a few other characters who have their moment in the spotlight with a scene or two told from their perspective but madeleine sarina and lorca are the ones you hear from the most as you might expect i enjoyed certain characters more than the others with lorca's momments being my least favorite but while i started out enjoying madeline's sections the most i soon fell a little in love with sarina's madeline though is still the heart of the story and you can't help feeling for her throughout she puts on such a tough exterior to the world to get through all the hardships life has dealt her while she isn't the nicest person to many because we're in her head we can see where she's coming from and it's a bit heartbreaking luckily there are a few others like sarina fighting for her and when she finally has her moment you can't help but cheer for her i don't know that i've ever read a book quite like this one i do think a lot of it is because it all happens over such a short period of time only 24 hours and we hear from so many different characters but it's more than really there's just such a soul to this book that's almost indescribable but i feel a little blessed to have had the experience of reading it 4 5 5disclosure i was provided this book through tlc book tours all opinions expressed are my own","675":"originally posted on my blog game read blog i received this book for free from blogging for books in exchange for an honest review i chose this one because of a booktuber lindsey rey that i really enjoy recommended it 2 a m at the cat's pajamas what to say about it it is written differently that most books i read the whole books takes place during the hours of one day each chapter title is the time that the events following are taking place it's a really interesting concept and you know from the title that something is likely going to take place at 2 a m what confused me before reading the book and not having read the blurb at all was what the heck the title meant the cat's pajamas is a jazz club in the story where the culminating event takes place at 2 a m once i got used to the writing style i really enjoyed it the only thing that was a little annoying was the fact that the perspective would rapidly change from one character to another this worked most of the time and i was able to follow it but there were a few occasions where it did get confusing as to who you were supposed to be following the story was fun there was a bit of romance some mischief some sad events in character's pasts it was entertaining but the end i won't spoil it but it left me with a sense of what the hell is happening this is one of those stories that leaves the ending open which is fine but there is a scene at the end with a character by the name of mrs santiago if you've read it i'm sure you know what i mean that last scene was just so out of left field with no explanation as so what the heck it is supposed to be that it really brought down the overall rating of the book for me overall i gave 2 a m at the cat's pajamas 3 5 out of 5 stars","676":"lovely and weird and sad and heart warming and delicious also awesome in audio","677":"this was a really fun and enjoyable read up until the ending i feel like only two or three of the characters actually had resolution while the rest of them were left hanging i would have given this book a better rating had it contained more resolution to the story","678":"looking for a relaxing but intriguing holiday read i know it's not exactly timely but just think of it as christmas in july follow the lives of multiple characters as they spend christmas eve eve unknowingly crossing paths with one another my favorite character has to be madeleine a fifth grader who only wants to sing the blues she has plenty of unfortunate personal experiences to draw from still reeling from her mother's death madeleine tries to take care of her dad while relying on family friends to take care of her plus she has to deal with the bs of her school-something with which i can definitely relate i found myself skipping past all chapters featuring lorca a hopeless manchild who attempts to keep the cat's pajamas afloat despite his self centered and careless view of the world still the characters work together to form a varied and interesting cast you won't get a fairy tale ending with this book but like the characters themselves everything turns out okay consider this book the philadelphia equivalent of love actually received from bloggingforbooks in exchange for an honest review originally posted on poreoverpages","679":" i wanted to love this book and there were times when i encountered certain phrases that so perfectly described a thought or an action that i felt as though the author had a lock on my experience of the world that being said i found this book very confusing there are several characters that i was interested in and felt connected to their stories were interlaced with other short vignettes dealing with minor players who i didn't feel advanced the story in any way i enjoyed madeline the nearly ten year old aspiring jazz singer and her colorful and irreverent language and sarina the teacher who is unlucky enough to love an unavailable man but i was unmoved by lorca the owner of the cat's pajamas and his son alex who made up the other half of the story i don't feel the conclusion was satisfying to any of the characters i don't think that a book has to be tied into a neat package but the events of the magic hour at the club and what transpired were just cooky i don't really understand if the book shifted gears and went into a dream world if there was a metaphor i wasn't clever enough to get or if there was some magic at work that i just didn't buy or care about the ending had me sighing in disappointment rather than content and i find that odd this book was provided to me by blogging for books to review for more info please check out the in depth review on my blog http thefinestdandelion blogspot co","680":"i wanted to like this book more than i did i felt invested in the characters but the narrative was chaotic","681":"this was a quick read with a sprawling cast of characters the action takes place in and around a failing historic jazz club in philadelphia during a 24 hour period preceding christmas it's kind of a rough take on that particular scene a sort of jazz actually while it was an interesting glimpse into that particular world the writing style often felt contrived and overwrought","682":"interesting book quirky as another reader called it i would like to read this again in a few months and see what else i can get out of it","683":"it was good but i'm not really sure what the whole point of it was i feel like not much was resolved at the end","684":"i have to give the outhor credit for a really interesting structure a day in the life of philadelphia through the eyes of several characters i just don't think it worked","685":"not really sure what i think about this book the ending was odd like tacking a little speculative element in the last 3 pages onto a book that was not speculative at all till then at least i think it was supposed to be a bit fantastical at the end or maybe it was just a metaphor anyway i'm still scratching my head about it","686":"http wordnerdy blogspot com 2014 08","687":"\"we carry our ancestors in our names and sometimes we carry our ancestors through the sliding doors of emergency rooms and either way they are heavy man either way we can't escape \"what is this book about it's christmas eve eve in philadelphia and the streets are covered with snow while the characters that circle around the jazz bar the cat's pajamas go around their business we follow madeleine a precocious 9 year old jazz singer with a love for menthol cigarettes her school teacher sarina with high school crush ben the owner of the jazz bar and his son and the evil principal of madeleine's school because every story needs a villain they move in and out of each others lives during the day culminating at you've guessed it 2 a m at the cat's pajamas why is it boring my biggest gripe with this book is not that it's boring but that it is a mess there are so many characters that all need to 'meet' each other that it often feels hammered in when a character stumbles around in someone else's chapter and when a big part of your ensemble consist of uninteresting characters it becomes tough to slog through those chapters who would you recommend it to it's definitely a christmas story so if you love those you might want to give this book a try also if you love kid characters who are way to mature for their age you are going to eat madeleine up definitely unbelievable but she's one of the most fun characters to follow nonetheless the book seems to be meant as a character study creating small vignettes of the philadelphia population so it might also be interesting for people who like to read small human stories why should i read it if it's boring the book has some strong characters and nice moments but to me they didn't outweigh the negatives i enjoyed the story of sarina and ben walking around the city at night reminiscing about their high school times this felt a bit like a before sunrise type of story and was highly enjoyable i already mentioned madeleine and her story was pretty sad but i kept on feeling that it could have been heartbreaking if she wasn't such an unbelievable character she's a salinger child times a hundred knowing old jazz classics singing with a hand on her hip and taking sexy drags of her cigarette it's all just too much the other chunk of the book consists of lorca the jazz club owner and his troubled son and that part i just couldn't care about at all and don't even get me started on the out of nowhere magical realism ending that bertino throws in i literally had to go back and read again what she made happen and it still doesn't make any sense that said the book is an easy read with a fluffy story that can't really rub you the wrong way i liked how bertino structures the story using time as her chapter headings moving backwards and forwards throughout the day 2 a m at the cat's pajamas is a good idea but unfortunately fleshed out into a dull novel rating 2 5 5review copy attained through blogging for books and edelweiss","688":"i love this book so much bertino weaves so many colorful characters all ultimately connected to the jazz club in philly called the cat's pajamas her writing is like poetry with humor she captures true jazz musicians and their life and 9 year old madeline is one of the most memorable characters i've encountered in a long time well written magical","689":"i read this awhile ago but i couldn't help loving everything about this book it takes place in my favorite city philly talks about some of my favorite music jazz and all this around christmastime the main character is heroic with just a hint of a tragic element and the auxiliary characters still get their chance to shine reading it feels like a warm blanket with a hot cup of chocolate even the darker parts of the novel","690":"it was just ok the concept was interesting following many characters through a day but i felt that there were too many characters and they took kind of long to get connected","691":"3 5 stars an interesting multi perspective story that somewhat reminded me of love actually there are multiple storylines taking place over the course of one day that converge together at 2 a m on christmas eve some of the story lines have happy endings some not so much and others are just downright confusing if you take magical realism into consideration though it all makes sense in the end","692":"i don't remember the last time i laughed so hard or got so attached to a city philly and a book's characters esp madeline lorca and sarina outstanding crossover narratives that take place in and around the old market neighborhood over the course of 19 hours 7 am 2 am on christmas eve eve into christmas eve most action set in or around or because of a jazz club called the cat's pajamas one of the best quotes ever anyone who doesn't think ray charles is the best is a chump","693":" this book is a pleasure to read it is at once whimsical and gritty full of poignant moments in our world of constant transition at each stage of life the struggles and the change can be viewed with joy or with sorrow if you've lived in philadelphia it's a plus to visit the city on the page the evocation of place is true to heart so is the grief and loneliness characters struggle with and lay bare in the course of 24 hours when you enjoy a book like this you want to share it when choosing it to discuss in a book group i want to enrich the experience for my readers so they let go of their own struggles and feel the joy big thank you to marie helene bertino for introducing me to blossom dearie reigniting my love of jazz and interest in the women who make it is a gift of continued pleasure","694":"confusedtoo open ended left too many questions did not like it would not recommend a friend recommended it to me that's it no more","695":"i really enjoyed the quick and fun read strong character work interesting structure through different character's perspectives plus the little girl's sass yes please fantastic","696":" i received this arc from read it first and random house in exchange for an honest review thanks for the opportunity this book reminded me of the movies valentine's day and new years eve as there were multiple characters all with different stories but all the characters have a connection i was thinking this while i was reading it it was a great story that dealt with many aspects and emotions of life all centered around a jazz club that had seen better times i got a chuckle when the same descriptive sentence was used for most of the characters i am definitely glad i got the chance to read this delightful uplifting story","697":" i liked this book but i thought it a little odd a quote on the back said it was laugh out loud funny hum it was laugh out loud funny the last 20 pages but before that it wasn't funny at all the story is about the characters all intersecting at a dying jazz club cat's pajamas in the inner city of philadelphia the main character is a rough 9 year old whose mother died and whose father is so depressed over his wife's death he doesn't leave his bedroom the book is well written and a fast read i would have enjoyed the book more if i hadn't expected it to be a light funny read","698":"i think i liked this it is a very unusual book","699":"i laughed i cried i'm probably going to read it again and again seriously i laughed out loud a lot and i found my heart caught in my throat an equal number of times maybe i'm just emotional but this book had such interesting characters that were at once relatable not a word and surprising that i was riveted from 7 a m until the sun came up the next day i zoomed through it so fast and there was a bit of a surprise in tone at the denouement so i am definitely going to read it again i can't wait to see what she writes next","700":"i enjoyed the honesty rawness of the book the grit there was a pulse a beat the characters people pets time city show the good the bad and the ugly of this thing we call life it played out like a song","701":"i kept waiting for something to happen","702":"i loved everything about this book the way it was written the characters the story it left me feeling completely satisfied even though it is the morning after i am still basking in the happy afterglow what more is there to say","703":"this book had a lot of missed opportunities it takes place in a city dear to my heart and i wanted to love it but there were too many characters and viewpoints it tried too much to be like 'love actually'","704":"i found bertino's writing refreshing she has a wonderful vocabulary and her word choices are delightful like nuanced jazz phrasing spread over 24hrs 2 a m is the story of intersecting lives on christmas eve at the final close of the club the cat's pajamas it's a tale of a girl against all odds finding her voice and the will to sing on the stage at the cat's pajamas it's about a father's love and young romantic love struggling to crack the concrete that prevents it from flourishing in light and fresh air the book has a magical feel something about a sweet mix of light and airy yet profound thanks for the suggestion vicki","705":"the backbone of the story was really good but the overly embellished language was distracting and confusing and there were so many unnecessary characters that we saw glimpses of not my type of book","706":"has humor the storyline is choppy and limited","707":"a quick and quirky read very endearing","708":" this story of several characters on a single night christmas eve eve is charming touching and makes me want to listen to some sassy jazz music nine year old madeline just wants to sing her teacher sarina greene just wants to reunite with her ex boyfriend even though she won't admit it at first and jazz club owner lorca just wants to keep his jazz club open which is called the cat's pajamas the story of this evening evokes philadelphia perfectly and makes me nostalgic for my time there proof of both the philly love and bertino's poetic talent the city is in a perpetual state of being not quite ready to talk about it instead it lashes its wind against the banners of the art museum moody light changes down market the cars bitch toward city hall puddles yearn toward the sewers the unrequited city dreams up conspiracies and keeps its buildings low to the ground you are never allowed to dream higher than the crown of ben franklin dear world you think you're better than me suck a nut yours sincerely pass the water ice","709":"it was ok wish i could give it 2 5 stars there were too many character story lines which confused me i only really cared about the storyline of the 9 year old girl so that's what got me through this one","710":" this is the charming quirky story of a lonely girl with a wicked singing voice a broken down jazz club owner and a number of star crossed philadelphians and how their paths merge one crazy winter night the writing is dreamy and sharp the story is original i was reminded of confederacy of dunces' in the way a city is revealed through a menagerie of characters however there are lapses in reality that beg for an editor even a dose of magical realism requires some explanation or was the entire story a magical one i'm left wondering","711":" madeline is nine going on 90 losing her mother to cancer was a tough blow losing her father to his stupor of grief only adds to her pain she is neglected and struggling and as a result she is belligerent nasty spiteful and swears like a sailor there are friends of her mother who help her but they cannot ground her as a parent needs to do jack owns a philadelphia jazz club housing friends and acquaintances who are addicted to drugs alcohol or music jack must face the fact that not only is he breaking zoning ordinances he is lacking in funds to keep the place a float sarina is divorced lonely and a teacher who cares she sees a spark in madeline and longs to guide her while overall i liked this book and felt it worth the time to read i also feel though that the author tried to get a bit too creative when depicting the jargon and emotions of the jazz club scene in these chapters the author failed to write clearly thus rendering it difficult to read my test is if i have to go back and re read the sentences to try to discern what is said then the writing fails i give these chapters a d and the rest of the book a c","712":"this book was an enjoyable journey that's not to say it was a happy go lucky sort of story it's more that the semi heartbreaking and sweet tales were woven together in a pleasant way i enjoyed how the story took place over a day","713":"i love a good 60% of this book some of the characters are truly engaging and some fall a little flat some flit in and out in a way that isn't entirely necessary the narrative structure is a little too college creative writing workshop for me too cutesy there is a lot of metaphor in here maybe a little heavy handed but some are quite lovely","714":"3 5 stars because i 30% hated it and 70% loved it the writing is rich and dense every word and every sentence imagery packed but there a few scenes that should have been left on the cutting room floor which knocked the whole endeavor out of whack gave it a bitter after taste even though the resolution of all the characters story lines ties up nicely","715":"this book almost lost me at first i just couldn't get into the different storylines and the omniscient point of view felt kind of obnoxious after i let my ego go and stopped trying to predict where the story was going because i was sure i knew exactly what was going to happen next i found myself falling in love with the characters the plot the city 2 a m at the cat's pajamas is not for readers that take themselves too seriously but it is for bookish folk that can allow themselves to be pushed pulled dragged along through a magical tale of a day and a night in the life a motherless girl a teacher a run down nightclub a dog i needed to read this and i am so glad i did","716":" madeleine altimari is a precocious young girl who aspires to be a jazz singer inspired by her late mother who was also a performer the death of her mother is still fresh and her father is still coming to terms with it himself sarina greene is madeleine's teacher fresh off a divorce and preparing to attend a dinner with her old high school circle of friends including her former crush and prom date and the owner of the cat's pajamas lorca recently broke up with his girlfriend is struggling to keep a connection with his son and has just learned he may be forced to close down his club forever the lives of these three people and a large cast of supporting characters intertwine in some very unexpected ways during the span of 24 hours on the day before christmas eve madeleine searches for the place where her voice can be heard sarina is wrestling with whether to reignite an old flame and lorca wants stability and opportunity for his son will any of them be able to find what they are looking for this story is broken down into timestamped snippets that jump around from character to character it's an interesting method of storytelling but i did find it to be confusing at times to know what was going on there are flashbacks thrown in that aren't clearly indicated as well the side characters definitely add to the story but the few scenes that solely focus on them with no connection back to one of the main characters also left me a bit puzzled at times overall i did find this book to be engaging and entertaining but part of me was left scratching my head at the end to really understand the point of it all perhaps that's what happens with a day in the life slice of life novel i ended up giving this three stars because of quality of the overall story balanced with the less than stellar execution disclaimer i received a copy of this book via blogging for books in exchange for an honest review","717":"damn near perfect the prose and characters are sharp and flawed in equal measures","718":"i'm not a big jazz fan but just loved the story behind this book and have discovered some great nina simone songs","719":"i was almost sure i'd never get into it i eventually did and was bewildered to find out i'd have to bail if you're looking for clean reading don't look here i could tolerate a bit of fowl language for only so long spoilers around pg 170 ish lorca starts flirting with a young woman in a bowling alley then it describes lorca's friend interacting with a woman in a very provocative way and barbra is trying to get intimate with him young adult book pffft no and no thanks the plot is intricate and the writing style is interesting but none of that makes it better the bad outweighs the good and it's really not worth my time","720":"gave up after 80 pages just couldn't get into the story","721":"i received this book for free for review through blogging for books why you might bump this down on your tbr it did not engage me there seems to be a lack of connection between the reader and the characters and plot i felt like i wouldn't be missing out on anything if i put the book down why you might bump this up on your tbr the characters and events are interesting and likable","722":"this is a cute tale with a lot of protagonists who are all connected in some way my favorite is almost ten year old madeleine whose father has never recovered from his wife's death so madeleine pretty much has to raise herself in downtown philadelphia she has help from a neighbor mrs santiago who keeps losing her dog and her teacher miss greene who carries a flame for the guy who took her to her senior prom many years ago and ignored her madeleine has a beautiful singing voice but no one ever gives her the chance to use it all the characters' lives intersect on the day before christmas eve and we follow them hour by hour in a nifty construct that culminates in madeleine finally getting to sing at the cat's pajamas on the night that it is shut down by police confused there are too many stories to mention in a review but you'll be amused and entertained by the deft way bertino handles them all recommended","723":"this story covers an epic day in the lives of a variety of philadelphians particularly 9 almost 10 year old madeline all madeline wants to do is sing but circumstances conspire to keep her from doing it because strange things happen when she sings strange and wonderful things the story is a twisty fever dream of multiple characters whose lives intersect around philadelphia and at the #2 jazz club in the city the cat's pajamas the story takes unexpected turns and is written beautifully","724":"ok but wanted more from the ending","725":"quick read enjoyable time frame felt off as though reading a story about the early to mid 60s then sudden references to recent events popping up would recommend but only to certain people","726":" i was provided a free copy of this novel by the publisher random house any opinions expressed herein are mine this book is excellent this book is jazz music in words on paper this book is the big city the hidden world tourists won't ever see the beautiful hidden places between the cracks and behind the cockroaches this book is the small town within the big city it is the intertwining of all the stories of people who don't even know they've had roles in the lives of the people around them this book is unassumingly highbrow and pretentious while pretending to be scummy and low born the story is often ugly but the telling is just beautiful not everyone will like this book though not everyone will understand this book not everyone will be able to feel the undercurrent of hope and freedom and jazz beneath the melody of this book","727":"3 stars is an underrating should be 3 1 2 but it's not a 4 bright crisp writing intelligent and nuanced character development too much of a happy ending that is evident from the beginning and avoids real conflict","728":"after reading a couple of good but not great novels i was really looking for one that upped the satisfaction level again this one did the trick nicely sweet without being saccharine romantic without being unrealistic and hopeful in a way that stays with you when you're done very nice","729":" really hard to read if you have any clue on philadelphia geography because it is incredibly off i know it's fiction but if you set a book somewhere somewhere you used to live take a trip or get out a map because the people who live here are going to notice i wanted to like this book so much i actually bought it it started out great and then just lost it i liked the magical realism parts but the realistic parts were too hard to believe these strong interesting characters turn to mush halfway through the book and it becomes really hard to follow if you want a book to take place all in one day it's really hard to go back 20 years in time i don't think i would recommend this book and i am pretty bummed i didn't get it from the library","730":"the subject of this book appealed to me greatly but a few things kept the story from being a favorite the cast of characters was large including a 5th grade singer and her sympathetic teacher her principal the musicians and owners of a jazz club two sex scenes seemed interjected unnecessarily to me and marred the sweet light tone of the novel there was a little magic realism which should have been dropped or expanded","731":"i gave this book a second try after talking to someone who loved it i got further this time thanks to the charm of madeleine the 9 year old aspiring jazz singer but bailed again about a third of the way through the author has a nice way with metaphors mostly but piles them on way way too thick too much of a good thing makes a very bad thing","732":"lovely and magical i really liked the shifting perspectives and the quick changes between these perspectives","733":"i love that the book outright tells you there's nothing to like about the little girl i also loved the interwoven stories and how they connected in the end i did not so much love the ambiguous end although i didn't hate it either but what is lorca gonna do","734":"i can't say that i liked this book but surprisingly it does have a happy ending there are lots of sad characters lots of adjectives and it ends with hope the writing style annoyed me at times and chops and changes throughout the book i almost put it down unfinished but had to find out what happens to madeleine","735":"this was not what i expected when i read the first paragraph i loved the gradations of personality in the characters no one was completely good or completely awful but very capable of being both i highly recommend this book","736":"as many have said i had very mixed feelings about this book i loved the style the prose and the interesting characters the way it wove seemingly disparate threads together as it built up to a common end that is where it lost me though it just didn't come together somehow it felt like it built up so beautifully then just sort of gave out some books build up but intentionally leave things open or unanswered this didn't fell that way it ended and it simply felt like a letdown after the brilliant story leading up to the final coming together so on the one hand beautifully done most of the book and i loved the characters but the end was such a letdown i finished it sort of confused about which feeling was stronger","737":"i enjoyed this book very much the character building the interwoven characters the only detractor for me was the group of scenes that felt similar to the car flying off into the sky at the end of grease too much fantasy for an otherwise real book","738":"this is one of those books that i might have to go back and read closer to pick up things i have missed it followed several characters in the course of a day night and how all their lives connect quick read and interesting story i am still not sure about one part of the ending but i liked the book overall","739":"this book is cute it's the story of three people and how their lives intertwine at a bar called the cat's pajamas it's about love hope loss and music i enjoyed it i didn't love it but it is a satisfying read","740":"not a big fan long and nothing happened audiobook","741":"i won this book through one of the giveaways it had one strike against it going in i have an aversion to cutesy titles and in my opinion 2 a m at the cat's pajamas qualifies as cutesy i'm glad i overcame my prejudice and gave this book a chance it is a quick and enjoyable read","742":" it took me a while to get into this novel but once i did i really liked it i found the constantly changing point of view a bit baffling at first and had a hard time keeping the characters straight as the author flitted from one to the next in her very short chapters this all cleared up with a bit of perseverance and the technique worked well in the end the novel was well written light and sweet but not frivolous in the included conversation with the author marie helene bertino describes her novel as a simple story in working class middle distance where life resides with some everyday magic the story encompasses a single day in the ordinary lives of some very unique characters the characters were the meat of the story and there was just enough of that everyday magic to allow them to step outside their rather ordinary lives for this quite extraordinary day i particularly liked the way this novel ended not too neatly wrapped up but satisfying nonetheless and leaving the reader pondering the futures of her characters i have a fondness for precocious and intelligent heroines so especially enjoyed madeleine and am convinced that she went on to fill her life with success happiness and of course music the author's love of music and the city of philadelphia shine throughout the story i love the included playlist at the end i received this book for free through goodreads giveaways","743":"so good it shares much in common with the movie love actually but this book is way better also similar to one of my favorite books of the year lucky us though i preferred lucky us the good parts of this book are exquisite really something but there are parts that felt awkward and unpleasant particularly some of the dialogue between sarina and her friends still the book as a whole was a joy to read","744":"i loved this book","745":" this is a wonderfully funny charming little book that is both heartbreaking and uplifting reminiscent of little known but fantastic books like makkai's the borrower or whitehouse's the mobile library and the better known but oddly lesser where did you go bernadette the story centers around the tragically orphaned precocious madeline and the oft bumbling but well intentioned adults in her orbit the author clearly intends for us to root emphatically for madeline and we do but spares us the cutesiness and irritating drivel often employed with child protagonists she pulls no punches as to who madeline truly is but compels us to love her anyway madeline had no friends not because she contains a tender grace that fifth graders detect and loathe not because she has a natural ability that points her starward madeline has no friends because she is a jerk the adults in the novel get an equally honest treatment and as with madeline we adore them in spite of or maybe more so because of their flaws and the writing whip smart and at once comically staccato and wrenchingly beautiful reviews and the dust jacket synopsis don't do this singularly unique and lovable book justice","746":"a charming book that tells the tale of madeleine who has just lost her mother bust has been left with a box full of cards that teach her all the things her mother couldn't like how to make a fist how to change a flat and most importantly how to sing i love how this book takes place during one day with chapter titles being the time so you know it's the run up to whatever happens at 2 a m and how you are introduced to lots of different characters who are very interconnected and all end up at the cat's pajamas and can i just say what an awesome name for a jazz club that is hats off to bertino a lovely fun quick read but i am still left confused by some aspects of it especially the ending which i will have to discuss with others once they have finished in order to make sense of it although this would make it a great book club read i would recommend this to anyone as it's one of those books with a character for everyone to identify with and a mood that will capture the hearts of all","747":" i bought this one this past weekend to read while i was on vacation and i have to say it was a pretty good choice for such an occasion the story was fast paced and kept me interested with all of the different characters and what they were doing throughout the one day that comprises the entire book i finished it on this monday in which i of course had the 'back to the real world after a vacation' blues and i think it just might have pushed me over the edge to a place where i'm okay again back to the real world","748":"four stars even after the odd addition of magic realism at the end","749":" a cast of lively enigmatic eccentric and loveable philadelphia residents revolve around the central personality madeleine altimari who is a smart precocious aspiring jazz club singer and nine years old set over one day christmas eve eve madeline has the most extraordinary day of her short

and all those twinkling stars delish right lucky me i won a copy from shelf awareness this is one little gem you do not want to miss my sweet peas author marie helene bertino who up until now has been known for winning the iowa short fiction award and editing instructing one story is about to explode on the book scene let me share something before we enter the utterly uniquely fantastical world of miss bertino one of three main characters in the kitty's pjs is a nine year old little girl madeleine altimari who believes her calling in life is to be like her mother a jazz singer \"whose voice could redirect the mood of a room \" so like her late mother she sings to blossom dearie albums every morning i don't know if you know but blossom is a real singer and my favorite you should check out

grand but he's not ready to give up until they drag him away kicking and screaming these three stories intertwine over the course of twenty hours with a full back up cast of quirky characters that only add layers of richness to the heart and soul of miss bertino's unique world we enter into while reading \"2a m at the cats pajamas \" it's a mystical whimsical world where reading bertino's prose is getting caught up in blossom dearie's beautiful scats during her early 60's paris years i can dig that babe i loved that the characters are damaged and vulnerable this novel may not be for everyone but if you're looking for something different written well that delivers beyond expectations i highly recommend \"2a m at the cat's pajamas \"","751":" originally posted on my blog a lovely bookshelf on the wall 2 a m at the cat's pajamas is a day in the life of three characters in philadelphia madeleine a 9 year old aspiring singer who is mourning her mother's death her fifth grade teacher sarina recently divorced and back in town hoping to reconnect with people from her past and lorca owner of the cat's pajamas a legendary jazz club in danger of closing madeleine's story is what kept me reading she's got a lot of spunk a lot of grit her father is so crippled with grief that he is barely able to function she endures rejection at school from both her classmates and her principal yet she pushes ahead determined to find the cat's pajamas and make her debut you can't help but fall in love with this kid bertino's writing is absolutely ravishing just breathtaking there are times when the rhythm of her words is downright musical as smooth as listening to john coltrane however i found myself wanting more of a focus on madeleine i liked how the three characters came together but that wasn't enough madeleine's story was so compelling it made me wish sarina and lorca were minor characters instead unfortunately they didn't hold my interest i went into 2 a m at the cat's pajamas with high expectations but i felt it lacked some of the elements that captivated me in bertino's collection of short stories safe as houses which i read last year there aren't as many strange fantastical moments in this debut novel it is much more subdued so when something extraordinary occurs at the end something that normally would have me holding my breath in awe it didn't feel all that magical it just felt out of place huge letdown although this fell flat for me the things that worked i loved i anticipate feeling just as enthusiastic about bertino's future works as i was for this one 2 1 2 stars i received a copy of this book from the publisher via edelweiss in exchange for my honest review","752":" this is a surprising day before the day before christmas story that is not about christmas the action takes places on christmas eve eve in a pocket of philadelphia and brings together a strange group of people all looking for love and flight i have to say again that it is an unusual book but i liked it the style seemed choppy to me initially and some sentences never made it beyond phrases then it struck me jazz not just a theme in the story the writing seems to mimic jazz structure through the use of phrases alternate voices and the coming together at the end i am interested to see what else this author writes","753":" a day in the life of a community really though the story concentrates on 3 people there are so many more featured that keeping track can be a bit of a jumble this reads like a jazz piece a riff here a solo there a path followed then reversed and like the music some parts work and others do not and like jazz it all comes together in the end my favorite character was young madeleine who like flavia de luce could easily carry a whole book by herself the slight use of magical realism with her singing detracted from her and the story perhaps distraction would be better term an unnecessary distraction lorca and his son sabrina and her life the man with the pit bull puppy all the characters with big parts and small and seen from multiple angles all added depth and color to the story i suppose some confusion is just a normal part of life and jazz kindle galley via netgalley","754":"this was such an enjoyable read i loved the way it was written and how all the stories came together the main character madeleine is wonderful","755":"an interesting quick read that kept me turning the pages","756":" it's christmas eve eve and the story starts at \"dark dark seven a m \" over the next 24 hours \"2 a m at the cat's pajamas\" by marie helene bertino intertwining characters will converge on the eponymous jazz club what makes this novel so thoroughly enjoyable is the utterly beguiling cast of characters and the wonderfully witty and smart writing in a cozy neighborhood of philadelphia we meet almost ten year old madeleine altimari a smoker a singer and a sailor level curser who has recently lost her mother to cancer and her father to extreme grief madeleine has no friends because she's \"a jerk\" but she's no bully she idolizes her teacher sarina greene who is recently divorced and has returned somewhat defeated to philly her home town and then there is lorca jazz aficionado and owner of the cat's pajama's jazz club now under threat of being closed down by the city bertino's writing is simply sublime she writes prose like a poet and several times i had to stop to savor her descriptions \"a catastrophe of a hallway\" a \"mutinous dress\" floors that cling to their stains if i was allowed half stars i'd be giving this novel 4 5 only deducting the half for the very ending which i didn't feel matched the rest of the novel but it's not a huge detraction in what is otherwise a great read","757":"parts of this book were brilliant with succinct chapters and great character development an interesting melding of three individual stories that intersect throughout the book i would happily give it a higher rating if the author would take out the unnecessary foul language and graphic sexual references and fix several typos found throughout the text","758":"i liked the book it got better as i got further along in it however i think the ending was rushed and bizarre","759":"loved it 4 5 stars rounded up to 5 i liked the way the author structured this story really worked for me i always a like a child protagonist and loved madeleine plus dogs","760":"whimsical and lovely","761":"i almost gave up half way through 2 am at the cat's pajamas but decided to go on and finish because it was a short book now that i'm finished i wish i had given up on it the story is pointless and the ending is just plain weird the book is organized by times from 7 am on the eve of christmas eve and the three plotlines climax at 2 am the next morning then limp along to 6 30 am and the weird ending there are three main characters in this book 10 year old half orphan madelaine who wants to be a jazz singer her recently divorced fifth grade teacher sarina and lorca who is struggling to hold onto his philadelphia jazz club the cat's pajamas there are other random characters thrown in the mix for no apparent reason madelaine learns of the existence of the cat's pajamas and dreams of singing on stage there sarina is thrown together with an old classmate who was her disastrous prom date lorca needs to come up with $30 000 to keep his club open at times i enjoyed the author's unique writing voice which was often poetic in a stream of conscience sort of way at other times though i just wished she'd get on with the story","762":" i can't do this i'm sorry i tried i really did but there comes a point where you have to sacrifice your completion code for the sake of your own sanity the writing style was interesting and fresh at first but after a few chapters it became monotonous when i say monotonous i mean ferris bueller's econ teacher sounded like morgan freeman compared to this stuff when it gets to the point where you read to get to the next chapter and get this one over with instead of for the story ya know there's a problem and you need to get the heck outta dodge plus the language started getting a little too vulgar for me to handle and i had to call it quits i wanted to like this book i really did but reality is a real kick in the pants sometimes","763":"sweet story but a little anticlimactic","764":"it was a half way decent story but it's very wordy almost pretentious and the reader of the audiobook was awful she seriously needs a new job","765":"madeleine altimari a foul mouthed 9 year old whose mother died last year all this kid wants to do is sing * sarina greene madeleine's 5th grade teacher she moved back to philly after her divorce and has just run into her old flame ben and* lorca the owner of the cat's pajamas a jazz club unless he can come up with thirty grand his club will close forever all t i really wanted to love this novel but i didn't in a nutshell there are three stories being told and three main characters *tmadeleine altimari a foul mouthed 9 year old whose mother died last year all this kid wants to do is sing *tsarina greene madeleine's 5th grade teacher she moved back to philly after her divorce and has just run into her old flame ben and*tlorca the owner of the cat's pajamas a jazz club unless he can come up with thirty grand his club will close forever all three characters and their storylines converge at 2 a m at the cat's pajamas i loved madeleine and sarina but just could not get into lorca and his jazz club boring madeleine and sarina are charming and sympathetic characters but they're not the whole story unfortunately perhaps both characters would be better served in a collection of short stories","766":" a young girl dreaming about signing a young teacher trying to find love and a club owner who is hoping to keep his family business open through many hurdles all three of these characters get the chance to share their own story and this book takes place all in one day with the time ticking through the book not my favorite book with a whole heck of a lot of quirky characters and not one really grabbed me in one way or another this book just kind of fell flat for me if you are a fan of of books filled with quirk then this one may be more up your alley than it was mine","767":" precocious nine year old madeline wants to be a jazz singer as she mourns the recent death of her mother she doesn't realize that this christmas eve is going to be the most interesting day and night of her life she plans on making her stage debut at philly's famous jazz club the cat's pajamas meanwhile madeline's teacher is hoping to hit it off with an old high school crush at a dinner party and the owner of the cat's pajamas realizes he may lose the club unless someone can raise the money required to save it i enjoyed 2 a m at the cat's pajama's by marie helene bertino the very spirited madeline is easily my favorite character out of the entire group her taste in music is absolutely fantastic i can definitely say that for a fifth grader she has a fully functioning personality i liked reading from the other's perspectives but madeline definitely stole the show after having finished the story i can honestly say i probably would have liked it more if the story didn't alternate between leads and stuck primarily with madeline as much as i liked madeline and the music this book never really grabbed me and held on tight the first thing right off that bat that threw me about the story i had it in mind that this was going to be set in somewhere between the 1920s and pre wwii that theory seemed to make sense while reading until one character let her cell phone ring through to voicemail that shattered my illusion about the setting right there as i realized it's set in our present i had to completely rework the character design and sound in my head personally i would love to see this set somewhere in that time period especially with a character like our young jazz loving madeline at the helm it was also difficult for me to keep track of the extended cast especially in the club owner's part of the story by the time i was able to put name to faces i was just starting to realize how interconnected their stories turn out to be i usually enjoy such interconnectedness but i don't think i was invested in the other characters as much as i was with madeline i can also usually appreciate some good magical realism but it's use here just felt misplaced especially when i read that ending overall it's a charming and intelligently written book featuring a passionate and wise beyond her years aspiring jazz singer but at times it felt cramped with too many cast members to care for and just a little out of place and time","768":"i listened to the audio version of this if i could start fresh i would opt for the book instead there was something about the audio version that was hard to follow however because this book got really good reviews from those i trust i plan to give it a go in print in the future","769":"i listened to this one as an audio book and i believe that really increased my enjoyment of the book up until the end i was debating whether i considered this one worthy of four stars or not the abruptness of the ending is what finally made the difference to me i thought the author i think the author did well in creating the setting i could almost feel the crisp chill i the philadelphia winter air and smell the sour stale beer at the cat's pajamas the character development was uneven and parts of the plot were unnecessary and superfluous the writing style and how past present and speculative future were woven together to create a complete picture was probably the strongest element of the novel the novel captured simultaneously both a day in the life and a life in one day","770":"this was the perfect last read of the year it was quirky which i don't always like but this was just perfect i can't stop smiling when i think about it","771":"its good but there is so many characters it was hard to keep track","772":"freakin' awesome i wish it never ended reminds me so much of my catholic school childhood","773":"this book wasn't as bad as the 2 rating implies it's just i feel i'd be being unfair to books i rated 3 that i liked a lot more if i gave it 3 stars that sounds nuts i need to be less emotionally invested in these ratings it's a fine book it's my kind of book it just didn't do it for me","774":"this had some charm but boy the author was just so intent on dazzling us with her metaphors and verbage someone kept wagging across a room while dancing more than once that it completely took away from the main story stories for me i did like the wrap up when all the characters wound up in one place but i must have missed something at the end that everyone else comments on but at this point i don't really care enough to re read the ending","775":"i was on the fence with this book because i didn't know what to make of it until someone described it as an urban fairytale then everything clicked for me a realistic tale with a bit of magic great book club book it is a book you want someone else to read so you can discuss it great writing the author describes emotions almost perfectly","776":"super charming and fun read enjoyable and recommended for a palette cleanser i really loved it but can't explain why i can't give it 4 stars maybe i'm just a snob but if you are looking for a light well written read totally pick this one up","777":"was the author trying to mimic the rhythm of jazz in her writing i like the setting and the characters but like good jazz it needed more time and attention to explore the notes","778":" the novel's style dips into the impressionistic occasionally using poetic license with grammar and word choice not being much of a poetry reader i found it somewhat distracting and was thrown out of the narrative now and then at the same time some of the riffs are dazzling in all the novel works despite the impressionism and the occasional sudden flights into magic realism the structure of the narrative is marked by the time throughout the day beginning at 7 00 a m on christmas eve eve through 7 00 a m on christmas eve the pace moves quickly as we witness the simultaneous events of the day for each of the main characters the characters are an interesting bunch full of surprises madeleine the protagonist is an ornery sometimes cruel nine year old who has the soul and talent of a jazz singer from within the uptight principal randles emerges a hungry passion a caring school teacher sarina greene carries a wound that causes her to lash out as she steps cautiously toward redeeming love lorca the club owner patron and father is so consumed with his nightclub that he's had little time for his son but is starting to notice him alex's shape comes into focus as if lorca's eyes have taken sixteen years to adjust to new light the setting -- the city of philadelphia and the jazz club of the title the cat's pajamas -- are almost characters in their own right and reflect the struggles of the characters philadelphia rundown and hopeful is described in bertino's impressionistic manner the unrequited city dreams up conspiracies and keeps its buildings low to the ground one of bertino's strengths is in describing music and the feelings of the musicians and their audiences the descriptions make you feel as if you're in a plane taxiing on the runway building up power until the soaring takeoff max is the lead singer in the club's band max howls gargles tri notes making everyone in the audience feel they are on something windmills thrusts beads of sweat on...his cheeks... max could reason with the archangel on judgment day...he stays drunk scared of the part of himself that is able to blow his mind so far out if he ever got sober he'd be...no better than the bums in the square playing chess with the pigeons telling them he used to be a jazz great and the pigeons would say the hell you were max checkmate alex is the son of lorca the owner of the jazz club alex has been secretly taking guitar lessons though his father has forbidden him to do so when alex finally gets to play in the club \"alex chases after a few notes...the people at the front tables stop talking he takes a run picks at a particular line threads it yes he says because he likes it holds it noses it asks it if it has anything more lets it go \"the thoughts of the characters often move back in time to fill in backstory as we move through their stories we come to know and empathize with them and hope everything is going to be fine for them and most of the characters do get at least their immediate wishes for the day except for lorca as the end approaches the troubles at the cat's pajamas seem to multiply rather than resolve yet lorca begins to realize that an alternate outcome for the jazz club might be okay even more than okay when lorca finally hears his son play lorca guesses where his son will leap and is wrong every time can't catch me alex's tempos seem to say before leaping in wild directions an urge cracks beneath lorca's breastplate he wants to be softer with alex encourage this tender talent this is how it must feel to be a good father but then the urge is replaced by helplessness the amount of energy it would take to reverse the father he already has going would be too much i won't spoil the ending but it is \"earned\" and it feels right i recommend this novel -- it is a creative inventive energetic satisfying read","779":"i've had this book for a year the whole year this little gem has been sitting right there on the shelf a year i've been missing out everything about this book sparkles this book is made out of charm it is brilliant and perfect and i will read it again and again","780":"though it took me awhile to finish this i loved it this story was unlike anything i had ever read before and the writing was really beautiful some of the individual stories in this book weren't as interesting to me but i still enjoyed the writing","781":" in the beginning i was not quite sure about this book with a foul mouthed nine year old as the protagonist however soon i started rooting for the precocious madeline and read non stop the book takes place in philadelphia during a day and night 2 days before christmas and a lot happens during that period to this quirky and quacky cast of characters i would have liked to have met madeline's mother i had only two issues with the book which caused me to lower the rating from a 4 to 3 star rating there were times when i had to re read certain passages to understand the meaning as the sentence structure threw me a curve ball now and then secondly the book 's ending switched almost completely into a different direction of magical realism or fantastical realism out of nowhere but hey it was christmas eve and anything can happen on that special night if on any night right i would recommend it to my friends however be aware that it is more circular than linear in its telling we carry our ancestors in our names and sometimes we carry our ancestors through the sliding doors of the emergency rooms and either way they are heavy either way we can't escape","782":" this book reads like poetry the language is musical and full of imagery the way the author weaves magic into the ordinary is beautiful it's a little bit like an adult james and the giant peach or tar beach for me the strength of this book lies more in the imagery than in the actual story although there is a lot to appreciate in that as well the way marie helene bertino makes you experience each moment with all your senses it makes you slow down makes some of these scenes feel more real than real life we never slow down enough to notice so much","783":"i am undecided about how many stars to award this book 3 or 4 a little humor a little drama and a little romance with some quirkiness mixed in makes for a good read but i was a little thrown off by the very bizarre ending i had to go back and read it again since i thought i missed something the first time around i really did enjoy the unique story and kooky characters in another review someone described the story as an 'urban fairy tale' which i thought was kinda cute","784":"enjoyable relatable simple while this is yet another debut novel that has an assortment of characters whose lives intersect the nine year old aspiring jazz singer steals the show and paves the way in a novel about the bits and pieces of daily life","785":" this novel is about a day in the life of several different characters whose lives intersect in one way or another before meeting up at 2 a m at the cats pajamas a night club on the brink of extinction due to several code violations motherless madeline a 9 year old wannabe jazz singer her teacher sarina greene divorced and lonely and jack lorca the failed owner of the cat's pajamas are all bruised and battered souls hoping for life to get better eventually casting aside their fears misconceptions and resentments to accept these changes bertino's unique style makes this debut novel an engaging read","786":"sometimes slow going and i think i would've enjoyed it more if the story had focused on madeline the 9year old diva who had to sing no matter the odds i still loved many of the characters it was quite funny and clever in parts and it certainly made me come away with yet another renewed appreciation for jazz","787":"completely fun charming lovely story the setting and characters are vivid and enjoyable to read about thoroughly enjoyed the unique voice and i would definitely recommend this great read to finish out my 2015","788":"almost every line was fun to read i didn't enjoy the story line about the men in the jazz club until the end but i know if i read it again i'll feel differently i wish there had been more planning on reading again next christmastime","789":"some fun writing i chuckled a lot the bit of magic at the end ruined it for me maybe","790":"i really enjoyed the rhythm and textures of this book some of the characters were more interesting than others and there were a few clunky moments when the style suddenly changed but like an improvised jazz solo it happens the little girl was definitely my favorite character","791":"light and entertaining an interlocking people stories novel that doesn't force the overlaps some of which are major others are small but charming","792":" i wanted to love this book not just because it seemed like a cast of good characters but mainly because it takes place in my favorite city philadelphia and zeroes in on my former neighborhood bella vista the characters were ok i thought it was difficult to follow their development sometimes because the story jumped around haphazardly the biggest disappointment was the awful misrepresentation of bella vista and philly how can you see the el from the 9th st market or christian street near the market since when do fountains have running water at christmas time what is the 2nd st bridge yes philadelphia can be a plausible character in a novel like this just be true to the city it has a lot of character and can hold its own","793":" very mixed feelings i expected more while i liked madeline she was in speech and thought way way past what any 9 year old would do so sort of unbelievable her living situation was plain and simple child neglect also sort of out there there were a ton of random border of the story characters like the musicians in the club that for me were not germane to the plot and were confusing to follow i kept confusing sonny with max enjoyed the interconnected stories and the writing was snappy but it just did not capture me it was better than ok but probably not something i would recommend","794":"i loved everything about it but the ending","795":"this review has been hidden because it contains spoilers to view it click here i initially was uncertain about this book however the rhythm of the prose eventually won me over while a light and enjoyable read it managed to touch on the troubles hopes and joys of the human condition i adore the madeline character in fact most of the characters were remarkably fleshed out although the focus of the book is not exactly on any particular one a great read","796":"a lovely follow up to being mortal by atul gawande a friend passed it over on her library check out rather reluctantly i had trouble getting into it at first such hopping skipping jumping but as it slowed and settled on certain characters i became charmed after charmed came delighted it's not straightforward prose at all but as a certain momentum builds in a very long day it became altogether wonderful the interaction between two characters in particular is a love story as understated and yet romantic as anything you'll read","797":"this book was fairly well written with a few interesting characters the trouble was that there were a lot of uninteresting characters who took up a bunch of the story and were difficult to keep track of they were the ones who ultimately ruined this book for me i really wanted to like this book but just couldn't i'm moving on to something else sorry cat's pajamas","798":" \"do what scares you bring a scarf \"before i say anything i want you to know that i loved marie helene bertino's short story collection safe as houses evidence here 2 a m at the cat's pajamas by marie helen bertinosome authors should stick to short stories i can't say yet that this is the case with helene bertino because she's only now written one novel however it really was a novel of a bunch of stories titled 2 a m at the cat's pajamas this novel is about lost and lonely people in philadelphia it's specifically about three characters madeline sarina and lorca madeleine is a young elementary school girl who's mother has passed and father is a bodily ghost that spends everyone else's waking hours in his bed next to his record player and open bottle sarina is madeleine's teacher who is divorced and not really looking for much but an end of evening ice cream and a little compassion lorca owns the legendary \"cat's pajamas\" jazz club where he and a posse live until a new cop takes over their street and issues a citation that could put them out of business although the main plot points are about these three characters there are full \"chapters\" dedicated to the thoughts of people who bump them on the street see them in a coffee shop or have memories deeply embedded with these characters \"gathers him in his name - jack francis lorca we carry our ancestors in our names and sometimes we carry our ancestors through the sliding doors of emergency rooms and either way they are heavy man either way we can't escape \"caramel apple for madeline @ joy creative commons it's both uplifting and upsetting the minor character chapters seek to show that these three main characters shouldn't be so lonely just drifting they have people that care or have cared for a very long time these characters are all exhausted and people in their lives are dropping not quite like flies more like pins silently and with too much meaning the \"chapters\" were also interesting because they went by time i was expecting it to end at 2 a m it didn't but it was nice to go through one full day with these characters watching them move almost literally through time \"but then her class will be making caramel apples madeleine has never had a caramel apple and she wants to taste one more than she wants god's love \"electric guitar @ wikipedia commonsi was really interested in madeleine's story because she was the youngest bitter book character that i've ever read she had no friends girls were scared of her baditude and all she wanted to do was sing a solo in the church service the reader gets the full brunt of a woman's death through this small girl it's actually quite a feat because i felt like her grief was real grief she was angry had obsessions and only wanted few sweet things but was never given them without a battle her principle has no empathy and her teacher worries without speaking \"madeleine has no friends not because she contains a tender grace that fifth graders detect and loathe not because she has a natural ability that points her star ward though she does madeleine has no friends because she is a jerk \"sarina her teacher is just a simple woman who has returned home after the death of her mother the reader finds out the story of her missing father later in the book and a poor prom experience this really is most of her story until a man enters the novel lorca owns the jazz club and takes care of the men within the main band of the club the cubanistas his girlfriend is practically done with him and his son is sullen wild but a gifted guitar player \"they are sixteen and skinny their collarbones vault in upsetting directions \"john coltrane @ jason hickey cdcovers john coltrane crescent jpg creative commons this is it really the book had helene bertino's signature language funky and beautiful like a good john coltrane song if you read for inventive and lovely language then read everything she's written as far as a story goes this whole thing just saddened me i finished left with the question \"so what \" i wasn't concerned that the people were out of hope i was just more concerned at the reason that i read the book i know these people in my everyday life they may not be from philadelphia but they are finding themselves living through it silent when the world needs them to talk and open when the world asks them to be closed if this story was meant to introduce me to grief or introduce me to sadness or acknowledge that everyone is fighting a hard battle then it did its job but i'm not sure that was enough the big finale was just odd honestly when i got to the end i knew the big finish was coming but it was some weird want to be magical realism people almost became who they always wanted to be or what they hated inside themselves came out it was all really strange it might be worth the read just for that clutter \"who cares which way is faster you can't say you know a city unless you know three ways to everywhere madeleine swings her legs over the edge of the roof i sang on a stage she is close enough to high five saint anthony but doesn't because no matter what kind of thrilling night you've had you do not bother saints this way \"for a reader who waited for her next book i was disappointed i'm not saying this is a bad book but it didn't have the closure i needed and it didn't say anything new like another reader on goodreads i think this novel could get a cult following i don't think it's introducing a new style to literature or that it's fresh or modern but it's a catchy song and it's beauty in the sadness i think a good multi character book makes you want to read each character not look towards a mouthy girl who walks a dog eats breakfast at the local cafe and tries not to take on second mothers in all the outstretched hands \"pedro is an open air pooch not prone to evenings at home his joints are nimble and his snout superb he spent the previous night following the scent of a bitch pink notes and hydrangea and dung \"","799":" i was looking for a good holiday read and this was it the tribulations of the nine year old girl reminded me of my mother's sad story so there were a lot of tears initially several story lines were masterfully weaved together outlining the events of the day before christmas eve the characters were developed well enough to keep me yearning for a sequel to each of their stories i feel i was transcended to the streets of philadelphia this was an impressive debut novel and i look forward to reading ms bertino's future works","800":"i thoroughly enjoyed this book it made me want to break out all my old billie holiday records u0026amp just sit back u0026amp enjoy them it has been a long time since a book made me feel so connected to music i swear i think i could almost hear madeleine singing i really did love this book it gave me a whole new desire to just say this is fucking bullshit every time life gets rough love it","801":"meh i was really prepared to like this book but just didn't i love precocious little girl characters and i found madeleine's drive to be a jazz singer entertaining and original i like the familiar philadelphia setting but i failed to really connect with either the characters or story","802":"cute story told in an interesting way and from multiple points of view didn't really carry my attention until i got about 3 4 of the way through it easy read","803":" quirky for sure and the strangest christmas story ever as we root for foul mouthed nine year old madeleine struggling with the lose of her adored mother dealing with her broken down father for whom she barely exists and expelled from school for having lice and fighting the only thing that keeps her going is her desire to sing in a jazz club like her mother but her story become entangled with so many other characters her teacher her principal every band member at the cat's pajamas jazz club people on the street that is hard to follow their many lives or even keep their names in mind while all achieve their dreams by 2 00 a m on christmas eve eve i think we are left with a birdman like ending that seems to have little to do with madeleine many choppy interesting narrative passages and a great dog but harder to follow and get into than an endless jazz piece","804":"interesting read and loved it highly recommend","805":"liked most of it--agree with many other reviewers in that the ending was rather underwhelming wish it focused exclusively on madeleine the passages that featured her were resplendent","806":"hey there you with the stars in your eyes this novel is a charming relatively short read although i enjoyed madeline sarina and ben once they are introduced it took a while to warm up to alex and lorca however i especially liked the end of each chapter how bertino added flare and meaning to seemingly simple style overall this book is worth your while with a wonderful plot and quirky characters","807":"i had high hopes for this one but i thought it was slow and the characters just weren't that interesting","808":" this book is for music lovers night owls romantics and everyone in between a tale of ups and downs real consequences and the satisfaction of being in the right place at the right time 2am at the cats pajamas is riveting and impossible to put down set in philadelphia the story follows madeline altimari a flamboyant 9 year old who dreams of being a jazz singer sarina greene madeline's newly divorced 5th grade teacher who's despairing over an unexpected meeting with a high school crush and lorca the owner of the cat's pajamas a once prosperous but soon to close jazz club with a bit of fate and a lot of risk the three stories of these unlikely characters intertwine at you guessed it 2am at the cat's pajamas marie helene bertino's quirky and memorable writing style is what pulls this fantastic tale of love loss and coincidence into one beautiful adventure please read this right now","809":"clever and poignant well done","810":"really hard for me to get into character development felt choppy but overall a good story","811":"audiobook note anglea goethals' narration is problematic i couldn't bear to grant even the single full hour i usually allot as a baseline every syllable is over punctuated and each sentence is delivered with try hard melodrama this book is by all reports quirky and syncopated in tone so the delivery may have been an intentional artistic choice but it doesn't work for this listener audiofile honored it with its earphones award high level review but it certainly didn't sing for me","812":"not my favorite writing style almost poem like but the way each character's stories overlapped was cool good quick read","813":"bertino's sentences are a delight on every page i'm not sure she set the ending up correctly as it pulled me out of the story but this book is worth it for bertino's inventive use of verbs and jazz as a structural device","814":"quick read cute story","815":"delightful loved the writing and the characters would love to read interpretations of the ending","816":"to be honest i was not a fan of this book the characters were not interesting and i did not care for the writing which to me was all over the place i got halfway through and just gave up","817":"charming","818":" somewhat gritty quirky poetic ode to the city of philadelphia would have rated higher if not for unexplained things people levitating the meaning behind that escapes me favorite bits bella is a girl who doesn't mean to be rude ever but is rude always character at a dinner trying to tell a sad story about a student sure she's back in her hometown teaching grade school and she can't fill out the tops of most dresses but she can tell stories goddammit certainly that must mean something to ben she means men she means the universe certainly she can cash in a little girl's pain for respect at a dinner party","819":" while the story all takes place in one day the book feels more like an entire season of a television show with multiple narratives that bounce around in time by the time the final moments of the book come the reader is left with a full hand of fleshed out characters and a web of intertwining tales that are simultaneously independent and reliant on each other the best part about this book is that the people it follows are at their core painfully imperfect they're adolescent miscreants with chips on their shoulders educators who hold grudges and dream of sex and musicians who've let their venue begin to slip from their fingers the role of music in this novel can't be ignored and just like the great jazz ballads and ditties that are constantly referenced this narrative doesn't follow traditional standards instead it sweeps and bounces around with a sort of a d d mentality until finally coming around later on to make even the strangest of threads imperative to the whole","820":"this quirky debut novel by marie helene bertino is just the right mix of despair and optimism set in downtown philadelphia the story unfolds the morning of christmas eve eve and follows the interconnected lives of three charming but flawed characters over the next 24 hours there's madeleine a smart mouthed and talented nine year old who recently lost her mother sarina her newly divorced fifth grade teacher and lorca the forlorn owner of the once legendary jazz club the cat's pajamas the events of the day gradually weave the characters closer together until they finally intersect during one unforgettable late night rendezvous at the city's #2 jazz club 2 a m at the cat's pajamas packs both heart and punches and is sure to delight readers and book clubs alike","821":"this was well written but i just couldn't relate with any of the characters maybe i just wasn't ready for such bleakness i wasn't in a mood to be dragged down and gave up","822":"enjoyable debut novel i loved the interwoven stories however while some of the writing was beautiful sometimes i had to read passages more than once in order for them to make sense","823":"the characters were interesting and i liked the way their stories all tied together with a notable place i wasn't too crazy about the gratuitous sex and four letter words though they seemed to cheapen the story and the characters would have seemed just as real without them","824":"\"if you are anything other than humbled in the presence of love you are not in the presence of love \" i thoroughly enjoyed the plot and found the characters well crafted and interesting particularly the nine year old madeleine altimari her dream to sing in front of a large crowd was inspiring and her backstory was incredibly sad at times i found the writing to be rather erratic and confusing almost as if the author was unsure just what writing style she wanted to ultimately choose this sometimes took away from my enjoyment of the overall plot i loved how this novel was a quick easy read and perfect for a day of relaxation over christmas break i look forward to reading more from bertino in the future 3 5 out of 5 stars","825":" review of the arc bertino does a great job of instantly drawing us in we are aware of the characters' different forms of despair and the bitter feeling of having something you love taken away from you for madeleine the precocious nine year old who steals the book it's her mother and the ability to remember her through singing for salina it's ben her high school love and the opportunity to have a different kind of life for lorca it's his wife louisa and the cat's pajamas club itself despite the despair there are little glimpses of sweetness an accurate representation of life the one problem i seemed to have was the omniscient narration though i understand why the author chose this way to tell the story it provides a connection between the characters without it being obvious however i almost wonder if alternating viewpoints wouldn't be better most readers who pick up this book will be smart enough to make the connections on their own still very well written looking forward to seeing how it does when it hits shelves","826":"just loved this book this book will stay in my memory for sometime and deserves a lot of attention from reading fraternity highly recommended","827":"won this from goodreads giveaway it was cute and i liked the intertwining stories but i've seen better examples of this genre","828":"$30 000 a

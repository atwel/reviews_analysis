really loved this book it's a very interesting story of family dynamics and the power of love u0026amp hate it's a live story a mystery and a drama the relationship between the sisters and their relationships with thomas is so multi layered and kept me riveted and i couldn't wait to finish and then hated to see it end","2":"this book is a must read for art lovers it is beautifully written and embarks on an unexpected journey of discovery i found myself very invested in all the characters but stephen was my favorite his quirky bold nature was right up my alley i found him to be absolutely precious in a little brother sort of way","3":"what a beautiful book it was kind of slow starting but toward the end i couldn't put it down the writing is superb and the story unique","4":" i was looking forward to reading this as i'd heard a bit about it while the story was interesting and the prose at times was well written even beautiful at times ultimately i was left somewhat dissatisfied this was one of those books that was interesting enough to not give up on and to keep reading to see where it was going yet not that interesting that i couldn't wait to get back to it largely for me i think the man problem was the characters even though they were all well drawn the problem was i didn't particularly like any of them thomas was the type of artist who has a natural genius but thinks of no one but himself and his art natalie was equally as selfish in her own way and alice didn't grab me either add to them finch and stephen who set out to try and do the bidding of thomas and find the two missing panels of the triptych and it makes for a lot of uninspiring characters i also got tired of what seems to be the current trend for telling stories in different periods of time unless exceptionally well done i'm really over this device i felt i was being pulled backwards and forwards like a marionette into the different time frames when i'd have rather have stayed with one the visual description of new mexico was beautiful ultimately it is a novel about choices and the consequences of those choices it did become more interesting towards the end maybe the big problem was the novel was not as good as i was anticipating but others may have different opinions it is however a debut novel so it will be interesting to see what comes next","5":"wow i finally finished this book my neighbor loved it and raved over how good it was i felt as though every time i'd pick it up to continue reading it was torture only towards the final 2 3 of the story did it really pull me into the story and make me not want to put the book down until i was finished","6":"a little bit of mystery wrapped in a heartwarming search for family didn't think after the first 50 pages that i would keep reading but by the end of 100 pages was glad i had","7":"this was an excellent read u0026amp i highly recommend it the book is hard to describe but i was totally absorbed","8":"i loved this novel so amazingly well done as it says it is her first novel the mysteries that unfold in this work can be likened to the mysteries one feels when looking at a fine painting including the one mentioned by a character that which is unseen as well as that which is seen as each part of the story is revealed you are more certain that the last layer has been displayed and then realize there is more yet to learn then truth comes in the end in such successive swipes that the reader is left quite dizzy the author is quite deft with her words the sweet drawl of his words floated toward her on a river of honey if she was braver she would have pulled him to her taken his words into her mouth swallowing them down like a balm for everything wrong in the world her own sadness swimming back to her reaching for her with needy grasping fingers don't miss this one","9":"i liked the book especially much of the writing specifically character dialogue one can really get a vibe of the personalities of the characters based on the way they 'spoke' reminded me a bit of the shell seekers good read","10":"what a phenomenal book it was very well written haunting and bittersweet","11":" this novel begins a bit slow i almost abandoned it the characters are intriguing so i continued for which i'm glad i did it picks up in the middle and becomes very engaging at the end it's a story of two sisters and the art world i learned a lot about art appraisal and portrait art forensics the story begins in the summer of 1963 at a family summer lake cabin two sisters one 14 alice and one 17 natalie meet an exotic neighbor thomas who is an up and coming artist alice is interested in ornithology and books while natalie is a conniving and manipulative teen both girls find thomas to be intriguing thomas persuades the family to sit for a formal portrait an event happens that summer that redefines the family's life through the story the reader finally learns of events that transpired which shaped the course of devastation there's many twists and turns and a couple of surprises it's a story of familial dedication and manipulation of deceit of love and kindness of compassion and forgiveness it's a shame it starts so slowly i like the idea of the story and loved the ending this is tracy guzemans's first novel not bad for a first novel","12":"i liked this book a lot and learned quite a bit about art world as a bonus the characters are deeply drawn highly original and not at all stereotypical most are flawed in some unpredictable way the nuanced story is skillfully constructed with more sensitivity than i'm used to finding in a novel the author is an acquaintance of my sister thanks for the reference kath","13":"i went into this book rather blindly what it's about is kind of hard to explain without giving things away but i'll give the gist without any spoilers it's about an artist and two sisters and his unclear relationship with them then it jumps forward in time he has become quite famous and reveals there is one painting nobody knows about there are two other panels and they are in the possession of these sisters he hasn't seen in decades he is quite destitute in his old age and commissions two fellows for specific reasons that are revealed later in the art community to track down the sisters so he can sell the whole thing in its entirety as they begin sleuthing they realize his motive differs from what they originally thought it becomes a bit of a mystery as pieces of lives are put together the book jumps backward and forward the more i read the harder it became to put it down bonus at one point the characters wind up in new mexico as a new mexican it was fun to see my home state described","14":"telling the story of alice and natalie kessler their relationship together and with artist thomas bayber the gravity of birds is a beautifully woven tale spanning several decades the descriptive writing is excellent as are the character depictions i could imagine thomas both as a struggling young artist and as the older more desperate man trying to repair events in his life by reuniting three parts of his artwork alice's character is warmly written and despite her difficulties in life with loss and illness she comes across as someone you would wish to know and befriend especially touching were the parts finch listened to advice from his deceased wife the artwork and the journey towards finding it is cleverly mixed in with events in the characters lives and i was intrigued to see how the story would end if when the paintings were found a lovely read with a nice twist at the end i received this book to review through goodreads","15":"the beginning of this novel is fantastic but as i read on my enthusiasm for the story waned it was a great read and i truly didn't see the little twist coming though i should have but i wanted this book to be more than it was due to it's strong start","16":"initially i had trouble getting into this one but once i figured out who everyone was i found this book hard to put down the story of a love triangle between 2 sisters and an artist jumps between the present and the past and i didn't like having to re read some of it to get it all straight about halfway though the story really came together and i was very satisfied with how it all turned out","17":"it is hard to like a book with such a repulsive main character but it's interesting anyway","18":"deeply engaging characters each with crippling flaws woven together through time and circumstance at times it read a little slowly but the descriptions of artwork were thorough and captivated my interest i loved the characters the only thing that left me dangling was the sisters' parents' house part of me kept hoping there was a deeper connection with the setting","19":"a debut novel that makes me want many more by this author well written full of secrets family and art","20":" i'm so disappointed with this book the reviews on amazon were excellent and the blurb on the back of the book made it appear that the gravity of birds would be my cup of tea but sadly i was wrong the novel started off very promising i warmed to the teenage alice immediately but the author decided to switch the narration to 2 other characters in the present time who weren't engaging at all and i simply didn't care about what was going on in their private lives adding to the disappointment i feel like i wasted more than a week of my life reading this book which failed to live up to my expectations on the plus side i've finally finished it and can now read something far more worthwhile to pass my precious free time","21":"this was a great read i kept thinking as i read it that this was the third book i've read this year along with tell the wolves i'm home and the goldfinch that made art a character unto itself out of the three this one would be the most forgettable but the story and characters were beautifully rendered and compelling i couldn't sleep and stayed up from 1 to 6 a m finishing the last 60% of it the story is unrealistic with lots of coincidences but i couldn't help but forgive that when i think of all the incredible true stories about life intertwining with works of art in the real world bottom line i'd recommend this to anyone who likes art or literary mysteries","22":"one of those books containing frustrating dialogue and you find yourself often thinking this just isn't how people talk in real life twists you don't see coming are thrown in at the right times to keep you hooked but some of them especially the last one are pretty cheesy that being said i read it in 6 hours because i could not put it down if you are interested in art you will find a lot to like but it's not necessary to appreciate the book very fast paced and addicting story glad i read it and would read more of hers this is her first and while sometimes it shows it's generally a really good read","23":"i loved this book","24":" this was kind of a mystery within a mystery a famous painter reveals that he still has a painting out there that nobody knows about but he himself does not know it's location an art history professor and an art authenticator are given the task to find this work of art during their search they uncover the story behind the painting which involves two sisters who the artist befriended many years before when they vacationed in neighboring cabins one summer the book goes back and forth between the search for the painting and what happened between the sisters and the artist i got totally caught up in the story between the sisters i thought it was well written maybe not fine literature but it took it beyond the soap opera feeling","25":"review coming soon on my blog","26":"this is a wonderful book that captured me from the first page it is so well written and the story is mesmerizing i loved it and hated to finish it because i wanted to stay inside the book","27":"i finished this about 8 days ago and can hardly remember a thing about it i guess that say's it all it had the components that i thought i would enjoy art birds minimal and sisters but it just didn't come together for me it felt very fragmented and i would find myself confused with all the switching back and forth between timelines and characters","28":"a page turner mystery about an artist and his two subjects who have disappeared very moving and the art stuff is fascinating","29":"at times slow moving and written with detailed descriptive passages which are not particularly to my liking and i am not convinced that any critic could look at a work of art and interpret as much as portrayed by the author however there were enough twists and turns to keep it interesting and the players in the story were plausible for me","30":"very good book it had some flaws but still a unique and very good read","31":"review first published on my blog http memoriesfrombooks blogspot com thomas bayber is a world renowned painter he has not painted for many many years and lives pretty much as a recluse dennis finch has spent his life studying thomas bayber and supporting him as an individual and as an artist he is the authority on thomas bayber's work and is shocked when bayber reveals the existence of an undocumented painting a painting that is part of a triptych that he now wants to sell the painting is of a young thomas bayber and two young ladies sisters alice and natalie kessler bayber has one piece of the painting the other two are supposedly with the two kessler sisters who seem to have vanished bayber charges dennis finch to find the other two panels of the paintings so that the three can be put up for sale and he engages stephen jameson an art expert to authenticate and sell the paintings the book is about finch and jameson's search for the paintings and the sisters the book weaves back and forth through time and characters alternating sections tell of the the search of the past relationships between bayber and the kessler sisters and of the life of the sisters what emerges is a tale more complicated and discoveries much different than what finch and jameson could ever have imagined this book reminded me a little of kate morton's books the emotional story the mystery the hint of things around the corner the book kept me reading the ending throws in a curve that i felt was unnecessary to the story but other than that this story pulls you in and keep you with it a beautiful debut i look forward to reading more by tracy cuzeman reviewed for goodreads first reads program","32":" i expected to love this the storyline sounds promising--thomas bayber a reclusive celebrated artist unveils a provocative work he had hidden away for four decades a portrait of himself and two sisters alice and natalie kessler who summered in a lake house near his family's vacation home but before he will agree to sell the painting bayber sends the art historian who catalogued his works and a brilliant young art authenticator off on a quest to find alice and natalie who seem to have disappeared unfortunately the gravity of birds never succeeded in coming off the page for me i simply couldn't get past my awareness of the writing to immerse myself in the world of the story the author's presence is evident in every sentence supplying oh so much detail and leaving little to the imagination occasionally we're treated to a perfectly beautiful phrase as a result but more often the prose feels stiff awkward melodramatic the dialogue frequently gets bogged down with flashbacks and characters' internal ruminations there are loads of adjectives and loads more adverbs where a sharp blue pencil could have really helped most of all i struggled with parts of the plot that felt contrived the art authenticator who is supposed to be pretty much a genius says and does some incredibly unlikely things--things that serve the plot but things i couldn't for one moment believe he would ever do but there's a wonderful passage where the author shows perfect restraint as alice recalls her own experience of a tragic event in our nation's history without ever naming the event we're simply given a couple of breadcrumbs the year the location and it's left to the reader to understand what event is being referred to sure i was proud of myself for figuring it out--and that's exactly what good writing does it makes the reader work a little bit it trusts the reader to fill in the blanks all said i still believe this book has a gem of a storyline but it's cloaked inside what feels like a very first novelish first novel received through a goodreads first reads giveaway","33":"literary mystery suspense love story psychological drama and just a great story perfect story told in different time periods","34":"i can't say i loved this book it was ok the plot is convoluted and i found the threading of periods distracting there were parts i enjoyed such as the details regarding authentication of art works or bird watcher's behavior the characters are not too endearing except for alice and phinneaus and of course the long lost daughter","35":"this is the kind of book that would be great for a long winter's read a curl up by the fire kind of book with interesting characters a bit of a mystery not criminal but a mystery of the heart and a plot that moves in more than one dimension upper new york state provides the setting for thomas bayber a brilliant young painter to come into the lives of two teenaged neighboring sisters affecting them both for the rest of their lives the structure and method by which the story is filled in provides for an intense page turner and the resolution is both satisfying and appropriate in almost present day thomas who has not created a painting for decades and has become world famous sets two men a task to locate the sisters who seemed to have fallen off the earth in 1972 as the book continues those two men take on an almost mutt and jeff quality providing moments of hilarity that lighten the proceedings","36":"i found this on scribd and really enjoyed it it's sad and full of complicated family mysteries that get unravelled","37":"i won this book on goodreads first reads giveaway i liked how this story had two setes of characters and was set over 44 years and very cleverly brought the two stories together in the last few chapters i really felt for the character alice throughout the book think there could of been more about thomas the artist but it did not spoil the book family jealousy","38":" why is it sometimes easier to write what you did not like about something versus what you did like like is hard to encompass sometimes it just is here are some of my fav reviews \"the gravity of birds is one of those rare exquisitely written novels that haunt you long after you've finished the last page guzeman writes of both the fragility of the human spirit and its inner strength the book unfurls like a hidden canvas soaked with color emotional longing and a desire to make sense of what is often too painful to be said without the assistance of art it is a novel not to be missed \"--alyson richman best selling author of the lost wife\"upon opening tracy guzeman's debut novel \"the gravity of birds \" readers are immediately drawn into the plot much like the paintings that the book describes it is the details that hold our attention the secrets we learn about the characters that make us care about them...it is only at the end when the puzzle is completed that we see all the pieces guzeman so cleverly layered into the story \"--the cleveland plain dealer\"tracy guzeman's the gravity of birds is part mystery part psychological drama and intriguing love story this is a stunning debut it's a brilliant tale written in evocative language and every page is pure seduction i want to scream from the rooftops read this book \"--ellen sussman author of the new york times bestseller french lessonsa lovely mesmerizing novel the gravity of birds combines the drama of warring sisters the mystery of a missing painting and the sorrow of lost love into a haunting elegy

you think about art \"--tiffany baker author of the little giant of aberdeen county and the gilly salt sisters\"riveting debut\"--good housekeeping","39":"an amazing first book the characters are well drawn could almost feel alice's pain interesting descriptions of different parts of us as a bonus twist at the end highly believable given the characters involved loved the descriptions of the art involved not too heavy but illuminating","40":"a 3 star rating sounds too harsh but i can't quite make myself commit to 4 stars so 3 5 it is the story was intriguing and engaging enough to make me want to keep reading until the end it was just that i was never really shocked enough by anything i would call them 'plot bends' instead of 'plot twists' it was extremely well written see above quote this is just one example and a good display on how a decision can change the course of a persons life but there was just something missing for me to consider this a great book rather than just a good book i found alice to be a bit of a bore i understand there was probably another side to her i e that she showed the children in scouts but you didn't really ever get to meet that side of alice only the whinging self pitying cripple side of alice it was a similar thing with natalie she was apparently so despicable and callous as a teenager and adult but you never really found out how much until the end you just had to trust the other characters opinion of her until then i loved how the story evolved through the different times and how it was entwined with art overall i enjoyed it but would not recommend for anyone who loves their thriller novels fast paced","41":"loved this book it wasn't so clear initially what the book was going to be about but once it got going i was hooked a beautiful story with one caveat i didn't understand why various people hadn't just hired a detective but this is easy to overlook","42":"lovely but a bit tedious at parts","43":"interesting structure and some beautiful writing review to come","44":"incredible a must read added to my favorite list when i was given this book from a friend she said the cover was kind of boring and unappealing i wholeheartedly agree the cover does nothing for this book i understand the desire to include it but wow what a fascinating read so many emotions come from this book a great mystery with art as it's basis but oh so much more than that bravo miss guzeman you have created a masterpiece","45":"i was thoroughly entertained and read this book on one sitting which is rare for me the writers ability to paint pictures with her words allowed me to so clearly visualize the paintings in the novel","46":"i chose this audiobook for two reasons 1 i think the narrator cassandra campbell is amazing and 2 i wanted to read more adult literary ish novels the gravity of birds is told in somewhat converging timelines starting in the 1960's when adolescent sisters alice and natalie kessler meet the rich young and burgeoning artist thomas bayber flash forward to 2007 where bayber is a world renowned artist but in poor health with one trick left he sends his only friend and biographer prof dennis finch and expert art authenticator stephen jameson on a journey to find a lost painting of the kessler sisters along the way the men uncover bayber's history and family secrets that have been hidden for decades this novel has a lot of plot twists and reveals so it can be hard to talk about without giving away too much while i found most of these reveals predictable a few still managed to catch me off guard when listening to an audiobook it is hard to linger appreciate the writing but from the snippets i've seen from the print version it's very obvious guzeman has an excellent writing ability this book focuses on art and she has this great way of describing the pieces so the reader can see them the dynamic characters bring a lot to a plot that could have easily been generic of all the characters i found the somewhat socially unconscious art authenticator stephen jameson to be the most interesting learning about the process of art authentication and the things people can tell from something as small as an artist's signature got me interested in reading more books about art this has left me wanting to check out the art forger by b a shapiro for my next art themed read cassandra campbell does a wonderful job with the narration which is no surprise as she has over 300 voice credits all of her different voices just flow so well together one of the things i like about her is the versatility in her voice this novel has a majority male characters and campbell creates these really authentic male voices there were times when i forgot it was a woman's voice but then on the flip side of it she can do an array of teenage girl or little boy voices reviewing this book as someone who primarily reads ya is difficult often when ya readers talk about adult books we tend to focus on how the book has ya crossover appeal but i don't think this book is that kind of book there aren't very many of the usual tropes and qualities of ya in this book which made it refreshing for me i'm learning that one of the things i like about adult books is they have an wiser perspective ya novels tend to function on the notion that the most important and finite moments in life happen to you when you are a teenager and then that's it while adult books tend to linger and show a span of a character's lifetime joyland the night circus water for elephants which puts everything including the characters adolescent in perspective as a post college reader this was a nice change audiobook provided by simon and schuster","47":"i like all of lucy maude montgomery's books but the ones when anne is older and raising children are even more interesting she depicks a bygone life with such clarity it's almost a shock coming back to the real world i also like how she carries her main characters thru to each book so your not wondering what happened to them very relaxed and friendly reading","48":"i enjoyed reading this book it had rather dark and mysterious story lines woven together i liked the way different pieces of the puzzle were revealed as the story progressed i couldn't stop reading this book i had to know more about the painting and its story","49":"two sisters hiding secrets from each other all through their lives a dying artist with secrets of his own good descriptions of birds and authentication of art excellent story line","50":"i enjoyed this book very much i like a book that you can read slowly and ponder on awhile","51":"i had a hard time putting this one down you go through every emotion possible reading this the characters cause you to feel discuss sadness happiness sorrow love wonder the list goes on","52":"very interesting story loved the way the three main characters used different methods to find the truth","53":"lots in here i didn't see coming lovely prose to take you there enjoyed this one sorry to see it end","54":" this novel tries to straddle the line between literary and commercial fiction what the publishing gods have deemed upmarket fiction unfortunately for the gravity of birds it probably tries a little too hard and therefore doesn't do either as effectively as if it just picked one and flew above the treetops instead it crash landed into a cactus and i was left picking needles out of my butt the structure proved a little confusing with the movement between time periods and i was prone to forget who i was or where i was for brief periods of time sometimes a wee bit longer this was certainly a literary element as i end up more confused and discombobulated when i read \"more serious\" works than when i read the high octane commercial fiction what can i say my brain likes to be entertained and i feed it generous helpings of the good stuff not that this novel lacked an entertainment factor it just might not have been what tracy guzeman intended as i wanted to throttle thomas bayber within an inch of his life for being a self indulgent ass note to readers who are not artists we are not all like this some of us surprise surprise actually have a soul the other source of entertainment was a \"who's on first \" sketch between finch and jameson that made me want to slap my head and then get on a plane in the middle of a blizzard as for the other characters i was less than impressed except for a cameo appearance near the end of the novel the cameo setting--new mexico land of the sand and vast openness--proved a rather beautiful side trip during which i could have indulged myself further had i just been given the opportunity to do so while some might call this a mystery or hear it marketed as such and then proceed to be disappointed when it's not i'd say this is more of a coming of age or contemporary fiction tale that had more of a literary spin than it knew what to do with in other words this book had an identity crisis and i'm not sure i can really help this novel solve its problems but someone smarter than me can probably make a better effort at identifying its feathers cross posted at robert's reads","55":"i won this book in a giveway and i appreciated the opportunity to read it before its release the book revolves around a artist and the search for one of his first paintings the piece s is a mystery and a complete surprise to even his cataloguer this search leads to the unraveling of decades since 1960s old secrets of the artist thomas bayber and the relationships he had with two sisters natalie and alice guzeman's storytelling is very detailed every item is beautifully described this book is also accessible to a variety of readers and is original in terms of storyline overall i enjoyed the book i did find the amount of minor characters a bit excessive much of which i cared little about i wish she would have focused more on the ones i mentioned there were too many plot lines and the bouncing back and forth between places eras was a bit confusing at times","56":"4 5 5 stars... loved it","57":"for some reason i picked yet another book about artists and siblings eh took a long while to build up the drama wouldn't say i was very impressed but it had some good moments my favourite character is stephen his disarming humour and honesty appeals to me and also natalie who is so pretty and mean","58":"hardcover library book a freaking masterpiece u0026lt 3 u0026lt 3 u0026lt 3","59":"this was s very strong debut novel i liked the voices of the main characters as they wove through past and present","60":"nice easy read","61":"the bird motif which pops up now and then in this kind of hard to believe story of two sisters and a famous painter was the best part of this novel the images details and explanations were wonderful the rest left me scratching my head about the foibles of human behavior too many coincidences for me to fully fall into the book and loose ends","62":"lovely writing","63":"loved this novel wonderful debut from tracy","64":"i was instantly sucked in and i stayed sucked in and even though i saw things before they were revealed and at times things were just too pat i remained sucked in","65":"this is one of the best books i read in 2013 the writing is gorgeous the plot is compelling and the larger questions it raises about art family and identity kept me totally absorbed","66":" this book is part mystery part love story and part psychological drama thomas bayber a reclusive world renowned artist unveils a never before seen work and asks dennis finch an aging art history professor and stephen jameson an eccentric art authenticator to sell it for him but first they must track down the two sisters in the painting natalie and alice kessler who seem to have vanished years earlier how do you find someone who wants to be lost--in more ways than one guzeman's characters the good and the unlikeable are fully fleshed and provoke a host of emotions tracy chevalier sarah dunant and susan vreeland also write about the visual arts","67":"deception jealously regret pain but ultimately this book is about loss the writing is good and the story kept me engaged i really enjoyed all the art talk i think the author could have delved a bit deeper into some of the stories though but basically a decent story","68":"just finished the last page of the gravity of birds by tracy guzman this finely crafted novel compels from the opening scene a story of an enigmatic sexy driven painter the novel unfolds over decades to finally expose the personal damage he wrought a book that will have me thinking for a long time about narcissism art disability tenderness and flight","69":"i struggled through this one i guess the bottom line was that i didn't really care about any of the characters all of them were pretty 2 dimensional and i never warmed up to any of them this is the second book with birds in the title maybe i need to give it a rest it was a bit of a stretch the bird part in this case that's for sure i'm not certain how these books become so popular didn't do much and the title was goofy if you really think about it overall i don't recommend if you got it as a gift it has regift written all over it","70":" first sentence alice haunted the mossy edge of the woods lingering in patches of shade favorite quote why do we lack the capacity to celebrate small bits of perfection unless it's obvious on a grand scale it's not worth acknowledging i find that extremely tiresome i wanted to like this book more than i did the story was uniquely woven and very interesting but i just could not click with any of the characters i glazed over everyone not completely interested in any of them book club books are so great always taking me in directions i would nit have read otherwise","71":"this book started off slow i struggled to know where the plot was going and how the characters were intertwined as i read on after about 50 or so pages i found myself mesmerized by the plot and the characters i couldn't put the book down it was literary enough to be beautiful but not too much to be boring the ending was absolutely perfect concluding enough but leaving something to the imagination i just closed the book and said wow out loud one of the best books i've read in a while","72":"oh what a tangled web we weave what a mess we can make of our lives that was my thought as i finished this book i loved the story of two sisters separated by circumstances kept hidden yet miserably kept together partly because of those circumstances at times i felt that the solutions came a little too easily and were a little too convenient but there was so much that didn't come together that it was balanced out it made it feel true to real life","73":"great read 4 5 starts bumped up to 5 because it's a first novel terrific story line involving art siblings family secrets and lost loves i highly recommend","74":" in all a good readable story about secrets and family loss and forgiveness the comic relief of finch and stephen kept the rest of it from being maudlin there's really no surprise or suspense except for how long it will take for the characters to figure out their relationships which the reader has been clued in to from early on artists painters rheumatoid arthritis sisters lake houses curators oh and it mentions prendergast chas w r t frames not brother maurice but still so that's something","75":" this was a lovely story with many twists and turns i would have given it five stars but was disappointed with how it ended which felt very abrupt to me parts of it were rather unbelievable however that being said i definitely enjoyed it alice u0026amp her sister natalie have only each other to depend on supposedly they have more in common than they know initially but are very different people finch and jamison are also very different people but are connected in a way even they don't know yet if i had to sum it up i'd say this book is about what makes up a family and what we're willing able to forgive","76":"such a beautifully written and melancholy debut all about the choices we make and how they affect our lives filled with descriptive imagery and three dimensional characters each with their own flaws this is a book that you won't soon forget jumping betweent past and present i was sorely tempted to skip chapters and read on especially during alice's segments but restrained myself and everything was revealed in time a step above the average novel i was captivated within the first chapter and had to unravel all the bitter secrets contained within highly recommended not particularly light reading but well worth every minute","77":"i don't like to rate or review a book that i haven't finished it's slow after a week of reading i find myself wondering what on earth it's about i read a few pages and am just not gripped or engrossed enough to carry on and that isn't like me","78":"loved the beginning and the lake and after that not much natalie was a cypher and lots of the rest was just plain sad and also other than the natural world's descriptions and context of pain in each particular for alice rather flat didn't connect with the self involved artist at all","79":"it really picked up in the last half of the book but i had to stay with it through the first half i was left wanting to know more about the characters though","80":"thoroughly enjoyed this book was a bit slow for a start the story took a bit of time to unfold when i was about one third through the book i really started to get involved with the story it was great had a brilliant conclusion not what i expected but enjoyed all the same would recommend this book to read by everyone easy to understand u0026amp flowed perfectly thank you to goodreads for supplying me this book to enjoy","81":"4 5 stars i loved this book for the complex quirky characters and the interesting story a great read","82":"i really enjoyed this book the characters were interestingly quirky the relationships were complicated but true the descriptive language and lots of twists through out i think it would make a great book club discussion","83":"this was a goodreads recommendation because i love kate morton's books and i have to say that this one was very similar it straddles the line between literary and commercial fiction and keeps a nice tension balance between mysterious events of the past and the current day attempts to solve the mysteries this is a book about secrets kept and discovered about family and parental ties","84":"for me the book started out slow but i'm glad i stuck with it the ending as good","85":" this book was fascinating but not a very smooth read i would give it 3 5 stars if that was possible it is a complex multi layered story of a tragic family and their deep connection to a emotionally remote artist who later becomes famous and reclusive the two sisters are orphaned as young adults and a series of events leads the older sister natalie to become a master manipulator who is heartless her complex deceptions rob all of the characters of a chance at happiness thomas the famous artist approaches an art history professor whose life has been devoted to cataloging and analyzing his work to help him reunite the three panels of a previously unknown triptych painting he specifically requests that a young troubled art specialist an acquaintance of professor finch be brought in to validate the genuineness of the middle panel which he has in his possession and help to find the missing end pieces of art most of the story is stitched together methodically by the two mis matched investigators but there are flash backs to encounters to build the history of the various characters the book neatly resolves all the mysteries and loose ends by the finish which felt a bit rushed however i found the writing style to be choppy and parts of the story too far fetched...in 2007 the internet should have been a much more useful tool than portrayed the author also never delves into the motivation of the women who raised the daughter - she is never addressed at all which is odd to me all in all a good first novel by a promising writer but not great","86":"what a wonderful haunting book i couldn't put it down picked this up from the new shelf at our library and i am so glad i did i will be looking for future books by tracy guzeman","87":"i really liked this book the story the interesting characters the peek into the art world and how it ended thanks tracy guzeman for a great read","88":"the visual imagery in this one worked for me i thought the author did an excellent job of looking at how our relationships with each other form us however i also found the characterization engrossing i was sad the book ended d","89":" 3 26 won in first reads giveaway on goodreads 4 27 received this book in the mail today 5 8 totally loved this book it wasn't amazing like goodreads says when i hover over the 5 star rating but it was really good and really well done i liked and didn't like the characters i was drawn into the story although it was a bit slow at the beginning and then there were the few twists that i did not anticipate that really kicked the story and interest factor into gear for me there's a lot of detail in the book the painting and the ornithology study of birds that are heavily detailed and referenced frequently so either the author did her research well or she already knows these subjects well i could visualize the settings described and the people so well and was totally immersed in the lives of the characters and stephen and finch's search for the kessler sisters fabulous clean book with no foul language that i can recall a debut book by this author i look forward to anything she writes in the future","90":"this is one of the best books i've read in a while what a great feat for her first novel the writing pulls you in you feel like you know these characters they are that well defined the relationships are complex your emotions will run the gamut and combine all this with the involvement of art and birds as well a truly special read","91":"i liked the beginning got bored a little bit in the middle and then enjoyed it once the action picked up again the story is messed up emotionally but i enjoyed the artist details and how things balance out in the end","92":"truly loved this book a great story about family illness art mystery love and trysts enjoy","93":"this is a well written story about two sisters and a man who changes their lives at first the book appears to be about the art world and the search for a lost painting that search continues throughout the book but the human story is what makes this such a good book","94":"this was a first read from goodreads i loved it it is a wonderful story and the characters are so believable you become engrossed in the story i would love the author to do a sequel to see what occurs next i would urge anyone who loves a good story to read this highly reccomended","95":"great read it moved but not quickly kept my interest add twisted along the way and had a finish that brought everything together in a complete way","96":"there are times to be sad but you should never search for them or find them too often this book is full of sadness but not maudling sadness that leads desperation but rather a quiet refelective sense of loss that leads to hope","97":"love the book jacket love the book","98":" the cover is beautiful it sucked me in plus i'm a sucker for any book set in the art world i do think it was beautifully written and full of lovely prose but maybe too full the characters were forever drifting off into memories and introspection that really did nothing to forward the plot my main beef is probably my own personal hangup but i wanted to know more in the end i know we got glimpses and back story and pieces were revealed along the way but in the end i was just not satisfied with the overall explanation for some of the big events view spoiler like why natalie was twisted enough to actually steal her sister's child hide spoiler and i hated hated hated natalie there was nothing redeemable in her and i think i was supposed to feel sorry for her","99":"i really enjoyed this novel it is well written the author deftly handled some rather complex layers of the story in time and space it has very interesting characters and a great plot jeez what more do you want from a modern novel highlyy recommended","100":"this was ms guzeman's first novel her characters were well developed and the story was interesting new twists kept one reading on it is worth your time to read this one","101":"really enjoyed this book ms guzman's debut novel is a winner quiet but deep us how i would describe characters an interesting twist of plot at the end lends to the sense of wanting more","102":"great story","103":"well written a beautiful book of loss and found people and paintings loss is described on so many levels the characters are well drawn even minor characters and one can feel the weather and environment in which the sisters are transported to hide out this book is about sibling rivalry and competition at its strongest but it is also complex i found it hard to put down","104":"i really enjoyed this and think most of my friends would enjoy it too","105":"loved this book though it's a heavy story i love the way that art birds and homes all play an important role in this story the descriptions of the homes and their surroundings are written with an amazing ability to reflect the wonder of each while also accurately describing them the description of birds too like having a national audubon society book to reference but never having to refer to it beautiful book","106":"i won this book in a goodreads first reads giveaway i thought this book was great the story was well written the characters were intriguing though not always likable and the plot had just enough twists to keep me reading can't wait to see what the author comes out with next","107":"this book was a lovely revelation i picked it up at the library with no foreknowledge beautifully written with an interesting plot well defined characters with whom i was happy to spend time with a bit of a mystery which i always appreciate i read it in the space of a day or two highly recommend","108":"this book was really lovely it was really beautifully written at the start it was a bit slow but the book was really enjoyable and had some twists that i did not see comming","109":"i really enjoyed this book i appreciated all the little details about birds and art but i also felt like the author was really invested and connected to her characters flawed as they were with the exception of natalie they all felt like real people beautiful prose too","110":"well developed main characters whose lives intertwine and sisters in a love hate relationship","111":"probably a 3 5 really nice writing but a little slow i also felt like the motivations behind the actions of two of the characters were never really explored which might have added another dimension to the story","112":"this review has been hidden because it contains spoilers to view it click here i enjoyed this but was surprised how the story played out with no happy endings or reconciliations for the 'bad' characters namely thomas and natalie i thought there must have been some room for forgiveness for natalie at least who's own life had been ruined by her parents decision to have her abort her baby but no kind thoughts were spared for her i was also suprised by alice's lack of fight in the later part of her life given how she'd fought to maintain her independence in the earlier y i enjoyed this but was surprised how the story played out with no happy endings or reconciliations for the 'bad' characters namely thomas and natalie i thought there must have been some room for forgiveness for natalie at least who's own life had been ruined by her parents decision to have her abort her baby but no kind thoughts were spared for her i was also suprised by alice's lack of fight in the later part of her life given how she'd fought to maintain her independence in the earlier years sorry but she just seemed to fold up and spend the majority of her adult life as ghost on the edge of society and i realised by the end of the book that she was actually my least favourite character took this on holiday and once i'd finished it was eagerly taken on by a fellow holidaymaker who taught art and has gone from edinburgh to the home counties via seville i hope she too enjoys the story more","113":" i really enjoyed this book despite some cliched plot devices the gravity of birds managed to charm me it was by no means what i would consider a serious read more like a well written romance with an art history mystery twist even as i found some aspects of the novel less than believable i loved the characters and the way art brought them together in the end there was quite a lot of pain in this book but guzman's message in the end was 'be not afraid' some birds inhabit cages of their own design it was good to read a book that so elegantly portrayed that yet also showed its dissolution all in all a very satisfying debut and one i happily read in a single sitting","114":"great read characters were very well developed","115":"3 5 stars started out strong but not sure the end delivered quite as well as i had hoped enjoyed the writing and the story but seemed to be wrapped up with a minimal of fuss and excellent timing that wouldn't be seen in the real world storylines involving hateful people destroying oblivious people's worlds really bother me although this doesn't fully apply to this story as one of the main characters made some poor choices all on her own it still annoyed me i would read this author again","116":"i plopped down on the couch and started reading 'the gravity of birds' it grabbed me from the first sentence the young girl alice waiting the woods hoping to catch a glimpse of their summer neighbor thomas bayber a young up and coming painter a simple scene but one that stays with you author tracy guzeman has an elegant way of bringing the sights and smells into our consciousness the scent of green the cushion of moss the snap of dried branches underfoot but it is the stillness of a young girl that grabs our interest a young girl who not only harbors a love of birds but also has a curiosity that will change the lives of everyone around her but it isn't just the descriptions that grab you it's the way each character moves across the chessboard natalie the jealous vindictive older sister holding secrets and telling lies sensitive alice living with a disease that is horribly ironic thomas with his amazing talent who loves one more than the other pulled into the mix are an art historian and a young art authenticator the story travels back and forth across the years although it doesn't go back so far to confuse the reader it's within our time we can make sense of the clothing and the whole world of art and the artists who bring us such delight or melancholy we experience deception and jealousy joy and beauty but it's the search for two missing paintings which is at the heart of this beautifully written story it is 2007 and thomas bayber is a world famous painter his works hang in museums and private residences now a recluse who hasn't painted in years thomas reveals the never before seen painting 'kessler sisters' to dennis finch the art historian and stephen jameson the authenticator it is bayber's plan that finch and jameson should be the ones to search for the lost paintings and the women who meant so much to him when he was but a young man there's so much more to this novel but i don't want to reveal any 'spoilers' it's elegant it's interesting it's 'sister centered' and so very very full of surprises guzeman is a master manipulator and you won't see what's coming this is a huge recommend for reading groups","117":"our book club book one of my favorites","118":" so this book made me cry it was great the characters were very real and complex the writing had numerous lovely pieces of wisdom who's a tortured character thomas i loved thomas i shouldn't but i did him and alice one true pairing which i know is wrong whoops i can't help it you recognised it even though it frightens you even though you find it dark and ugly so maybe those qualities are inherent but you choose to overlook them you don't see the ugliness because you don't want to that's the job of an artist to make people look at things--not just at things but at people and at places--in a way other than they normally would to expose what's hidden below the surface \" your parents were far from saints alice it would be generous to say they were ordinary people who made some very serious mistakes don't make them out to be perfect that's too thin a wire for anyone to be able to keep their balance \" alice do not let grief be the only map you carry lest you lose your way back to happiness i have lived my life in service only to myself and now i am left with the deserved remains of such a life \"he is a principled man and compassionate someone who will remind himself of your best qualities while struggling to forgive your worst in short he is a friend \" the estimation of an artist's talent is often based on his ability to render both light and shadow if you have any choice in the matter spend time seeking the former","119":" there are events and moments of epiphany that change the course of not just one life but many chapter one opens at one of those junctures it is the summer of 1963 fourteen year old alice kessler ever watchful of both birds and adults explores the awakening of her own sexual curiosity she also recognizes the first symptoms of what will become a debilitating disease at the same time her seventeen year old sister natalie the beauty of the family has shifted abruptly and inexplicably from mischievous confederate and co conspirator to sullen fury the third person introduced is 28 year old thomas bayber a promising painter who exudes such magnetic charm even the reader is beguiled chapter two opens 44 years later it is now 2007 bayber is 72 his early talent blossomed with his first solo show in 1967 and currently all of his works are in the hands of major museums and a select few private collectors the art historian dennis finch was drawn to bayber at that first solo showing and has dedicated his professional life to bayber culminating in his magnum opus a catalogue raisonne of bayber's work however inexplicably bayber stopped painting 20 years ago lives in squalor despite finch's considerable financial aid and is ailing also inexplicably he now summons finch his only friend and reveals the existence of a previously unrevealed work painted in his youth it is a portrait of the kessler sisters as they were that summer and he has inserted his own youthful self portrait into the center of it bayber persuades finch to act as commissioned sales agent for the piece -- if he can locate two missing panels that would complete the work the main characters are alice kessler dennis finch and stephen jameson the authenticator bayber requests to assist finch i loved the exchanges between finch and jameson finch is an introspective father figure dealing with the death of his wife claire nearly a year ago he still imagines claire's voice with its moral clarity gently chiding or encouraging him as the situation shifts his loss triggers thoughts of aging and bouts of regret about his professional devotion to bayber a devotion that isolated him in his study or drew him into the heady gravitational pull of bayber's brilliance -- repeated choices to exclude claire nevertheless he enjoyed a happy life with her and they had a daughter now married and solicitous of finch's health bayber is portrayed in unflattering terms claire even went so far as to hint finch was his enabler yet the chapter introducing the elderly bayber reveals a sensitive and perceptive intelligence he counters finch's reluctance to be drawn back into his orbit \"thomas seemed to sense his discomfort and smiled 'the best way to slow the march of time denny perhaps the only way is to throw something unexpected in its path '\" p 32 even in this diminished state thomas bayber still exudes a beguiling charm jameson is finch's opposite so impulsive he lacks the wit to hide from his boss the relationship he is having with the boss' wife the disclosure sent his once promising career into a tailspin he now works in the bottom level of a second tier auction house he embarks on the search for the missing panels with the eagerness of a puppy oblivious to whatever unruly furrows he may leave in his wake jameson displays his own array of eccentricities he recites nursery rhymes to focus his concentration when studying a piece for authentication he resorts to complex mnemonics to recall mundane details like someone's name but has no problem rattling off the minutiae of characteristics and release dates for a rare set of 21 porcelain birds produced as limited editions by the royal worcester company guzeman excels at creating dialog and launches this 'odd couple' on a road trip in search of the kessler sisters who dropped out of sight in 1972 nine years after that pivotal summer and are believed to possess the missing panels she even has some subtle fun finch refuses to fly an anxiety tick he developed when his wife collapsed and died at an airport the book alternates between two timelines the present 2007 and the past between 1963 and 1972 1972 was the date of a second critical juncture this discontinuous narrative structure pits the author's desire to create suspense against an opportunity to maximize the emotional impact of the story the timeline is critical but difficult to follow readers accustomed to taking notes while they read will definitely want to note the years key events occur the real strength of the book is the emotional ambivalence of the characters that ambivalence is apparent only on a second reading after all the surprises have been revealed only then do significant gestures stand out view spoiler thomas' hand guided by the arthritic alice as he asks her to imagine and paint a flock of birds in flight the sketch of the kessler family in 1963 alice and natalie's abrupt move in 1972 and bayber's pleasure when jameson deduces that two panels are missing whereas alice resolutely ascends from the past guzeman conjoins past and present with delicate poignancy hide spoiler another problem i had with the book is that alice kessler although sympathetic is far less interesting than any of the other characters including natalie her disability and victimhood overshadow the precocious intelligence and sensitivity she displays in that first chapter even her lifelong passion for ornithology affects the reader in an abstract way she speaks of species and plumage contrast that to the passage describing finch's first encounter with bayber's paintings \" standing in front of the work it was impossible not to see the talent behind it and not to be shocked \" p 24 that shock sucks the air from his lungs banishes the impulse to analyze and silences the crowd pressed around him if anything the passage recalls the art critic robert hughes' exhilarating narrative in his book shock of the new the plot leans dangerously toward melodrama with its coincidences and unanticipated revelations to appreciate this book focus on the characters and affecting dialogue","120":"all consuming and i say that because you can't put this book down after you read the first page what a wonderful told story of love and relationships the bird cage and it's relation to life is evident throughout the entire book even in the first pages a most surprising incredible reading","121":"do not let grief be the only map you carry lest you lose your way back to happiness","122":"slow to start but pretty good overall","123":"this book was a fascinating interplay of relationships expertise loss and redemption the impact of choices are powerful and make for a haunting and compelling narrative loved it","124":"while compulsively readable i found gravity to be a very uneven work there is some beautiful thoughtful language and then there is the contrived awkward plotting what saved the book for me is that i truly like the character of alice and wanted to see her vindicated even if the neat wrapping up was not at all in keeping with the delightfully lyrical and complex narratives in other parts of the story like when alice was stranded in the boat during the storm one of my dearest themes to read about in fiction is sisters and guzeman has this to say about natalie and alice they had lived their older lives like strangers from different shipwrecks washed up on the same island without the benefit of a common language you get to learn something of art history and art authentication in this work which is interesting but i think for me it is this juxtaposition of sophistication and intellectualism with an unconvincing story trajectory that makes me hesitant to recommend guzeman's tale","125":"when thomas bayber first walked on the dock there was a certain knowledge that the world had shifted and nothing would ever be the same she'd pushed her memories of him accompanied by her feelings of disappointment and shame to a dark place at the back of her mind natalie and alice kessler are sisters of wholly different natures natalie is a cunning 17 year old to alice's forthright 13 years thomas bayber is an artist come to vacation at his parents' summer cottage on the lake he makes a name for himself in the art world only a few of his paintings are in private collections the rest have been bought by museums and then over 40 years later bayber makes a revelation a new never recorded or seen piece of work a self portrait on the cottage couch between natalie and alice bayber contacts a relatively small auction house to authenticate and sell the work this excellently told story takes the reader back and forth from the seemingly idyllic summer days at the lake and then back to the present alice now mostly incapacitated by rheumatoid arthritis bayber an old man laid low by a stroke and the painting the mystery of it being hidden for so long and then revealed this book is a story of mystery of thoughtful psychological dissection of complicated love and of remorse one of the best books i've read lately","126":"very slow read and hard to follow on the first half just wanted to get thru it since it was my book club read","127":"this book tells the story of alice and natalie kessler the two sisters meet artist thomas bayber when they are young and on vacation at a lake house thomas has a large affect on both women to give anything away would be spoiling the book the main thing about this book that keeps you reading is learning the secrets of all of the characters the characters are the best thing about this book most of them are well drawn and you care about them the characters of natalie and thomas are more left up to interpretation you gain knowledge about them mostly by what the other characters tell you i found this book to be a bit slow and to me it did not necessarily flow very well that said it was still enjoyable mostly to see how everything turned out","128":" i feel as if i know all the characters in guzeman's book she made them all visible with their faults and foibles intact and i was right there with them in the story told in chapters that correspond to different years in the development of the plot the book unfolds quickly as a complex intertwining of places personalities sibling rivalry art deceit and reconciliation two sisters and a talented young artist meet at a lake cabin and the moment is electric i loved the symbol of the grosbeak great read the mark of a good author is characters who make the reader feel as if they are real people the mark of a great author is a good ending writers often know the ending before they write the story book and i think guzeman is in this company of writers i can just imagine how she crafted the story to come around to the ending she wanted i have this picture in my mind of one of those huge boards you see in television crime shows where the detectives hang up pictures news clippings and other clues excellent i hope she writes more books","129":"there were too many implausible coincidences a lot of soap opera drama but also some interesting characters and descriptions of art","130":"all that is not given is lost this is a book that reminds one of how quickly time passes but not quick enough for regrets not to catch u","131":"this is an excellent book it has everything a good book needs believable characters and a strong plot more to come","132":"wow this is easily the best book i've read since all the light we cannot see i loved how well guzeman draws the characters and how the plot evolved i definitely recommend this book","133":"had a lot of potential but couldn't quite seem to get there","134":"loved this book very fascinating characters story line and back story sorry it ended","135":" in 1963 when alice was 13 something happened in her sister natalie's life which caused a major change from a fun loving close sister companion into an aloof morose and bitter teen thus alice is left to her own devices and meets a neighbor thomas bayber is an artist and the girl becomes friends with him much later in the 1990s he is a famous artist and suddenly reveals a pointing of the two girls it becomes a mystery as the art curator at the local museum attempts to find a missing piece from the pointing","136":" i loved this book even though it was slow going in the beginning as the reader becomes familiar with all of the characters but once the storyline takes off i had a hard time putting it down natalie is a perfectly flawed villain as the reader learns about her through other character's points of view her sister alice is always more virtuous even on bad days tracy guzeman does a wonderful job of weaving together multiple characters confronted with one bad decision that leads to a lifetime of heartache","137":" i really enjoyed this even though i don't think it's unreservedly great a lot of the more serious material dealing with alice to me falls kind of flat she never really comes alive as a character and i think guzeman sort of cheats a lot by jumping around in time to hide some of those limitations likewise there's a note of sameness to the characters' backstories here alice stephen and finch are all at key moments in the novel dealing with the grief of not exactly recent deaths but those that happened a year or two ago the art stuff is kind of silly even and we never get a section from natalie's pov which feels like a missed opportunity but then dennis and stephen for reasons i can't quite fathom are energetic fun and strange characters to follow i'd read a book about the two of them set off on an american pickers style adventure with stakes much lower than this book they aren't even especially fresh but guzeman writes about them and their exploits with such energy and wonder that it drags up all the other elements here that feel not quite finished everything that doesn't work fully becomes an excuse to spend time with these two characters who do and hey it's a first novel i suppose guzeman could never achieve the good things here again but i'd rather believe her next novel will dispatch with the weaker elements after an early draft and really write a crackling follow up to this one","138":"just could not get into it story line sort of creepy with older guy interacting with 2 teen sisters i only read about 3 chapters then stopped","139":"it took me a while to get into this one but once i did i enjoyed it i wasn't in love with it i didn't finish it thinking oh i will definitely recommend this one to paraphrase larry david it was pretty pretty good","140":"i read this coincidentally at the same time as tell the wolves i'm home and they have a lot of similarities 2 sisters older one is mean a painted portrait with lots of meaning and death it was good but i probably shouldn't have read them at the same time","141":"if i could i'd give this a 4 5 rating an intriguing story full of information about painting which helps me appreciate that creative art all the more this first novel of tracy guzeman's is good a very enjoyable read she writes well the book goes quickly i don't want to give away the story so won't say more do read this book you will be glad you did","142":" this is a strong debut novel guzeman's writing is highly skilled and her descriptions are as described by so many readers simply beautiful there are lessons to be learnt too but are presented in a subtle way adaptable to different individuals and situations the heart warming sense of nostalgia is strong and permeates the entire novel making it impossible to draw away from the story i would recommend this wonderful novel and i am interested to hear other reader's opinions on the final plot twist i personally enjoyed it but i think others may find it to be a little far fetched overall i believe that readers' will experience an emotional connection with this novel and for this reason it is well worth reading i received this book as part of goodreads firstreads programme and am grateful to goodreads the publisher and the author for sending it to me","143":"i am drawn to books with art mysteries and complicated familial personal relationships and this book managed to combine all three i really enjoyed the story but the constant changes of time place and character were a little hard to follow and confusing at times overall a compelling story with engaging characters","144":"a little slow to start but then i was sucked in an interesting read and i wasn't at all sure what was going on until the end","145":" i finished this book at 2 00 in the morning and was too bleary eyed to write a review now that i've slept on it i must say say this was a very thought provoking novel the author uses beautiful language to describe her characters and the situation s the only thing that bothered me was that i felt there were too many blanks in the early story of alice and thomas i wish that ms guzman had fleshed their story out a little i was left wanting more but that being said the story kept my interest throughout it's a love story a mystery and it depicts different time periods through the eyes and thoughts of her characters ms guzman makes us think about what is truly important in this life","146":"this was the perfect book if i could give it ten stars i would wonderful writing great characters fascinating story loved it","147":"great story could not put it down","148":"beautifully written with complex characters slow to start but good storyline in the end","149":" 2 it's not terrible but it has issues some of the descriptions are too long the language is often unnatural you don't see the ugliness because you don't want to that's the job of an artist to make people look at things in a way other than they normally would to expose what's hidden below the surface the story is unbelievable and too neat or not neat enough and there's a predictable and lazy epilogue i think there was too much going on and too much jumping around from character to character and too much focus on the ones that weren't all that interesting the title is bad though i see how it's supposed to draw a person in the gravity of birds sounds familiar i heard that's a good book no you didn't you're thinking of the secret life of bees or maybe the goldfinch which also has something to do with birds and might have a birdcage on the cover i get it but whatever i skimmed a lot i don't do that because i think it's cheating i did it with this one with no qualms whatsoever i also sighed a lot because i knew what was coming because it was the obvious not obvious thing that should happen next if that makes sense the ending was sort of ridiculous and the way everyone just accepted all the big life changing revelations was just too easy so it wasn't a great book overall but i do think it would make a good beach read it has some depth to it and sometimes the writing is nice it beats a romance novel any day all books have their place i suppose","150":"i loved this book superbly written great characters and a mystery that kept me guessing until the end i hated for it to end and will be wondering about the characters and wishing them well for a very long time","151":"started off strong lost me in the second half","152":" what a lovely story mystery love family told so beautifully that every page was a gift a reminder of how we can never know just how another perceives the same life that we do cuzeman introduces us to two sisters and to several unique men all of whom are caught up in a family net of secrets and betrayals most of which are unknown a search for two paintings reveals much more than art one of the truly couldn't put it down stories i've read in a long time and it's the author's first novel at that can't wait for another","153":" why i picked it i picked up a hard copy of this book when i went to the library last week i have been mostly reading on my ipad while it is very convenient i have heard more and more about the light emitted from all of these devices interfering with sleep that could help explain the sleeplessness so i decided to go and find a real book to read i went to the new fiction section and stood there trying to figure out what in the heck i was going to read i had not brought my list of books i wanted to read so what i picked would be totally random i must admit that i was first drawn by the cover the info inside the front cover was intriguing as well however the reason i ended up with this book was that one of my favorite authors meg waite clayton wrote a recommendation on the back cover her recommendation ended with a compelling story of the love of art and the art of love i was hooked synopsis sisters natalie and alice kessler were close until adolescence wrenched them apart natalie is headstrong manipulative and beautiful alice is a dreamer who loves books and birds during their family's summer holiday at the lake alice falls under the thrall of a struggling young painter thomas bayber in whom she finds a kindred spirit natalie however remains strangely unmoved sitting for a family portrait with surprising indifference but by the end of the summer three lives are shattered decades later bayber now a reclusive world renowned artist unveils a never before seen work kessler sisters a provocative painting depicting the young thomas natalie and alice bayber asks dennis finch an art history professor and stephen jameson an eccentric young art authenticator to sell the painting for him that task becomes more complicated when the artist requires that they first locate natalie and alice who seem to have vanished and finch finds himself wondering why thomas is suddenly so intent on resurrecting the past in the gravity of birds histories and memories refuse to stay buried in the end only the excavation of the past will enable its survivors to love again type fictonquick take away i thoroughly enjoyed this book it was a bit family dynamics a bit mystery and a bit art history lesson all things i like to read i would have loved to have a section showing us bayber's work i know it doesn't really exist but it would have been really cool i liked the bouncing back and forth between the 60's 70's and 2007 and the different points of view it helped paint a picture which slowly came into view the two characters central to this story natalie kessler and thomas bayber became increasing remote as well as unlikable i really enjoyed learning about them and the other characters through other outside sources the ending was beautifully written and also full of surprises thank you tracy guzeman for ending a book as strongly as you started it i am looking forward to your next novel please write one rating 5 5 it was wonderful one of the best books i have read in a long time source i borrowed this book from the library","154":"it took me a little time to get into the story but once i did i really liked it","155":"i loved this book and i am having a hard time deciding if it is for personal reasons or because it was such a great book for me there is the artist thing the bird cage thing the mother daughter separation thing i like the relationships and the strength of the characters i like the mystery of the hidden panels and what they come to represent","156":"lots of surprises in this one just when i thought i had the plot figured out another twist","157":"i enjoyed this as a quick and entertaining summer read there are some flashes of excellent writing in here but the wind down after the climax of the the story really fell flat in some ways this felt like a superb and interesting short story that got expanded lengthened unnecessarily to sell books still quite enjoyable and worth reading","158":"this was alright highly highly predictable and i felt the natalie and thomas story should have been more developed so as to have us more betrayed invested what have you really cheesy ending really","159":"it's hard to sum up what this book is about but it's definitely worth the read you want to hate natalie but after hearing her story you can only dislike and pity her you want to love alice but you pity her as well for different reasons and you really want to slap thomas at times but he's kind of pitiful too stephen and finch are a good duo and weave it all together on their quest to find the missing pieces of thomas' final piece of artwork the only thing that is slightly off putting is that there were many times i needed a dictionary it's nice to pick up new words but i feel like the author was really showing off early in the book other than that this is a great read with a plot that doesn't bore","160":"incredible writing great story loved the differing voices points of view couldn't put it down wanted more after it ended i will definitely reread this book it had a lot of nuances can't wait for another book from this author","161":" i received this book as part of a goodreads giveaway and was ridiculously excited about reading it the cover is beautiful the writing equally so and what i knew of storyline sounded like it had been written for me maybe it was partly because i had such high expectations but i found this book a dilemma to read the story switches from the experiences of two sisters to the story of three men working in the art world blending these stories together later in the book typically i enjoy reading this style of writing but on this occasion something just felt a little unbalanced about it and i spent considerable time trying to understand what was wrong the writing was good the storyline very promising and yet i would find myself putting the book down and not returning to it for a week or so very unusual for me a stay up all night til the end sort of reader i never felt i connected with any of the characters or experienced the events within the book the author mentioned in an interview at the back of the book that she had begun the book as two separate short stories but later merged them into one novel that seems to explain very well my mixed feelings about this book and although this book will not make it onto my 'reread' shelf i would be keen to read future work by this author short stories or novels intended to be novels","162":"great read enjoyed every page","163":"this is definitely a must read i liked the following review cassondra windwalkermar 17 2013 cassondra windwalker rated it 5 of 5 starsbeautifully written the prose lilts dips and soars like the flight of the birds whose images run through its pages a haunting story of the power of love that however flawed and mysterious must indelibly change the fate of all who experience it every chapter left me aching for the next the grief bound in this book's pages was tied up with grace so that rather being overwhelmed by sadness the reader is bouyed by hope these characters will stay with you long after you have finished the text familiar spirits who will remind you of a quiet nobility in the human spirit a nobility that is defined rather than diminished by the frailties and vices of the vessel less","164":" the words flowed like a river to tell the story the art the girls the story behind the paintings drew me in at the first word and kept me hanging until the end i think i'll read more by this author a good read stop here for spoilers alice and natalie meet the boy next door who happens to be a young 28 year old man who is just starting his career in art he asks the family to sit for him and they do the young 14 year old alice falls in love with him and they visit each day as he paints later in life he rescues her from the lake when she goes out too far during a storm she has rheumatoid arthritis and has no strength and ability he takes her to his cabin and they have an affair she becomes pregnant and because she is mad at him she doesn't tell him her sister natalie is jealous and so she tells her sister that the baby died in child birth and has the housekeeper move and take care of the girl in arizona she tells the daughter that the mother died in child birth so neither of them know that they other exists at the end of the book thomas the artist wants all to come out natalie has told him so he knows he has a daughter we find out that he has a son as well he helps them both with his last wish to sale his last work of art it is a three paneled piece of art and must be sold together these men are tasked to find the sisters and the art work they find them natalie has just died thomas sees a photograph of alice and his daughter and of his son as well just before he dies the story leaves us without tying up the loose ends it is left to our optimistic minds to imagine that they all live happily ever after the painting is worth millions and so they can live well indeed will they sell it the painting is of the newly found daughter's mother alice and of her aunt natalie writing this makes the book seem trivial but the way it is written makes it so powerful and good it made me wish i could see the painting and be there in the cabin and experience the bird sculpture this is a book to read for summer","165":"enjoyable the chapters jump around between people's perspectives and timeframe but it was a well told story","166":"fantastic story","167":"there were things about this book that i truly liked and there were things that i didn't believe overall felt more irritated after finishing it then anything else and i really loved being in the art world","168":"picked this up from the library because i was drawn to the cover sad i know but the idea of a story coming together with so many pieces of the past was intriguing i loved this book extremely well written you feel like you are just outside the story watching it unfold the little twists and turns pulling the past and present together was done beautifully i enjoyed this book immensely highly recommend","169":"lovely story i started on a crosscountry flight and finished it the next day lots of surprises as the novel progressed","170":" though overall a good read and very well written i lost my focus occasionally as when there was elaborate description of painting authentication or of painting technique the story starts in 1963 when 2 sisters 17 yr old natalie beautiful but coldu0026amp manipulative and 14 year old alice less attractive but with a warm heart u0026amp absorption by birdsu0026amp nature spend the summer at a friend's cottage where the meet thomas bayber a young self absorbed seductive u0026amp promiscuous painter who will paint u0026amp bed the kessler sisters the story shifts to 2009 when an older dissolute thomas engages prof finch an art expert who has written a complete account of bayber's works and young stephen a young art authenticator to sell a previously unrevealed painting of the 2 sisters u0026amp bayber himself potentially worth millions as bayber has become very famous u0026amp stopped painting for 20 yrs however 2 panels of the tryptich are missing u0026amp thomas requires them to find these before he will allow the sale the search leads to a small town in tennessee where the 2 sisters fled in the 60's after the death of their parents there alice crippled by rheumatoid arthritis u0026amp natalie carve out a new small social circle it appears alice had been impregnated

u0026amp passed herself off as the mother agnate is found by the 2 investigators u0026amp turns out to be a very talented sculptress as the truth is revealed after natalie has died it also appears that stephen's father also is not who he thought but bayber which is why he engaged him thomas wanted not to find the missing panels but to get his children back though he suffers from a stroke u0026amp dies before that is possible in the end the truth brings peace u0026amp resolution","171":"couldn't put the kindle down a good mystery that also had me giggling a few chapters towards the end when two main characters start up bickering again very descriptive and detailed info re the art world only the end seemed far fetched posted before i could add the five stars hope to read more by this author book club soon hope they like it too","172":"2 5 stars this book is a confusing mix of literary fiction and chick lit the story about the two sisters was interesting but everything else was a bore","173":"this was ok it oscillated from being character driven to plot driven and then to just kinda blah","174":"great debut novel loved it the writing was beautiful the characters were intriguing the story surrounds a famous reclusive artist and unravels with some surprising revelations don't think i can tell anything about the story without giving away something important","175":"a novel about two sisters and how love loss grief and betrayal shaped theirs lives and affected the lives of those around them","176":"a mystery with gravity about 2 sisters the storyline was compelling and the characters interesting except for one of the sisters the author allows the reader to know only one of them the other remains outside the margins a mere character sketch of an unhappy manipulative selfish person from adolescence through death after which some of her mysteries get solved but the reader still never gets to know anything from the perspective of the evil sister and i wanted to know her a little so i was disappointed a story worth reading","177":" ending this book reminded me of an old hindi saying i love which goes like this khatha ki lamhe ne sazaa payee sadiyoon ne translation a moment erred and centuries suffered guzeman' debut novel is without a doubt one of those books which explore relationships in a non judgemental way it doesn't preach it doesn't have a hero or a heroine the protagonist at the core of everything around whom the story revolves instead it can be described as a narration of decisions gone wrong of mistakes being made of misunderstandings and wrong judgement calls it can be described as being utterly and purely an exploration of what it is to be human it has in all its rawness characters which can be best termed as grey no one is so good that the person comes across as a doormat nor is anyone so evil that redemption is not possible its another thing though that you may be too late to fix mistakes right the wrongs or even get an opportunity to apologize at age 28 an eccentric brilliant artist thomas bayber crosses paths with the kesslar sisters - alice u0026amp natalie in the summer of 1963 when the girls with their parents rent a cabin in thomas' neighborhood a 14 year old alice who suffers from rheumatoid arthritis has a great deal of interest in ornithology and her older sister natalie at 17 she has suddenly turned against her own family and this is not her being a teen rebel no natalie is rather driven by circumstances to hate her family 44 years later thomas entrusts the responsibility of locating the sisters to his most ardent fan and friend dennis finch - a university professor and thomas's personal authenticator along with stephen jameson - a disgraced art expert they have to find the missing two pieces of a triptych that the sisters have - of a never seen or catalogued painting by thomas his most scandalous piece ever the subjects of the painting being the sisters u0026amp himself also makes it thomas' most personal piece what thomas does not reveal to dennis u0026amp stephen is the search for the missing pieces means to him a lot more than he is letting on it isn't mere monetary profits he is seeking what he is seeking means to him a lot more what unravels over the course of this search is thomas' history with the sisters and secrets which affect their lives secrets which came into existence based on decisions made sometimes on a spur of the moment which have consequences that impact them for a lifetime whether these decisions were mistakes made of a momentary lapse of judgement or urge to hurt or conscious choices is ambiguous all the while depicting dennis u0026amp stephen's own stories in co relation to their finds making them question some of the things in their lives while regretting others without a doubt one of the most beautiful and exhaustive pieces i have read in a while guzeman is an author to watch out for her lyrical prose is an enchanting work of art this review can also be found at my blog","178":"i won this from a goodreads giveaway but wasn't expecting too much from it however it surprised me a lot the writing was wonderful and the story mysterious there were a lot of twists i wasn't expecting most of which worked well but there was one at the end i felt was a little unnecessary","179":"started out so well with intriguing characters and just petered out once mystery parts began to be solved lost all character development along the way ended with a whimper","180":"pretty solid contemporary fiction reminded me of the sense of an ending from time to time both draw me into the mystery while i sat there hating myself for being interested in trivial matters of trivial lives both seem to revolve around character development but the characters don't seem quite realistic dynamic or complex enough come to think of it the sense of an ending did a better job in that department merits it's an interesting glimpse into the world of art authentication plus there's the inevitable appeal of a roudtrip to hunt down missing persons i guess it's supposed to make you wary of wasting your life either emotionally abusing others or letting yourself be emotionally abused i guess so not mind blowing but certainly not garbage","181":"this was one of those books that is upsetting in a good way when you are desperately frustrated with the characters for being stupid and you try hard to understand why they do what they do but thanks to the lovely and deliberate writing of tracy guzeman you believe it because the choices we make when we are young and emotional and stupid can haunt us the rest of our lives","182":" a love story that is less about love than about the spaces between what is seen and not seen what lies beneath the surface is as important in the gravity of birds as what is evident sisters a family both torn apart and held together by their interactions with the artist thomas bayber there are too many traps here for the reviewer anything i could say would be a spoiler what lies beneath the surface is as important in the gravity of birds as what is evident sisters a family both torn apart and held together by their interactions with the artist thomas bayber the search for a lost masterwork here we have the beauty and the intellect deception and discovery strength within weakness a near perfect beautifully written debut that refuses to be put down until all the pieces are drawn together many in unexpected ways there is much here about art and artifice but also about the multi dimensional experience of life of what we choose to grasp of ourselves and of others and what we inevitably remain blind to either by choice or by inattention","183":"really enjoyed this book good characters you could get a feel for who they were where they were coming from there was more you wanted to know but the book ended in a way that you could imagine what followed","184":"i started this book while vacationing with my family in a birdwatcher's paradise the wings of house finches doves and jays blurred outside the windows with an occasional hummingbird darting to and fro as i sunk deeply into the story of the kessler sisters artist thomas bayber and the 'detectives' denny finch and stephen jameson i loved so much about this book from the quirky flawed characters to the beautifully rendered geography to the presence of avian life throughout what began as a book about an artist two girls and the missing sections of a triptych morphed unexpectedly into a compelling mystery shaped by family secrets and a weighty meditation on loss and regret i might have given the book five stars were it not for the questions i was left with about natalie's pathological cruelty i also appreciated the vibrancy of agnete and would have enjoyed more of her perhaps a sequel","185":"beautifully written incredibly engaging i read it in one sitting visual art via storytelling is not easily created but tracy guzeman does it here the beauty and pain that she's able to convey through these thoroughly believable characters was almost overwhelming at times if you're looking for a story to make your heart ache this is a good one to choose definitely a favorite","186":"i loved this book so many by lines and clues tense family relationships missed opportunities and the quest for missing paintings or models from the painting unlikely matches of characters with all the pieces coming together at the end i didn't want this one to end","187":"there's a haunting mystery at the heart of tracy guzeman's beautifully written debut novel brilliant reclusive painter thomas bayber who hasn't painted in decades and now lives in near squalor reveals a painting no one knew existed a portrait of sisters alice and natalie kessler the piece will fetch millions at auction but bayber demands that the missing kessler girls be found before the painting is sold natalie and alice vanished years ago and the story centers around what it was that wrenched the sisters apart irrevocably bound them together and connected them both to the world renowned artist there is something gravely important at stake in finding them not just for bayber and the kesslers but also for the two men tasked with the search the gravity of birds is lovely and gripping and exceptionally well written guzeman's talent is impressive and i can't wait to read more from her","188":" part love story part detective novel famous painter thomas bayber enlists the help of an art historian and an art evaluator to find two of his lost paintings only that his real motive was to get dennis finch and the odd but endearing stephen jameson to find a long lost love and their daughter while there are plot twists thrown for good measure the pacing of the story is rather slow -- especially at alice's chapters -- so it was plodding at parts my fave chapters were those on stephen and finch although the main theme of the story must be about jealously and dependence","189":"very intriguing kept my interest thought provoking","190":"i guess i'm in the minority i gave up on this one couldn't get into it","191":"a lovely novel gripping at times and enjoyed the story","192":"fabulous book that i couldn't put down from the 1st page love the characters and their relationships love how the story was told as a mystery","193":"there were surprised throughout this story to keep things moving i really liked it","194":"local author's first novel excellent story combines memorable insights about what makes great art with a detective story that surprises at the end tries to be a little too clever here and there but otherwise well worth the read","195":"read in gulp on a flight home from the east coast a tender story believable characters brought a tear to my eye once or twice but not in a maudlin way","196":"3 5 stars i really enjoyed the way the author crafts a sentence rich and lush descriptions painting her own picture with words but the plot at times did not flow smoothly i've read quite a few books that jump back and forth in time and this author was not as skilled in that type of narrative","197":"great read for bookclub","198":"i struggled to finish this the only reason i did was that i got a copy for review and felt obliged to finish and review it the second half was better than the first half but in general very little actually happens the language is very descriptive and for me the incessant descriptions seemed almost trying to hide the basic and uninspiring plot for a book that spends most of it's time describing we don't really get a complete enough picture of the relationships in the book especially that of the sisters the relationship between thomas and alice is unrealistic to me it moves too fast and ends too abruptly i don't understand anyone's motivation and did not connect with any character in the book a generally disappointing read for me","199":"this review has been hidden because it contains spoilers to view it click here probably the best fiction i've read since kathryn stockett's the help i have given it five stars but i would have liked to have the lose ends of the novel tied a little better there was a true conclusion but i feel like after the build up and development of the characters it ended rather abruptly looking forward to more novels by this author","200":" the premise was interesting but the characters were both unlikable and unrelatable the story did not pull me in and the twist at the end was hardly unexpected at the back of my book is a q u0026amp a with the author one of the questions is why she chose to write it her answer because she had just always wanted to write a novel another question was which character she identified with the most her answer jameson because they both like salty snacks if the author has no compelling reason to tell a story no emotional attachment and cannot even identify with her own characters it is all too apparent to the readers this story could have been something incredible but instead lacked feeling","201":"couldn't put it down","202":"i had not heard of this book when i picked it up from the library and therefore didn't expect much but was so pleasantly surprised beautiful writing varied story lines great character development","203":"this is one of the best books i've read this year so beautifully written with a deeply absorbing plot each chapter left me wanting to read more for me it was the perfect combination of art and artists families with their pain jealousies and love art lost and found and finally the grace of the human spirit a wonderful first novel","204":"great book family dynamics and unexpected twists","205":"arc for review for booktowne","206":"read for bookclub good not great","207":"thomas bayber meets teen sisters natalie and alice at their neighboring summer homes in 1963 forty some years later thomas is a renowned artist and reveals to his biographer finch that there is another painting that no one has known about he shows it to finch and art expert james and will allow them to auction it if they can find natalie and alice who are the painting's subjects thus begins an intricate look back through all the history between thomas and the girls","208":"this was a quick read with interesting and likable characters it could have used a little more development of some of the characters and the constant time skips were a little confusing and a little more detail in general as the speed was a little fast but i enjoyed it overall","209":" i read most of this book in the course of one day when i was home sick it was a bit slow for me to get into but once i was in i was all in the combination of an art mystery and trying to find the elusive subject was very well done one of the most satisfying aspects for me was that the way the author described the fictional artist's work was so well done that i could picture the style i was also impressed that the author gave one of her characters a nasty disease that isn't often referenced in fiction rheumatoid arthritis a good friend of mine has this and i see her struggle with the pain and the stiffness and all that it causes i thought the depiction in the book was an accurate and sensitive portrayal","210":"the story was good but too descriptive interesting characters surprising ending","211":" title the gravity of birdsauthor tracy guzemanpublisher harpercollins ukpublication date 15th august 2013a haunting debut of love in all its forms the

however i was totally wrong it was amazing and written so beautifully i just adored every moment reading it especially as i finished it in two days and even after finishing i still can't get it out of my mind we meet sisters alice and natalie on a summer family holiday on their lakeside they were once close however when alice fell in love with a struggling young painter thomas bayber natalie in years to come was jealous of alice by the end of that summer three lives were shattered now decades later thomas now a well known artist reveals a portrait of himself with alice u0026amp natalie from that summer but the sisters themselves are hidden away thomas employees the help of two guys to help find the missing paintings and the sisters alice u0026amp natalie too tracy guzeman has done a terrific job of writing this book so beautifully and adorably i did adore it so much i loved the way each chapter flicked between different dates but you can easily follow each chapter with what is unfolding in every chapter i loved warming up to the characters especially alice i felt kinda sorry for her in a way especially because of the way her sister natalie betrayed her and could do such a nasty thing like that not going to do any spoilers though hehe i feel this book is one to cherish on your own and not to be spoiled i adored and will be passing on the books to all my friends u0026amp family certainly deserved the 5 5 rating","212":"a true gem a literary fictional story with interesting characters i would invite to dinner a twist at the end i didn't see coming and a great story or as i found out today meeting the author 2 short stories which formed the basis of this novel the words are carefully chosen and compiled in the most sequences creating a strong visual image i learned about art authentication i didn't know anything about sit back and enjoy this well crafted story","213":"slow start but couldn't put it down past page 100 amazing detail great characters mystery and intrigue","214":"tracy guzeman does herself proud in this first novel i love art and i love mystery i did not anticipate all the twists and turns which was great","215":"my biggest criticism is that some if the characters were undeveloped u0026amp therefore confusing to follow however as a first fiction it had an interesting plot","216":"a good read for anyone who feels like they've screweed up their life these people have got to trump you","217":"this was a little slow for me to get into but after i was in it rolled right along and was filled with ah ha moments that kept me hooked this was a book club read and i highly recommend for book clubs because there is a lot to discuss i also want to mention that someone in my club emailed the author with questions she had about the book and tracy guzeman was nice enough to write back","218":"probably 3 5 stars but i just never wanted to go back to this book so i'm rounding down it's not badly written and in fact many of the characters are quite well drawn but it just didn't grab me it's a time shifting narrative which is not my favorite of two sisters their relationships with each other and with a reclusive artist and a search for missing valuable paintings the two big plot twists are fairly predictable or at least heavily telegraphed which may have been intentional i wanted to like it i just didn't really one to skip","219":"i really enjoyed this book if you appreciate art and the complexity of relationships you will enjoy i appreciated how the story unfolded part by part i really nice read","220":"this was a beautifully crafted book that drew one in from the start whether you liked or disliked each character you needed to know them their stories made you think about how we all make choices that change the course of our own lives and that of others choices we believe are sound at the time they are made but do not stand the test of time i read it at one sitting unable to put it down","221":"could not get through it","222":"thanks to my reading group i have once again been blessed by reading a book that otherwise i never would have bothered with i learned about birds and i learned about the world of art two things that are not featured prominently in my day by day this book awakened a deep interest in both it has so much to offer betrayal upended lives family secrets and redemption the unusual illness of one of the key characters lends a very distinct backdrop to the drama and mystery if you read it you will be glad you did","223":"found it slow moving","224":"i liked this book a lot at times i found the writing overly descriptive a bit of sensory overload so i'd skip sentences here and there overall a good story i found myself thinking it would make a good movie if done well","225":"beautifully written guzeman puts the art on the page and writes the characters in a likeable sympathetic way even way they should not be likeable and would not be likeable people a beautiful story with a satisfying ending","226":"riveting abso utely loved it","227":"lots of twists and turns but a good story very interesting characters too that made me want to know 'what happens next'","228":" the gravity of birds is a story of two sisters torn apart and held together by secrets and words left unsaid of an artist haunted by memories and regret and ultimately a study in how the choices we make and our perceptions and misperceptions shape our experience of life a haunting and beautifully written debut novel that explores art and artifice what is seen and unseen what lies below the surface and in all the spaces in between this book will linger in your consciousness long after you have exited its pages","229":"i enjoyed this book and most of it's characters it's more of a three and half star but i did look forward to reading it each time it tried to have a few twists and some worked while others fell flat or seemed too coincidental","230":"excellent one of the best books i've read this year the story line was unpredictable with interesting characters","231":"tracy guzeman is my new favorite author good read will look forward to her next novel","232":" it took me a while to get into it but once i did i was hooked and liked this book very much not so much a who dun it as a where are they this story is a tangle of one complex family and an illustrious legendary artist he effected the girls when they were girls which in turn made him effect the women when they were women he struggles through his fame unable to hold relationships unable to open the doors to his heart very wide or for very long the women move on and make due with a chasm of unspoken resentment and pain stuck fast between them this was a real story plausible misunderstanding lack of communication assumption love fear misconception lies and secrets ornithology birdsong hands reaching out into nothingness crippling illness money and peerless art abandoned children mothers in prison mothers in secret mothers dead the twists were indeed twisty and surprising a reminder about what life can look like at 'the end' when we've lived with our heads in the sand end game who loses who flies away who joins the flock","233":" how can find someone who wants to be lost sisters alice and natalie were once close but as they get older they drift apart malice is a dreamer who loves birds and books and natalie is headstrong every summer the family go to their lakeside cabin and here alice falls under the spell of an uprising artist called thomas who is over a decade older so begins a story that spreads over 3 decades thomas has been extremely successful but is now a recluse and the 2 sisters have disappeared but what secrets r they all hiding i have a few questions who was the father of natalie's child did thomas leave a will and who would benefit from the forthcoming sale did stephen get his life and career back on track how did he feel when he learnt agnete was his half sister was her work opened up to a wider audience a wonderful compelling novel with great characterisation bev","234":"i really enjoyed this book the story is unusual and unexpectedly touching","235":"i wish this book had more about the backstory line the house at the lake and the meeting between the sisters and the artist nonetheless it's a compelling novel it has a lot more to do with art than i originally anticipated","236":"so glad i had the opportunity to read this great book i couldn't put it down","237":"this book surprised me while the premise and plot were as described the voice and tone were not what i anticipated how refreshing i felt as though the characters themselves were mysteries and that they revealed themselves slowly as the story progressed my only fault with the book is that as much as i got to discover alice stephen and dr finch i feel natalie remained an enigma that may be a deliberate choice but i would have enjoyed her voice in the narrative of the story","238":"superbly brilliant a must read","239":" the cover of the gravity of birds is truly beautiful i loved the colours and the scene in the picture caught my attention straight away i also was caught by the tagline \"that summer everything changed\"... it had me intrigued instantly - what had changed who was affected it made me very keen to start reading the gravity of birds begins with two sisters alice and natalie alice is a dreamer whilst natalie is very headstrong girl whilst on a holiday with their family alice is drawn in by thomas a painter thomas offers to do a painting for them but by the end of the summer their lives have been changed decades later thomas is now a very famous artist and it comes to light that there is a portrait of himself with alice and natalie but the two sisters have disappeared will thomas let the past stay there or use the painting to resurrect the past ...i thoroughly enjoyed the gravity of birds the writing is so delicately and beautifully worded i managed to completely lose myself in this story the novel moves backwards and forwards between time and with the focus shifting from one character to another although this sounds confusing tracy guzeman wrote it in such a way that it flowed effortlessly and seamlessly from one section to the next i found the two sisters completely fascinating i particularly enjoyed reading about alice and natalie's background stories and learning about what had happened to them in the past alice and natalie were the main reason that i was so gripped to the novel i was desperate to read on because i genuinely cared about them i constantly wanted to find out more about their journey and to discover the truth about what had happened it was a very emotional read i went through a wide range of feelings and became very involved with the story i felt such a connection with a few of the characters and i was up late at night turning the page the descriptions of the scenes were very vivid and realistic i could picture every moment in my mind and i felt as though i was actually there in the scenes watching the events unfold in front of me i don't want to spoil the story because it is one of those novels where you unravel more details as you progress through the story and the details come out at exactly the right moment what i will say is that they story surprised me it touched me and i was still thinking about the characters long after i had turned the last page there is a huge air of mystery in this novel and i particularly enjoyed gleaning little bits of information at a time which slowly built up to the bigger picture the gravity of birds is a beautifully written and emotional story which is both rich in detail and with a collection of intriguing characters that you will want to know more about i was drawn into this compelling novel from the beginning and i would thoroughly recommend it the gravity of birds had me captivated...this is a truly special story","240":"i really enjoyed this book there were little twists and turns along the way that i wasn't expecting the detail about the art world was a bonus many of the characters i loved and the outcome was a bit surprising","241":"i can't believe i actually finished this book and not sure why i stuck with it the premise sounded promising enough and there were elements i enjoyed such as the references to birds and art and some plot twists however i found it very slow and plodding yet confusing at the same time i kept having to pause and remind myself which character was which","242":"really didn't care for this one despite high praise from lots of friends i found the prose elementary and forced the dialogue stilted and the character development nil oh and the story was preposterous and didn't hook me in the least bummer","243":" beautifully written with some great sections of how life is complicated and even more so by the decisions you make a story about how fear resentment and love can guide you down a path you wish could go back change realizations that it's to late my only faults is i wish there's was more character on character conversation there was almost to much setting descriptions but it was written beautifully also the two story lines converging felt rushed towards the end perhaps alice and thomas views were intentionally left out for the reader to feel sad but i only feel rushed and slightly disappointed in the closure of this novel","244":"not so much about birds more about art and particularly about the past and grudges and memories and holding on or out for a long time it's a mystery without a murder rare and pretty interesting i enjoyed reading it interesting how the older sister never gets a voice but almost everyone else does her motives and life remain quite a mystery i noticed that the book never speculates on her reasons or feelings about her secrets which is a hole in the story this would be a good book club book","245":"i loved the writing all of the characters grew on me as i got further into the book i thought about the book when i wasn't reading and i couldn't wait to get back to it it's on my list of best books ever","246":"i absolutely loved this book the mystery and the voices of each character were well written this is one of my favorite books","247":"the gravity of birds is a hauntingly beautiful and sad book i'm in awe of this which is tracy guzeman's first novel it revolves around the hunt for two lost pieces of a triptych by a dying famous artist we meet some remarkable characters along the way and learn a good deal about art authentication i liked these words do not let grief be the only map you carry lest you lose your way back to happiness and these the estimation of an artist's talent is often based on his ability to render both light and shadow if you have any choice in the matter spend your time in the former i read this book in two days i couldn't put it down","248":"absolutely loved this beautifully written engaging absorbing tale will be reading more from this author this story will stay with me for a very long time","249":" i had very mixed feelings about this book i liked the plot and the pacing and the suspense i did not like the characters very much at all natalie was wholly unlikeable and the reasons for that did not strike me as strong enough to explain her actions as for alice i kind of wanted to shake her and get her to join the world again and that's about all i can say without spoilers the author completely skips over what should have been a pivotal scene later in the book the writing was pretty good and with more likable characters and better motivations for them i would have given this 4 stars","250":"easily devoured this well written story full of quirky but believable characters well planned points of view cohesive themes and mostly believable twists cleverly revealed through flashbacks and perspective hope to see more by this author","251":"awesome multi layered and very interesting kept me guessing till the last page very real life characters not all good not all bad complicated just like real people not fast moving but hard to put down i highly recommend","252":"this was a great book","253":"i loved this book the story kept me interested to the very last page","254":"i don't often write a review about books i have read but enjoy reading what others think of books i choose to read i am not sure why i chose 'the gravity of birds' maybe the cover attracted me but it proved to be worth every minute hour i spent turning the pages sometimes going back to re read a page as i didn't want to miss anything it was a wonderful read i will look for more of tracy guzeman","255":" book club choice and one of our very discriminating members loved this book it was good for me so it could be better or even best for you i enjoyed the look into the world of art and artists galleries and authentication the family mystery was well done and it kept me guessing until almost the end the pace as a bit slow for me and when i had unlocked the next piece of the mystery the writing seemed to be took leading for too long as if the reader didn't yet make the connection some characters made great sense while i wondered the motive of others over all a good read a good mystery and and glimpse into a world unknown to me","256":"this review has been hidden because it contains spoilers to view it click here this book started off slow for me but the characters quickly became interesting and memorable i think the author was on to an excellent storyline but some of the storytelling was so obtuse that it wasn't totally clear to me what was supposed to be happening spoiler alert the ending had massive potential but i felt like it unraveled a bit it would've been a great opportunity to tie some of those loose ends together it never became clear to me if natalie had been raped gotten pregnant by t this book started off slow for me but the characters quickly became interesting and memorable i think the author was on to an excellent storyline but some of the storytelling was so obtuse that it wasn't totally clear to me what was supposed to be happening spoiler alert the ending had massive potential but i felt like it unraveled a bit it would've been a great opportunity to tie some of those loose ends together it never became clear to me if natalie had been raped gotten pregnant by thomas gotten pregnant by george reston jr did stephen keep his job was there a happily ever after for him and how did agnete so easily except her mother showing up one day and the men showing up one day later and why did natalie feel the need to rename sophia agnete the author is clearly very talented and her writing style was engaging but i feel like her editor did her disservice by not helping clean up some of these edges more","257":" i would give this novel eight stars if i could i selected this for our book club but i cannot remember how i came across it probably goodreads what a treasure this novel turned out to be i must admit i was slow getting into it but by chapter 3 i could not put this book down so much intertwining of people's lives so many twists and turns so many puzzles to solve the characters were well developed with such depth at times that i felt sympathy or empathy for even the most unlikable characters without providing any spoilers there is a scene at the end of the book with a photo on the hearth that i felt was a bit unbelievable but thomas was quite the cad so maybe the scenery was well detailed the symbols were strikingly eloquent the detail about the art world and painting was sufficient for the story yet allowed for the heart of this tale to remain center stage bottom line i just loved this book","258":"i was intrigued after the first chapter unfortunately the book went downhill from there i found there were too many minor characters that i just did not care about i wanted to find out about the painting as the unraveling of art history is usually quite interesting but not here i found this novel tedious there were a few good chapters when alice gets caught in the rain but overall not what i thought it would be i do think the author has a great grasp on character writing i felt like i could picture them just didn't care enough to read their atory","259":"unique and interesting a bit sad but worth the read","260":"i loved this book the writing was engaging and it was a type of mystery trying to figure out how all the pieces of the story were coming together when it was done i went back and read some of the pages again just so i could visit with the people again","261":"barely a 3 i was pulled into this story of two sisters and a lost painting that has them as the subject but it just got away from me as i read by the end i didn't really appreciate the intricacies of the plot though the writing is good","262":"seventeen year old natalie kessler is beautiful sullen and determined to have things her own way her brainy younger sister alice plans to become an ornithologist while on vacation with their parents they each develop crushes on the moody artist in the neighboring cabin thomas bayber who does some sketches of the family ten years later alice is forced to give up her graduate studies by the debilitating effects of rheumatoid arthritis wanting to be alone to come to terms with the death of her dream alice retreats to the same lakeside cabin not knowing that thomas now well on his way to fame will also be there an intense but brief liaison ensues after which they go their separate ways the second half of the novel takes place decades later the kessler sisters are now living secluded lives in tennessee and alice is completely dependent upon natalie and their housekeeper thomas has succumbed to alcoholism squandered his fortune and become a recluse he has long since been supported by dennis finch the art historian who wrote the catalog on bayber's work now he summons finch and disgraced authenticator stephen jameson to locate a heretofore unseen triptych that he painted from the kessler sketches the gravity of birds has a complicated plot told in a series of alternating flashbacks and present day scenarios there are two mysteries to unravel why did the sisters leave new england so precipitously and why did thomas send finch and jameson on this close to impossible quest there are poetic and fairy tale elements in the narrative that create an almost gothic other worldly atmosphere it is easy to empathize with each character so much so that the revelation of the novel's central mystery comes as a blow if the novel has faults they lie in the resolution which relies too heavily on serendipity to be entirely credible nevertheless it's an impressive debut by an accomplished writer i finished it last week and it's been staying with me i look forward to ms guzeman's future work","263":"good story lots of family secrets some of which are not revealed until the final pages quirky characters and plot that hunts for missing paintings and missing sisters","264":"i really enjoyed this book loved the writing style had lots of twists and turns","265":"too many subplots and characters i found it tedious without any redeeming value felt a bit overwritten in places like the author was trying too hard to make this literary without really succeeding","266":"alice and natalie kessler were 14 and 16 years old sisters on vacation with their parents at the same lakeside cabin the family has rented for years this year 1963 thomas bayber a talented artist is staying in the cabin next door the girls enjoy spending time with thomas talking about birds and nature even though he is twice their age the girls exhibit typical sibling rivalry for the attention of thomas and because he lives close to where the family vacations the sisters manage to see him every summer until 1971 flash forward to 2007 and thomas is no longer painting he lives the life of a recluse in ny thomas has a never before revealed work of himself and the sisters in a somewhat compromising portrait from one summer when they spent time together the the side panels of the triptych are missing and he enlists the help of 2 men in the art profession dennis an authenticator and stephen a historian to not only find the missing panels but also to find these long lost sisters it took me a while to get into this story as the beginning was a slow moving for me this is the type of novel that is going to take patience on the part of the reader for several reasons it's a story that starts in 1963 and ends in 2007 and moves back and forth in time there are several threads which run though this story which is challenging in itself and there are quite a few unlikable characters as well to the author's credit the writing shows promise vivid prose a mystery to unravel and great details about art it's a subject you can tell the author is passionate about i wanted to love this debut novel but it had just a bit too much going on in it for me","267":"one of the best books i've ever read a dense and mesmerizing tale quite unforgettable and thought provoking","268":" the bookish dame reviews i'm sorry it took me such a long time to get to this book what a gentle and fulfilling read it was i was moved by the prose and the storyline all together ms guzeman has a way with words that gets to the heart of her characters this is a novel that will live in my mind for months i'm sure after i've left the pages i was completely taken up by the gentle way we are brought into the very shaky relationships in the novel as none of them seem to be steeped in longevity or planted in deep soil upon first observance the girls alice and natalie whom we meet as sisters almost immediately are soft rivals alice the do right girl and natalie the hard shelled one and poor stephen the young art authenticator is nearly rootless and blind to the hard facts of an art world with little room for human error then we meet the artist at the center of the novel thomas bayber who is a picture of many facets of humanity seemingly self absorbed the storyline is a simple one in finding the girls whose picture bayer painted on a long ago summer time along a coastal area but the underlying story is one of self discovery on all their counts a psychological study of the individuals a finding of not only the painting s but of the metal that holds each person to each other and together themselves this is a beautifully wrought novel full of gorgeous word pictures and deeply held sayings it's a book to read and reread one i'll keep for a long time it's the story of healing of the mind body and soul which we all can take a note from i simply loved the book highly recommended 5 stars deborah thebookishdame","269":"i wish this weren't tracy guzeman's first novel because i wanted to read the others hope she writes another soon this was a good story with strong characters and many surprises some mystery some romance some tears can't go wrong here","270":" i love this book i just finished it and can tell it will stay with me for awhile loved the dynamics between the characters ironically the ugliness in this book is what makes it beautiful possible spoiler below can i just say that the author was so spot on in that scene between alice and thomas in the beginning the tension was unbelievable alice's feelings and thoughts were written so beautifully any woman who has been in love with a man she couldn't or shouldn't have has had that exact feeling","271":" tracy guzeman's the gravity of birds get your hands on ittracy guzeman's 1st novel the gravity of birds is some kind of debut the story takes place over a 44 year period here is goodreads' synopsis of the book sisters natalie and alice kessler were close until adolescence wrenched them apart natalie is headstrong manipulative--and beautiful alice is a dreamer who loves books and birds during their family's summer holiday at the lake alice falls under the thrall of a struggling young painter thomas bayber in whom she finds a kindred spirit natalie however remains strangely unmoved sitting for a family portrait with surprising indifference but by the end of the summer three lives are shattered decades later bayber now a reclusive world renowned artist unveils a never before seen work kessler sisters--a provocative painting depicting the young thomas natalie and alice bayber asks dennis finch an art history professor and stephen jameson an eccentric young art authenticator to sell the painting for him that task becomes more complicated when the artist requires that they first locate natalie and alice who seem to have vanished and finch finds himself wondering why thomas is suddenly so intent on resurrecting the past in the gravity of birds histories and memories refuse to stay buried in the end only the excavation of the past will enable its survivors to love again there are more protagonists than bit players and each is interesting in his her own way alice kessler sister with rheumatoid arthritisnatalie kessler sister with beauty and lots of secretsthomas bayber tortured artistdennis finch university professor and thomas's personal authenticatorstephen jameson disgraced art expertthe book is beautifully written in fact the only reason i gave it a 3 5 instead of a 4 is on me not tracy this is a book that does not rely on dialogue although there's plenty of it instead it oftentimes relies on long and descriptive passages and although the writing is excellent i found my mind on occasion wandering let me restate that this is about my concentration and not tracy's writing if i can make a comparison i would liken it somewhat to barbara kingsolver i finally read my 1st kingsolver flight behavior last year i have been hearing for many years what a great writer she is i have to tell you that i liked the book but didn't love it but just like tracy the writing is largely descriptive with some dialogue and let me also tell you that i thought tracy's writing beat the heck out of kingsolver's writing i know that there are 4 months left in the year but i'm pretty darn sure that the gravity of birds will be in my top 10 for all of 2013 and out of 70 books that ain't too shabby","272":"so many twists and turns just when you think you have everything figured out she throws you another curve ball","273":"this book was irritating i found myself wanting it to just be over the descriptions were too long the characters were whiny i couldn't find any character that i really liked the story line was dragged out until the very end and then it ended without resolution on several things i'm just glad it's over","274":"i kept hoping for an ending that would justify having gone through the whole book i was disappointed the book was okay but eh","275":"a wonderful tale of family secrets and art gozeman did a fabulous job of writing a novel from multiple perspectives each character was interesting and multifaceted finch was my personal favorite","276":" at first i didn't like this book i found some of characters rather unsettling and did not know if i really wanted to know more of their story but i decided to pick up the book again a few days later and found myself lost in their world trying to uncover the secrets and lies surrounding these people the gravity of birds explores the extremely complicated relationship between two sisters especially when one sister has a disability that will always tie her sister to her you feel pity for these sisters but at different times you wonder if either sister truly deserves pity or if they are just awful people it's the idea that we all need pity at times and we all feel like terrible people inside at times that helps us to understand these women and encourages us to read on and learn more the mystery of this book kept me hooked until the end even though i had figured out many of the answers long before the characters did in the end i really enjoyed this book and found myself eagerly awaiting my next trip on the subway and my next chance to read more","277":" review orginally posted at http stephinlondon com 2013 08 08 b i didn't dislike the gravity of birds let me just start off by saying that guzeman's writing was lyrical and quite beautiful and painted a gorgeous picture... but it really wasn't my thing i was intrigued by the blurb on the back and indeed the first 50 or so pages had me gripped but somehow after that i wasn't as into it there was nothing wrong with the writing itself or the characters-in fact i loved jameson and saisee i felt alice's pain in dealing with ra as well as her gut wrenching grief i did find the plot to be like an episode of heir hunters and slightly unbelievable and i wasn't on board with the final twist at the end-i think the book would have had more believability if it weren't for that others i imagine will love the plot twist... i think it might be a bit like marmite again this wasn't a bad book-it's had loads of amazing reviews from a variety of authors and websites guzeman's novel was very well written and heartbreakingly beautiful in description at times but it just wasn't for me","278":"a beautifully written masterfully crafted literary novel i loved this book with its beautiful descriptions of art and its amazingly empathetic characters there is just enough mystery to keep you going and just enough love betrayal and heartache and reconciliation to make for great literature","279":"i bought this book by mistake though i was interested in it a little perturbed at myself until i started reading it my goodness it pulls you into the lives it encompasses and holds the reader in it's palm even at the end there is more to come enjoy","280":" loved this book for the cover love books about families the art part not so much hence the three stars for my review told between 3 different characters i did find that part interesting and not so boring hard to pull off but tracy did for myself something just didn't work for me with this book i felt a bit deprived i just lacked something that really held my attention also i felt as if i didn't really understand the title after reading this book i also felt as if it could have been a bit dragged out at times although the sister act does work it is a bit been there done that still i hope you try it for yourself","281":"guzeman's writing was lyrical cassandra campbell's narration was lovely and the plot was interesting but this novel was very depressing a treatise on how one woman's evil destroyed the lives around her there was great inconsistency and naivete in the actions of the characters which made the story seem less believable i think a better editor could have taken this novel to the next level","282":"slow start brilliant remainder love","283":"couldn't get into it had to stop","284":"i really enjoyed this book i'd not heard of it i only found it while browsing at the library i'm glad i did i found this book lyrical it had great ebb and flow of action and the foreshadowing sometimes misled you note to self potential for bookclub","285":"this is one of those books that when you start to read it the premise sounds very familiar i got 68 pages into it and i stopped and had to think hey did i read this already i always keep a track record of what i have read just for these moments but i didn't have this book on my list then i thought well maybe it was on my list of books to read and nope was it made into a movie nope hmm it still bothers me after reading it it was very good and i liked how it was more a mystery than it was a love triangle which is the category i chose this book for for my 50 book challenge i like the symbolism of birds and how they're used throughout the story","286":" this one was in my to read list here i didn't remember anymore why i put it in the list when i saw it in the library i just knew it was on the list my list is not that long so i know which books are in it so i took it the first chapters were promising but later on it became clear that it is a romantic roman with a soap opera plot i used to read those before and they were entertaining and i founf myself wishing for the characters to be loved and happy but in this book no character was interesting enough or even deep enough to symphatize with and the plot itself was not very trilling after all that around the last 80 pages i found myself skipping pages and eventually decided that i could live happily ever after without knowing how it ended also i want to add that i was dissapointed with some sexism and ageism in this book not only that every time natalie and alice were reffered to as the 2 women in the painting when they were 17 and 13 in the painting not women when 70 years old finch looks at the photo of natalie when she was 28 his thought is old natalie is still an attractive woman right because she so old than the woman of 17 he saw in the painting","287":" i really enjoyed this book and appreciated how much of it had to do with art and artists being married to an artist the book really resonated with me despite the fact that my husband's personality is not at all like the protagonist's the central character in this book is thomas bayber an artist of great renown but who has not painted anything for over twenty years he is in his seventies and living as a recluse in a dark and dingy apartment in new york city supposedly all of his paintings are accounted for and reside in the great museums with a few in the homes of some very wealthy collectors thomas decides to call dennis finch a well known art historian and expert on bayber's work to his home finch has supported bayber by paying his rent and his bills for years finch works as a writer and professor and is in mourning for the recent death of his beloved wife claire along with dennis finch bayber calls stephen jameson a strange and socially awkward man who is an expert on the authentication of art he tells them that there is a painting of his that no one has ever seen and that has been unaccounted for dennis can not believe it because he has catalogued all of bayber's work however the painting is unveiled in thomas's apartment and with time they realize that it is part of a triptych the painting is a disturbing portrait of the kessler family primarily the two daughters natalie and alice bayber gets finch to promise to find the other two parts of the triptych and this leads to a search for the people who are painted in the portrait because it is a portrait primarily of natalie and alice the thought is that they would have the answer as to the location of the missing two panels the portrait's disturbing qualities come from the way the two young girls are situated in the painting both of them looking like they are involved in some intimate way with thomas alice is about fourteen in the painting and natalie her older sister is eighteen years old alice is an intense intelligent and loving girl who loves ornithology and studies it in college she knows all the birds that flock near their summer rental which is right next door to bayber's natalie is cold and harsh with something like rage seething beneath the surface though very beautiful at first glance she spells trouble shortly after they finish college their parents die and they leave their connecticut home immediately by this time alice has come down with rheumatoid arthritis which is very debilitating and painful dennis and stephen decide that the way to find the triptych is to find natalie and alice thus begins a country wide search they both believe that it may not be the two panels of the painting that are most important to thomas but rather the finding of the kessler sisters what thomas's relationship was to them is not known but it is obvious that he has very strong feelings for them this is unusual for a man who has never had an long term relationships with women and does not seem to care about other people the book is a debut novel but it is written with panache i never for a second found anything to suggest that the author was a novice at writing she has had short stories published but this is her first novel it is fully realized with wonderful characterization and a fascinating plot that kept me on my toes for the whole ride i highly recommend this novel especially for anyone with an interest in art and artists","288":"part real life drama part mystery this book's characters were wonderfully developed while the storyline shifted from different sets of characters i found myself equally missing each set of characters as i read","289":"guzeman captured the beauty of art in her prose it's been awhile since i read a beautiful book not only that but the story of the search for lost pieces of artwork by famous artist thomas bayber was suspenseful and thrilling just like a painting that is made with many layers the story is layered in perfection with twists and turns that made me sometimes want to breeze past the prose to find out what happens just like most great novels it is tragic story with bits of redemption a common complaint about a lot of great books is that they're depressing but true fiction reflects real life and i found myself deeply emotional as part of story the relationship between two characters mirrored part of my own life a beautiful book that i can see becoming a classic","290":"a bit wordy and i loved every one","291":"wow what an intriguing story i looked up the author and there is very little written about her on the web the questions i would like answered about her much layer story like the painting in the novel are not to be answered by reading about the author's own life although it is easy to guess that such a richness in characters and plot have to come from some life experiences i hope to learn more about her and am hoping she writes another novel this was her first","292":"4 1 2 stars great story with unexpected twists and unexpected characters very well written u0026amp compelling from beginning to end","293":" i picked up my copy of 'the gravity of birds' while waiting for a train in nyc i was drawn to the cover art and did a quick look up on goodreads to see if reviews were favorable while it wasn't on my radar i'm glad i came across guzeman's first novel about love loss and complex relationships i was intrigued by the nature of storytelling jumping back and forth in time as the history of sisters natalie and alice kessler and thomas bayber unfolded some spoilers ahead professor dennis finch and art historian stephen jameson are summoned by thomas bayber world renowned painter where he unveils a previously unknown and undocumented work from his collection finch and jameson are chosen by bayber to validate the work and sell it contingent upon finding the two missing panels that complete the triptych the middle panel is a disturbing portrait of bayber flanked by the young kessler sisters whom finch and jameson must track down in order to find the missing panels a slow burn the 'the gravity of birds' gives you enough information to deduce the tragic events that occurred between the sisters and thomas while revealing shocking details along the way i enjoyed the added perspective of finch and jameson to have another set of characters that are impacted by the story of the kesslers and thomas bayber reminded me of how i am affected by them as a reader overall i enjoyed the prose although i did gloss over the more poetic passages if they had been told more from the point of view of a main character i would have appreciated it more some of my favorite passages finch tried to imagine a different life for himself but could not the loss of his wife had been devastating even now he woke in the middle of the night to find his arms stretched out to her side of the bed encircling her missing form painful as this was a life she had never been part of would have been worse how odd it was all those years spent feeling old while she'd been young and now that she couldn't be considered young anymore not by anyone's standards she didn't feel old instead she felt like she'd finally caught up with herself and was exactly the age she was supposed to be but people always do things they hadn't intended to do you're angry you allow yourself the luxury of considering a horrible though you don't have any intention of acting on it of course but you've given it a home in your head it burrows in pays attention waits for an opportunity and in the moment when something requires a decision it's right there seeming just as viable as the saner option the morally correct response so you choose and with one decision you've become a different person capable of doing something so reprehensible you convince yourself it's completely justified because why else would you be doing it and if no when you start to doubt you can't see your way back to making it right so you just keep moving forward making it wrong over and over again","294":"this is so well written and engrossing the story of 2 sisters whose parents die in a car crash when alice the younger one is in college in the 1960's she struggles with a life long battle against the disabilities caused by severe rheumatoid arthritis natalie the older sister is beautiful haughty u0026amp sure of herself when it comes to boys u0026amp men but when 2 major events threaten to destroy what little family life they have left natalie takes charge u0026amp moves them both far away to a tiny southern town so no one can find them in the mean time a famous artist thomas bayber who vacationed u0026amp painted in the cottage next to theirs when the girls were children is dying and his one hidden masterpiece may be in the girls' possession two unlikely men at the behest of the artist both struggling with personal issues go off in search of alice who may or may not be the mother of thomas' only child and in the meantime find the rest of bayber's valuable works of art the characters are so finely drawn you know that you know them when you are finished and are surprised to find that they exist only in the book several reviews speak of a haunting quality to this book that would certainly fit since you can't quite get the feeling or the images out of your mind and want always to go back to it u0026amp find out some more about these people this is guzeman's first novel and it kind of reminds me of the almost spooky rattling world of karen russell's works there are ghosts here somewhere you can feel them you just can't quite put your finger on where or who they are definitely recommended if i choose this for book club i can see right now that there will be a clear divide those who love this and those who don't get it the gravity of birds title has something to do w alice's devotion to ornithology she could hv been an excellent biologist ornithologist but circumstances prevent this also a small ceramic bird she stole from the artist","295":"when i received a copy of the gravity of birds i was excited to read it as i loved the synopsis however i found the book a let down in comparison a few chapters in i almost gave up completely as it really wasn't holding my attention the book gives you a good insight into the art world and the main characters were well developed i thought there was however a lot of characters which were not needed in the story i think the story needed a lot more to keep you focused and continuing to read to the end despite the characters being well developed where i found the story lacked substance i found it difficult to relate to the characters and feel any emotional connection to them overall the book is well written but wasn't one for me to be complete honest if i hadn't have received this as a review book from harper collins i think i would have given up on it","296":" this is a first novel by an obviously talented writer the story was certainly interesting and the characters were well drawn she captures the web of relationships nicely family and friends living and departed if i have a criticism it is that this novel relies far to heavily on the fiction of coincidence one big coincidence is acceptable to a story but when they start piling up they start to seem like laziness a shortcut out of a plot point when the author finds that she has written herself into a corner the result is that the novel seems a bit incomplete and leaves the reader with too many for me unanswered questions that being said i can hardly be too critical of anyone who has managed to complete and publish such an interesting novel that is an accomplishment deserving celebration despite my criticism i look forward to reading her future works and to seeing her talent develop","297":"i couldnt finish this it was so depressing","298":"literary fiction as its truly defined art mystery love story albeit unconventional dysfunctional family unexpected twists and turns something for everyone what's not to love interesting characters especially alice and thomas left me wanting more","299":"i was loving this book and then it betrayed me with a terrible ending betrayed","300":"elegant prose and mysterious well crafted characters -- guzeman nailed them i was constantly blown away by her lyrical writing and i'm just going to place on of my favorite quotes here to give you an idea for context he's speaking to the artist of a painting you have been praised for your rendering of minute details in your work stephen paused thinking about the first time he'd seen one of bayber's paintings it's like looking at a puzzle isn't it the longer and closer you look the more you see and once something is seen it cannot be unseen the viewer is never able to take in the piece as he did the fist time -- indeed the initial impression is gone and cannot be recalled the art history nerd in me loved every second of the discussions about art and the details they contain the family connections were especially intriguing and it was like a soft mystery throughout the course of the novel i desperately wanted to know what happened in the past to make certain characters the way they were and why some of them no longer talked with others this was just one of those books that is so thoughtful and makes you read slowly because you want to read every single word on the page and it wasn't action packed or anything and at times i felt like the plot moved excruciatingly slowly which was the only negative i took away from the book at all but even then guzeman's writing was so intriguing that it almost didn't matter","301":"loved this book","302":"i couldn't finish this book after getting two thirds of the way through it the first chapter seemed promising and i thought i would really like it the execution of the rest of the book was very poor though i didn't feel a connection with any of the characters the pace was off the author provided too many details many of them insignificant","303":"a worthwhile story written with beauty and patience i loved this read","304":"a lovely tale of sisters art orinthology betrayal parenting and love guzeman's characters are compelling and well drawn pun intended couldn't put this one down","305":"i won this book as a goodreads book advanced uncorrected proof copy i only sign up for books i think sound interesting and want to read so i was excited that i won this i struggled getting through this book at times so i would take a break and go read a second book then come back i think my struggle was i felt it was over written at times and drawn out but i give it 3 stars to me that means good as the actual storyline was intriguing enough to get me to finish it","306":"i found out about 'the gravity of birds' by tracy guzeman through an email for new literary fiction from amazon com i was drawn to this particular book because of the title and the cover art reading the synopsis put me off because i have never been a fan of stories revolving around several characters that span scores of years i'm older and i just don't feel that i can learn or even be surprised by anything people and characters in books do or don't do i just don't care anymore unfortunately for me still as i said i liked the title and cover art and you can laugh if you feel so inclined but liking the cover art has always been an indication that i will also like the story so i downloaded a sample to my kindle i loved it right away and i loved it to the very end this book never dragged in it's narrative it never became boring tracy has a gift with words her prose seems sparse and yet lyrical she knows how to say just enough to make you pay attention and savor the words so that you don't miss a nuance and you have to do that when you read this book she doesn't always reveal the mysteries of the story she hints and perhaps teases the reader to pay attention this jaded reader loved her technique this story had me in tears and i had sympathy for all the characters this is tracy's only book so far and i hope she will write and publish another one soon i am definitely a fan please read this book","307":"i loved this book art birds and the complicated ways we struggle with our losses and navigate through our relationships brilliantly written story i'm looking forward to her next books","308":"really a great book i wished for more of an ending","309":" wow talk about a family dynamic this is a very quick read with a great story and great writing i stayed frustrated with the relationship between the kessler sisters but felt sure there was more to the story the unfolding and unravelling of these is lives is fascinating the descriptions of thomas bayber's art made me wish he was real the symbolic use of the bird and the cage were right on the relationship between finch and jameson was a nice bit of comic relief in an otherwise intense story great debut novel","310":"i wanted to give this 4 stars because i didn't like the ending but i couldn't deny this book the credit due trisha r you will love this one","311":"art infirmity the brokenness of families and the possibility of redemption with just a little bit of mystery i almost gave up on this one but about half way through it kicked in the writing was good from the beginning but i just wasn't sure i cared enough about the characters until i did true to form i read the last page after having read about two chapters it spoiled some things of course but not everything the book still was able to surprise me","312":" in my opinion tracy guzeman is a writer that comes along once in a generation she is to writing what beethoven was to music the gravity of birds is her first book and what i hope will be only one of many it's a compelling intimate yet lush story about a small group of people that are at once fragile fierce loving selfish and all too human the style of her writing its craft talent and expertise makes the reader loathe to leave each page but eager to move forward the ending is beyond satisfying i actually dried some tears from my eyes if you're only going to read one book over the holiday season make it the gravity of birds","313":"probably one of the best books i've read this year the gravity of birds reads like a mystery with a tense forward momentum that will keep you turning pages all night long the plot is riveting featuring everything from a pair of squabbling sisters with dark secrets from their past to truly lush romantic scenes between unlikely partners but the thing that truly sets the gravity of birds apart is the language which is so lush and sensual that you will feel like you're experiencing everything from the rain on your skin to the miracle of watching birds in flight","314":"i was intrigued by the the premise but ultimately i found the novel to be just so so i found aspects of the novel to be completely far fetched especially when i wondered why none of these characters ever bothered to perform a google search on each other or look into the past it was well written but one i think i will quickly forget","315":"enjoyed this good characters","316":"a little far fetched but some nice writing","317":" nice pre pub -reviewsdiscovering pictures mystery reveals larger mystery motivation of artist and need for connection plot complicateed several nice twists amorality of

the best parts of the story guzeman is less at ease with men the 'male' pages are not so well acomplished and finally she failed a good ending what a pity","319":"although a bit convoluted this tale was a delight to read several aspects of alice's life and my own coincided age affliction love of birds but nothing further and thankfully my older sister was not natalie i enjoyed reading the book and while i often find coincidences too difficult to swallow in this novel they seems to work","320":"wow for now just wow time with this book was well spent","321":"this book is amazingly well written with beautiful imagery fabulous dialogue quirky characters and sorry to say too contrived however i really enjoyed so much of the beauty that i can recommend it many important facets of the story remain unexplored and unexplained but that is excellent for book club discussion enjoy","322":"alice and natalie sisters growing up in the 1960's spend a month with their parents at a rented

novel","323":"started slow for me but got more interesting with every page","324":"absolutely terrific book start to finish offering credible and appealing characters a strong twisty plot and a fascinating glimpse into the world of high priced art it's 4 1 2 stars for me and i only shy away from 5 because i'm not sure the novel has the kind of literary heft it would need to become required classroom reading twenty years from now but i was delighted by everything here and thrilled to find that an author can still surprise me in the last few pages of a story","325":"great for somebody into art history although a very different time setting this reminded me of 'the lost painting by caravaggio' loved it","326":"enjoyable story with an interesting side in the science of art detection and insurance work if you like to learn about techie things like x raying paintings to see what's underneath the book is almost a detective story itself but with a persisting sense that we don't quite have the full details or know quite what or who is being detected take home messages on the power of family chosen or not betrayal secrecy and the importance of living your own life i won a copy of this book through a goodreads giveaway","327":" part sisterly saga part find the missing painting mystery as the book moves between plots and back and forth from 1963 to 1972 to 2007 two sisters lived next door to a young artist who later became very famous and now he wants to find the paintings he did of them sending an unlikely pair an academic and a down and out gallery owner's son to find them the writing is lovely and the characters are mostly likable but there are too many you've got to be kidding plot coincidences and one character is cruel with not much explanation for why","328":" this book received via goodreads giveaway - thank you to all concerned sisters alice and natalie were once close but adolescence has wrenched them apart alice is a dreamer who loves books and birds natalie is headstrong manipulative - and beautiful on their lakeside family holiday alice falls under the thrall of a struggling young painter thomas bayber natalie however seems strangely unmoved tolerating sittings for a family portrait with surprising indifference but by the end of the summer three lives are shattered the first thing that struck me about this book was the wonderful and evocative writing style - easily drawn in i was fascinated by the inital portion of the novel that begins the tale of thomas alice and natalie at the point of their first meeting from then on in it is a haunting story of betrayal the consequences of which echo on in the present...overall this was a terrific read as we see the story unfold in various timelines from the point of view of alice amongst others it is easy to \"see\" the people and the places the author really does paint a picture with her words i was intrigued to find out the ultimate story of thomas and the sisters and bit by bit more is revealed of their past i did feel it lost momentum about half way through for a while the characters lost their \"edge\" and became less interestinga lot of the \"authenticating art\" story went right over my head mind you by the time i had finished the book i was utterly fascinated by the whole art world and the work that goes into ensuring the best is preserved and original if i had read this book 30 years ago it might be an area i would be interested in going into myself assuming i had the talent the downside did not last long however and as we head out of the middle section and into the final hurdle i was right back in it again there is some beautiful writing to be found here - words are power and tracey guzeman uses them perfectly and with zeal i will be very interested to see what she brings us next happy reading folks","329":"the discovery of a famous artists' painting uncovers family secrets from forty years previous shaking the foundations of alice kessler's life the story was well written and heartbreaking what would have happened if life had gone another way and that the truth had been told from the beginning","330":" great book story of a reclusive painter thomas bayber who asks dennis finch an art history professor and stephen jameson an art authenticator to sell a painting that he had been holding on to while evaluating the painting finch and jameson realize they only have one third of the painting which is a painting of two girls bayber had befriended many years earlier the two set out to find the two missing panels this book is mostly about the relationship between natalie and alice the two girls in the painting and the consequences of decisions made there is a nice twist at the end","331":" i stated out not liking it but by the time i was 30 pages into it i had absolutely changed my mind the story shifts back and forth in time and perspective alice and finch tell their stories and they meet up at the end in a finale you won't soon forget the secondary characters are wonderfully drawn and there is just enough technical explanation about art that you get bayber's talent without being overwhelmed by too much detail its set in contemporary world so the world building is already there but the backstories and development of the characters are so finely paced you learn what you need to know when you need it and not any sooner the twist towards the end was awesome and i was totally not expecting it but when i read it it created a perfect aha moment for me i would recommend this for people liking gentle reads about families and coming of age maybe also for people who like fiction books about artists or art history","332":" i like books that go back and forth between different time periods and this book does that very well i gave it 5 stars because i really could hardly put it down despite not feeling too much affection for many of the characters one of the main characters alice has too much self pity although i did really feel sorry for her because she had such a horrid sister thomas the artist is a narcissist to the max finch was totally unlikeable to me until suddenly in the middle of the book something shifts and he becomes more human stephen is just plain strange i also like books that shift from one set of characters and circumstances to another but in this book i found myself gritting my teeth through the stephen and finch chapters and really hurrying through those to get to the alice and horrid sister chapters still i gave it a 5 star rating good ending although a bit contrived and it certainly held my reading attention","333":"this review has been hidden because it contains spoilers to view it click here the writing int his book is beautiful and i was even drawn into the mystery for a bit but i simply cannot handle how it glosses over natalie's actions she let her sister believe she delivered a stillborn baby for 35 years all the book says about that is that maybe she started with that lie and didn't know how to undo it what and the characters remaining after natalie's death seem to just get over this fact and think well those 35 years are gone might as well make up for lost time now a the writing int his book is beautiful and i was even drawn into the mystery for a bit but i simply cannot handle how it glosses over natalie's actions she let her sister believe she

to just get over this fact and think well those 35 years are gone might as well make up for lost time now as though natalie simply misplaced a dear object that part of the story the character reactions and how little description is given to it just made no sense to me more","334":"i didn't review this right after i read it because i needed to think about it and let it marinate awhile i loved this book it had the best twists i've read in a long time i had a hard time with the characters in the beginning but soon i was loving them even the ones you don't really like i hope this author writes many more","335":" the gravity of birds is the debut novel of tracy guzeman and it is an intricate novel of jealousy heartbreak secrets and betrayals i listened to the audiobook version of the gravity of birds which is narrated by the wonderful cassandra campbell who is a favorite of mine she has a wonderful voice for storytelling and she drew me into the complexities of this novel in no time making me regret having to stop listening for even a second we begin in 1963 when teenage sisters natalie and alice are spending part of the summer at their vacation home with their parents as young girls the sisters had been close but after both girls develop a crush on a brilliant painter thomas who is living nearby in his parents cottage their relationship becomes forever changed and the secrets and betrayals begin shortly thereafter the girls lose their parents and natalie is forced to be a guardian to alice who suffers from severe rheumatoid arthritis years pass and we fast forward to 2007 where thomas is now a very well known and successful artist but for some reason has pretty much gone into seclusion and stopped painting out of the blue he contacts dennis a professor who is an expert on thomas' work and had spent years with thomas and stephen an art authenticator he stuns them both when he tells them that there is a painting of his still out there the thing is he not only wants them to find the painting but he also wants them to locate the sisters this sets off a chain of events that changes everything as the men begin to uncover clues as to the whereabouts of the sisters more and more of the plot is revealed secrets that have been buried for years surface and betrayals become apparent and shocking when i began this book i wondered if i would like it because it started a bit slow for me but as the plot unfolded i was fully invested in the story and absolutely riveted to it i don't want to say much more as this is one of those books that needs to be experienced by the reader the plot is complex and it would be much too easy to give away a detail that i'd rather not so i will leave my thoughts there although i have to say that i think this would make a wonderful book club selection because i'd love to have someone to talk to about the book i really enjoyed the gravity of birds and would most definitely recommend it especially the audiobook version which i thought was extremely well done","336":"i actually really liked this book at first i couldn't remember why i even wanted to read it the character development was slow to start but there ended up being so many twists and unexpected turns","337":"http www facebook com photo php fbi","338":"naturally with the word \"birds\" in the title i was drawn to this book and with descriptions such as this it certainly didn't disappoint a breeze stirred the branches and she saw the brilliant yellow head and underparts standing out like petals of a sunflower against the backdrop of leaves the undertail a stark white his beak was long pointed and black his shoulders a mossy green a blend of the citron yellow of his head and the flat slate of his feathers he had a black dot of an eye a bead of jet set in a field of sun never had there been anything so perfect when she blinked he disappeared the only evidence of his presence a gentle sway of the branch it was a sort of magic unveiled to her he had been hers even if only for a few seconds and yes this passage is reflective of some of the beautiful symbolism throughout this tale of a complicated sister relationship from childhood into adulthood aside from its lush prose this debut wasn't just about birds it also was about art secrets love and family and at its heart was a mystery - or perhaps multiple mysteries - expertly woven into a very literary character driven story the characters were so real so flawed and so relatable i couldn't help but care for them while the book gets off to a gentle start reminiscent of much literary fiction -urging the reader through beautiful language and characterization to learn more about the complicated pasts and present situations of the key players - the ending is a full blown a roller coaster ride with its twists and turns i did see one of the surprises coming but i certainly didn't catch them all so many wonderful secrets and surprises if you enjoy literary fiction and enjoy a mystery twist this book is for you i'm looking forward to future work by this talented author","339":"i wanted to give it a four but one of the characters was not developed fully enough for me","340":" i don't think i've ever openly cried reading a book if i try to search into my memories i can't recall a moment i wasn't able to read something because my eyes were full of tears until now this book is a piece of art i'm so glad i picked it up one day because of its pretty cover i read the back and it got me intrigued but it's what i've found in its first pages that bewitched me to the point i lost track of time the story is beautifully written the characters are stunning and the descriptions of places and and thing create a picture so vivid that you can actually see what the writer saw i've been suck into the story of thomas and alice from page one and i suffered with them until the very end i'm not going to write what happened because this book is a must read and if you are reading this review you just have to go get this book sit down read from cover to cover and come back here to say i was right and this is an amazing book i would not be surprised if someone decides to put it into a movie one of these days good luck with that because i can't imagine how could someone give it the justice it deserves i'm looking very much forward to the next book from this author","341":"beautifully told wonderfully suspenseful enjoyed it very much","342":" i'm not sure how i feel about this book i did not like the style of dropping bombshells only to come back to them later generally that style is ok but in this case i found it very confusing i did not overly like any of the characters and did not feel i knew any of them enough i continually confused stephen and finch i did not see stephen as a younger man i didn't even dislike natalie i'm not sure if we were suppose to dislike her or feel bad for her due to her circumstances i do feel she was manipulative but that's as far as my judgment feelings about her go my favorite character was their housekeeper saisee i loved her directness and the way she saw people i did like the way everything was wrapped up at the end but as i write this i realize i do not like the connection between stephen and thomas i do like the theme of the blue bird i do like the painting thomas made for alice of the lake house overall these things were not enough for me to like the book my rating is actually 2 5","343":"this book was recommended as a bonus pick for our pulpwood queen book club while i felt the book started out slow it picked up around page 70 and then i was hooked i have a connection with alice and her health issues so i felt i could partly relate to her i liked the telling of the story through different times and characters throughout the chapters definitely good once you are into it","344":"i would never have read this if it weren't for book club i didn't love the characters but that did not detract from the story for a change i found it difficult at times to keep up with the time shifts and who some of the ancillary characters were like what was the point of frankie but i just powered through and it all came together i liked the uniqueness of the storyline","345":"i loved this book the first chapter drew me in about two sisters and their parents vacationing at a cabin on a lake one summer and the handsome artist staying at a neighboring cabin the rest of the chapters go back and forth between the past and the secrets that the sisters and their neighbor kept from each other and the present with 2 men trying to unravel the many secrets and trying to find 2 missing paintings neither of them is prepared for everything they find out i couldn't put this book down each chapter ended with me wanting to find out more every time i thought i had figured it all out another secret was revealed","346":"it started off well but about halfway through it seemed like all action stalled and the whole story's progression came to a halt then near the end everything picked up quickly and many major events happened in quick succession that was the only thing that bugged me other than that a great read","347":"this one's mostly my fault it's not at all what i thought it was going to be and had i known that i probably wouldn't have picked it up","348":" i have come to realize that the way a story is written is sometimes more important than the story itself i've read books with a fantastic plot but they were absolutely butchered with poor form timing or credibility i loved this book the writing is exquisite poetry in words the characters are mysterious and we are only shown one scene at a time the author doesn't gallop ahead and leave us lost in the dust alice is a sweet creature and very precocious as a child her sister natalie is entirely self consumed and beautiful she manipulates the people in her world without any guilt it seems thomas bayber is a famous artist who comes to escape the whirlwind world of his popularity at his family's summer home cabin where next door are the kesslers alice and natalie and their parents the story begins here where they meet","349":" art history mysteryfourteen year old alice is fascinated by birds and the artist named thomas who occupied the lake house next door to her family during summer vacation he breaks up the monotony of the days as someone to chat with and alice is interested in his art and the trinkets in his home when it appears thomas is in an improper relationship with her older sister natalie alice feels betrayed years later thomas is poor and desperate seeming when he shows a painting of the girls to his cataloger denny finch and sends him on a mission to find two missing pieces that make up a triptych the three paintings together are worth millions with very little information and the name of an art authenticator reluctantly finch sets out to find the paintings and uncovers many more of thomas's secrets in the process","350":"i really wanted to love this book but ultimately we ended at a 3 5 like level this is an emotional multi layered story that lingers long after you've read it so much pain from life altering choices so much sadness for what can't be undone the novel's themes are universal and thought provoking...\"you're not the only person in this world who got handed a life different than the one they expected \" and yet i couldn't completely lose myself in the story the author gets points for plot but the story felt disjointed perhaps due to its structure of past present timelines where the narrative also switched characters even within a chapter i usually enjoy these elements in a novel however i don't think it was effectively rendered here i feel as if the author wanted this to be so much more but then couldn't quite fit all of the pieces together in a way that flowed characterization and prose had potential but it was rather convoluted and only comes together toward the last third of the book perhaps this is a novel best read in one sitting or at least in one weekend where the structural issues wouldn't compromise the story telling because it is a good story","351":"pretty close to 4 stars","352":"i really liked this book","353":"this book started slowly for me but the more i read the more i loved it","354":"lovely sad a page turner","355":" the gravity of birds tracy guzeman 4 stars this is a engaging debut novel by tracy guzeman and i wish to say a difficult book to review without spoiling the experience for future readers as such the book blurb provides a great summary how can you find someone who wants to be lost sisters alice and natalie were once close but adolescence is wrenching them apart alice is a dreamer who loves books and birds natalie is headstrong manipulative and beautiful on their lakeside family holiday alice falls under the thrall of a struggling young painter thomas bayber but natalie seems unmoved tolerating sittings for a family portrait with surprising indifference by the end of the summer three lives are shattered decades later thomas now a world renown artist reveals the existence of a portrait of himself with alice and natalie from that fateful summer the sisters themselves have disappeared and thomas is torn between taking their secrets to the grave or using the painting to resurrect the past before it closes up on all of them for good whilst i struggled to become engaged early in the book i recommend you stick with it this beautifully told melancholic story across various time periods and different character groups will stay with you long after the last page has been read this novel takes us on the journey into the past and present with the characters of alice and natalie the sisters from the fateful summer and finch and stephen the art enthusiasts charged with the task of locating the otherwise unknown paintings of the joining character thomas bayber thomas is nearing the end of his life a journey of long held family secrets and the impacts they have on so many i wanted to keep reading to see how the story ended all characters including those making small appearances became a part of my world for a short time some staying with me after the cover has been closed i would highly recommend this read to those who enjoy reading novels across various time periods eg my current favourite australian author kate moreton encouraging many to read it to share the experience with a friend can't wait to discuss this with my fellow readers","356":"this review has been hidden because it contains spoilers to view it click here it had an element of mystery characters well drawn but the twists were a bit too hard to swallow the believability factor was missing although well written i enjoyed reading it but felt disappointed by a number of elements characters i wanted to see more of thomas was missing and the explanation for natalie's behavior was unsatisfactory dare i say soap opera but with good writing","357":"interesting book about sisters families and everyone's special talent","358":"metaphors abound in this beautifully poetic artistic masterpiece that explores the love between sisters in the face of turmoil","359":" 3 5 a family lake house two sisters and a young painter living next door who comes from a wealthy family that will not accept painting as a reliable job source this is a quiet book a book about things under the surface of paintings and human hearts about wrong decisions made that affect the future of all of them this book drew me in the prose is wonderful at times the moments shared between the characters are poignant misunderstandings are a the forefront of most of what happens in this novel some tragic some just a spur of the moment decision i think the characters we come to know the most are finn and alice the other characters we know only through the lens of others i learned much about the art world the steps to authenticating the painting and the cut throat world of the appraisers and sellers found that fascinating some of the story seemed to drag a bit and this caused the story to drag in spots all in all i enjoyed this book with beautiful cover enjoyed the quietness and the unraveling i loved this quote the estimation of an artist's talent is often based on his ability to render both light and shadow if you have any choice in the matter spend your time seeking the former words that should fit us all whether we are painters or not","360":"lovely prose very descriptive story of sisters the artist they both loved and two art historians who are out to solve the mystery of where two of the artist's paintings ended up well drawn i was impressed enough with this one to look up whether she has written more novels i hope she does soon","361":"i am sometimes wary of books that are described as poetic and gorgeous because these are words that can gloss over a weak plot or can talk around an author's lack of control not so with tracy guzeman's debut novel these are the right adjectives and her thoughtful sensory language is driven forward by an engaging plot this is a mystery novel a quiet romance and a contemplation on sisterhood and loss and forgiveness and time and love and art i found myself slowing down and rereading passages where the characters reflect on some of these things rereading both because the language made it worthwhile and because the insights rang true guzeman gives herself space on the page to do this because she leaves a lot of mundane details out big events are revealed quietly and guzeman isn't worried about getting us from here to there the 70s to the 90s or giving us every logical detail behind the characters' emotional states in fact the characters are drawn a bit larger than life perhaps to force our acceptance of them as is the story is told from multiple perspectives and in different decades but it weaves together seamlessly it's not an action packed book so the jumps in time and character don't ever feel like teasing for a long time i did have trouble feeling anything but dislike for stephen and dennis though this too seems intentional nonetheless i would have preferred them painted in a slightly softer light the women for all their emotional faults consistently are the ending feels a bit rushed with one too many convenient connections but the coincidences make the last few chapters satisfying and throughout there's that language beautiful purposeful and poetic","362":"this was one of the best books i've read in a long time surprise after surprise kept me engaged for hours until i had to finish it to be satisfied","363":"a good first novel a quick read but also an absorbing one a famed painter reveals there are unreleased paintings a product of one pivotal summer when he met two young sisters at his lake house this revelation sets a complex plot in motion the characters especially the two sisters alice and natalie are well realized and memorable the secondary characters at times seem too flat lacking in the emotional depth of the sisters the ending was a little too complete for me in that every plot line was resolved in a very tidy way but the book remained enjoyable","364":"just outstanding pristine writing moving story well discerned and distinct characters depiction of alice and her struggles in particular resonated i've never encountered anywhere chronic illness described in such a perfect and accurate and lyrical way best novel i've read in a long long time wept often especially at the end","365":"the first chapter was promising but the rest fell short for me","366":"in this carefully crafted story we find out about what binds people together that can also rip them apart you can read my full review here http drchazan blogspot co il 2013 0","367":"a friend gave me this book when i finally got around to reading it hard copy not audio i just loved it the characters were interesting and well developed and the plot was engaging it jumped back and forth in over 30 years or so really well written","368":"3 5 stars i found this while wandering the library shelves it turned out to be better than i hoped a great beach read","369":" a relationship triangle amongst two sisters and their summer vacation neighbor in the 1960s

debonaire painter whose wealthy parents own the house next to the cabin the kesslers are renting leads to emotional devastation and secretsmoving forward 40 years thomas bayber a now world renowned artist reaching the close of his life enlists the aid of an art historian dennis finch and brilliant but socially awkward art authenticator stephen jameson to find segments of a previously unknown masterwork that were sent to the subjects of the painting the now apparently vanished kessler sisters although not a powerhouse of fiction nor a literary piece tracy guzeman has written a compact and highly diverting tale of fateful decisions long term consequences and unconscionable secrets if there is a serious flaw it is in at least one coincidence that's implausibility doesn't so much painfully glare as irritatingly glint in my opinion it is a great beach read some might think that dismissive but not every book needs to be classic literature guzeman's stylistics are not rapturous elysian flights but there are not so inane as to plummet like a torpid lead balloon a situation which leads this reader to abandon a book in short order you may not quote extensively this book for it's turn of phrase although it does sneak in a couple of good aphorisms but you won't feel like you're losing brain cells with the truncated sentence structure and brutally feeble metaphors found in churned out pulp novels that these days serve as \"fiction\"","370":"a little bit of a slow start and the jumping around in time was a little hard to follow at times other than that it was a great read","371":"a wonderful debut novel filled with lyrical prose and very viable characters i missed the beginning of downton abbey to finish this novel last night couldn't put it down and i am looking foward to her next book","372":"this is tracy guzeman's first novel and it's a wonderful one the story revolves around talented but self centred painter thomas bayber and the kessler sisters natalie and alice thomas's parents own a holiday home by a lake and the kesslers holiday there each year renting the house next door to the bayber's whom they have never met the kessler's make their annual summer trip there in august 1963 when natalie is 17 and alice 14 and meet the bayber's 28 year old son thomas who has escaped to his family's home to paint and to avoid the disapproval of his parents who don't consider painting a proper occupation thomas asks if he can paint the kessler family and extends an offer to them to visit him whenever they like natalie who has always been beautiful has changed into a cold and withdrawn person who holds herself apart from her family alice plain but highly intelligent is hurt and confused by the change in natalie and also coping with her own transition into womanhood as she develops a crush on thomas alice's feelings for thomas are shattered when she unintentionally uncovers his drawing of her naked and knowing sister 44 years later thomas is a washed out drunkard who lives in solitary squalor and hasn't painted for twenty years although his paintings are extremely valuable he calls denny finch friend and author of the definitive 'catalogue raisonne' of bayber's works and shocks denny by telling him that he has a painting that no one has ever seen before and he wants denny to sell it he asks denny to enlist the help of stephen jameson the son of gallery owner dylan jameson to authenticate the painting when finch returns with stephen the following day thomas reveals the painting to them it is a painting of the kessler sisters with natalie alice and thomas in the frame and a painting that is disturbing because of the way the subjects are positioned and the expressions on their faces when stephen examines the painting further he discovers that it is actually the middle panel of a triptych thomas reveals that he wants the work sold in its entirety and that he does not know where the other two panels are but that they were sent to the kessler sisters many years ago finch and stephen are thrust together into a quest to locate natalie and alice and the missing paintings after so many years this proves not to be an easy task and is made more difficult when thomas suffers a stroke and is unable to share any more information while finch and stephen are searching for the kessler sisters alice kessler is embarking on a quest of her own the story of finch and stephen's quest is told in parallel with alice's and as alice progresses with her search the events of the past are slowly peeled back and the truth revealed when finch and stephen find alice they not only find both the paintings but the truth of everything that happened so many years ago this is a story of betrayal and hurt of how a moment of malice can create a situation that cannot be easily undone and how the hurt can linger for generations but it also a story of love and loyalty and redemption it is engrossing beautifully written and tightly plotted i am already looking forward to tracy guzeman's next book","373":"i loved this book from the picture on the cover to the very last word on the very last page i felt like a spell had been cast on me the writing is just beautiful i didn't want it to end this is one of the best books i've read in a very long time it is best to read it with no expectations and just let the story unfold from the innocence of young love to betrayal to hope a lovely touching and wistful book","374":"wonderful and heart wrenching loved although without spoiling i would have liked the book to end slightly differently","375":" no spoilers but vague references to plot points this was an emotional one for me my mother suffers from the same disease as alice and this book really made me think about what alice calls the shame of her diminishment this book was heartbreaking the mystery unraveled slowly enough that i was able to put the two big pieces into place well ahead of their reveal but it was the smaller emotional revelations that were truly the soul of this book natalie's motivations alice realizing for the first time that her parents were not the perfect people she'd remembered hope that stephen at last could have something he'd been looking for his whole life redemption of a sort for thomas who brought them all together truly a lovely thoroughly bittersweet read","376":"i found this book sweet it was kind of a family mystery unwinding around lost paintings it took me a bit to get into it but it sucked me in and i got involved and it was worth it","377":"dont let my 3 stars keep you from reading this book it is a well written good story that has a good ending and i had no trouble getting thru it it just wasnt a book that really grabbed me","378":" my favorite characters in the book were finch a retired art critic and mentor and stephen an asperger ish young art authenticator they team up to discover the missing panels of an art triptych the main panel of which was a surprise secretly revealed to them by the world famous artist himself finch and stephen set off on an adventure to find the missing paintings and the missing sisters who appeared in the painting with the artist in their youth the back and forth between the older art critic and young stephen are amusing as they travel finch is reluctant to board an airplane and stephen is a non driver who has bouts of carsickness and fears finch's driving their personalities are quite opposite they approach the quest differently much later in the book i began to empathize with alice one of the sisters as her back story was revealed and she became more of a credible personality the unraveling of the mysteries and surprising twists even near the end kept the pages turning the author did a masterful job of making an implausible plot seem possible and matching the intricacies of who did what who knew what and when from this book i learned some interesting facts about birds and art a few details were unclear why and how did stephen receive his black eye what was therese's motivation for stealing away the baby and who ended up with the ceramic blue grosbeak but for a very complex story the author did well in the end the story was less about solving an intricate mystery about art and missing persons and more about regaining renewing family ties better editing would have smoothed over some rough edges 1 a difficult first chapter with convoluted time sequences from present day to three weeks earlier to first day back to present and then to sometime in the past during the first 3 weeks and where was all this happening also the initial appearances of alice and the artist made them seem like stiff actors on a stage speaking in complete sentences 2 changes of p o v were not well indicated when two characters were in a scene there was confusion as to who was the p o v character in the paragraph and thus confusion of pronoun references 3 not starting a new paragraph for a new speaker sometimes occurred on page 113 it appears a man is saying i was pregnant with my first 4 other confusions on page 168 alice finds negatives of images of herself she's never seen in her mind she wants to go back to the girl in those images age fourteen is stated but whoa the images are of alice pregnant not 14 but sometime later 5 an important character was given a name of uncertain pronunciation agnete whenever i bumped up against this name i wondered agneet like agnes but with a 't' or three syllables as in spanish","379":"the ending was a bit contrived but i enjoyed the book and how the characters lives were so intertwined i thought the sisterly relationship was very interesting","380":" while i could see why this book would appeal to many readers it fell short for this one so much attention and detail was written regarding the surrounding areas as well as birds but very little was given to the actual story and characters not only that but the one thing that pisses me off is when an author is unable to end their story and simply wraps everything up quickly and without any logic to that conclusion and here is yet another example of just such an ending blech unless you really dig birds or really want to see if someone can describe their wallpaper in over 12 00 words it can be done unfortunately skip this one","381":"i enjoyed this book but with such an interesting premise i feel like it could've been more plot points wrapped up too quickly and there was a lot left unsaid","382":"i loved the story and characters learning about the art world was interesting","383":"this review has been hidden because it contains spoilers to view it click here note i write these reviews solely to remind myself what i liked and didn't like about a book that said i liked a lot about this book i love reading about art and artists segments of the story were stunning the triptych separated much like its subjects alice with her pain both psychic and physical natalie's betrayal but some were just too convenient stephen's parentage for example i'm not really sure if i would recommend it or not if you read it let me know","384":"what a fantastically written first novel guzeman's characters are flawed and complex and the plot is suspenseful and engaging highly recommend","385":"fast reading pseudo mystery love story","386":"wonder how evil sisters can be to one another this is a riveting tale of the power of sisterly love jealousy and hate and what happens when a human being loses her moral compass as envy and suspicion replace goodwill and trust it's a book of how dark secrets can destroy lives this debut novel by tracy guzeman is a treasure with fully developed three dimensional characters and a rich textured plot that builds up slowly and then delights with twists turns and intrigue aside to the author keep writing highly recommended","387":"i wanted to love this book i was so exited when i won it in a goodreads giveaway the blurb interested me the cover seemed magical and it seemed that it would be my kind of book i'm a fan of kate morton so i was exited to start it but i had such difficulties getting into the story i found the lack of visual description contributed to my inability to connect with the characters and fond large sections of the book filled with monotonous unnecessary detail it took 260 pages for it to become an interesting story which is a shame when it's 370ish pages longthe idea of the story line was great but the way it was told i really didn't connect with","388":" the parallel and then convergent stories of alice kessler as a teen a graduate student and then an adult and that of thomas bayber make for a compelling read art disease and relationships are far more central to this story than one might initially suppose too the power of jealousy and wanting to repair an estrangement are much more powerful than one might initially suppose how do you love someone who hurts you how do you view that person after that death when you learn they have hurt you far more than you ever might imagine the power of art to capture us and the power of observation matter a great deal in the end the truth may or may not set people free but it creates a dynamic that leaves the reader wanting to know what happens after","389":" after reading the goldfinch i was a bit reluctant to take on another novel that in some way involved art i'm glad i did i enjoyed the story very much but my favorite aspect was the characters they were all flawed and or hurting but you could empathize with them even the ones that were tough to like i especially enjoyed what i thought of as the odd couple interaction between stephen and dennis the author did a nice job establishing and maintaing relationship complexities that were ones we'd never want to experience but could identify with if i have any criticism of the book it's that not being art savvy much of the description on the technical aspects of the art world was lost on me but i view that as more a reader issue and not a flaw in the writing","390":"a gripping and thrilling read couldn't put it down however one twist at the end may have been one twist too far","391":"i enjoyed the story and the characters the writing was good and i do like a mystery","392":"beautiful and sad","393":"there is something haunting about this book tracy guzeman uses words to paint pictures that have remained vivid in my mind much like the paintings she describes part of me wanted to go oh yeah give me a break at parts of the story and yet i was too invested to do so it's the kind of story where you say truth is stranger than fiction and since this is fiction my guess is that this story is based on someone's truth well done","394":"good read interesting characters eclectic","395":"amazing story great book for discussion why did alice the bright strong child become the weak dependent adult would love to hear other ideas def a recommendation for my book group","396":"beautifully crafted couldn't put it down","397":"for the most part i liked this book though i thought it started out with more promise than it finished the characters in their youth were better defined and much more interesting as they aged they seemed to lose definition and motivation until everything was far too much about the past i wondered if natalie could have sustained her cruelty for so long or alice could have remained so passive none the less the gravity of birds is very much worth reading","398":"boy did i ever enjoy this story i can't remember the last time i was quite so completely drawn in by the plot characters and writing style i never thought i'd ever find a true 5 star book but this for me comes close putting it down after reading the last page was emotionally deflating","399":"beautifully crafted and meticulously detailed a first novel to be proud of guzeman tells the story of two sisters and an artist she takes us from the northeast to the south to the west in search of a missing painting and more art aficionados will appreciate the aspects of painting and sculpture southerners will recognize the small town atmosphere those who like family stories will enjoy the whole novel","400":" i won a copy of this book from a contest held on twitter by @historicalfix this review in its entirety was originally posted at eclectictales com http www eclectictales com blog 201 i thought the gravity of birds was interesting and was quite strong at the beginning in presenting the two storylines that of the kessler sisters and the arrival of thomas bayber in their lives and the contemporary story with an elderly thomas seeking out the sisters it left me wondering what what happened to the kessler sisters what was really going on between them as the rift was palpable even at the start etc the book was also interesting on touching on themes of art the drive to create and art criticism all of which were pretty strong early in the novel core to this novel however is the theme of family and the notion of how strong the bonds of blood are when faced with illness and personal tragedy disappointment and resentment having said that the novel sort of ambled in the latter half of the novel i'm not sure if it was the time that i finished reading the book but one minor problem i was having throughout the novel was my sense of time within the story most chapters indicate the year in which events in the chapter are taking place either in the past or the present but a sometimes the 1960s 1970s events feel like they could take place in the early 20th century and b some of the chapters are missing dates when the shift has turned from alice to dennis and stephen also while i don't mind that the emphasis shifted towards the mystery in the second half with the two storylines merging it physically felt like the novel moved away from the earlier themes of art and self despite of this i did enjoy reading the gravity of birds the story of alice and natalie and thomas had me completely enthralled as well as dennis and stephen's attempts to find out what happened back then speaking of which the dennis and stephen dynamic was quite interesting to read at first especially as their road trip started off rather hilariously but i felt like their respective character stories weren't as strong as they could be though dennis' personal backstory was much more interesting and fleshed out probably just because the main story was just too intriging to digress to other characters that weave in and out of the main story i would recommend the gravity of birds to readers of historical fiction rating 3 5 5","401":"really good read people make sometimes grave mistakes when they are young that haunt them always i think the end was a little too quick after 35 years people don't just let go and move on quickly life is a lot more complicated than that but the story flowed interesting characters and some surprises so all in all a good read","402":"received as an arc from the publisher part art mystery part family study and an ending i wouldn't have predicted","403":"this was definitely a compelling read and a very interesting plot i did find a number of the characters to be awkwardly contrived which is why i couldn't give it 5 stars it lent to literary conflict but i think that tension could've been created without it being so glaring entertaining though and i'm very glad i read it","404":"wow what a great story some mystery great characterization a glimpse into the world of art and enough of a positive ending that you don't close the book and feel like you are weighted down with gloom do yourself a favor and read this book","405":"i wish this book had been longer because i didn't want to stop reading it i picked it up at the airport on a whim and i'm thankful for the urge this is traci guzeman's first novel and i can't wait to read what else she has in store i loved her characters thought she handled the time span portions of the book alternately told in the 60s and 70s then in the '00s well really grasping the social differences between the eras recommend","406":"i enjoyed this book about the relationship between two sisters","407":"great and novel idea well written the characters were interesting and consistent although you learn more about some peripheral characters than one or two of the main characters it got slightly confusing in one or two points as it moved backwards and forwards with flashbacks if you hate flashbacks you might not like this book a lot of the action takes place in he past it's a good psychological story without a pat ending","408":"a guy friend recommended this book while apologizing for its being a girl book i think it will appeal to a reader of either gender who is fascinated by a twisted story with a unique surprise hat marches through the world of art treasures","409":"this was a mostly enjoyable book but it seemed to take a long time to get through to the end there were a few organizational issues that gnawed away at me though i think that is what ultimately helped me make the decision of three stars i don't want anyone to think the three stars means this book is not well written and and interesting read because it is for the most part i'm not trying to nitpick honestly but there were several times i'd get lost i couldn't figure out who was talking or narrating i guess it's bound to happen when you have three narrators who start and stop within chapters and there is no definite or clear delineation between them i would have enjoyed the book more had it been better organized and it was clear from the beginning who was responsible for a particular section or who exactly said or thought what all in all i still think the book was interesting and had a nice story i would pick up another book by the author and give her another shot hopefully by then she will have worked the kinks out of multiple protagonists","410":"this is more a 3 5 i enjoyed the book but the writing felt complicated and lost me a few times","411":" beautifully written the prose lilts dips and soars like the flight of the birds whose images run through its pages a haunting story of the power of love that however flawed and mysterious must indelibly change the fate of all who experience it every chapter left me aching for the next the grief bound in this book's pages was tied up with grace so that rather being overwhelmed by sadness the reader is bouyed by hope these characters will stay with you long after you have finished the text familiar spirits who will remind you of a quiet nobility in the human spirit a nobility that is defined rather than diminished by the frailties and vices of the vessel","412":" in the early 1960's alice and natalie are teenage sisters who meet thomas a brilliant artist at their parent's summer house in 2007 thomas shows a painting to finch and stephen an art professor and an art authenticator it is a painting that no one knew existed a painting of two teenage girls he reveals that the painting is a triptych and two of the panels are missing the only way to find the other two panels is for finch and stephen to play detective and find alice and natalie and off starts a hunt a hunt for many things missing why has thomas chosen this moment to find the panels why has he chosen stephen to search for the painting eventually all is revealed the story bounces back and forth between the past and the present between the story of the sisters and the story of the detectives trying to find the sisters the story is beautifully written and i found myself being pulled into the narrative the further i got into the story i can heartily recommend this book note that i received this book for free through the amazon vine program","413":"i really liked this book and highly recommend it i would give it 4 5 stars","414":" setting connecticut usa new mexico usa characters professor dennis finch stephen jameson sisters alice and natalie kessler artist thomas bayber this is a novel certain to leave you breathless by the conclusion of the story painter thomas bayber has become reclusive secretive and even cruel to those around him he has revealed a previously unseen painting to art history professor dennis finch and art authenticator stephen jameson in the hopes of bringing the pieces of a painting together his request comes with a caveat find the sisters in the painting this story is about family secrets history and anguish it breaks the heart and leaves you trembling i was drawn into the emotions and the mystery i feel this is one of the best books of 2014 worthy of book clubs and would shout my enjoyment from the rooftops if i could i enjoyed the book obviously it will resonate with me for a long while in compliance with the fcc regulations i declare receiving this book for review purposes as part of the goodreads first reads program","415":" this review is based on the firstreads copy i was fortunate enough to win a fascinating first novel that deals with relationships and the art world the plot centers around the search for a previously unseen painting by a brilliant but reclusive painter thomas bayber who has not offered any new works in the past 20 years bayber enlists the help of an art history professor dennis finch and a struggling art authenticator stephen jameson to sell the painting however there is a twist to his seemingly simple request before bayber will agree to sell this painting finch and jameson must first track down the subjects of the painting two sisters named alice and natalie kessler who seemingly disappeared the story alternates between the present and the past providing clues to the reader about the painting and its subjects and the intertwined lives of the characters the author did an excellent job of giving the characters distinctive voices and creating three dimensional and believable personalities while providing a puzzle for the reader to solve included at the end was a reader's guide for book clubs with intriguing discussion questions and an interview with the author that enhanced the reading experience overall based on her first novel i look forward to reading more by ms guzeman thanks again to the firstreads program for introducing me to another new author","416":"this book was a gift and it drew me into its many plots which of course were just abut one major plot it is well crafted poignant and provocative the choices one makes are so shaped by the choices of others including the choice to tell the truth i will think about this book for quite awhile","417":"this story started out somewhat slow but began to build momentum in its second half i like stories with interesting topics and this was one with some twists toward the end that made it worth the read as far as the end it was not a perfect 100% but maybe that made it more realistic","418":"impressive first novelit had been awhile between reading reviews and downloading this book and finally getting around reading it so i had no expectations the story follows the lives of two sisters through flashbacks of the younger sister plus the unraveling of their mysterious relationships with an artist who caused life altering heartache for both the story is complex and beautifully written the author tends to digress rather like your aged great aunt when allowing characters to wander in their thoughts during important tense passages this was acceptable early in the book when character was being developed but it was mildly irritating deeper into the plot however this was a minor criticism and i did really enjoy the book it has some darkness but there were also some scenes where i laughed out loud at exchanges between an art history professor and an antisocial analyst i hope to read more from this author","419":" somehow this book started slowly for me but soon i was totally involved staying up late to read it it's full of tragedy starting with the death of the sisters' parents and the younger sister's rheumatic arthritis butthe characters the sisters an artist they knew as young women his biographer art historian an art appraiser and the mysteries where were the sisters and the lost paintings and why did the artist want to find them why did they do what they did etc were so intriguing that the sadness didn't overwhelm me the writing and storytelling were very powerful at times i didn't want to hear any more about pain or physical difficulties but they were observed so beautifully and were essential metaphors to explain inaction","420":"lovely read by a debut author i was drawn into the world of each character and enjoyed the ties to the art world","421":"great charactersart description suffering characters and their relationships surprising plot developments well worth the readers timegood book club discussion candidate","422":"this book was a delightful surprise i was initially worried i'd ended up with chic lit a light weight novel aimed squarely at the female reader i was pleased to find that it was actually a compelling mystery stuffed with diverse well described characters that i enjoyed reading about i particularly enjoyed the ambiguity surrounding the make up of the women in the novel they were complex and multi dimensional the author's descriptions too were very well done and detailed i was a bit disappointed at how transparent the twists were saw 'em coming a mile away but overall thought this one was worth my time","423":"i liked this book a great deal i can't say i loved it because i found so much of it sad the sadness of a single decision and the long term ramifications the sadness of grudges held close and the lives ruined as a result the sadness of a lifetime of lies the sadness of lives limited by chronic illness yet tracey guzeman offers threads of light and love if only each character will open up to them i found this book well written and truly enjoyed","424":"i enjoyed the story but did struggle a bit here and there with things that seemed unlikely or contradictory there were still unanswered questions for me at the end even so it was entertaining","425":" disclosure i won a copy of the novel from goodreads but never received it i purchased an e book as a result this is a classic first novel the characters are familiar archetypes the story has a too slow build the reader's interest wanes at times as the writer gets a bit lost fortunately guzeman develops good characters and also share so much fascinating information on art and birds that you can't help but want to finish it out i am interested to see what guzeman writes next she has the potential to be great","426":"i wasn't a fan of the ending it didn't give me enough closure","427":"the first chapter drew me in about two sisters and their parents vacationing at a cabin on a lake one summer and the handsome artist staying at a neighboring cabin the rest of the chapters go back and forth betweenthe past and the secrets that the sisters and their neighbor kept from each other and the present with 2 men trying to unravel the many secrets neither of them is prepared for everything they find out every time i thought i had figured it all out another secret was revealed","428":"historical fiction is my favorite genre and i enjoyed learning about 1666 and the plague the book had to much earth and despair for my liking i didn't dislike the ending as most reviewers did i was happy for her escape","429":"i ran out of a book while in nyc did you know it is impossible to find a book in new york we drove up to boston and ferried out to martha's vineyard where i finally found a darling book store called bunch of grapes thrilled that i finally found a book store i started perusing through the shelves when i came upon a book with a beautiful cover not usually buying a book because of it's cover i picked it up and scanned through making sure it didn't have a bunch of bad words etc when i took it up to the register i asked the clerk if she had read the gravity of birds she said she had not nor had she spoken with anyone who had read it it was the author's first novel what the heck i thought i'd give it a chance and purchased the book after a 3 or 4 page slow start i was hooked and loved every single page the writing style and most of all the story i was sad to see it end and would have ended it a little differently but it was there the last page to leave the rest to the reader's own thoughts and imagination i hope tracy guzman keeps on writing and i will watch for her next book with eager anticipation","430":"loved it tracy","431":"i had a really hard time getting into this book the beginning felt very slow and i put it down for weeks at a time which is really unusual for me the pace picked up somewhat at the end i found it to be an interesting story but not anything really compelling","432":"such a wonder a novel constructed in such a way that one isn't aware of the author's plot moving along an artist ruins the lives of two women two men are tasked with the job of finding two panels of a triptych painter early in the artist's career you'll have to read this lovely book to see what happens","433":" this book is nominally about thomas bayber a talented painter and natalie and alice kessler two sisters who spend a month as teenagers living with their parents in the cabin next to bayber's what happens that summer ripples through the rest of their lives the problem is that there's a hole in the center of the book where natalie belongs the things she does are often awful and as much as the other characters try to justify them or explain her reasoning it might've been better with natalie's narrative voice to explain herself it's certainly a reasonable narrative technique to leave that hole alice never got explanations from natalie so why should we but it still feels like something is missing from the narrative i received this book through the goodreads first reads program","434":"sometimes i really enjoyed this book the story and the writing and other times i thought it was too much like a made for tv movie it held my interest enough that i finished it","435":"beautifully sad real characters lives of regrets and what ifs told in an alternating past and present format","436":"in 1972 two families were renting cabins on a summer lake the kessler sisters develop a relationship with young thomas bayber a budding artist who captures their images and their hearts years later bayber is a famous artist who retired twenty years earlier he tells his agent that there is a previously unrecorded canvas that he commissions him to sell upon seeing the canvas of bayber with the kessler sisters the clever agent realizes that there are two more panels to this piece and insists they be found so that the triptych can be presented together the search for the missing panels begins a journey into bayber and the kessler sister's past which not only makes for a great mystery but a terrific page turner as well i don't typically enjoy books about relationships but guzman does a wonderful job weaving prose the subject of art and ornithology into a work of fiction that i found hard to put down wonderful first novel by tracy guzman","437":" after a rather slow start this book grabbed and held my attention sisters alice and natalie kessler long ago friends of the now famous artist thomas bayber are the center of a search as the keys to finding two missing bayber paintings the story recounts the turbulent pasts of these three people and the surprising futures of two of them told in a series of flashbacks mixed with the present tracy guzeman writes with superb clarity vocabulary and style creating a cast of memorable characters an excellent debut novel i will eagerly await her next one","438":"it started out very slow and i often had difficulty remembering what i had read the previous evening however about a 1 3 of the way into the book that changed and the story became more engaging in fact it had some interesting twists and turns especially with the involved characters not quite sure how believable the half brother twist was but not a bad twist","439":"nice debut summer 1963 connecticut sisters alice 14 year old and natalie 16 year old and 20 year old painter thomas are neighbors tragedy strikes when alice is diagnosed with rheumatoid arthritis and their parents die in an auto accident 1971 alice and thomas meet you'll want to read what happens yourself 30 years later thomas is a once famous artist who has not painted in two decades a self portrait with the sisters created in 1963 is missing sections and thomas is selling it but not before recovering what's missing what happens next reveals the mysteries of '63 and '71","440":"couldn't put it down some twists in the books which kept it interesting a lot about birds which i thought would be boring but loved it","441":"i enjoyed it except for the ending i wanted things to be a bit tidier i wasn't ready for it to end i was left wondering what happens next with some of the characters","442":"great book highly recommend this one to everyone","443":"the mystery of the paintings kept me going on this book","444":"the gravity of birdsbytracy guzemanmy thoughts after reading this book this is a book about losses aching blinding heartbreaking life altering losses this lovely book with its beautiful writing is about pain and sadness it is also about lies and separation and choices all of these made both with love and without love the sadness in this book is heartbreaking because it can not be undone or made better it's the kind of sadness that feels as though it could have been avoided if everyone involved had just been real and honest but they weren't because something held them back some part of them that made them bitter unfeeling afraid this novel takes place in the present and also in the past a past that was about 35 years ago it is the story of thomas bayber an incredibly talented artist and his relationship with natalie and alice kessler two sisters he met one summer when they both had lake houses next door to each other he was in his thirties they were young natalie almost ready for college alice still in high school alice was at the threshold of a disease rheumatoid arthritis that would be with her forever natalie was beautiful moody free over time they both were involved with thomas both relationships were traumatic secretive damaging in the present time thomas has not painted in over 20 years and has requested that a friend of his find pieces of one of his unknown works that means finding the kessler sisters because they have these paintings they might not even know that they have the paintings and that these works are a part of a triptych thomas wants the paintings sold together and to do this natalie and alice must be found enter finch and stephen kind of an odd fellow duo whom thomas charges to find the sisters this also means that alice will find out the truths and lies that natalie has peppered their lives with once alice is free of natalie the lies that natalie told are revealed sounds simple but the truth will change alice for the rest of her life what i loved about this book the unraveling of natalie and alice's relationship was delicious natalie was hateful to alice for so many years she was dishonest hateful and truly mean i wanted to shake alice she seemed so gullible she never doubted natalie and just accepted her words as truth i also loved finch and stephen recently widowed history professor and quirky art authenticator they were tasked by thomas to find the kessler sisters and the missing pieces of the painting plus stephen is even more a part of this mystery than he even knows final thoughts i loved this book perhaps it's one of my favorites this year the past and present intermingle within this fine book and it reads like an unputdownable mystery i did not want it to end","445":"seemed to take forever to read i'm really not sure if i liked it or not it was quite a good story but i didn't really like the characters","446":"this is a good story of love loss and redemption but at times is a bit pedestrian","447":" in the same vein as possession or the thirteenth tale this literary fiction mystery novel focuses on the relationship between two sisters and the enigmatic painter they both had a relationship with this book made it clear to me that i tend to gravitate towards books with fully developed interesting characters a compelling plot and beautiful language minor details are at times conveyed in too much detail while major plot elements only get a quick mention that might be overlooked it was unclear what exactly had happened by the end of the novel by my book club members which i see as a good thing it's left to your own interpretation reading and imagination","448":"this was a goodreads give away win i really liked the way the bird theme was threaded throughout the story without out it being about birds at all at the same time the theme was subtle enough not to distract from the story","449":" despite the pretentious and meaningless title this book was a great find it didn't take me long to get hooked and i thought that the plot took some surprising turns the characters were well realized and interesting i absolutely loved stephen and there was a very subtle humor to the book i definitely recommend it on another note this is the third book out of the last seven that i have read that had a missing painting as the main plot line unintended on my part but it does make for interesting material","450":"such a good read love how the author built layer upon layer until you were covered in their world sometimes we need beauty mystery and hope","451":" i was amazed to see this was a first novel for tracy guzeman well written this novel is about 2 sisters alice and natalie natalie is the elder sister she is beautiful alice is younger andis stricken with rm starting at the age of 14 in their younger yearsthey would spend a month at a cabin at a lake with their parents they meet an artist thomas who is in the cabin next to theirs hepaints a picture of the girls years later thomas has become quitefamous his paintings selling for serious money at the age of 70 hereveals a painting of him with the two sisters that noone has everseen before the sisters have disappeared and it is necessary to findthem thats enough about the basics of the story read the book wonderful characters strange lives interesting story i hope you areworking on your next book tracy","452":"what a story i found myself wishing this story would go on and on to know what happened next i would like to hear what happiness these characters could come to know after all they had gone through what a joy this book was","453":" the kessler sisters are as close as two siblings can be however during their adolescence this closeness is shattered during a family holiday when the sisters strike up a friendship with a struggling young artist thomas bayber by the end of the holiday all three lives are changed irrevocably years later when bayber now a renowned but reclusive artist releases a painting entitled the kessler sisters the past which has been long buried is brought back into focus and secrets which have been hidden are forced into the open for the first third of the book nothing much seems to happen and i was almost on the point of abandoning the book but gradually as the layers of the story start to be peeled away it becomes more complex and as the feelings evoked by the divulging of secrets are revealed piece by piece the novel started to grab my attention overall this is a competent debut novel with some flashes of brilliance but rather too much drawing out of the story which i think could have been more succinct in places","454":" i don't think there could have been a better time to read this than when i was in my first oil painting class i would build up texture and color and trying to highlight only to work on this novel before moving on with my day it almost seemed as if i had insight knowledge a special connection with the artist in the story also i got complimented on the book's cover everywhere i went as if i had something to do with it goodreads summarizes the story as follows sisters natalie and alice kessler were close until adolescence wrenched them apart natalie is headstrong manipulative--and beautiful alice is a dreamer who loves books and birds during their family's summer holiday at the lake alice falls under the thrall of a struggling young painter thomas bayber in whom she finds a kindred spirit natalie however remains strangely unmoved sitting for a family portrait with surprising indifference but by the end of the summer three lives are shattered decades later bayber now a reclusive world renowned artist unveils a never before seen work kessler sisters--a provocative painting depicting the young thomas natalie and alice bayber asks dennis finch an art history professor and stephen jameson an eccentric young art authenticator to sell the painting for him that task becomes more complicated when the artist requires that they first locate natalie and alice who seem to have vanished and finch finds himself wondering why thomas is suddenly so intent on resurrecting the past and man was the writing beautiful i felt that i could never skim because of it although i'm not sure if it was the descriptions or just the all around beauty of the subject matter i found the characterization to be just as lovely the figures mysterious and yet real at the same time despite all the merits i find in this novel it is also one of the most confusing ones i have ever read there is a mystery whoever narrators and decades and everything else imaginable change on unrecorded whims it often halted the reading process many loose threads were tied in but i felt as if there were a few strays outside of the complete tapestry commence spoiler such as the father of stephen where did that come from it was a slap dash twist crammed into the end that made me feel more confused than completed never a good thing this book is difficult because if you miss a small detail you're in trouble but i recommend it for its beautiful writing especially if you have a love for artists or oil paints it made me wish bayber was a real man so i could look at his work","455":"a lovely and enjoyable book about love and family with great characters and a compelling narrative voice this was one of those vacation reads that was hard to put down the plot ties up a little too neatly but that doesn't tarnish an otherwise great novel","456":"this novel was slow in the beginning it seemed like it was going to be one of those novels that makes you depressed about humanity and feeling dirty however despite it's lack of a conventional happy ever after ending i ended up loving it and feeling uplifted a glimpse into the world of people who care deeply about art the pain of rheumatoid arthritis the impact other people can have on our lives all interesting themes in the book thoroughly recommend it","457":"well written and interesting story","458":" this is our burleith book group read for our meeting on march 8 and i can't wait for the discussion i found many of the characters in the book to be annoying in one way or another but it didn't keep the story from being a compelling read ms guzeman was very adroit in keeping the reader and some of the characters wondering how the mysteries in the story would play out until the end as with many books i found things went a bit too quickly in the wrap up of the story lines but overall it was a pleasure","459":"i enjoyed this book it's a quick read and flows nicely the plot becomes too tidy and disbelief crept in a fun read though i'm glad i chose it","460":"very beautifully written book really kept my interest and a great story","461":"i had a hard time grasping the characters through the first half of this book i don't think i ever quite got either of the sisters and their relationship certainly eluded me i felt i was missing some essential part of the story of course i was reading this over christmas week so all those distractions couldn't have helped however i felt the book really picked up momentum in its second half and i liked the way it all came together","462":"for sure a cant stop till the end sort of book you get so involved with the sisters wonderful mystery solved but sad just goes to show there are always three sides to a story yours theirs and the truth","463":"this was a quiet book but rich with detail and twists all while i was reading i thought this shouldn't be as interesting as it is -- a story about two old sisters and some art dealers why am i so captivated but i was captivated from beginning to end","464":"loved this book it was slow to start but then it grabbed me great characters and a few plot twists","465":" i won a copy of this book through goodreads first reads program i really enjoyed this book once it got moving about a 1 3 of the way through i would say this book is less of a time slip and more a few flashbacks this is probably a good thing given there are also multiple narrators the story revolves around a famous and reclusive artist and a pair of sisters he knew 30 some years ago the artist reveals a previously unknown painting and tasks some friends and acquaintances to find the other two panels of this triptych which he gave to the sisters as the search for the painting unfolds so do some very tangled relationships this leaves the reader hoping that not only the painting will be made whole but the relationships and people they touch as well very satisfying and reasonable ending","466":" in my opinion this book is a great read i should have written my review right after i finished it but it has been a few weeks the book has love tragedy and mystery this is a story of a woman's life and how choices made by other people changed the course of her life it reminds you that the truth always comes out and the lies have a deep impact on the lives on those to whom you have lied i don't want to spoil it since i loved it so much i hope you just take my word for it and give the book a chance","467":"after reading some similarly themed novels earlier his year this sounded promising but pales in comparison the art and ornithology serve almost as afterthoughts and the story itself lives in the shadows rather than the light","468":" i'm trying to figure out what i didn't like about this book it just felt weak to me somehow with characters that acted and reacted in ways that seemed extreme given what i had been told about them their background and their personality i felt like they behaved the way they did for the convenience of the author and the story she was spinning not because it was intrinsic to them that said the story was interesting and had enough twists to be entertaining and keep me reading so i definitely don't resent the time spent reading it and would say that anyone would be pleased to have it along on a plane ride or a long evening spent in the comfort of a reading chair","469":"for a more detailed review please check out my review below debra's book cafedebs","470":" i received a copy of this book from a goodreads giveaway the gravity of birds was an enjoyable and easy to read book that offers an insightful peek into the art world birds and ra while the opening chapters of the book were perhaps a little slow the second half of the book picked up the pace making the book difficult to putdown by the end you think you have it all figured out so the unsuspected twist is a fantastic surprise however without giving anything away i would have liked to have seen more of the action of that twist playing out i found this throughout the book that there were certain scenes that i wanted to witness not just hear about in backstory or flashbacks this was particularly true with the character of natalie while we get a brief glimpse of her in the opening chapter and a tiny section later on the rest of our knowledge about her and what she's done comes from either alice's memories of her or appraisals made by stephen and finch and other characters when they look at paintings or photographs of her i suppose i felt that i wanted to see her in action we are given a clear understanding of why she might behave as she does so we get that even so i wanted to be a witness and make my own judgement about her myself not simply be told that this is who and what she is in terms of other characters i wasn't sure that both finch and stephen were both needed stephen was for me the strongest character in the novel he made me wince and laugh with his social awkwardness and thought processes and i would have liked more of him and perhaps less of finch while alice i felt i needed more from there was a tremendous amount of internal thought process about her ra but nothing much about her beyond that this may have been intentional as her life has indeed revolved only around her condition but once she is in santa fe i felt she came alive more overall this is a thought provoking book that makes you question life death and loss and how we spend or waste our time i would recommend the gravity of birds and will be keen to read the next book from this author","471":"strangely delightful story","472":"a well crafted story interesting plot line well developed characters i kept finding myself delightfully surprised by the turns in the story great first novel","473":"more in the 2 5 range i enjoyed it more than my 2 star books but probably not as much as some of my 3 star ones i realized halfway through how little i cared about finch and stephen ugh to the both of them but i did care enough about thomas and alice to get me to the end the conclusion however felt like a bit of a let down","474":" this book was a slow start for me i pushed through and found the end better than the beginning all in all it was not terrible and i found it had it's moments of beauty at some points i felt the novel lacked clarity as it rushed along through moments i agree with one reviewer who said it struggles with being popular fiction and a literary work the story was very good albeit at times mired in lengthy descriptions and details i found i knew too much about alice but not enough about supporting characters like her parents for example i would have enjoyed learning more about thomas and the years he spent after her departure it was an ambitious story and at times i felt it pulling me in and than other times i felt halted","475":" time taken to read 5 days dipping in and out as i was working a lot publisher harperfictionblurb from goodreadssisters natalie and alice kessler were close until adolescence wrenched them apart natalie is headstrong manipulative--and beautiful alice is a dreamer who loves books and birds during their family's summer holiday at the lake alice falls under the thrall of a struggling young painter thomas bayber in whom she finds a kindred spirit natalie however remains strangely unmoved sitting for a family portrait with surprising indifference but by the end of the summer three lives are shattered decades later bayber now a reclusive world

jameson an eccentric young art authenticator to sell the painting for him that task becomes more complicated when the artist requires that they first locate natalie and alice who seem to have vanished and finch finds himself wondering why thomas is suddenly so intent on resurrecting the past my reviewthe story opens in 1963 with alice her sister natalie and their parents on holiday and the introduction of thomas bayer a young painter twice alice's age with a talent he offers to sketch the family and alice finds herself drawn to his company the story then goes into the next chapter and opens at 2007 and dennis finch has been summoned by thomas bayer a brief explanation of how their relationship came to be is covered and what thomas expects of finch now thomas is a hugely successful artist that stopped painting at the top of his game and became a recluse finch has known and cataloged all of his work and now thomas tells him of a piece no one has saw or known about if it is true it will be worth a fortune but finch needs to track it down along with stephen whom thomas has asked for to personally verify it is indeed his work the story then flicks back and forth between alice the past alice now and the journey between finch and stephen as they try to recover the art that will change all of their lives if they are successful this book was fairly slow to start i felt although there is enough to keep you interested until it builds up alice loves birds and even goes on to study them which leads to lots of bird discussion or reference in the book i found myself going off and looking up a few of them stephen verifys and authenticates works of art and the process of this is also discussed in quite a bit of detail which again i found quite interesting as it isn't something i have ever considered the time scale at some of the chapters is quite specific but a lot is lost in between so you have to figure yourself how much time has lapsed since one event to another i felt some scenes where missed which i personally would have liked to have read for example alice goes off to meet someone she introduces herself and the chapter ends then when we are back with them they are already chatting and established communication whereas i would have loved to have picked up right after the introduction they say an author is doing their job right when they leave you wanting more and i definitely would have liked more insight into scenes like that sorry to be a tad vague but i hate spoilers there is a lot of secrets or information purposefully withheld throughout the story however as the tale unravels the mysteries are revealed but just a little slow and jumbled for me when something is highlighted that happened but only mentioned then the story moves on i find this frustrating however it is a smart move by the author by doing this it guarantees i will not put the book down as i have to find out what happened to the character overall for a first book i think the author has done very well the characters were brought to life quite well and the character natalie evoked quite a strong reaction from me i really disliked her there are many layers to this story and it covers quite a lot of ground secrets betrayal family and love to name but a few there is no bad language that i can recall and for people who like a slow burner with depth i think they will really enjoy this i would read this author again this time it is a 3 5 for me thanks so much to harperfiction for giving me an arc and introducing me to a new author this book is available from the 15th of august 2013 in paperback PS7 99 or ebook for PS5 99","476":"the writing in this book is wonderful great characters and a good story it just seemed to drag too much it should have provoked tears near the end instead it was a feeling of well finally tedious instead of surprising in this book a self indulgent artist becomes involved with two sisters there really is a lot to the story it did jump back and forth in time too much for my liking","477":"liked it well enough i would read a second book by guzeman","478":" many thanks to my gma friend mimi for recommending this book tracy guzeman's book about family sisters and the art world was mezmorizing sisters natalie and alice kessler are on a summer vacation when they first meet thomas bayber who is a young artist in his early thirties this fateful meeting and vacation will irrevocably change their lives once close natalie the oldest sister is controlling vindictive but compelling beautiful alice is also good looking also but she is kind compassionate and saddled from a very young age with rheumatoid arthritis prohibiting her from pursuing her caeer in ornithology after their parents die natalie controls alice with lies subservience and away from the public eye once they move away from their home fast forward to thomas bayber in his seventies commissions two art experts to find his earliest never seen before painting titled the kessler sisters only problem it is nearly impossible to find the sisters if you love lies romance family dysfunction and the thoroughly evil sister against the backdrop of the beauty in and around the art world you will not be disappointed with this sweeping novel","479":"every one of the characters in this book are completely memorable great read","480":"this novel is set in two time periods the present 2007 and the past 1960's and 1972 it is the story of alice kessler her sister natalie kessler and a painter thomas bayber it is about family relationships and how they mean different things to different people","481":"i would have liked a little more insight into natalie's character a few more details about the whole scheme and definitely more closure at the end but i couldn't put it down once i started","482":"i loved this book art love mystery all covered i honestly couldn't put it down","483":"this was a lovely little novel slightly haunting at times and as layered as the brushstrokes on the lost canvases in the story it didn't turn out as happily as i would've liked but that's life isn't it","484":"the gravity of birds starts out telling the summer the kessler sisters at the time in their teens meet the artist thomas bayber while vacationing with their family it then switches to present day where thomas has gone on to become an extremely prominent painter but has long since stopped painting and become a bit of a recluse he informs his friend dennis finch that there is a painting of his that was never known a three part piece two of those parts being owned by the kessler sisters he asks finch to get the help of a down on his luck art authenticator stephen jameson to hunt down the two remaining pieces the story unfolds from there moving back in forth through time as we learned what happened in the kessler sisters' lives after they met thomas and follow finch and stephen's efforts in locating them its a story of family and the complicated relationships that make up a family there are plenty of unexpected twists as the story unwinds that left me anxious to know what would happen next and even cheating by peaking ahead at times please note i received this book for free through goodreads first reads","485":"really really good unique plot lovable characters u0026amp good villains wrapped up a little too fast u0026amp precious but enjoyed it tremendously","486":" i liked this book didn't love it exactly but you can't love 'em all i'd give it 3 5 stars if i could it's got characters relationships plot plot twists solid writing and a wicked title but something didn't quite work for me it was almost like it wanted to veer off in a different direction sappy romance and it got perilously close to allowing itself to go there i did like that the protagonist was an ornithologist with rheumatoid arthritis there aren't enough of those in contemporary fiction and i liked that the book was set in the art world i enjoyed learning more about ornithology ra and the art business while being entertained i'll read her next novel this was her first and it was good but i believe her second will be better","487":"this review has been hidden because it contains spoilers to view it click here i really enjoyed this novel having seen the title on a list of recommended summer reads i reserved a copy from the library then became somewhat disheartened after reading a number of goodreads reviews that indicated the story was slow moving and not all that interesting hopefully this will teach me once and for all not to

having seen the title on a list of recommended summer reads i reserved a copy from the library then became somewhat disheartened after reading a number of goodreads reviews that indicated the story was slow moving and not all that interesting hopefully this will teach me once and for all not to look at reviews of a book i'm about to read because i found quite the opposite to be true in less than three hundred pages the author spans fifty years and weaves together a compelling story that bounces seamlessly back and forth in time the characters are for the most part well developed and authentic the premise is a novel one and the conclusion is suitably bittersweet avoiding the treacly heartwarming ending wrapped in a big bow that i feared was coming my only real complaint is that natalie whose actions drive most of the plot remains mostly a mystery her motivation is attributed to one event in her life which seems a little too convenient and makes her feel one dimensional she seems more deus ex machina than full fledged character present simply to slip the gears into place that propel the machinery of the story among a cast of dysfunctional emotionally damaged characters she appears to have been the most warped and hardened by her circumstances yet the reader never gets a chance to know and understand her perhaps guzeman never meant for the reader to sympathize with natalie perhaps as is suggested once or twice in the book natalie is just naturally cruel a bad seed whether or not that's true i found her to be a perplexing and frustrating character one that left me feeling like i was cheated out of part of the story having said that i still found the book well worth my time more","488":"even if the story weren't so compelling this is a worthwhile book because guzeman's writing is so beautiful but she also weaves a wonderful story of a once famous artist who stopped painting more than forty years ago because of a trauma that included himself and two young sisters he met on a summer vacation he suddenly calls an art historian to reveal a hitherto unknown painting that he wants to sell it is the center panel of a triptych which depicts himself and each of the young women when the art world knows of its existence it will be worth millions he says he will only sell if the other two panels can be found which begins a search for the young women the surprising secrets that are revealed kept me reading until 3 a m and then 3 hours later for another 2 hours until i finished it in tears highly recommended","489":"i rate books of fiction by how well i am entertained by them this one was hard to put down it had some mystery to it a lot of interaction among just a few main characters and was even funny at times i liked the authors style many layers all coming to together at the end so will look for more from her","490":" this isn't an easy book to describe or review the story had a slow start and was at times difficult to follow but in the end it was worth the effort and i'm glad i stuck with it this is a very literary complex novel that moves back and forth in time between 1965 and 2007 it is multi layered has numerous characters complicated relationships and is told from multiple points of view there's a lot going on love loss a decades old mystery a few unexpected twists plus an interesting look into the world of high priced art the book is beautifully written with vivid descriptions lyrical prose and well developed characters it is at times a haunting emotional read i did enjoy the bird references in particular the blue grosbeak a gorgeous bird and not often mentioned in literature his presence in the artwork is important which isn't revealed until the end this may have been easier to follow in print if it wasn't for the excellent narration by cassandra campbell her reading kept me alert to changes in point of view and flashbacks in time it required a little additional attention but regular audio listeners will be pleased with this production","491":"at the end of the day this feels more like a guilty pleasure than an enlightening read must say i enjoyed it though","492":"i absolutely loved this book loved the characters all flawed and real but with redeeming qualities loved the talk about painting and loved the references to birds beautifully written wonderful read","493":"beautifully written interesting mystery to the plot kept me interested until the end","494":"the plot gets a bit out of hand but the characters are compelling and the writing strong","495":"beautifully written","496":"this review has been hidden because it contains spoilers to view it click here i quite like this book and i must say that i did guess bayber was his father from the beginning and later thought that i was wrong in doing so i first read the sneak peak because the main character shares my name but the writer put so much mystery and suspense in it that i was dying to read it i didn't like the romance side of the novel but the mysteries and plot twists were the best areas they are what kept me reading","497":"i like the sisters but the mystery part feels a little contrived i have trouble keeping finch and jameson apart probably because i could care less about either of them i like bayber too the descriptions of art are nice not overdone the whole ra thing is also more obnoxious like a pity plea than like a real thing being dealt with by alice i'm happy reading this because the parts that are well done are very well done and the parts that aren't well done are only minorly annoying at least so far alice is supposed to be an observer a bird watcher but she is the least observant character in the book everything she finds out toward the end of the book is apparent in the very first chapter it is infuriating that the paradox of her watchful personality and her absolute near sightedness in relationships is never made explicit she never admits this and so it feels like just a poorly written character i expect characters to be at least slightly self aware and if not give them appropriate characteristics for non self aware people someone so introspective should be able to recognize this contradiction within herself agh i have to keep reading though to guzeman's credit despite my frustration the ending is satisfying despite the extra meaningless twist finch gets more developed the sisters possibly less so and stephen stays annoying the descriptions of the artwork are well done and weirdly made this book worth reading even though i usually hate vivid descriptions of things that aren't characters they add to the characters i suppose and so reading them is worthwhile","498":"i enjoyed the story the character development was really good","499":"2 5 rounded down to 2","500":"i gave this book 4 stars because i think the writing is excellent the descriptions and characterizations are so impressive for a first novel however i can't say i liked the book though not graphic the abundance of immorality really bothered me there are some things that end happily but much of it is so sad i could hardly stand to finish it the results of lies told and truths not told are so devastating i hope in her next book it will not be too late to fix past mistakes by the time the book ends i hope to read more of her books but only if they don't leave me with such as feeling of it's too late","501":"i loved this book thanks for the recommendation susie gilbert from the title i would have never picked this book off of the shelf","502":"beautiful writing so many secrets lies and misunderstandings that cause much heartache between two sisters and the artist briefly in their lives yet the author weaves a fascinating mystery about a missing painting of the two sisters art authentication and restoration and the resilience of love and family don't miss this read with its twists turns and surprises","503":" the gravity of birds by tracy guzeman is a very typical book - the plot and writing are both typical as is the progression there was little to separate it from the rest in terms of quirkiness or creativity this doesn't necessarily make it bad just something that you might want to be prepared for alice is the protagonist so a lot of the gravity of birds both in the past and the present is told from her point of view alice is gullible and constantly self pitying so she isn't exactly someone that you want to look up to but i liked her enough to hope for a happy outcome for her finch and stephen also play a very large role in the gravity of birds and to tell you the truth i really had a hard time distinguishing them from each other they are both incredibly neurotic and awkward but quite funny together and are supposed to be very similar to each other personality wise eventually i began to think of them as interchangeable and not worth the effort to try to keep straight in my mind read the rest of this review and more of my reviews at www bookwookie ca","504":"i loved this story it was quiet and strong and had a lovely veil of stillness about it almost as if the story was told mirroring alice and her movements it never rushed but settles itself in your mind as any great story should so good","505":"this is the author's first novel it is a great book great characterization good balance of two time settings unpredictable plot","506":"this was an entertaining story that jumped from past to present and back again narrated by three believable lovable and flawed characters it's about art and about family and relationships and disappointments and compromise loved this book","507":"solid read that wasn't as predictable as i thought it might be really rich and well developed characters with an interesting plot a few memorably well written phrases look forward to more by this author","508":"great story line i love reading about the gallery side of the art world","509":"the story line grabbed me before the characters did i did end up liking a few of them i enjoyed the suspense and the role of the painting in the story i would give it 3 5 if i could","510":" i loved this book it is the story of alice kessler and natalie kessler two sisters who meet an artist living in a summer house near the house they rent every august years later the artist suddenly calls on his friend an art historian and a young valuation expert to sell a portrait he has of the two girls but first they have to find the sisters it is a very well done novel and i couldn't put it down what kept it from being a 5 start novel for me was that i didn't find the sisters' story completely believable without giving anything away i find it hard to believe that anyone's jealousy would last as long as it did in this novel in addition i find it somewhat unbelievable that an adult who grew up with a strong independent personality who went off to college and lived out on her own would suddenly become completely dependent on a sibling to the point of barely functioning but that is only a small part of the novel it is a very good read","511":"overall i liked it the character were well drawn though not always likable the story well paced and interesting sometimes the switching between time and characters could get confusing didn't blow me away but a good read","512":"i couldn't finish this book it's well written but the characters in it are a mess in order to like a book and want to finish reading it there has to be at least one sympathetic protagonist someone you care about the gravity of birds has none","513":"a 3 5 excellent writing good characters but at times the plot feels a little contrived worth reading though","514":"a great story with interesting characters and information about art it's not 5 star because i didn't find the depth but i really enjoyed it i so want to go to santa fe","515":"it's a tale of youth love and deception with a little mystery to tie it all together","516":"at first i found the novel slow and i wondered whether i would make it through the more i got to know alice the more intrigued i got and became engrossed in the novel while i find the natalie's actions sad it gave a depth to the story i couldn't have thought of myself i won't spoil the story but can honestly say i was so surprised to discover just who stephen was i don't know if anyone else had the same reaction but i just didn't see it coming overall i am glad i picked this one up it was a lovely read and took me on a unexpected journey","517":"a solid good read wonderful characters beautiful descriptions and a bit of a mystery plot line reminded me a little bit of her fearful symmetry","518":"this book unravelled in such an unusual way i often found myself asking if i wanted to continue there were parts that were written so beautifully so descriptively that i read them twice other parts i wanted to skim because the same attention to detail wasn't there overall though i'm glad i stuck with it","519":"i liked how all pieces came together in the end but it moved slowly","520":"i enjoyed this book","521":"i have conflicting feelings about this book i really wanted to find out what happened but i found the basic premise of the story unbelievable","522":"what a beautiful story and well written","523":"i really enjoyed this book for about the first hundred or so pages it was very appealing but around the middle of the book some of the detail started to really slow the story down and became tiresome i then ran into some plot issues that i found a bit implausible and then just lost interest in finding out what happened that surprised me because it was rather intriguing at the start","524":" this was a huge pleasant surprise although reviews of it tend to mislead in that the story has very little to do with art guzeman certainly understands appraisal and conservation well but the bits of art world information are really just backdrop for something much more low brow however as low brow and salacious as the real premise of the story may be combination slap stick road trip antics scheming relatives clandestine affairs it's exceptionally well written guzeman's plot may scream ya chick lit but her writing says literature a few ridiculous coincidences rankled me a bit man people sure do tend to die at very convenient times but it was surprisingly touching at times and loads of fun to read","525":"3 5 stars while i enjoyed the writing and the flawed characters i found the plot a tad implausible at times the sudden realization of jameson's real father irked me for some reason u0026amp felt like the author was trying a bit too hard sometimes it brought a favorite book of mine empire falls to mind which similarly had great characters u0026amp beautiful prose u0026amp an intriguing plot but the gravity of birds definitely didn't quite measure up it was an easy u0026amp compelling read however and had some valuable insights about human relationships i also liked the different backdrops of the lakeside cabin a small southern town new york u0026amp santa fe","526":"a beautifully written book that is captivating and emotional i couldn't put this book down and when i had no choice it was nearly all i thought about until i picked it up again full of surprises every page is a piece of art unto itself","527":"loved this one so good","528":"an average but decent mystery with some compelling art elements i found some characters utterly fascinating while others fell a bit short","529":"goes back and forth between present and today about two sisters forced to stay together even though they do not get along also about an eccentric painter that comes into their lives in the present people are trying to find his missing paintings it was ok but didn't really hold my attention","530":"this book is a reminder of why i am stingy with five star ratings it is because i save them for the very very best books ones that leave a lasting unforgettable impression in the summer of 1963 sisters alice and natalie are book ending the first blush of womanhood alice has just entered her teens and natalie is barely looking back upon her teen aged years it is the summer when at a lakeside cottage each of them will encounter a neighboring artist several years older than them thomas forward to 2007 an elderly thomas is looking back upon his illustrious art career and commissions an almost washed up fine art authenticator stephen to evaluate a piece of his art that has remained unknown to the public stephen is teamed with finch an art history professor in this endeavor the work of art is an unsettling portrait of young thomas natalie and alice sitting on a sofa but there is so much more to the painting than meets the eye the year 1972 is also pivotal as events of that year resulted not only in mysterious aspects of the painting but in the complete disappearance of the sisters family history missing art secrets and searches bring all the characters together in an extraordinary unfolding story tracy guzeman is masterful at weaving the tale and it is not a spoiler to say that the ending is......spectacular","531":"i really loved this novel about two sisters and how their chance encounter with an artist changed their lives the novel spans from the early sixties to today as a reclusive artist decides he wants to sell a painting he's kept hidden for almost 40 years before auctioning the painting he asks an art historian and expert in authentication to locate the sisters whom he painted all those years ago","532":"i liked it there was enough complexity to keep it interesting i was a little disappointed with some of the character development most of the characters were really good but the character on the autism spectrum was not quite right it is really good for a first novel for this writer i enjoyed meeting her and i would definitely read another of her books there was some mystery and romance art and ornithology","533":"i really really like this book the characters except for the artist are interesting and flawed and so human the writing is excellent it caught me off guard the description of the book doesn't do it justice please ms guzeman keep writing","534":"really enjoyed the book would recommend","535":"a nice fast read the book takes some twists and turns and takes a different direction than i thought it would having said that i thought all the character were enjoyable and wish i had more time with them","536":"i loved the wonderful structure and pacing of the book it was a mystery masked as contemporary fiction i loved how the story unfolded and how it was told from multiple vantage points i loved the long term complex relationships between characters the mystery aspect of the story kept propelling the characters and the story forward but the complex relationships and the multiple vantage points made it feel like the story unfolded slowly and carefully not rushed in any way","537":"i was interested to keep reading throughout some time changes added to the unfolding of the plot unlike the current trends of waffling back and forth without purpose unexpected revelation at the end good read","538":" this is one of those books that i wanted to turn around and read again as soon as i finished it there can be a few reasons for doing that 1 you liked it so much that you don't want to be done 2 it was so complex that when you got to the end you said hey wait a minute...and went back to see if you completely understood how to get to where you got 3 you wanted to wallow more in the writing or the characters or the imagery or the story parts of all three of those played into my desire to start over the characters were complex it took a long time to get to that in the book so once i did i wanted to spend more time understanding them than the author had given me the imagery was compelling i so wanted the artists in this book to be real so that once i was done i could go look them up on the internet and see their paintings and sculptures so as to add the visual component the story took place on a triple timeline in multiple locales so i felt the need to go back and check when certain things happened and who knew what at the time they did this is a fairly simple story and simply written yet the complexity of human emotions and betrayals involved made it intricate and nuanced a lovely first effort and i will definitely keep track of the author to see what she writes next and yes i will probably reread this very soon","539":"enjoyed mysterious and kept you reading loved how the story was woven","540":"i enjoyed this book would probably give it 3 5 stars if i knew how to do a half star very easy to read well written with a good story line that twisted around the characters","541":"lovely textured novel","542":" note i got my copy of this book through first readshonestly from the outset i wasn't sure if i was going to really enjoy or get into this book although i have liked this sort of genre in the past it has been off my radar for a while saying that i actually ended up really loving the book the pacing was slow at the offset reading about the childhood of alice and natalie distinctly from alice's point of view which i enjoyed and i appreciate that she was young and naive and viewing the world with rose tinted glasses as all children do but it isn't my cup of tea essentially really for the first hundred pges or so i kept having to motivate myself to read doing only a small amount at a time but at around halfway through i was gripped as you were offered small packets of information and as a reader i was desparately tring to work out the full story even towards the end of the book when i thought i had everything down to a tee a few small surprises cropped up keeping me on my toes the whole way through as for the characters we are led to really sympathise with alice from the beggining since she is the innocent younger sister and there are deceitful vibes coming from natalie even then saying that throughout the book we are led to not reconcile with or forgive natalie but to consider her motivations and come to our own conclusions on the events that have transpired between the sisters yes there are some malicious undertones but even the characters themeselves question if they do truely hate her even with this in mind whether alice is too naive and trusting is held into question showing true flaws in both sisters and there strong reliance on eachother as for our other two main characters finch and stephen there relationship was intriguing to me stephen was truley believable for me myself knowing people who are just as straight talking and though i don't think this is quite the right word as socially inept as stephen he makes mistakes is a little strange and has a quirky way to form relationships which makes his role and presence stronger for me at least as for finch his raw emotions that come to play throughout the novel are endearing and again his relationships and sympathy are some of the most interesting aspects of his character really i love the way these two play off each other stephen with is scientific analysis and finch taking an emotional standpoint overall this is a wonderful book set out with each chapter being at different times or from different perspectives as too feed information slowly to piece together the complex relationship between the kessler sisters and thomas bayber i loved the story and the twists and turns the only thing was i found it hard to initially get into this book but it didn't take long for me to be hooked","543":"this novel is superb it is centred on a famous dying artist who has not painted for years 2 art experts and 2 sisters who were neighbours of the artist one summer in their youth it is a tale of loss of lies that changed lives and of the gradual revelation of the truth the book is both beautifully written and emotionally powerful i loved it","544":"another beautifully written book with a great plot and interesting characters that is a stinker","545":"i liked this and at times i really loved it but overall i think it's just okay it felt a bit too dense and i think it could have used a better edit and some of the plot turns seemed really easy and contrived i wish we'd had something of natalie's perspective because it's hard to have any big feelings about a character who has no real voice of her own all i know is the laundry list of her faults and mistakes and hurtful actions and although her motivation is speculated upon i still don't think i understand her that well it's a little like tell the wolves i'm home or the swan thieves but not quite as good as either that being said i'm glad to have read this one and would recommend to library patrons","546":"i won this in a goodreads giveaway a haunting debut","547":" hopefully this first novel of tracy guzeman's will be followed by more wonderful writing engaging characters and an intriguing plot with twists and surprises natalie and alice have a typical sisterly relationship in which natalie is the pretty one and alice is the smart one when they meet a charming painter during a family vacation thomas will affect their lives and futures in a way they would never predict fast forward decades later to find thomas a hugely successful and famous artist although a recluse who has stopped painting thomas asks his friend finch an art history professor and stephen an art authenticator to look at a never before seen painting the subjects are thomas alice and natalie and there are two more paintings that must be shown together with it finch and stephen thus become detectives in a hunt for the two missing pieces and what ensues is a wonderfully engrossing story absolutely loved it","548":"this book was very well written but a little confusing and very sad i wanted some more information when it ended about what happens to the characters and do more secrets come out i will spend a lot of time thinking about the characters and their choices but i don't think it will make my list of favorites","549":"the gravity of birds was a gripping story of the art world the connections between an artist's life and work family secrets sibling rivalry and human frailty and regrets in this mystery filled with surprising plot twists guzeman successfully creates sympathetic characters in whose fates i was deeply invested i enjoyed reading this book and it was a fast read for me but there were a couple of details that did not ring true for example the shocks on a rental car would not be worn out as rental cars are rountinely well maintained and sopapillas are served with honey not powdered sugar i know these issues are minor but for me to give a book five stars it has to be painstakingly researched details and all that said i will definitely look for more books by tracey guzeman since this was an amazingly good debut novel","550":" the gravity of birdsby tracy guzeman summeryhow do you find someone who wants to be lost natalie and alice kessler are sisters who have always been close until the events of one summer wrenches them apart natalie is headstrong manipulative and beautiful alice is a naive and sees the good in everyone including thomas bayber a talented artist who paints the sisters but by the end of the summer all their lives will be changed forever years later thomas is a reclusive world renowned artist bayber who reveals a painting called the kessler sisters a provocative painting depicting the young thomas natalie and alice thomas asks dennis finch an art history professor and stephen jameson an eccentric young art authenticator to sell the painting for him but first they must find natalie and alice who seem to have vanished finch finds himself wondering why thomas is suddenly so intent on resurrecting the past in the gravity of birds is a book about personal histories and memories that refuse to stay buried in the end only the excavation of the past will enable its survivors to love again this is a brilliant book buttragic story of love lies and loss and forgiveness 4 5 stars","551":"exquisite a tale of loss a mystery too and a book i was sad to finish perfection","552":"i could not put this book down from the moment i picked it up it's an engrossing story of lost love dysfunctional sisters and friendship set amongst the search for two paintings the only problem i had with the book was that everything seemed to tie up a little too neatly at the end","553":"really interesting involving story highly recommend","554":"this is a page turner i literally carried it everywhere with me the characters their lives losses and discoveries kept me eager to find the resolution to their life long mysteries the world of art figures centrally but the damage done to each other and the eventual resolution were what i found so intriguing this is guzeman's first novel i'll be watching for more","555":"i loved the characters in this book especially alice compelling story that never disappointed it is the kind of book that i had a hard time putting down and now that i am finished i am a little sad that i won't be keeping company with the characters anymore more than a love story a mystery of the finest sort","556":"two sisters one attractive man and birds lots of birds art lots of art a love story and a story of two sisters at odds with each other forced by circumstances to live together a story that zooms in and out from the past to the present and all the times in between a story that leaves you filled with sadness for what might have been and what shouldn't have happened and what wasn't said i liked this story a lot i think you will too","557":"2 5 started out great then dragged dragged dragged picked up again around page 200 and was very good after that interesting plot twist but unsatisfying ending for me seemed as if after page 200 it was rush to the ending and then just end the writing was very good","558":"it all came together at the end and that is why i gave it four stars i'm glad i stuck it out when it lagged a bit midway through","559":"i read the goodreads and the amazon previews of the gravity of birds and i was so hopeful that i had found a book similar in feel to my new favorite tell the wolves i'm home unfortunately though it had a lot of potential the execution was just a bit lacking the story was good yet only some of the characters were developed some other characters though integral to the plot the reader never got to know i enjoyed reading it but was also disappointed by the end","560":" though well written with an interesting premise the gravity of birds ultimately feels average and unremarkable in the summer of 1963 famous painter thomas bayber meets two sisters natalie and alice and the lives of all three change forever decades later in 2007 thomas tasks a friend with finding the two sisters and two of his paintings they own all of whom have disappeared told in both 2007 and various times in the past the story slowly unravels the truth of what happened between thomas natalie and alice it's an interesting story and one that i wanted to keep reading to find out what happened but by the end some of the twists and turns made the plot a bit too soap opera ish for my taste it's not a very realistic story we'll say additionally i didn't find any of the characters particularly compelling while there are some strong supporting characters the main relationship between thomas natalie and alice felt sparse there are very few scenes between them and thomas and natalie are barely in the book at all since the book revolves around those characters they needed to be fleshed out more the prose is elegant with some lovely imagery and it's a quick read but while there is nothing particularly wrong or bad with this book there's nothing particularly memorable either note i received this book through goodreads' first reads program","561":"tracy guzeman's first novel is fascinating told from the point of view alice kessler but also the point of view of two art scholars dennis finch the expert on the painting of thomas bayber and stephen jameson the art authenticator with more than a touch of social blindness i am always impressed when an author succeeds in writing from the point of view of more than one main character at first i was drawn in by the gentle lyricism of guzeman's language and the way the descriptions seemed to float the scene in front of my eyes but soon the alluring plot picked me up and took me for the ride in addition it's always a pleasure to find myself immersed in a new world as the background of a novel in this book the world of fine art i learned a little about birds too but i see them as more symbolic the characters are all imperfect some more than others and as the novel progressed i kept learning more about each one it was a voyage of character discovery as well as the slow revelation of the central mystery i loved this novel and hope you do too","562":" for a first novel this book is amazing it's amazing if it were from a seasoned author with a long string of great novels ok it starts slow or i thought it did when i was finished reading it i read the first chapter over again and it made much more sense the book is about two sisters who were close as children but with adolescence comes competition manipulation and yes hatred alice and her sister natalie are two very different people who could have lived separate lives and should have but alice has rheumatoid arthritis and needs a caretaker the worst caretaker in the world for her turns out to be the one she has her sister they loved at one point in their lives the same artist this is as much of a spoiler as i will offer before he was bayber the sisters spent a summer living next to thomas bayber a struggling young artist when we meet bayer again 40 years have passed and he hasn't painted in 20 years he shows his biographer finch an unknown painting surprising finch by adding that it is part of a trio the other two pieces of which are missing bayber now dissolute and impoverished asks for stephen jameson a talented authenticator to help finch find and sell the entire triptych it would put his life back on track bringing in millions the book alternates voices and times with each chapter so you understand islands of time and characters as they are exposed it makes for a slow but clear development the book is beautifully unwrapped and written i read pages over again just for their voice and tone as the book drew to an end there are some mysteries that remain which makes it even more interesting where are the paintings and why does bayber want finch and steven to find them and what else does bayber want as the lives of alice and natalie become more clear so do the motivations of finch and steven a wonderful read that i was sorry to see come to an end","563":"this book took an awfully long time to set up the last few chapters i would have liked less lead in and more about the after still enjoyed it and might recommend it to someone interested in art","564":" i wish goodreads had a half star option i'm torn somewhere between liking and really liking this book the characters were all well done and fairly multi faceted even if you occasionally became frustrated with them their actions were understandable the story compelling and guzeman has a knack for beautiful descriptions it's not even necessarily that there was anything specific lacking i simply felt less tied to the characters and the books than i felt i should feel in the end i was left emotionally untouched despite knowing that it was very much the type of story that has the capacity to be emotionally powerful i can't even place my finger on why save that perhaps the transitions were jarring enough that i scrabbled around the edges trying to pry my fingers into some sort of crack which would gain me an emotional foothold if you will","565":"very good story symbolism and plot a little too contrived characters well drawn","566":" i did something i rarely do before i write a review i went to amazon to see what others thought of this book most gave it 4 to 5 stars they praised the author's beautiful prose they loved the art angle in the plot then i read reviews by readers who gave this book 3 stars and their complaints were the same as mine i was relieved to know i wasn't the only person who didn't love this book the biggest problem is the main characters are unlikable the brilliant artist is selfish the sister he loves is weak yes i know ra is a disease as we are constantly reminded by the author but the character failed to win my sympathy because she was such a victim and the jealous scorned sister is psychotic as readers we are left to our own devices to figure out why this character did what she did then the author conveniently kills her off so we never get to hear her side of the story it's why this melodramatic story doesn't quite work yes it's beautifully written but the motivation of the central characters is downright implausible","567":"i was lucky enough to read an advance review copy wow gorgeously written absolutely compelling i gobbled it up and wanted more not from the book but from guzeman","568":" tracy guzeman's debut novel has left me wishing she would hurry up and write another her inspiration for the novel was a curiosity about the back story of an old family portrait and that is how this story drew me in as well the novel is a portrait of a family you think you know and a dance between characters in the past and present to uncover the thick gritty layer of truth beneath the surface i loved tracy's ability to paint a picture with her words i just loved her choice of words her use of them sounds silly maybe but some people just have that talent of stringing words together in a melodic way like tracy while others write in a forced manner that is not pleasant to read i raced through the second half of the novel because i was excited to find out what happens at the same time i felt dread at reaching the end of the story i would definitely recommend this novel","569":"this book is great i loved the two male characters who go off on a road trip just finished the book and definitely recommend it thanks lara for sharing i recommend this book","570":"i really enjoyed the way this book was written the characters were rich and the story was very interesting","571":"should be a 3 5 took awhile to get into this thought i was going to bail but held on a little longer and enjoyed it","572":"this book had good strong characters and a twisting plot that kept me captivated i believe the greatest accomplishment of this book is how the author was able to bring art alive through her words and descriptions and i appreciated this literary talent i also appreciated the symbolism of birds and how she threaded this theme throughout the book","573":"this book was well written from a technical aspect the characters were clearly drawn and the descriptions tantalizing guzeman did her research into art identification techniques bird watching and other subjects important to the storyline and it shows however what disappointed most about this book was its plot which was so carefully almost painfully engineered for entertainment and emotional digestibility its beautiful shell contained a formulaic and predictable core i should have been tipped off by the cast of characters a tired lineup of young girl artist old man prodigy fallen from grace it tugged at all the right heart strings the desire to prove something to parents familiar life losses sibling rivalry turned dark and malicious even the title with its obvious paradox fits the template of similar books while i can understand wanting to make a book appealing to the broadest audience possible too much of the writer's promise and creativity was lost to this endeavor while she left an attractive picture behind that shows some suggestion of artistry this writer colored inside the lines too much","574":"incredibly beautiful and tragically sad absolutely loved the author's ability to weave this story when i first started the book i didn't have time to read more than the first couple of chapters today i was compelled to spend my whole afternoon reading it as i couldn't put it down","575":"really liked this book i love the way tracy guzeman writes so was engrossed in the story though i had an inkling of what would happen still loved the journey","576":"a good story it has surprises","577":" i would certainly read guzeman's next novel but there are elements of this that were a bit much and it took me a few tries to finish it a lot of the dialogue is well i might say literary to the point of being distracting there are passages that simply dwould not get said outloud in real life conversations that it's very hard to imagine outside of masterpiece theater there's also a tidiness to the plot and a wink kind of charm to even the flawed characters that feels very clearly fictional that said this is fiction and guzeman does write beautifully about these characters and places i could inhabit this world more easily when reading the internal voices of the characters it's when they interacted with each other that the writing felt more like a script than a reflection of life","578":"3 5 this isn't a bad book but i found it depressing and sad the author tried to bring a positive resolution but the main characters had so much needless sorrow in their lives for so long that the overall effect for me was sadness","579":" i started this book months ago but then abandoned it because i just couldn't quite get into it some of the narration was a bit too detailed for me but then i came back to it last week and couldn't put it down i ended up really liking the book after all was said and done i wondered if the author was also a visual artist because her understanding of the emotional depth that a painting can convey is evident i loved that aspect of the book favorite quotes from the book \"the estimation of an artist's talent is often based on his ability to render both light and shadow if you have any choice in the matter spend your time seeking the former \" do not let grief be the only map you carry lest you lose your way back to happiness","580":"periodically i congratulate myself on being lucky enough to live in a time where i can find a treasure of a book and have it in my hand instantly thanks to my kindle granted there has been more than one purchase that fell far short of being a treasure the gravity of birds is truly a treasure makes me want to thank anyone who had a thought in writing inspiring or bringing to market can you tell i loved this book rather than provide a synopsis why do we need one more reviewer re writing the synopsis anyway let me just say that the characters are beautifully written identifiable and fully fleshed out i can see each of them in my mind's eye they were so beautifully described the little throw away lines such as no doubt ordering multiple copies of pat the bunny speak volumes about the character who thinks it as well as the character it describes perfection","581":"the author writes in a very lyrical style that i love the story was hard to put down it broke my heart for the people in the tale and yet i had to finish it if you like a mystery this one had it","582":"i chose this book because of its cover and it was on my shelf for over 1 year i gave it 3 stars not more because it was a pleasant lecture but nothing more the prose is really well written and at some point almost beautiful the characters are well drawn but i could not really appreciate the plot too many lucky coincidences and something

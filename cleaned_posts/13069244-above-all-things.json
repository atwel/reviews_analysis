been a little bit behind with my reviews but above all things was a huge surprise for me it was not at all what i was expecting by a long shot it was completely and totally unputdownable i loved every word every sentence every paragraph and every page and chapter tanis rideout is a beautiful writer and she transported me to mt everest this book is not just a book about another climb to the summit it is so much more a must read 5 enthusiastic stars","2":"very well written the characters had emotional depth and the book gave a real sense of time and place","3":"while i loved the george mallory chapters i wasn't as captivated by the ruth chapters but overall a great read for those interested in everest stories definitely prompting me to read more about mallory","4":"slow to start but accelerated i felt i was on the mountain at times","5":"somehow i have managed to live my entire life without knowing thing about george mallory or the 1924 attempt to conquer everest just in case you've managed to do the same i won't give away the ending but i suspect i'm the only person on the planet who had the opportunity to read this book without knowing what was coming consequently i was surprised when the ending happened i have since done a bit of reading about mallory and the early treks up the world's highest mountain and i can say that tanis rideout did a stunning job bringing the story and characters to life this is a tragic book and not just in relation to mountaineering this book is about human passions the drive that pushes us to go farther and to sacrifice everything for a goal in this novel obsession takes on human shape loss is palpable and you begin to sense that the story isn't really about mallory at all but about love and how it isn't enough even though we believe that it should be i don't know what reading this book would have been like if i had already known the shape of this story i went into this an innocent and came out shaken a great book that skirts precipice between fact and fiction","6":"what drives a person to do incredible feats is an important question about the human condition why does a person do a certain task when it seems impossible to do how do the people feel around that person while he she is trying to accomplish the impossible and what occurs in the mind of that person if he she should happen to fail to reach that goal that is some of the important points tanis rideout explores in her brilliant novel above all things my complete review","7":" since i vaguely remembered the story of george mallory and his passion for climbing mt everest i wanted to revisit this part of history this is essentially an historical novel which takes a slice of his third and fatal climb of everest and looks at it through the eyes of some of the characters on the climb as well as an often little mentioned participant his wife who agonizes over the situation while trying to be brave as well even before her husband was lost on the mountain she went through the pain of a broken promise made after his last climb to never go on an everest expedition again i believe this novel is well researched it's a worthwhile read","8":"whoa tough one to read but knowing it is based on a true story makes it more interesting and appealing definitely well written and insightful just sad","9":"what a simply amazing book i loved the transition between the two different story lines the change between first person and third the characters were riveting and the plot moved along very smoothly as someone who knew nothing about the subject from the get go i must admit your story has inspired me to study up on it bravo will most definitely recommend this novel to friends and family note i received this novel for free from the first reads giveaways","10":" i've just read above all things by tanis rideout and highly recommend it it was sent to me by my mother in law ahead of my planned visit to nepal 'because it's there ' were the three words george mallory explained why explorers do what they do yet beyond these words volumes have been left unsaid with above all things finally fills in this void illuminating one of the great tragic adventure stories of the modern day age it's a fantastic read \"the book is a captivating blend of historical fact and imaginative fiction above all things moves seamlessly back and forth between the epic story of mallory's legendary final expedition and a heartbreaking account of a day in the life of george's wife ruth mallory through george's perspective and that of the newest member of the climbing team sandy irvine we get an astonishing picture of the terrible risks taken by the men on the treacherous terrain of the himalaya the writing is so fantastically descriptive you can almost feel the intense cold and biting wind indeed it was a a comfort to read it on a hot sunny beach the drama and danger of this most historic climb is immense and you'll wonder how anyone can actually make this climb but it is through ruth's eyes that a complex portrait of a marriage emerges one forged on the eve of the first world war shadowed by its losses and haunted by the ever present possibility that george might not come home drawing on years of research this powerful and beautifully written novel offers a deeply satisfying blend of fiction and truth a story of desire struggle love and the lengths people are willing to go for honour glory and fame if you enjoy the book as much as i did you might like this link where you can share your viewpoints and answer deeper questions read group guideonce you've been bitten by the george mallory bug - did he or did he not reach the summit there are numerous blog sites debating this topic one that i enjoyed isthe mystery of mallory and irvineas this history is so well known i don't think i'm providing a book spoiler comment by saying the following so i'll close by saying do i think they made it my personal opinion is yes i think george made it to the summit but due to the change of weather lack of light and sheer exhaustion mistakes were made on the descent it would have been easy to lose the correct path in the darkness and then slip his body was found in 1999 and the famous photograph of his wife which he pledged to leave on the summit was not found in his clothing however a successful summit is one where the climber achieves the goal and returns no matter there are huge accolades for these brave men in the 1920's who attempted this climb with primitive clothing materials and knowledge they paved the way for mountain climbers who followed years later armed with the advice and knowledge gained read the book and you'll definitely get bitten by the mallory bug sa","11":"another standout","12":"fascinating an excellent debut novel provides an interesting historic perspective on a fascinating mountain climber","13":"this was a very moving fictionalized account of george mallory's final attempt to reach the summit of everest i found the sections covering the adventures of the expedition to be rather exciting and enveloping the alternating sections narrated by george's wife ruth waiting at home with their three children were very different but were also quite moving the two different styles and storylines were well interwoven i found the ending to be rather affecting despite knowing the ultimate result rideout does take a few liberties with the historical record for literary reasons which she explains in the author's note at the end i don't think they were really necessary however other great histories of george mallory have already been written people can turn to those for a good source of facts what this book offers is an exploration of relationships strained but strong and it was very touching","14":"a very interesting read and i loved the parts that were written from ruth's perspective","15":"too hard to get into i enjoyed reading his wife's pov but george's chapters were boring i found myself just not really caring too bad because the actual story is intriguing","16":"enjoyed the book was disappointed that the author deviated from the actual life of mallory in terms of the timing of his brothers death it seemed to be such an important aspect of his reason to climb but in reality was different i guess one could say his brother represented all wwi soldiers","17":"the story of george mallory and his obsession with climbing mount everest is fascinating the author has captured the mystery the adventure and the hardships of conquering the worlds tallest mountain in elaborate detail it also tells the story of mallory's wife ruth left back in england wondering and waiting for word of her husbands success or failure i gave four stars for george's story and left one star blank for ruth's story which i found to be drawn out and mostly boring","18":"i absolutely loved this book as the spouse of a retired military service member i could relate ruth's feeling experiences during their separation i received a digital review copy of this book from net galley through first flights the penguin debut author program","19":"with a mix of fact and fiction tanis rideout's above all things was an engaging read within the first few pages i knew that i would like this book i was not disappointed she was able to draw me into the story about how the pull of the summit of mount everest was for george mallory and his team at the same time she was able to show us the feelings of the families left behind losing their loved ones to the passionate drive to be the first to make it to the summit and wondering when or if they will return i highly recommend this book","20":"based on the reviews and having recently read into thin air i thought i would enjoy this book more i struggled to get into it and connect with the characters never really was drawn to finish but after skimming ahead i reached the end maybe i am one of the few who didn't really care for it","21":"a really well written and memorable book with grueling details of mountain climbing but i only rated it 3 stars for a couple of reasons the mix of fact and fiction was a little hard to sort out and mallory's wife was portrayed as weak and unable to cope was she really like that in all fairness i probably ruined it for myself by doing a little side research about half way through so i knew all would not end well overall quite a bleak although true tale","22":"this book follows the story of an early english expedition to mount everest it follows the lead explorer george mallory on the expedition and his wife at home back in england caring for their family i really enjoyed the story and the parallels between the climbers on the mountain and the family back home","23":"this review has been hidden because it contains spoilers to view it click here what an interesting read developed and told through the letters between ruth and george mallory i didnt really know to much about mt everest never found mt everest interesting or really questioned who had climed her or why they wanted to but when i picked up this book the mountain and the people it enchanted really hooked

this book not my usual thing at all but the story was compelling and i felt for the characters quite a debut novel","25":"i enjoyed the story here that looks at the relationship between george mallory and his wife ruth he the hero that dies on everest and she the one out of the spotlight but who keeps things going on the home front some gripping writing about the climb and the group of men who attempted and the challenges they faced felt it was very well researched and reader friendly","26":"i am fascinated by all things everest this was interesting but a little slow i wanted more of her side","27":"above all things tells the fictionalized story of george mallory's third attempt at reaching the summit of mt everest the author not only did her research on the subject tanis rideout manages to make you feel you are along for the ascent it is a story of travel adventure and love we get three perspectives that of george a novice climber sandy and george's wife ruth who is left at home to carry on while her husband seeks glory for great britain the chapters vacillate between the three different voices and blend into a compelling tale once again this was a book of fiction that caused me to do internet research of the true story tanis rideout does a marvelous job putting the reader in the middle of this historic time fascinating","28":" 4 1 2 stars i really enjoyed this book it is historical fiction so you pretty much know the outcome when you begin reading but it is very well written and still creates suspense the plot flows between the expedition in the 1920's and george's wife and family back home waiting for word this creates the tension of rooting for george but being pretty mad at him at the same time probably much like ruth the descriptions of the conditions are remarkable i could almost feel the thin air the cold the wind the reader is left with the same question historians have did george mallory make it","29":" a really great historical fiction about the lives of george mallory and his wife ruth during his third expedition to everest while ultimately an examination of what it must be like for those waiting at home for the pursuers of dangerous sport adventure it's also a really interesting read about climbing i now have a slight obsession with everest you know it's hard you know that most sane people would never want to do it but you forget why it's so challenging until you examine the minutiea involved with the process the will and obsession required to conquer it while rideout created fictionalized versions of the mallorys the story is based on years of research on their private communications and public documents","30":"i think because i knew what would happen in the end it made me not like the character as much i just felt frustrated through the whole thing interesting though","31":"i really liked the idea of this book told from the perspectives of the explorer husband and the wife left back at home however i didn't find the wife's part very interesting at all i found her whiny and boring i did quite enjoy the husbands part it love historical fiction i have never really read about the early explorers of mt everest over all i enjoyed it","32":"really enjoyed this fiction based on the story of george mallory and his third attempt to climb mt everest i liked how the author alternated between the story of george's trip and assault on everest and one day in the life of his wife while he was away there was one confusing point early in the book one character is introduced and later one character is referred to by the first name and another by the last name bad editing","33":" i had high hopes for this book an explorer climbing mount everest and his wife's perspective as well how interesting but i was so wrong here's a list of what i didnt like 1 the book is supposed to be from from the perspective of the wife ruth and george the explorer although i'm ok with others in the story she pops in explorer sandy's perspective why it doesn't fit it feels out of place he's like a third wheel 2 ruth is such a boooooring character all she thinks about is her husband i understand it was 1924 but i do not believe women were this empty i just didnt care about her her perspective doesn't add to the story 3 i don't understand why ruth's written over a day and george over wks or months this was confusing and annoying what was the point in this 4 why would people climbing a dangerous mountain suddenly get a little snapshot of a dinner they went to umm no i just dont believe it 5 i found the story very poor in transitioning from scene to scene 6 george is a jerk i do think a writer can create a readable dislikeable character but not here overall the story had poorly developed charactors the story felt like it was trying too hard to be good like most hollywood movies i just couldn't connect to the story at all it was very very very slooooow i wanted to be interested in exporing and climbing but didn't i didnt finish it","34":"i think most people would rate this book 4 stars i just felt it was hard to get through i didn't like ruth or george and didn't feel connected to any of the characters i would have preferred a fascinating non fiction account","35":"i thoroughly enjoyed the parts of the book dealing with mallory's climb but i could have happily done without ruth's side of the story while it was somewhat interesting to have her perspective i thought the writing in ruth's narrative was forced the final scenes for sandy and george were brilliant","36":"i have no interest in mountain climbing bridges make me nervous yet i liked this maybe because of the juxtaposition of the two narratives i admit that i liked ruth's first person account better i would have liked it more if i didn't know how it would end that george mallory died disappeared on everest in 1924 and his body not found until 1999 but that often happens with historical fiction i like the comment from the reviewer which said the paris wife meets into thin air","37":"i really enjoyed this book i liked that the author explored the psychological reasons behind why people have to conquer everest the autobiographies are hard to swallow sometimes all the talk about it as if it's something has to happen","38":"a blend of historical fact and imaginative fiction this harrowing story follows george mallory's 1924 attempt to conquer everest combined with the telling of the details in a single day of his wife and children left behind in england this book was a real heartbreaker and a bit hard to read in august given it's frozen setting i've never really understood why people continue to go to everest and sacrifice so much when they push themselves in extreme ways even living with canada's cold gets me wondering how i ended up living in such a cold country however when i was working for the nature conservancy of canada ncc i had the distinct pleasure of hearing bernard voyer speak and meeting him afterwards a renowned explorer and mountaineer bernard has climbed the highest peak of every continent including everest in 99 and has stood at all three poles it was a fancy ncc dinner but by the end of his speech tears were just streaming down my face i don't know why he moved me like he did but just for a moment when he talked about how small he felt standing on those peaks how fragile life is and how short and how important it is to follow your passion i think in that moment i had a glimpse into why they do it they are simply taking a dream to reality","39":"above all things was okay but as the story progressed i became less and less interested the story felt flat i didn't finish reading the book","40":"i thought that the premise for this book was so promising and i could not wait to read it however the plot moved so slowly and i gave up about halfway through once george got onto the actual mountain it seemed like not only was the entire mountain party suffering from foggy headeadness from lack of oxygen but so was the author everything moved so slowly and was so vague utterly disappointed","41":" like the paris wife and loving frank above all things focuses on the the lives of real people from the past talented charismatic men and the women who love them in this case tanis rideout has carefully researched george mallory's life and times mallory a product of oxbridge a survivor of the great war is driven to conquer mount everest and to that end he undertakes three expeditions there the novel describes in detail mallory's 1924 attempt to ascend the mountain as part of a team of similarly brave and in my view reckless men the account of this climb comprises about two thirds of the novel the final third is given over to a day in the domestic life of george's wife ruth as she anxiously awaits news of her husband at the outset i was not enthralled by above all things but as the novel progressed it grew on me more and more i became fascinated by what was involved in climbing everest under such primitive conditions mallory and his mates dressed in simple clothing no mec products pooh poohed the use of oxygen and did not have any of the luxuries that modern climbers do it is amazing they were able to go as far as they did ruth's story adds romance and context to mallory's adventures ordinary life awaited him back in england in spite of his extraordinary skills the novel is well written especially considering that it is rideout's first i enjoyed her ability to transition seamlessly from the immediacy of the mountain to a memory that george might have of his courtship of ruth or his trip to the u s a the varying points of view were a good touch as well all in all this is worthy read","42":" in 1924 george mallory attempts to become the first to scale mount everest this novel alternates between his expedition and his wife's ruth struggling to maintain normalcy for their three children the reader like mrs mallory keeps wondering why why would someone attempt such an undertaking and endure such privation when ascending mount everest has become so commonplace that garbage litters the mountain this novel gives us a glimpse into a time when it was indeed men again a mountain","43":"for a story where you knew the ending it was a book i could not put down","44":" i purchased this novel for a friend who then lent it to me i picked it up because i had heard rideout speak about it on cbc radio and because i love to encourage canadian authors i was incredibly impressed with the quality of the research and the structure of the novel i also very much enjoyed the parts which focussed on the wife left behind as mallory climbed mountains or went off on speaking tours however as i am not much of a risk taker and have little patience for people who take extreme risks i did not particularly enjoy the parts which described mallory's exploits but the 4 stars indicate the admiration i have for the talents of this author i would pick up another tanis rideout novel with no hesitation i look forward to her next publication and hope it appears very soon","45":"i liked how rideout alternated mallory's quest to conquer mount everest with his wife's daily narratives about keeping the home fires burning while questioning why she and the kiddos weren't enough to keep her husband home while the book is well written it does get off to a slow start strangely while the author's description of mallory's climb comes alive through her writing i grew weary of the long expedition led by obsessive individuals whose bad decisions ultimately impacted their lives and those of their loved ones i grew exasperated with the little woman left behind story line while her obsessive husband and his companions made repeated bad decisions that affected their lives and those of their loved ones it took me a while to get through this one","46":"this is a wonderful book of historical fiction about the explorer george mallory and his third attempt to conquer mt everest in 1924 the well researched account of his expedition is interwoven with the story of his wife as she patiently waits at home for word from her husband the novel explores the themes of personal sacrifice and what we are willing to do for love and honour and glory beautifully written and extremely moving","47":"this is an excellent historic novel placing king u0026amp country against love and loyalty be fair to yourself and devote the time this story deserves don't rush it along it is a fantastic read exploring interpersonal relationships woven into rugged adventure on the slopes of mount everest in the 1920's","48":"this is a book i hesitated to pick up because it is about mountain climbing a pursuit in which i have no interest the many positive reviews it has received changed my mind and i'm so happy i was persuaded it's not just about mountain climbing and it is a wonderful read the book tells a fictionalized account of george mallory's third attempt to conquer mount everest in 1924 the expedition is described from two points of view that of george's and that of the expedition's least experienced climber sandy irvine the everest sections are alternated with one day in the life of ruth george's wife as she waits for word about her husband the mountain climbing sections kept my attention because the focus is on the men and their thoughts and reactions and not just the physical obstacles encountered the other half with its imaginative rendering of \"what it would mean to be married to a man like george mallory\" 352 was equally interesting climbing mount everest has become an activity for almost anyone with sufficient funds none of these tourists face the challenges of mallory and his contemporaries who \"willingly endured the discomfort and pain of freezing temperatures and the many dangers of extreme altitudes dressed in little more than burberry tweeds\" 352 at a time when some viewed the use of oxygen tanks as \"unsporting\" 254 and unlike ruth mallory the loved ones of modern day tourists need not wait \"for months at a time with nothing but long delayed letters delivered by steamer to soothe their worries\" 352 at one point ruth comments \"'the letter it is weeks old everything has already been decided and there's nothing we can do to change it'\" 299 as she copes with the possibility that her husband might not come home one aspect of the summit attempt about which i was curious was the question of why the obsession to climb everest mallory once gave the enigmatic response \"'because it's there'\" 107 but other motivations are suggested at one point rideout has mallory talking about climbing as an escape 130 and the ultimate adrenaline rush \"'isn't that part of why we go out there the fear the possibility of it all ending to really feel alive'\" 155 as he tries to explain to a doubtful ruth that the sacrifices involved are worth it george argues that \"'it's for something greater ruth'\" 222 and \"'a chance to make it up to all of those in the war'\" 271 and then there's the beauty that irvine describes \"he was enjoying this - the sweep of the mountains around them the brilliance of the sky the total silence there was only the sound of his breath the swish of his boots through the new snow the crunch of ice below he thought he understood why george loved mountains everything seemed impossibly perfect \" 166 in the end i still didn't understand why the great desire but the author's speculations gave food for thought the role of everest in the relationship between george and ruth is fascinating from the opening page it is obvious that ruth sees herself as competing with the mountain for her husband's affections as she asks \"'tell me about this mountain that's stealing you away from me'\" 1 clearly ruth's views of love change because of her husband's obsession she observes \"when i was small i imagined love as something safe something without sharp edges only the sweeping enveloping curves of romance and happiness but it isn't there are edges and they cut\" 177 she even tells george \"'it feels as though we've spent more time apart than together that's not a marriage'\" 222 george realizes that his efforts to reach the summit of everest have had an impact on his relationship and he thinks that succeeding at his goal will make things right between him and ruth \"if he came home empty handed all the sacrifice would have been for nothing ruth had lived for the past five years on the promise that he would reach the summit and then everything would change for them disappointing her would break his heart and everest would still be there between them the great mass of it and the years it had consumed for nothing only claiming the summit could make things right between them\" 222 - 223 was this his ultimate motivation yet i found it impossible to imagine that if he had returned he would have kept his promise never \"'to go away again'\" 222 it is george's character of course that is most interesting he is not an ordinary man the book jacket describes him as \"a man of uncommon athleticism passion and ambition\" and that is an apt description he argues that \"'moderation has never led to greatness no give me a wild temperament'\" 153 although others tell him \"'you're always so damned rash'\" 317 was he selfish and self centered and a glory hound \"'as long as everything works out in your favour it doesn't much matter what happens to anyone else as long as we're still there to play the audience to your adventures'\" 313 there is certainly something both admirable and repulsive about someone so single mindedly determined to achieve a goal the book gives one pause to ponder the idea of sacrifice in the pursuit of a goal mallory argues that it is \"important to risk something if you believed in the end goal\" 30 and sandy's father tells his son \"'there's a cost to pay for something worth doing anything worth doing sacrifice is the watchword'\" 64 - 65 sandy is however also given further advice by another expedition member \"'but you have to decide for yourself what price is too high'\" 232 at the end of the novel i wondered whether the price paid by mallory and irvine was too high what about the price paid by ruth and her three children mallory thinks that coming home after a failed attempt would mean that \"all the sacrifice would have been for nothing\" 222 yet he never contemplates what not coming home would mean and then there's the question of whether he reached the summit i highly recommend this book it is an indication of the writer's skill that she kept me entranced throughout even about a subject in which i had minimal interest and even though i knew the outcome from the very beginning please check out my reader's blog http schatjesshelves blogspot ca and follow me on twitter @dcyakabuski","49":"while this was a work of fiction i felt like i was there on the mountain and it makes me want to read more about mt everest","50":"#26 a book based on a true story mallory on everest and bookclub book for january","51":" there are two reasons i did not give this book 4 stars one has to do with me and the other has to do with the writing so you can decide for yourself how that impacts how you feel about this review and what it means for your impression of the book i have been fascinated with everest for many years which is one of the reasons this book appealed to me i have read lots of non fiction books about everest expeditions including many of the books mentioned in the author's note and i am already familiar with lots of everest lore the mountain as goddess the taboos the trekking the setting up of camps the names of landmarks i am also familiar with lots of mallory's story specifically therefore much of what is in the first half of the book is familiar to me from prior reading and i found myself skimming if this isn't true for you you won't have this reaction and you'll enjoy this element of the book more than i did from the point the men arrive at camp iv and begin their summit attempts the book begins to race i was turning pages rapidly wondering how the author would handle the big questions at the end but what this means is that prior to that the previous 2 3 of the book was moving rather slowly i wasn't grabbed until they got high on the mountain meanwhile back at home george's wife ruth gets her own chapters intercut with george's and she's waiting for news that's pretty much what she does she waits she comes across as such a passive almost whiny person that one wonders why the charismatic engaging mallory is so much in love with her after the first chapter or so of hers i found myself rushing to get back to the men of the expedition but for ruth too once the end of the book hit and the summit was being attempted her chapters attained greater passion and urgency for me sandy irvine might be the star of the show overall the writing was good and the book was interesting if you don't know much about mallory or everest i think you would like it better than i did but i still can't do anything about ruth","52":"pretty good definitely an interesting subject not as good as the paris wife but much better than the aviator's wife","53":"i really tried to get into this novel but it was difficult for several reasons first the subject matter the ascents to everest especially historic ones like george mallory's ascents are weighty and serious and while i applaud the author's extensive research into mallory and his family it seemed really weighed down by all the important significance meh i suppose if i found climbing everest to be thrilling i would get more into the details of whether or not to use oxygen or how or how he did not die i felt that as a fiction writer who knows a lot of the facts ms rideout could have left us with more of a mystery as to how he dies but she did not perhaps this was to give a peaceful end and finality to the wife he left at home in any case it made for just okay reading","54":"i really enjoyed this book and would recommend it to everyone it's about george mallory's third attemp in 1924 to climb mount everest and also a day in the life of his wife ruth it describes the hardships both go through ruth in being separated from her husband and george on being exposed to the elements on everest truly a great read","55":"story of mountain climber and his zeal for the montain told from his wofe's point of view enjoyable","56":"i met the author of this book at en event last year and was thrilled to see it out in stores and with such a beautiful cover treatment i loved the dual narrative of the book which alternated between an ill fated climbing expedition by george mallory and his team and a day in the life of his wife ruth who is waiting for his return with their three children i was worried i wouldn't enjoy the george sections because mountain climbing and traditional adventure stories do not interest me in any way however the trip is just as much about the conflict and group dynamics among the men who are climbing together as it is about the incredibly harsh and unwelcoming mount everest the psychological drama is fascinating particularly as they get closer tot he summit and exhaustion starvation and the high altitudes start to play games with the men's sanity i adored ruth and her quiet struggle and rideout's portrayal of the children and how they each miss their father and act out at their mother felt heart breakingly accurate more than an adventure story or piece of historical fiction this felt like a love story in the grandest tradition romantic sensual imperfect and ultimately thwarted already rideout feels like a seasoned and accomplished writer an artist so at ease with language that this could have been her fifth or tenth novel look out for this during award season","57":"my favorite part of the book was the afterword in which the author shared the true story behind the book it was fascinating and i would love to hear more about george and ruth mallory as she did in her research i gave the book three stars for the slow chapters related to the climb that just weren't captivating enough and didn't flow like ruth's pages did i would recommend the story despite that though for the peek at a rarely discussed topic","58":"i had mixed feelings about this book i was able to appreciate the make and female perspectives but felt anxious at the idiocy and lunacy of george i feel their love but also george's extreme betrayal in every aspect of his life i liked the climbing aspect of the book and the basic experiences on the mountain","59":"the book started off good but dragged through the middle","60":" wow this book was fabulous and by a first time toronto author it is a story of deep love heart pounding adventure and intense obsession george mallory is on his third attempt to counquer everest for his king his countrymen who lost so much in the great war his own fame and glory and of course because it's there his wife ruth is at home with their three children wondering why he is jeopardizing his life why she and the children are not enough and what will happen if he does not return the story is based on historical fact mixed with fiction but for someone who has never read anything else about the everest treks it reads like non fiction just think about the sparsity of equipment in the early 1920's and you shake your head as to why these men were so obsessed with this trek they were in tweeds and kneesocks for heavens sake one of the top 5 books i've read this year","61":"a great mix of history and romantic love story beautifully written","62":"very good book but knowing the ending before even starting the book made it seem like there was nothing that could save the day to be a happy ending","63":"very interesting book about climbing mount everest i did not read the cover so the ending was a surprise to me i liked reading about his passion for conquering the mountain and his wife's struggle at home w the children","64":" tanis rideout has crafted a wonderful historical novel telling the story of george mallory's final attempt to summit everest while also illuminating the relationship between mallory and his wife ruth i love a good historical fiction and this is definitely well done rideout focuses on a number of things that i would never have contemplated before i really enjoyed the struggle ruth goes through as the wife of mallory what does it mean that her husband keeps choosing a mountain over his family and the historical research comes through i couldn't even imagine that the men in this attempt were trying to do so without oxygen nowadays that just sounds insane i think all the characters are well constructed and the book flows nicely switching back and forth from chapters about ruth and chapters about mallory and his team every time i picked this book up i couldn't stop myself from reading just a little bit more than i had planned i was definitely caught up in this story and this book is sure to appeal to a wide audience thanks to the publisher for an advance readers copy provided via the first flights program","65":" above all things by tanis rideout is an absolutely outstanding first novel it is stunning tale of mountain climbing in the 1920s tanis rideout tells the story of george and ruth mallory george is one of the extraordinarily courageous explorer mountain climbing adventurers who attempted everest relentlessly during the 1920s ruth is george's wife and mother of their children who waits for george's return with only occasional letters to keep her apprised of george's progress rideout has produced a very exciting historical novel her deeply researched details of climbing available apparel and equipment along with george and ruth's private letters helps the readers experience and understand the amazing courage and generosity that would allow men to try again and again to accomplish what had never been done","66":"highly recommend if you are fascinated with history","67":"this was a perfectly meh read the premise sounded interesting but the execution lacked something the flashbacks weren't well delineated from the present action well enough characters weren't introduced properly and frankly while i can totally empathize with ruth's agony in waiting and not knowing her half of the story was wretchedly boring to me meh","68":"this was a great novel i really felt connected to both the men on the mountain and the woman one left behind she perfectly conveyed to me the adventure and heartbreak of the early everest expeditions anyone who enjoyed into thin air should pick this up too","69":" explorers were a big deal in our home when i was growing up canadian school children prepared endless maps showing the paths followed by explorers seeking the northwest passage and the various fur trade routes at home my mom told us stories of heyerdahl and the kon tiki and the sad tale of robert scott who was second to the south pole and of course the stories of sir edmund hillary and his conquest of everest i'm pretty sure that i knew the story of previous attempts at everest as well including the loss of george mallory so i perked up my ears when i heard the interview with tanis rideout about her fictional account of mallory's last of 3 attempts at getting to the summit of everest and was particularly intrigued that she included mallory's wife ruth's perspective as well the book is largely faithful to what is know about the historical characters and where changes are made for a better story the author makes these departures clear in her afterword the telling is interspersed between a 3rd person account of the expedition with flashbacks to provide context and fill in gaps and ruth's first person account of a couple of days during which she was planning and hosting a small get together of friends which was coincidentally being held as it was later discovered on the day of mallory's death a great summer read especially as it is hot and steamy the cover of the version that i read has the figure of a woman arising from the mountain this idea of everest as being george's mistress and coming between ruth and mallory is woven throughout the book as well mallory has to go back after 2 unsuccessful attempts he has to persist and in his death the imagery of everest not being willing to let him go is in the narrative as well","70":"an ok read but did not pull me in enough to finish","71":"amazing story considering that it took place in the 1920's","72":"have the kleenex ready","73":" not sure why i didn't love this book like others did it was different tho and i appreciated the originality and at times i found the story very compelling but honestly i did not think the writer captured why george was so compelled to reach the summit it was like his experiences during the climb both previous attempts and the final attempt were so awful i did feel any exhileration i couldn't relate to his passion it seemed lacking to me and i found i didn't like the wife much she was too vague and wishy washy for me jmho","74":" while this was not as bad as don't go it was not great interesting topic but the actual writing never grabbed me i usually enjoy historical fiction but not this one i loved both the paris wife and into thin air so figured this would be up with them perhaps i set myself up for disappointment by thinking that writing wasn't bad and juxtoposition of george and ruth's story was interesting but i felt first half of book was rather slow it did pique my interest in learning more about the first attempts at everest and i'm sure i will find something that i will enjoy more than i enjoyed this","75":"in 1924 george mallory set out on an expedition with seven other men for a third british attempt at reaching the peak of mount everest really it was an easy decision for him much to his wife ruth's dismay like many climbers but perhaps more than most george is driven to climb everest the tallest mountain in the world his two previous defeats only make him more determined though at thirty seven he knows this is his last chance if he fails this time he won't get another shot george hikes up through tibet they weren't allowed through nepal to base camp with expedition leader colonel teddy norton dr howard somervell naturalist noel odell photographer john noel two british soldiers shebbeare and hazard to help with managing the sherpas and supplies and twenty one year old sandy irvine who is good at fixing things and hopes that norton will let him be part of the last push up the mountain despite his inexperience meanwhile back at their home in cambridge ruth goes through the motions of a single day taking care of their three young children preparing a dinner party she doesn't want to have and struggling with her feelings of loneliness dejection depression even ruth misses george and sadly she knows she can't compete with the mountain all she's left with is the endless waiting not once but several times waiting for george to return waiting to hear word that he's been successful or something else entirely as the two move through their very different lives the past blurs with the present and memories are relived and shadowing the story and george himself is the true story of his disappearance during his last attempt to climb mt everest a mystery that wasn't solved until his body was found in 1999 i have to say right from the start here that this is a phenomenal book it's one of the most atmospheric compelling emotionally wraught historical fiction novels i've read in quite some time and for a debut novel it's very impressive the level of research involved is one thing but where rideout really excelled is in her ability to bring these historical figures to life giving them room to breathe on the page to fill out their period costumes to convince us modern readers of every facet of their lives without any self conscious second guessing or fear of not doing right by her characters is i think the expression we first meet george and ruth in 1920 when they are both filled with excitement by the news of his first impeding trip to everest and it is a superb place to start because it gives us an intimate first hand glimpse at the couple when everything must have seemed so bright and promising to them contrast that with the shell shocked ruth who moves through the day on autopilot trying to hold it together but completely worn out by the endless waiting aware that her sister and servants don't consider her stoic enough their three children clare berry and john who barely remembers his father because of all the absences are likewise very real characters young beings with growing personalities hot breath on their mother's neck and youthful demands among them a strong need for the father the expedition itself is rendered in clear artful detail from the list of supplies 44 tins of quail in foi gras 120 tins of bully beef dozens of wrapped squares of flaky chocolate 9 tins of tobacco 7 tubes apiece of petroleum jelly to be smeared on chapped faces to deflect the sun 63 working oxygen canisters 26 tents of varying sizes a crate of cutlery and tin plates one case of montebello champagne 17 bottles of macallan whisky not less than 15 years old miles and miles of rope campbeds tents tools and cooking pots p 34 to the clothes they wore their bleeding lips and most fascinating and scary of all the effect of altitude sickness in all its diverse forms and not just the altitude but hypothermia dehydration and shock as well i felt like i was right there on the mountain with these men which was truth be told a very uncomfortable and frightening place to be to think of these climbers tackling everest in woollen socks and tweed coats it's amazing what they achieved considering how ill equipped they were the descriptions of their hallucinations or how they would zone out and hours later realise they'd just been sitting there staring were chilling and all too believable the atmosphere the setting was so vivid the effects on the men so tangible it only emphasises and justifies ruth's anxiety her fear the col had shocked him when george took him to see it the day after he arrived at advanced base camp he'd stood at the bottom of the long saddle that connects everest to her neighbour changste and looked up thirteen hundred mostly vertical feet all ice and snow above the col nothing was protected above it the wind screamed down in a terrible way that he couldn't quite grasp that was where they got turned back in '21 where the avalanche had occurred in '22 george pointed on the lower section we'll cut steps and haul ourselves up them but the last twenty feet george drew his attention to the chimney that they would follow the route he would try to take might as well be rock p 134 the air outside felt as though it might snap sharp and fragile edged like crystal when he inhaled it cut into his nostrils his lungs the moonlight was cold on the mountain iced blue sandy slogged through the snow after somervell the snow filtering into his mislaced boots melting against his skin and cooling fast his feet would freeze in his boots the cold in his brain hurt he pressed forward p 204 sandy's hands stroked the air near his face it was agony it felt as if the mountain had stripped the flesh from his cheeks there couldn't be any skin left george reached across to him in the twilight pushed sandy's hands away from his face and smeared petroleum jelly carefully gently on his skin p 279 as well as ruth and george's narrative ruth in first person present tense over the course of a single day george in third person past tense we also get the perspective of george's expedition partner sandy irvine young hopeful strong with a bit of climbing experience behind him but not enough for teddy norton to consider letting him try for the summit he gives us a third perspective on george not just to flesh out ruth's idea of george but to flesh out the story of the attempt to climb everest you can't help but warm to sandy and coming to care for him too part of the expedition is spent debating the use of oxygen in summiting they've never used it before and some of them consider it cheating if they use it now with god's help and not the oxygen's we'll make it somervell's tone was affirming emphatic somes the only thing that's going to tame this thing this he wanted to say bitch he wanted to curse the mountain but held his tongue the only thing that matters is us exactly george us we're the instrument designed for climbing you pretend to be a skeptic but you have faith you believe you're destined for it for the top don't pretend you don't that's faith george that's a plan somervell turned to sandy and you do you share his skepticism his humanism george watched sandy as he glanced from him to somes and back again i don't know sandy's tone was slow and measured or maybe it was the altitude george leaned towards him and sandy's voice picked up all that religion seems an excuse i'll keep god to myself i think i want to climb everest for the achievement of it not because it's for or against someone's idea of god pp 152 3 the climbers' motivations for tackling everest time and again are touched upon throughout the story especially george who is compelled to leave his wife and young family to conquer the mountain from the exhilaration he feels climbing you know that feeling when you're pushing yourself and pushing yourself and then you leap for that hold you think is just out of reach you know you're going to fall then you don't and for just that moment the world sharpens comes into focus p 155 to what the people back home expect from them especially after the first world war to george's personal ambition how he feels he doesn't even have a choice but to try and try again rideout tacks back and forth in time revisiting the time george and ruth first met to other scenes in their past each time making george and ruth feel ever more inevitable more tangible until that ending that mesmerising ending at which point george feels so alive and then suddenly isn't the only problem i had with this novel my only struggle was that the prose was a bit erratic it didn't always read smoothly the sentences didn't always link up neatly together so that you could start reading and never find a place to stop on the contrary i found it surprisingly slow to read easy to forget whose memories i was reliving surprising that such a well written novel could still suffer from jagged pacing but if the story was an unexpected slog to read and i use the word slog for the sake of metaphor not for its negative connotations it matched the character's slog through life ruth or up a mountain george and sandy and when you get to the final push to the summit the step by step slow detail of it all not only builds tension but makes you feel each and every painful step they make the struggle to breathe to put one foot in front of the other maybe it was a tad too slow and a bit too long but the effect can't be denied between ruth's raw emotions and sympathetic story george's obsession with summiting and sandy's youthful yearning it's a novel of depth and insight add to that the impressive and incredibly real atmosphere the sensation that you're there on the mountain with them and it's a story that claws its cold grip into you i also learnt a lot from it like the fact that this mountain is named after a man who never even saw it a british surveyor based in india i learnt about their attitudes towards the sherpas like children who needed to be constantly watched and told what to do and i learnt what it was like to try and climb everest in the 1920s even with all our advanced fibres and clever tents high protein bars and other gadgets nothing appeals to me less than the idea of trying to climb everest experiencing it vicariously through this novel was enough for me not to mention how emotionally wrung out i felt for it is a heartbreaking story all told this isn't a negative i love a book that makes me feel that way it's the mark of great writing and on a final note i have to add that this particular edition mcclelland u0026amp stewart hardback first edition is just stunning from the typeface on the cover to the font on the pages perpetua perfect for the time period depicted from the tinted photographs to the texture of the jacket hard to describe but wondrous to feel honestly i don't think i've seen a more perfectly put together book in a long time probably the only thing i'd add is a map because i love map and as a visual conceptual person it helps me visualise in relation to other things but it's not really necessary and definitely read the author's note at the end about how she started on this long journey of research and writing her personal motivations and some other details behind this finely crafted story highly highly recommended","76":" how can a book about climbing the mother of all mountains remain so flat it is difficult to pin down why this book didn't work the prose are actually well formed and the adventurous plot historical is practically fool proof i mean really mallory's disastrous final attempt to climb everest is a fascinating story by most accounts except this one i think by interjecting the second day in the life narrative of mallory's wife ruth into the adventure story throws the momentum off she is simply not an interesting character and there is nothing overly dramatic about sitting and waiting maybe the author thought that dramatic irony would be enough to pull along ruth's part if the story maybe ruth's naive and unfaltering love for george is meant to be endearing i don't know she just seemed like a poor me oh i can't live without my husband damsel not in distress the choice to then further fracture the first two narratives with a third narrative from the point of view of sandy the youngest member on mallory's expedition team is even more strange truly sandy's story has little bearing on the plot he is just filler any connection between the first two narratives is severed whenever the pov turns to sandy very distracting a very slow novel it never reaches a peak it doesn't add much depth or detail to history which to me is the whole point of historical fiction and the characters are boring and unlikable 2 5 5","77":"enjoyed this read fictional story about mallorys expedition up to everest and his wife left back at home in england both sides were both well developed i learned a bit of history while reading this book too","78":"it was well written but i hated every second of it i never would have chosen to read this if my book club hadn't selected it i was cold and angry through the entire thing","79":"excellent historical fiction about the marriage of one of the first climbers of everest","80":"above all things is a beautifully written piece of historical fiction that examines the lives of obsessive mountaineer george mallory and his wife ruth who is left behind in england with their children while george pursues his obsession with conquering everest the book interweaves the adventure of george and his team as they try to be the first to reach the summit with the angst ridden life of his wife as she tries to maintain a normal family life in george's absence whilst awaiting word that he is alive and well the story of the climb is full of suspense and delves deep into the minds of the mountaineers and is so superbly detailed that you almost feel the cold ruth's story depicts the pains of a woman who hates always being left behind but at the same time has nothing but support for george and his dreams the book documents their love for each other through the actual letters that they exchanged making it a fascinating insight into their lives whether you are aware of the outcome of the attempt or not i wasn't you'll be hooked and routing for them all","81":"i wanted to like this so much but it was so slow i didn't finish perhaps another time","82":"for the first part of this book i would've given it five stars but then the alternating veiepoint of mallory's wife began to drag the story down and down and down by the end i kind of wanted to rip out all her pages the mountain part was terribly interesting though and the writing is amazing visual and really makes you understand the cold and pain if not why they did it","83":"love factual mountaineering books so hesitant to read a fictional account of mallory's climb and life but when all was said and done i really enjoyed it well written and flows easily","84":"this was one of the best books i have read in a long while really enjoyed this one","85":"because it's there just wasn't enough of a reason for these explorers to try to conquer mt everest in the 20's it was just too early and the equipment and technology could not overcome the wind cold and lack of oxygen and lack of visibility at that time all the things that happen to the human body at that altitude were horrendous i also did not get the intensity of the love story instead i saw a woman who just sat at home waiting for her adventurer husband to return do something useful while you wait and a man driven by fame and ambition to get to the top at all costs the writing got very melodramatic in the second half trying to imagine what the actual last part of the climb was like","86":"this review has been hidden because it contains spoilers to view it click here i struggled through this book i liked the subtle romance that wasn't present tense i liked the style of the writing i was impressed how thoroughly the author researched the topic before she wrote a historic novel on it it's a silly reason for giving this book only two stars but i can't stand reading about being cold being cold in the winter is enough but i can't read about it i knew nothing about the historical background before reading the book and the copy of the book i had printed th i struggled through this book i liked the subtle romance that wasn't present tense i liked the style of the writing i was impressed how thoroughly the author researched the topic before she wrote a historic novel on it it's a silly reason for giving this book only two stars but i can't stand reading about being cold being cold in the winter is enough but i can't read about it i knew nothing about the historical background before reading the book and the copy of the book i had printed the reviews on the front and back covers i hated that knowing nothing about the expeditions to mount everest knowing nothing about george mallory or any other british gentlemen explorers of the time it absolutely ruined the book to read the review best tragic adventure story written this century written right under the title and people's review on the back about the doomed george mallory it also surprised me that people read the book because i didn't think they read or would review anything of substance but i digress i didn't think there was any point to read the rest of the story knowing the ending but i finished it anyways thus why i struggled through the book more","87":"great read i loved that the author told the story from 3 different perspectives george mallory's the experienced climber who so wants to conquer everest sandy's the inexperienced climber who doesn't really grasp the dangerous nature of the climb and ruth mallory the wife at home who wants her husband to come home safely and stay for her sake and their 3 children the author does a great job of helping you experience the harrowing and often life threatening nature of everest at times it's difficult to understand the obsession with the mountain but it's what drives the story","88":"at first i was going to give this only a 3 the writing and especially the personal stories seemed disjointed and hard to follow it did improve some as i kept reading","89":"wow what a great book can't remember the last time i read a book with such a powerful ending plus i don't normally read the author notes at the end of a book but i was captivated by her story and how she came to write this book about the mallory's she put her heart and soul into it and i look forward to her next novel","90":"i found this book to be slow not very exciting i gave up about halfway because i didn't really seem to care about the characters","91":"i think it's a sign of good historical fiction that i couldn't put this down even though i knew what was going to happen","92":" not knowing anything about george mallory was actually a positive factor for me while reading this piece of historical fiction the story is based on the news stories of mallory's third attempt at climbing mt everest in 1927 along with the letters written between mallory and his wife ruth at that time it's a beautiful love story mixed in beautifully with the action and adventure of mountain climbing in the days before technology made things different i strongly recommend this book it makes you wonder what drives the adventurer and how the people who love them deal with the fear and jealousy","93":"book club selection quite boring read only half the book the book club watched the everest movie after the discussion","94":"loved it has driven me to look into biographies of george mallory","95":"i read a review of this book and decided to check it out even though it is out of my usual interest area thank goodness i did it's an exciting and compelling story about the men trying to reach the peak of mount everest and the suffering women they left behind the story simultaneously follows a mountain climber and his companions on their month long trek up the snowy peak and the wife and kids back at home tragic and fascinating i definitely recommend this one","96":" this was a good read for people like me who can't seem to get enough of everest after reading into thin air it's a fairly well written fictionalization of the final fate of george mallory told from his perspective and his wife ruth's i like the way rideout captures ruth who must have had a tough time of it being married to a man with a fatal obsession with an at the time unclimbable mountain at times the story was so gripping that i found myself hoping it would have a different ending though i knew it wouldn't","97":"this is a powerful book indeed harrowing is the word yet it is also tender thought provoking it raises philosophical questions about risk and great sacrifice about what is worth cost time pain suffering even death especially death many are the reasons given including those used to justify cost and the potential loss of lives when george mallory is asked why he would leave his wife and three children for extended periods of time and the possibility that he may never return all so he can climb a mountain well mt everest he says because it's there this story is exquisitely well written and echoes long after one puts it down","98":"read for pals book club this is a historical novel which was well written and informative i like the way the author wove one day in the wife's life with a lifetime of her husband not knowing anything about climbing a mountain like everest this is very informative","99":" tanis rideout transforms the real life story of mountaineer george mallory into a sweeping fictional account of his final expedition to mt everest in 1924 this storyline alternates with chapters told from the perspective of his wife ruth who is anxiously awaiting his return in london i liked the concept of this book as it gives you several perspectives to complete the picture of the characters and the historic events the chapters chronicling the expedition to mt everest work very well that way i could easily envision the challenges and hardships the men encounter as well as get a better understanding of what drives them to such extremes in fact i was often thinking of a movie i saw recently \"northface\" shows a similarly ill fated expedition to conquer the most difficult approach to the eiger northface in the alps in 1936 both rideout's book and this movie not only describe their characters well but also set the mountaineering experience within the social and political context of their time flashbacks to earlier experiences complete the picture the accounts of the hardships on the mountain the weather with its icy winds and the endurance and skill required by the explorers are told in a very gripping way yes we know about the final outcome but still turn each page full of suspense i also appreciated the political connections described in this book a mountaineering expedition such as this one is not just about a group of men who climb mountains it is an image of their time a result of the broader historical situation as much as their own personal interests i found the chapters written from ruth's perspective less successful the idea of this additional point of view is great the account of a single day in her rather cushy life is set in stark contrast to the very different life of the mountaineers it does make the mountain experience seem even more surreal which is great but it just was too much for me it slows down my reading experience considerably the descriptions were too lengthy at times and often repetitive especially as the chapters set in the himalayan mountains also included slower paced flashbacks to quieter times with mallory's friends and family the pacing doesn't work out for me in conclusion this was a very unique reading experience it perked my interest into a different time and got me to google a lot about the real events of the exploration of mt everest and the people involved in it the concept of describing the events from different perspectives is a good one though in parts not well executed tighter editing might have helped to create a better pace for the reader","100":"like others i knew what the ending would entail but i couldn't gobble up the details fast enough best book i've read in a very long time and i'm very sorry it's over","101":"his book above is about george mallo tsome time ego i've seen a documentary about a british businessman who had enough money to hire a personal guide to mount everest he died not far from the summit after he had reached it his guide was not resolute enough to call the attempt hopeless and force his client to return while there was still time the guide survived but lost parts of his limbs to frostbite if we could ask the businessman would he say that reaching the summit was worth his life tthis book above is about george mallory's attempt to be the first at the same summit he died on the mountain most likely before reaching the summit on a relatively good weather day that would give him an opportunity to call the attempt hopeless in time he didn't quit and led himself and his climbing partner to the certain death how much will and ego are needed to do such a thing is achieving fame worth the risk of death do you need to reach the summit any summit to prove something isn't the joy of travelling there enough are such extreme endeavors worth endangering other people","102":"long obsessed with all things everest this book certainly scratched an itch tender glance into the private life of a famous man and how his desire to achieve climbing fame destroyed his relationship","103":"i enjoyed this glimpse back to the history of how everest was first climbed and the mystery surrounding george mallory's death","104":" i think this is an absolutely amazing book and i thoroughly enjoyed reading it the way rideout juxtaposes the two narratives has an astonishingly powerful effect on each the novel is set in 1924 and is based on excellent research that must have taken years to compile and then translate into good fiction one narrative first person present tense is ruth's george mallory's wife at home in england tending to domestic life in all its facets yearning for her husband's return upset at his long absences bring the reader up close and into her life and heart the other narrative involves the men primarily george mallory and sandy irvine preparing to attempt and then attempting the ascent of everest the worlds couldn't be more different warm versus cold domestic and highly civilized versus utterly wild nature men versus women hard versus soft well the list of contrasts goes on and each section enhances intensifies the other through the heightened contrast i had never been particularly interested in everest or in mountaineering but this utterly incredible experience george mallory sandy irvine and the other men have rendered by rideout with deft touch and great skill engaged me utterly","105":"tanis rideout did an outstanding job for her debut novel i was not familiar with the story of george mallory so part of the way into the book i was clueless as to the ending i did some research and was not disappointed even though i now knew the ending the book is about a man torn between his obsession with reaching the summit of mt everest and for his dedication to his wife that he truly loves tandis's vivid and very real descriptions put the reader right there on the mountain experiencing the pain and difficulty with the climbers i really do not know how they survived with the lack of modern equipment like we have today i was surprised to read on reviewer who did not find the descriptions realistic at one point i was trying to breathe for them she also did a wonderful job incorporating the struggle ruth had with her feeling while george was gone as far as publishing goes i much prefer the cover with the climbers and the woman's torso on the cover over the couple on the beach i wouldn't look at that one on a shelf also i was impressed with the feel of the cover and the deckled edges on the pages for my uncorrected proof copy i hope this is how it comes out in the stores over all i loved this book and story","106":"from the first page until the last page i could not put this book down it is fascinating on so many levels and not just regarding the fact of george mallory's legendary status as an explorer above all things is an intriguing read a fascinating look at not only the man but his wife ruth and his family the familial dynamics is portrayed with sensitivity yet with stark reality the prose is extremely descriptive affording the reader a look not only into the historical value of the novel but also the interactions displayed within the family unit and the other individuals who chose to seek the glory of reaching the summit of mt everest along with mallory there are several questions that came to mind while reading this magnificently written novel how does one leave a wife and children behind while they go on to seek fame and accomplishment how does a wife cope with her husband's decision to do so waiting for word of his safety waiting for correspondence for any sign of his trek up the mountain does love mean that one gives up the comforts of having a husband nearby in order for him to fulfill his dreams and what of the children whose father is absent does the father's goal to summit mt everest mean that his goal becomes their goal many thoughts arose while i read this incredible story rideout accomplishes so much within the pages with her magnificent prose and her understanding of human nature and the desire to accomplish what others have not we are taken on the journey not only with george mallory but his wife and children each foothold is told with breathtaking word imagery leaving this reader almost breathless reading the story the descriptions of the mental and physical suffering endured by george mallory is brilliant as well as how rideout portrayed ruth mallory and her emotional and mental suffering left behind constantly wondering about the outcome and left behind to tend to young children trying to act as if nothing unusual is occurring once you begin this masterfully written novel you will find it difficult to put down tanis rideout is brilliant in every aspect of writing creating intrigue fascination excitement inner strength of the characters and in affording the reader an intense look into george and ruth mallory's relationship and the obsessiveness to fulfill one's life long goal it is a novel filled with dreams and the courage to succeed and filled with love and loss it is a story of poignancy and heartbreak perseverance and inspiration i highly recommend above all things by tanis rideout to everyone","107":"when i saw the description for this book my curiosity was immediately piqued having recently read the paris wife i couldn't help but be intrigued by another re imagining of another famous adventurer and larger than life personality george mallory rideout's debut novel detailing hillary's third attempt at mount everest was an engaging and satisfying read once i became involved in the story i didn't want to put it down rideout crafts a novel of contrasts transporting the reader between the adventures of george on the mountain and a day in the life of his wife ruth who anxiously waits for his return interposed between these two very different scenes are memories emotions regrets and disappointments a wellspring of human emotion that makes the characters so very believeable one of my favorite aspects of rideout's style is her ability to create the inner thoughts of the characters in less stream of consciousness style but more organized wanderings her prose seamlessly weaving the characters' thoughts in the moment with the memories of the past and recreating even more vividly the confusion and mental struggle of the men as they climb into the higher altitudes as the novel reached its climax i felt as though i could almost feel the cold mountain air and muddle through oxygen starved thoughts this is an author whose subsequent work i will eagerly await","108":"this novel is about george mallory's final attempt to reach the summit of mt everest in 1924 the author creates the extremely difficult conditions on everest so vividly that i was frequently cold while at the same time sharing the pain and fear of mallory's wife ruth who was patiently waiting at home if you have a chance google george mallory and check out the videos of when modern climbers find his body partially solving the mystery if his death","109":"a well written debut novel and an interesting way to be introduced not only to george mallory but mountain climbing as well it was a tad slow at times but i still enjoyed it","110":"compelling and flowing","111":"effortlessly exciting and heartfelt a lovely taste of the 1920s even without the jazz and sex this book strikes up similar themes to the paris wife which i also loved you'll fall in love with george and ruth and the balance they struggle to find when he makes his quest to the top of everest","112":" marvellous a sensitive and moving novelization of the events of britain's third everest attempt in the 1920s the book's slow pacing and somewhat disjointed narration makes the reader feel as if she is accompanying mallory up the mountain this book was a slow read that felt a lot like undertaking a great challenge very deft characterisation particularly with ruth who is often depicted as the losing party in a love triangle where her competition is mount everest itself this book is a prime example of why historical fiction is my favourite genre when done well it makes you want to devour the book despite the fact that you already know how the story ends it also makes you want to read more into the historical events that were the inspiration for the novel note that reading this book in january was not the best idea i think it made me feel colder","113":"read it and weep","114":"really great and fascinating book i really like how the author took you back and forth between the rigors of mountain climbing and the difficulty of carrying on alone while awaiting news of your husband this book was also a love story but not in the traditional sense definitely worth reading","115":"4 5 graceful harrowing mesmerizing rideout's subtle craftsmanship is well suited to this almost mythic tale","116":"enjoyed this historical fiction of george mallory and his wife before during and after his attempt to climb everest having read and loved into thin air it was interesting to read about the man who started it all","117":"i hard time deciding 4 or five stars fabulous work of historical fiction the story of george mallory an early everest pioneer and his wife ruth and how they deal with being separated on his attempts to climb everest page turner","118":"considering the fact that we know the end of the story this was quite a compelling read i always have a bit of a problem with fictional accounts of real life events because of the deductions made based more on intuition than knowledge and this book was no exception yet i was engrossed george mallory is a fascinating subject and no more so than in this book whether the treatment of mr mallory and his wife is fair i cannot say but it certainly made good reading","119":"interesting story flashbacks flash forwards were a bit tricky to follow","120":"because it's there george mallory","121":"those of you who know me know i read all things mt everest and i have to admit that hillary turns out to be a real egotistical toad not one of my faves","122":"too sloooooooooooooooooooooooooow for me also i can only hope ruth's reservations and attempts to stifle her husbands dream were rooted in a premonition of sorts otherwise i think her mostly selfish and unrealistic","123":"i have no idea what prompted me to read this book i have never had an interesting in climbing nor in the history of mount everest i don't even like to climb to the top of a step ladder but by the time i had finished the first chapter i didn't want to put above all things down some how author tanis rideout has brought to life a story that is almost ninety years old i wanted to race through this book so i could find out what happened and at the same time i had to keep myself for searching about george mallory on the internet that would have been cheating this is the story of the third attempt by the british in 1924 to scale mount everest george mallory was part of the team for each of those attempts each time he left at home his wife ruth and their three children i was captivated by this fictionalized re telling as i was reading i watched the snow outside my window and shivered knowing that mallory and his team had endured much worse i imagined them in their cotton and leather clothing and realized how inadequate their supplies must have been poor nutrition and dehydration must have plagued them through the entire adventure several thoughts stuck with me through out the book first the nature of a man what lengths a man would go to in achieving a goal what price was george willing to pay to be able to stand at the summit of everest second the role of the wife who was expected to stay at home and support what ever it was that the husband chose to do with his life was ruth given any say in what george did a third thing that bothered me was that at that time it was thought to be unsporting if the climbers used oxygen bottles who would think it unsporting was it the climbers themselves or was it those armchair adventurers sitting safely in their clubs in london whose most dangerous endeavour was crossing the street i loved this book i found myself staying up late at night to finish just one more chapter and then another i will even admit that i was moved to tears during the final chapters","124":" this was an interesting book about the attempt to conquer everest in 1924 the narrator switches from george mallory a historical figure and his wife it was a compelling novel between his desire to be the first to reach the summit and her longing for him to return home the book is based on historical figures but is a work of fiction with the author speculating events it was intriguing to hear the details of the climb i am not familiar with climbing practices especially the way they went about it in the '20s it was in this attempt that a fellow climber tries to encourage the team to use oxygen tanks which had not been used up to this point the details of the effects of oxygen deprivation are interesting a good read","125":"well written but lacked a certain depth character's were interesting but grew tired of droning emotion perhaps i'm just not in the mood to read love stories","126":" originally reviewed at novel escapes i thoroughly enjoyed this novel the prose was lyrical and poignant the characters perfectly troubled and flawed and and the setting portrayal had me shivering and wincing at every detail based on true events above all things had me mesmerized throughout both at how someone would go to the lengths george mallory went to to climb mount everest and the woman left behind to wonder whether he would ever return my heart ached during this novel we know the outcome well in advance but as i read i couldn't help but hold out hope i commiserated alongside ruth while she floated like a ghost through her life wondering whether her husband would ever return and vacillitating between whether she was right have let him go to his mountain or whether she should have attempted to forbid his travels and smother his spirit the portrayal of george and ruth's relationship was marvelous from their tender moments to the scenes where they tear each other apart told via flashbacks which a few times lost me with the bouncing around although i was sick much of the time i read this so it might have been my ill ladened brain that couldn't keep up we are treated to an intense account of their marriage as imagined by the author the letters between the couple are now public record and based on these rideout crafted an incredibly real relationship full of love loss regret torment and tenderness i was constantly confounded by george's desire for extreme behaviour and picked up this novel with trepidation as my fiance used to climb years ago part way through this novel i turned to him and made him promise mt everest would never be an option thankfully he agreed i wouldn't have had the strength ruth had to live through the worry fear and anxiety although i completely understand how she needed to let george go how she desperately didn't want to change him yet wanted him to change at the same time it was heartwrenching above all things which is probably the best title for a book i have ever come across as it is so fitting that i had to sit back a few times in appreciation is so intense that i was actually somewhat glad i was sick while reading it if my mind hadn't been hazy i think i might have had to put it down at times wrap yourself up in a blanket and read pick this one up today you won't be disappointed thank you to mcclelland stewart for our review copy","127":"incredible story i love the title because this book tells the story of a man who loved his wife and family but his passion to climb was stronger than anything else fascinating","128":"this was a wonderful look at the life of the wife of george mallory and her trials being married to such an obsessive person the idea of raising a family in the 20s while her husband was off on expeditions was both interesting and amazing it is a completely different look at the surmouting of everest loved the adventure and the perspective","129":"very well written was still so sad at the end even though we know what happens i love stories that take real events and people and give them life","130":"this review has been hidden because it contains spoilers to view it click here should say 3 5 stars really slow in the first half and then gets substantially more interesting i feel so depressed now dying on everest seems the most lonely and cold fate i definitely don't think it's worth it","131":"so interesting i always fall hard for historical fiction if a novel can get me excited to learn more about a time period of history that's a win though i knew it was fiction it was intriguing to learn the conditions of those everest attempts and interesting to consider the perspective of those waiting back home in the time of cell phones and instant information it's hard to imagine waiting weeks or months for a single letter i know a story has affected me when i do follow up research on the book and events described in the book to learn more more more","132":" above all things is the story of george mallory's last attempt at everest in 1924 the book alternates between mallory and his wife ruth at home waiting for word on the quest there were a few times in the beginning of this book that i almost put it down due to the slowness of the story i'm so glad i didn't tanis rideout's descriptions of george mallory's time on everest are so vivid you can almost feel the bite of the wind on your face at home you can feel ruth's shortness of breath as she trys to quell the building panic felt in every inch of her body it is a devastatingly beautiful story for the last half of the book","133":" i wanted to savour this book because the story the imagery the characters were all so deliciously compelling i purposefully tried not to read it all at once which i tend to want to do with a really good book and in the end i failed miserably at that i couldn't not read it even though i knew how it would end but was a bit like george i guess he couldn't not just try for the top one more time and even though you know how this story ends i still wept when it was done so totally highly recommend to men u0026amp women because there is something in this story for everyone tanis is just possibly the next michael ondaatje i don't know how she'll follow this up but with a new poetry book coming maybe she'll make poetry cool again not that it ever wasn't but you know what i mean synopsis 1920's british adventure team decide they must climb to the summit of mt everest because the us and norweigans have already claimed the other two biggies in the world but they do this sporting burberry coats woolies leather hats a couple of layers of mitts silk puttees to keep the snow out of their boots and dear god leather boots i can remember skiing in leather boots in the 1960's and although they looked cool they freeze people so on top of not being able to breathe think straight to do simple math problems to test their mental acuity on top of sucking on meat lozenges ugh this sounds nasty freezing their proverbial es off they try again and again and again to climb to the top relying on a rope shared between men one falls they all can go throw in an avalanche snow storm winds ripping you like a flag in a hurricane what about this sounds remotely fun or even a good idea i don't like cold tea on a warm day but on a sub zero windy mountain with about 3000 feet straight down to the next tent invigorating nope not me that said i wouldn't want to be ruth either waiting waiting waiting keeping a stiff upper lip mustn't upset anyone with a public display and didn't they name a tv show after all this called keeping up appearances but even though you might know all this the book is still exceptional couldn't put it down the undercurrant here is 'read it'","134":"i enjoyed the climbing aspect of this book getting to understand the challenges and the team dynamics of the 1924 climbing team i enjoyed the wife's perspective but wish there had been more of her life after the climb it is a very different genre for me and i liked that it was different","135":"a heart wrenching love story","136":" well done ms rideout this is a beautifully written book that i didn't want to end like others i read it like a thriller even though i knew how it ended the author is able to convey her enthusiasm for her subject and help the reader understand that and even feel the same way i really liked the way she alternated the voices the first person intimacy of one day in the life of ruth mallory waiting for information of george and the third person perhaps above all things detailing just what was happening on the mountain i thought ruth very brave as brave as the climbers i got a real feel for the gentleman climbers and their dedication to their goal and there was the love story of ruth and george i thought the author handled that very well and how she managed to tell their whole story alternating back and forth in time and place","137":" a gripping account of george mallory's third and final attempt to reach the summit of mt everest though much has been written about these events this book is unique in that it is told from the point of view of george's wife ruth i found the title to be especially provocative married couples should hold each other above all things but in the mallory marriage there is a third presence everest george's mountain climbing took place in the 1920's when transportation was slow and communication was even slower the voyage from england through india to the base of the mountain by boat and then over land took weeks when ruth received a letter from george describing bombay he was already on the mountain and as the weeks went by and the letters became fewer ruth lived with the knowledge that george might already be victorious or that he might have perished in the thin air of 29 000 feet she waited expectantly every day for the post and then was afraid to look at the letters that had come she feared the ring of the telephone or the doorbell she tried to live a normal life but it was anything but normal you will feel the anguish of this woman trying to remain optimistic as weeks and months go by you will ache for her as she knows in her soul that too much time has elapsed and the news cannot be good you will understand that a little part of her died the day she received the telegram saying we regret to inform you an outstanding debut novel","138":"one of the best books i've read this year","139":"i really tried but couldn't finish this i loved paris wife and into thin air but something about this didn't appeal to me maybe the prose or that i didn't care for either story i might try to give it another chance in the future","140":"the writing and imagery were really good especially the descriptions of everest and the base camps but the tone of the book is so sad i got depressed the ultimate doom of the expedition weighs heavy over the whole story","141":"this book is written around the true event of george mallory's attempt to be the first to climb mt everest it makes fascinating reading delving deeply into george's preparations and climb attempts it also covers his wife's experiences being left behind with the children whilst he pursues his dreams the vivid descriptions of the ice the snow the cold the struggle to hang on to his faculties whilst suffering extreme oxygen deprivation all combine to make the reader feel as if they too were climbing the mountain no one knows how george spent his final hours but this book is a very believable description of how things could have unravelled","142":"i love everest and reading books about it i liked this book but it took about half way thru to get into it also it alternated between george mallory and the expedition on the mountain and his wife at home i found the wife at home storyline pretty boring if you are an everest fan you will enjoy","143":"i loved this book a captivating character study as well as a complex and multi themed novel it's very well written and i couldn't put it down i don't know why it hasn't gotten more attention highly recommended","144":"i enjoyed this book but would have preferred if it focused more on ruth's life at home rather than on everest","145":" i didn't know anything about george mallory or the everest expedition before reading this so it was a very interesting read often at times i forgot that this was a work of fiction although based on true events i think the description of the book as as being similar to a the paris wife is misleading as very little of the book was from the wife's perspective the beginning of the book was a little confusing as it seemed to assume the reader knows what has happened on the previous everest trip but found it quite gripping once it got going","146":"i think people who risk their lives climbing mountains like everest are extremely self centered and probably a little nuts how many families have been shattered by people like george mallory who died in his third attempt to reach the top of a mountain for glory although fictionalized it is a well told tale i have no idea how accurate it is but the facts have been well known up to a point since 1924 although i started this with an arc last summer i lost it on a trip and was just able to finish it with the final version from my library","147":"the story of george mallory's attempt to climb everest intertwined with the story of his wife i really enjoyed the half of the book that told the story of mallory's climb i did not like his wife's story half of the book is her story and it is not much of a story she waits for him to come home and always resents him for choosing everest over family","148":" this is a riveting story divided between george mallory and his several attempts to summit mt everest and his wife ruth at home in cambridge england she both longs for her husband's return and is furious at him for leaving her and their three children yet again i read it in conjunction with into the silence mallory the great war and the conquest of everest so i was terminally confused as to which of the three expeditions i was on at any given moment this volume is a huge tome unless you are a mountaineer or british i would recommend starting with above all things","149":"i picked up this book thinking i might not get very far into it but it captured me instantly not only did his love of climbing and stats of mt everest interest me but also the family aspects of living with someone that loved to conquer mountains ultimately mt everest and their sacrifice","150":"i actually only read 1 4 of this book i found it slow and the characters were not that likeable they all seemed whiney and in a bad mood i guess if i were them i would be too i know this book has received good reviews and i may give it a try some other time but for now i need something a little faster paced","151":"excellent book the author draws you in and does a wonderful job painting a picture of everest and the relationship between george and ruth mallory you know how it ends but she kept you hanging on to see what and when exactly it was going to happen","152":"i received this book from the penguin debut author program i have to say i enjoyed it very much i liked the alternating perspectives of each chapter the story was brutally honest in both the challenge of reaching the summit of everest in the 1020's and the relationship perspective of those left behind i will be passing my copy around and would recommend this book to others","153":"another book which makes me want to read more about the true story loved the story of the climb but found the wife's despair a bit tedious after a while","154":"this novel based on fact tells the story of george mallory's historic attempt to be the first to climb mount everest at home we follow a day in the life of ruth mallory long used to waiting at home for her husband the adventurer recommended for fans of historical fiction","155":"i wasn't in the mood for this","156":"really good but sad","157":"this was a good historical fiction about george mallory and his wife ruth mallory was an english explorer who failed to conquer mt everest twice the book details his third attempt it was spellbinding to follow his harrowing adventure up the mountain while his wife struggles with her fear feelings of abandonment back at home i would highly recommend this book","158":"loved this book great mix of love story and adventure","159":"a beautiful touching heart rending novel about george mallory and his wife ruth it is rather a dreamy disjointed book sometimes it's a bit difficult to know the timeframe or speaker but so poignant a love story about the so very handsome and charming george and his wife they do seem to have an incredibly intimate relationship an examination of the relationship between family commitment and love and then the urge to follow a passion like climbing everest and there is no answer about how to reconcile those dichotomy there and a very informative book about the initial exploratory climbs up the tallest mountain the novel moves back and forth between ruth and george ruth's side is told in first person she is trying to be strong and hold her life and family three young children together she is trying to reconcile her feelings between love for george so wanting him back home safely and her great anger at him for going off on his third trek up everest especially after he promised that the last time would be his last george's story is told in third person but is no less intrinsic he is questioning whether he should be away from his family or not but he has such a passion a recklessness to get to the top of his peak he especially feels this way after the disastrous second trip on which an avalanche killed a number of people the year is now 1924 and this expedition wants to top the third pole before the french or german have the chance an excellent opportunity to prove britain's might especially after the devastation of wwi some of the climbers seem to feel they have the correct perspective on the agony of climbing after having been in the trenches that one has to pay for life achievement even at great risk and seeing men die this expedition is a tremendous undertaking at the start of the ascent there is a five mile long train of sherpas yaks u0026amp ponies with just ridiculous amounts of necessities and luxuries they are determining a route exploring trying to determine how the body reacts to such altitude their clothing is so basic and hence the cold is just brutal brutal just tremendous we know all this because of all the letters ruth and george exchanged sharing the important info and the insignificant mallory's body was found in 1999 and it was realized he had a trauma his fellow climber sandy irvine never has been found it isn't known whether george summited or not but he may have a photo of ruth was missing from his person and he'd always said she deserved to be at the top of the world that he would leave her picture there at the summit so maybe rideout cme to write this novel because she worked at an outfitting story i am thinking rei and kept on seeing video of movie star looking george mallory she began to wonder about his passion for climbing and how it must have felt to be his wife so far away waiting for letters to arrive from such a remote distance she did a lot of research and wrote a very fine book","160":"i was sent this book to read as part of the britmums book club i wasn't sure what to expect from the book as it's not something i would normally pick up but i do like a love story and the 1920's so i decided to give it a go i'm so glad that i did it wasn't until i was about 1 2 way into the book that i realised that it is a fictional book based on real historical events i made the mistake of googleing george mallory and of course in doing so i did spoil the ending a little for myself i loved the way the book focuses not just on george's side of the story but also from ruth's side as well i did find ruth's narration a little confusing in that she flits from telling a story to 'talking' to george but i thought this also added to the emotional side of it i also enjoyed reading sandy's point of view as well i have never read or watched anything about mountaineering before so i don't know how factual the technical side of the story is but it felt realistic as to how they would have been feeling physically and emotionally in summary this is a well written story with drama and romance added in whether you are interested in the story of george mallory or just after a good book to read this is a fantastic read","161":"spoilers if you don't know anything about the history of climbing mt everesttanis rideout has written a novel that highlights the cost of climbing everest she details what george mallory and others were giving up in order to be the first to summit mount everest as the story switches from the efforts of the men on the mountain back to the family they have waiting at home particularly mallory's wife and children in england that contrast heightens the drama and intensifies the sense of loss rideout writes beautifully and tells the story of mallory's determination so well that even though i knew the end of the story there were times when i still thought he'd make it i find stories about climbing everest both compelling and horrifying compelling because of the courage and skill and effort and drama that naturally attend such adventures horrifying because of the cost and because i really do not understand that level of acceptable sacrifice i don't think my levels of acceptable sacrifice were that high even before i had children but after absolutely not this was an excellent story highly recommended","162":"this story captured my interest from the beginninng climbing mount everest a subject matter that i haven't given much thought about the author successfully paints a vivid picture of the characters and their surroundings definitely worth a read","163":"incredible book about the marriage of george mallory possibly the first person to successfully reach the summit of mount everest in 1924 historical fiction at it's finest","164":"this was a quick read action filled with the team attempting the 1st climb to the summit of mount everest there were enough historical facts to appeal to me a lover of historical fiction i also enjoyed the play on words of the title and the contrasting chapters of the team on the mountain and the wife with 3 children back at home in england","165":" i knew about mallory's 1924 attempt to scale mount everest and so when a fictional account of the expedition came along i could not pass it up and i am glad i did not whether one is familiar with mallory's unfortunate attempt to climb mount everest or not i do believe any reader will be pulled into this exceptionally written heart rendering book above all things by tanis rideout takes the reader back to 1924 as george mallory sets out to climb mount everest while leaving his wife ruth behind written in the form of alternating narratives the story is rather exceptional and whether one is interested in mountain climbing or not i am not the story is one that will capture one's heart rideout did an extraordinary job researching the material and recreating scenes and characters yes some liberties were taken which are explained however this is historical fiction and those liberties do not distract between this beautiful and yet harrowing story i recommend above all things to all readers and discussion groups the book has too much promise to pass up","166":" torn between 1 star and 2 much of the book was sort of painful to read ruth wanders around her house and then around town being depressed lonely and bored this might actually be how she felt but it doesn't make for a very interesting read plus her husband was gone for months at a time and it's hard to believe she lived all those months in this gloomy state of mild depression she had three kids and a household to run even if she did have two servants the chapters told from the climbers' pov were better but the author spent too long on their agonizing thoughts of home and all the people they had wronged is this really what they spent all their days thinking about several times i almost put the book down for good but at its heart it's a compelling story the non fiction foundation of the story and i kept hoping it would get better it did a little but just a little i also found myself wandering around my neighborhood in a state of mild gloom while reading this so i guess the author did a good job of evoking the atmosphere of their lives fundamentally this is a depressing boring romance much more than a climbing story i've read dozens of mountain climbing books and this doesn't hold up to pretty much any of them","167":"this was a fantastically written engaging story i read it first and foremost because i have known the author since we were 3 years old but being a person that does judge books by their covers i would definitely have picked this one up in the book store it is beautiful from the outside in congratulations tanis","168":" i bought a copy of 'above all things' at the ivy bookshop in baltimore after i read sara wheeler's review in the april 28 new york times book review section sara wheeler is one of my favorite authors 'above all things' is historical fiction based on the attempt by george mallory and andrew 'sandy' irvine to climb mount everest in early june 1924 in her 'author's note' at the end of the novel rideout says she first learned about mallory and irvine while working at an outdoor outfitter store i first learned of mallory and irvine in the summer of 1972 in a tent in the hindu kush my college history professor the late and great george mayer told me the story how odell from far below on the mountain saw two dark spots moving up the mountain then the clouds rolled in and of course neither mallory nor irvine was ever seen alive again the story was thrilling to george mayer who was cynical on the surface but at heart a hopeless romantic i said let's not let anything like that happen to us the only other novel with a mountain climbing theme i can recall is james ramsey ullman's 'the white tower' 1945 although i'm sure there are other novels i've missed the reason for the relative paucity of mountain climbing novels may be that the classic nonfiction climbing books like heinrich harrer's 'the white spider' and stephen venables' 'everest kangshung face' are so wildly improbable and exciting that there's not much narrative space left for mere fiction 'above all things' is an ambitious book and i like ambitious books it's ambitious because climbing people like me are so sensitive to the mystery of what exactly happened to george and sandy and we're reluctant to have someone tamper with it but rideout i guess without knowing that she's not a climber brings it off as george is dying after falling on the mountain rideout writes that he crossed his good leg over the broken one and tried to lift his head well of course we all recall sadly the photograph of george as his body was finally found with one leg crossed over another sara wheeler in her review makes one point i'm not sure i agree with which is that some characters including odell never really come into focus especially at the end of the novel i thought rideout gave us a good portrait of odell and the leader of the expedition norton i was surprised that rideout doesn't list among her resources wade davis' 'into the silence the great war mallory and the conquest of everest' 2011 which is the best book about mallory written to date rideout plainly echoes davis' theme quite original and quite correct that the attempts on everest can be understood only only in the context of the trench warfare on the western front also rideout doesn't speak much to the pathetic clothing and equipment that the climbers used in the early 1920s when the tweed jacket taken from george's body was displayed at the national geographic society in washington years ago i put aside my moral objections to disturbing his body and went to the exhibition i was astounded i wouldn't walk around the block in baltimore in january wearing just this jacket it was unbelievable that george tried to climb everest wearing it i stared at it for probably 3 or 4 minutes and then looked up to my surprise beside me was the late and great senator edward kennedy just as fascinated by the jacket as i was all in all this is a good novel well worth reading","169":"it started slowly for me but i grew to love this story about george mt everest climber and ruth mallory","170":"i've never felt claustrophobic reading a book before but i felt like i was there on this quest to scale everest for the first time really enjoyed it","171":"this story follows the last fateful days of the 1924 everest expedition told from the points of view of george and ruth mallory and sandy irvine and using two narrative styles it takes a little bit to settle into this book's rythym but it is a richly rewarding experience it is evocative and moving while at the same time being almost voyeuristic in the harsh realities of mountaineering it's not without it's flaws chief among them being this is a bleak book that is about death and failure not to spoil the plot but i don't think you can spoil this novel's ending as it's based on historical events that aren't going to change because someone wrote a book about it that being said it certainly takes some liberties with the truth this book is really more about love and obsession than it is an adventure story so i think tanis rideout was using the history as set dressing rather than the raison d'etre of the story still mallory's drive to reach everest's summit at the expense of everything contrasted with his wife's quiet desperation while she awaits news in far away england is an oddly compelling and readable mixture","172":"above all things is a book of historical fiction of george mallory an english explorer of mt everest it was interesting but it just didn't hold me it was hard to follow the characters this is tanis rideout's first book","173":" i loved this story the book was based on the true events of the 1920's mt everest climbing expeditions of george mallory i was so intrigued by this book that after i finished i began looking up pictures and articles on george mallory and his adventure i also love the way the story was written the author allowed you to follow george's story on the mountain and his wife's story as she waited for his return some have commented that the chapters that go back to his wife ruth are boring and pointless to the story i on the other hand disagree the chapters that are dedicated to the climb are filled with george's drive to claim the summit of everest something he has failed at twice before these chapters are harrowing and adrenaline pumping i found myself reading quickly dying to know what was going to happen then the author would switch over to ruth a wife and mother who has spent most of her married life waiting for her husband's return her days are filled with worry and regret i think the chapters involving ruth show the reader how george's addiction to this mountain affected those who loved him the most i also enjoyed the author's note in the back of the book it continued the story a bit more because honestly i wasn't ready to let it go yet","174":"didn't really like all that much moved too slowly","175":" what i learned from this book climbing mt everest is really really hard this book tells the story of george mallory's last attempt to climb everest tanis rideout makes you feel like you're up there with him feeling the cold headaches and delusions that come with climbing higher altitudes without oxygen rideout also tells the story of his wife waiting at home for him but i didn't find this part quite as enthralling overall an entertaining adventure with insight into a part of history i knew little about","176":"wow i'm still thinking about this book hours after finishing it it's hard for me to believe that this was rideout's debut novel especially because it was so thoughtfully and beautifully written i think the only thing keeping me from giving this a five star rating is because i didn't really understand how the author was utilizing the time frame between the two narrators one point of view over the course of months the other over the course of one day and the ending was a little difficult to follow but only because it became symptomatic of people suffering the effects of hypothermia not a spoiler people this is historical fiction i've read other accounts of more recent everest expeditions but apparently i'm stuck in a certain time period as far as fiction goes these days i'm sincerely hoping this a genre that rideout finds herself writing more of because she's a very talented author","177":" i wrote a review for the globe u0026amp mail this book is a must read for everest buffs with a sensitive side and for those who want to understand the anatomy of climbing accidents it is also the perfect summer read for anyone lured by the romance of adventure as the story goes well beyond the vast summit of everest into much trickier terrain the unmapped topography of the heart full review is here http www theglobeandmail com arts books and media book reviews above all things by tanis rideout article4394393","178":" my review is here once upon a time i think the world must have been flat it was our minds that made it round our desire to circumnavigate it our desire to leave home certain but just as strongly our desire to return but in making it round we crumpled it up pulling it apart in places crushing it together in others thrusting them up into the atmosphere bullying the deserts the tundra the plains into george's beloved mountains peaks that stretch up from the rest of the world i prefer the cracks and crevasses the gaps and holes the bottomless depths of oceans and valleys where you can see below the surface or small spaces that hold me secure and safe i prefer what is hidden away p 224","179":"i can't say i enjoyed reading this book its not that it wasn't poorly written or the story was not what i expected it was the fact that i knew what the outcoming was going to be and didn't want to get to it the author made george mallory his wife ruth and especially sandy irvine likeable people and i knew that tragedy was coming their way as the book is based on actual events that occured in 1924 i found myself wanting ti postpone the inevitable so found it difficult to pick up the book to finish it when then end was near","180":"i liked this book and didn't know what was going to happen even though it was based on real events it got a bit long with many repetitions of conditions and what they went through interesting to think of all this happening so long ago","181":" this is a story of love and it's more than the love between two people though that is a driving force in the novel it's also the love of exploration of seeking a glory that will live beyond you it's wanting to conqueer something because it's there love doesn't have to be logical or easy oftentimes it's neither of these things but you still pursue it because it's worth the fight that's what i feel like this story was all about ruth and george faced their own battles as they strived for their loves they each wanted to keep the love they had together but george was also searching for the love he had for exploration he wanted so badly to conquer mt everest and even after all he suffered and lost he still wanted it meanwhile ruth tried to live her life while he was gone and there is struggle for both of them there is pain of separation and a more physical pain for george as he pushes his body onward as you follow them both on their journeys you grow to care not only for them but for others around them there is sorrow and loss and your heart breaks when those things come all in all it's a beautiful story that's so much more than the tale of a man trying to conquer a mountain and the woman forced to wait for him it's about love and what you sacrifice for it i would recommend this book to everyone who loves to find more to their stories than what it seems on the surface","182":"i would have given this 4 stars but for 2 minor gripes i found it sometimes awkward to figure out who was narrating but more annoying was the artistic license taken with some of the facts disclosed in the post script altering the brother's death and the meditating climber to have happened before the 1924 attempt did not add any thing to the story it just made it less credible","183":"really a 4 5 although i found this book difficult to get through in the beginning i was totally consumed by the story setting u0026amp characters i didn't know a lot about the early attempts on everest before reading this but it is fascinating u0026amp crazy to think about what these people tried to do in addition to the climbing story i enjoyed the love story of george u0026amp ruth this is one story that i won't forget anytime soon","184":"a chilling read i finished this book utterly broken hearted wonderful story now has me scouring the internet for more information on the real mallory's","185":"liked the descriptions of being on the mountain but found the stuff with the wife to be a bit boring i'd give it 3 5 stars though","186":" breathtaking despite the fantastic reviews i likely wouldn't have read this book if i had not once been good friends with the author while i do enjoy historical novels mountaineering in the early 20th century is not something i'd normally be interested in however i am very glad that i remain in touch with the author and that i decided to support her work and buy her book it is truly fabulous the juxtoposition of a day in george mallory's wife ruth's life made the tale so much more complete and interesting for me than a story just about george could have been and yet it is so well written the emotions so well imagined that even through the george parts i devoured every word tanis rideout i am very proud of you","187":"i haven't ever given a book a 4 rating that i had a hard time getting through but this was a really good book i just had a tough time sticking with it because i knew the outcome as the book neared the end i wanted to will the outcome to be different it is an amazing story of some truly amazing people","188":" the further i got into this book the more difficult it came to puit the book down although the setting of the book and the feat of mountain climbing are not actually in my interest realm rideout combined both sides of the story and took us from everest to mingle with the family of george mallory the main character in the story although this was a fictionalized account george mallory in reality did live and climbed everest on three different occasions until the third fatal attempt an addictive page turner","189":"an incredible combination of historical fiction adventure mystery and romance after reading this novel i never ever want to climb a moutain","190":"chosen as the march 2014 smpl book club selection 2014 durham region public libraries pass the book selection","191":"found myself much more interested in the ascent of the mountain than the chapters focused on ruth but overall it was a good story and provided some information about the earliest terms to conquer everest","192":"i would have given this book 5 stars if the first half had been as good as the second half","193":" interesting story based on real events and people rideout really keeps the suspense even though the expedition being recounted was in 1924 she also leaves it to the reader to decide if george mallory was actually the first person to summit everest or not i really appreciate that she did not force assume the outcome of that final ascent i had some trouble with the shifting points of view and it took me a while to settle into the rhythm of the shifts also if i was rereading it i might skip the sections from one character i think i understand what rideout was trying to show in the story with those sections i just did not like them","194":"i loved this book it moved between george mallory's 1924 ascent of mt everest and his wife's life in cambridge historical fiction my favorite chapters centered on mallory's climb but i think this is true because of rideout's portrayal of ruth mallory i was feeling ruth's panic u0026amp sorrow throughout the novel now i would like to read more about mallory's life u0026amp his desire to climb everest fascinating","195":" loved this book a fictional account of the historical events of george mallory's 1924 everest expedition told from the perspective of george himself one of the other expeditioners sandy and george's wife ruth at times the george u0026amp ruth love story seemed a bit over the top but it seems like rideout really did her research and she really made the story come alive i can't even believe the conditions the expeditioners endured and like the jacket says in little more than burberry tweeds when you think of the incredibly expensive technical clothing and gear that climbers use today it is hard to imagine that these guys got as close as they did wished the ending was different though i was glad that the author didn't provide a definitive interpretation of what happened on the final summit attempt the way that she avoided it was perfect i will choose to believe that they made it though","196":" one of the most beautifully written books i can remember reading i had no idea who george and sandy were prior to picking up this book but now i want to learn more about them their families and try to figure out what in the world possessed these men to want to climb that mountain to be honest i couldn't wait to finish the book to know what happened and began searching for more about them on the internet this book captured my attention completely and i highly recommend it if you enjoy history adventure and or a good but sad love story five stars","197":"a different read","198":"a spell binding account of george mallory's third and final attempt to climb mount everest the account of his journey is juxtaposed with the life of his wife and three children in england during his absence the contrast of climbing in the 1920's wearing layers of woven clothing leather boots with spikes and using just an ice axe and rope as compared to later technology will blow your mind","199":"i was hooked on this book within the first few pages i can't even imagine what it must have been like to climb everest in the 1920s i now want to read into thin air","200":"i really enjoyed this historical fiction centered on climbing mt everest i would have given it a 5 except there were a few spots in the novel where it was too wordy and drawn out overall a great first novel","201":"everyone know the story of george mallory and his attempt to summit everest what we don't know or hadn't given much thought to is the people he left behind this novel beautifully meshes the story of mallory's obsession with everest with the story of his long suffering wife","202":" this is a debut novel and it captured me right away the back and forth of who is telling the story took a bit to get used to but once that was accomplished i was eager to continue reading to find out the ending of this adventure story that is filled with love tragedy and one man's obsession of achieving something that he hopes will be his legacy to his family and his country this is george mallory's 3rd attempt at climbing mt everest in 1924 note george mallory his wife kids and his climbing team are real people so there is a mix of fiction in with real life happenings in this novel you can definitely read more about mallory and his climbing adventures the losses of life during them and the accomplishments made during them as well i don't want to give the ending away so will just recommend that when you have the time please do pick up this book to read it won't disappoint","203":"a beautifully rendered narrative at the love story between george mallory and his wife ruth along with all the people involved with george's life as he undertakes the third attempt to climb mount everest tanis rideout does a great job of capturing the psyche of the climbers and the thoughts they might have had as well as what ruth might have been thinking as she waited for george to return although the ending does not deviate from the tragic ending those who are new to the world of climbing will enjoy the details of preparing for and undertaking the climb this was very well researched and very well written capturing the concepts of obsession love and the quest for glory for self and king and country","204":"i loved this book loved how it was written after the first 20 pages i did not think i would enjoy it but it was incredible once i got into the book i was hooked","205":"everest fascinates me what is the drive that pushes people to go against all the laws of nature just to stand on top of this peak i really enjoyed this story jumping narratives from the men and the boundaries they were pushing to the life of the wife left behind","206":"everest legendhas ever suffering wifekinda romantic","207":"i only made it to page 98 before i gave up on this so keep that in mind with my review thoughts i feel like i have this complaint a lot but my issue with this book is marketing here's the description on goodreads and amazon \"tell me the story of everest \" she said a fervent smile sweeping across her face creasing the corners of her eyes \"tell me about this mountain that's stealing you away from me \"in 1924 george mallory departs on his third expedition to reach the summit of mount everest left behind in cambridge george's young wife ruth along with the rest of a war ravaged england anticipates news they hope will reclaim some of the empire's faded glory through alternating narratives what emerges is a beautifully rendered story of love torn apart by obsession and the need for redemption now call me crazy but doesn't it seem like the book will be about ruth mallory here's the inside jacket description in 1924 george and ruth mallory are happily in love ensconced with their three children in cambridge england george is arguably the last great british explorer having twice tried and failed to conquer mount everest it is a mountain that has haunted him george with his movie star good looks and incredible charisma has captivated a war torn england that hopes he can restore some of its former glory after world war i yet george promises ruth that he won't mount a third attempt he belong to her not to everest then one afternoon ruth reads a telegram addressed to her husband glad to have you aboard again and with this one sentence her world will never be the same george has assembled a team of the best and the brightest to scale the top including oxford student sandy irvine haunted by the mistress he left behind the best friend he betrayed and the mother he deserted sandy hopes to return to make things right george has his own demons to confront before he can be reunited with his beloved ruth yet in order for george and sandy to make amends they must first go where no man has ever gone before a beautifully rendered story of love torn apart by the need for redemption and the quest for glory above all things is a captivating blend of historical fact and imaginative fiction it is a heartbreaking tale of obsession sacrifice and what we do for love and honor now does that sound like the same book here's what i've deduced the publisher thought the book would have a greater sales if it appealed to the readers of the paris wife a book i hated the aviator's wife and now z the zelda fitzgerald novel but this book isn't like those this book is mainly about george mallory the explorer and sandy a guy on the expedition with him and honestly that's not a subject that interests me at all the parts of the book from ruth mallory's perspective were few and far between and honestly she was kind of whiny and annoying like hadley in the paris wife bleh now maybe you think i'm being too hard on the book the writing is good it's a little flowery for me but i'm sure there are many people who will enjoy it i just couldn't get past my dislike of the characters and the fact that the story was about a bunch of guys attempting to climb everest and not about one of their wives at home this review first appeared on my blog","208":"the book started out rather slow and boring for me but gains speed a light story about the everest climb if there can be one","209":"very interesting it makes me want to learn more about how they climb today i wonder how well george's depiction matches his personality","210":"wow fantastic ending was surprise i'd recommend it to all my friends","211":"love love loved it my favourite kind of of historical fiction that doesn't sacrifice realistic character development a brilliant first novel on a fascinating subject full review to come i just needed to squee a bit","212":"book about everest climb from wife's point of view loved most of it hated some of it","213":"i always love mountain climbing books into thin air the void the north wall etc this one combines backstory with mountain climbing so you can see the human aspect and cost of this obsession","214":"i think my high hopes for this book exceeded the book itself plus when you know what happens since it is based on a true story it needs to be quite exciting to be pulled into all the excess details by the end my attention was faltering away and so i ended up skimming the end i didn't even realize that the last page was the end i turned the page excepting to be more but that was it a bit disappointed still a pretty good story though and makes you stop and think about all the wives at home of the hero's in history","215":" a story of george mallory's ill fated 1924 attempt to be the first man to conquer mount everest also a story of his wife waiting at home i liked george's story just fine but found myself super annoyed with his wife she was whiny and absorbed entirely in her husband even her children seemed an after thought to her maybe it was that george's story was told in 3rd person while his wife's was told in 1st person either way i could have done without her part in the story as i was finishing this book discovery came out with a documentary on the most recent avalanche to happen on everest killing at least 13 sherpas i felt like i got a better feel of the sherpas the mountain and the people that want to climb it from that 1 hr documentary than i got from this entire book that being said it was still entertaining enough for me to keep reading and because i had not heard of george mallory yet the ending was still suspenseful to me to some extent","216":"this is a beautifully written story about an adventurer who tackles everest and the wife he leaves behind it is set in 1924 when everest is the last pole to be conquered what makes a man leave the woman he loves and three children to attempt such a dangerous climb not once but three times how does it feel to be left behind to have your husband choose the mountain over you the author delves into these questions but also describes the climb in great detail so that you almost feel your own fingers freezing and head throbbing as you read","217":"i really love the writing in this book rideout is a poet and it shows she captures every intimate gesture every clink of glass and conjures the imagined elegance of 1920s england the plot alternates between george mallory's adventure on the mountain and a single day in the life of his wife ruth we are tethered to the rope with mallory as he climbs the mountain and we witness the length of ruth's days historical fiction is the original fan fiction","218":"first book i've read by this author climbing mount everest and the toll it takes on family left behind grips you as does all the danger in the climb itself however i was not hoping for how it ended the story is so vivid you can feel the good and the bad the cold and loss of life how a wife must feel when to climb mount everest causes her husband to choose it over her and her children very well written","219":"i'm an ex climber yet still found it a bit boring","220":"this was just too slow for me it started out so fascinating but as i kept reading i kept getting more and more bored i couldn't stand the chapters about ruth sorry that sounds mean but it's true in the end i had 3 other library books sitting on my nightstand and just decided to give up i really did want to know what happened but couldn't bring myself to stumble through the rest","221":"beautifully written heartbreaking story told from ruth mallory's pov as well as from george mallory's and sandy irvine's i knew from the start of course that he was going to die but to see it through his eyes as well as through ruth's as a wife was unbearable highly recommend","222":"very good story about climbing mt everest this was the first book for this author","223":"knock my socks off when i picked up this debut by author tanis rideout i figured i would get a good read i didn't expect what i got though i love when an author makes us crave more that is exactly what rideout did for this reader i really really love the cover says a lot doesn't it then we dive into the story told between ruth and george ruth hanging on hoping against all odds that george will come back and george on his first attempt at mt everest why did he want to climb it because it's there george had promised helen he wasn't going to attempt it again but helen read a telegram to george saying how they were glad he was on board and it all changed for them swaying between fact and fiction rideout did an excellent job i am eagerly awaiting her next novel i hope it won't be too long","224":"this is a captivating adventure love story about george malory's third ill fated expedition to mount everest the story is told through letters between mallory and his wife who is at home with their three children rideout has managed to spark an interest to learn more about the history behind the novel through her research and telling of mallory and ruths lives the children's grown up lives are interesting to read more about outside this book","225":" this novel is told from two perspectives the george mallory everest expedition and ruth mallory's life at home waiting for george's return i'd actually give this a 3 5 but i can't in good conscience give it a 4 because i found myself longing to read the everest expedition chapters and impatiently waded through the ruth mallory chapters in all fairness the story of team of british climbers struggling through practially impossible conditions is far more captivating than the story of a woman missing her husband and trying to decide what she should do should her husband not return","226":"interesting fictional read about george and his crew's hike to the summit of mount everest slow at times but a good read over all","227":"beautifully written and hard to put down despite knowing the real life outcome this book will stay with me for a while","228":"well written story about george mallory's attempts to climb mt everest culminating in his final attempt in 1924 as viewed by mr mallory and separately by his wife while the story is fiction much of the book is based on factual information","229":"being the wife of an explorer is most likely one of the worst situations a woman can find herself in when they are victorious it had nothing to do with you when they are defeated you bear their misery and disappointment this is as true today as it was in 1924 such is the life of ruth mallory whose dashing husband is destined to go on yet one more attempt to climb mt everest and be the first to reach the summit ruth will once again be left with the children her brave face a mask to all the well wishers and a deaf ear turned to those who claim her husband george is a fool for trying it yet again their marriage is strong but has never really been time tested because george has been home only long enough to father children and raise funds for the next climb he writes lovely letters full of hope and she returns with her own letters of encouragement and news of the children but something is missing we get a glimpse of their love story and life leading up to this last climb from ruth's perspective and we also get inside george's head to witness the climb and his feelings about his part in this adventure tanis rideout's description of george mallory's attempt to climb mt everest is so vivid that the reader will need to get a sweater and lip balm just to keep reading it is a fascinating portrait of the great adventurer and those he leaves behind i was lucky to receive an advance copy of this book through penguin's first flights program look for it on bookshelves this coming february","230":"this was ok the story following the climb was fascinating if nothing else realizing the effort required and the fact that they had only tweeds to stay warm it did however spark an interest in mallory and irvin and books about everest","231":"ugh a meandering meandering ruth chapters were whiny george chapters were oxygen deprived i liked sandy though couldn't wait to get off the mountain a difficult slow scattered read","232":"this story rotates among the perspectives of george mallory one of his climbing partner's and his wife's whenever we're on the mountain with george or sandy it's an entertaining tale however i felt very impatient whenever it switched back to his wife her chapters are slow moving and tedious i think this was the author's first novel so it's a good start","233":"worth reading proud i did not use wikipedia to find out the end","234":"this was another book that took me a while to get into but then i sat down with it for a few hours and just got so into the book that i had to go do other things because otherwise i would have just sat there until i finished the story is arguably about the attempt to climb everest in 1924 iirc but it's really about much much more than that and the climbing of the mountain serves as a really good backdrop for the rest of the action i really didn't know much about the expedition or the main characters and i'm pretty much glad that i didn't because i got to appreciate the way the characters were portrayed that much more at first i found the shifts in pov from third to first to be kind of weird but then it started to work it's hard to say which chapters i enjoyed more but on the whole i just really really enjoyed this book and wish it wasn't over even tough all i wanted to do while reading it was learn how it ended","235":" i knew how this ended before i started but that still didn't keep me from wishing for something else and i was captivated till the very end beautifully written - it made me want to learn more about the characters even though she explained why i was disappointed at some major changes to history that the author made specifically george's brother - there was no need to change the timing of his death and add all of the drama around it because of it i think the effects of the war as they happened were enough to contribute to george's state of mind the author did a beautiful job of bringing ruth to life and adding the dialogue and inner thoughts of all the characters so there was no need to change so many facts the history is a strong enough story on its own i think i don't know about the climb itself but have read comments that state the facts about that have been changed as well again i do not really understand why - but then i havent studied everest or mallory's climb so i cannot really say that it would have been fine telling it the way it happened the writing was wonderful though and i will most definitely read her next book s","236":"the style of rideout's writing allows for beautiful imagery in your mind and makes you feel as if you are present in the story i found the pace of the story to be a bit slow and slightly monotonous","237":"i have read many accounts of everest expeditions all by participants novelization does not convey the experiences the back story of ruth mapplory added nothing it was a distraction perhaps this novel would be ok for those wiht no background in himilayan climbing but not for me","238":"i loved how tanis rideout juxtaposed chapters telling of the rigorous efforts of the climbers particularly george mallory with ones that give fragments of one day in the life of his wife ruth as she waits for his return having already read several books about mallory's noble obsessive determination to reach the summit of everest i was pleasantly surprised at how compelling this novel is a companion for jeffrey archer's paths of glory also the tale of mallory's possible conquest of the top which i also loved","239":"this is a beautiful and haunting book about george mallory's attempt to summit everest tanis rideout alternates chapters detailing his ascent with chapters that describe the painstakingly slow hours his wife endures while waiting for word of his success rideout's writing is rich and insightful lyric and striking the final chapters of the book are a tour de force offering the reader a rare vista the final revelatory moments arising from a true obsession","240":"the author did a fine job imagining this tale of mallory and his adventures with the everyday goings on of living by ruth his wife i found myself more interested in reading an historical account of the everest attempts of the 1920's","241":" i'll be honest i was nervous about this one i did indeed make the mistake of judging the book by its cover the cover is terrible it looked far too much like romantic fiction for old ladies for my liking luckily the contents of the book are far better than the cover above all things is based on the tale of george mallory and henry irvine's attempt to scale everest in the 1920s the focus of the book deals with mallory's relationship with his wife ruth which is the reason for the soppy cover what is it like to wait at home for someone to return from a dangerous mission you don't understand or approve of to be married to someone so driven the story flits between the climbers's entire expedition and just one day of ruth's where she has a dinner party and needs to prepare for it i couldn't help but think of mrs dalloway here and i wonder if this was intentional given that that mallory was linked to the bloomsbury group i've never understood the allure of mountain climbing mallory was the chap who coined the irritating phrase because it's there it's a testimony to rideout's writing and storytelling that i forgot all about my general dislike of all things mountainous the climbers' parts of the story are much better than ruth's part george is a selfish ambitious arrogant and sometimes reckless man though i imagine you'd need all those qualities to climb mountains yet for all that i wanted him to succeed it didn't matter therefore that i knew from history that this would have a sad ending as i got closer to the end and therefore the inevitable a sense of dread took over and poor ruth who earlier in the book i found rather whiny having to tell the children their father wasn't coming back by the time of the dinner party her part has much improved there was only so much i could bear reading about her moping doing some random googling after i'd finished the book i found this terribly sad quote from mallory's son john who was three when his father died to him george mallory's failure to return home provided all the answers he needed 'to me ' he said 'the only way you achieve a summit is to come back alive the job is only half done if you don't get down again' essentially this is a good book let down by a poor cover","242":"kind of disappointed in this one especially since it has gotten such grand reviews the beginning was good the ending was well done but the middle was such a long slog i nearly gave up several times lots and lots and lots of detail","243":"i really enjoyed this book i loved how the author weaved the story of ruth at home with the story of george on the mountain my only issue is two of the things she changed the timing of trafford dying in wwi in real life he died in 1944 many years after george died on everest trafford dying in wwi was such an integral part of the story i understand this book is fiction mixed with fact but it's one thing to make things up for the story but i don't like that she changed an actual known fact the other was maurice wilson on the mountain george and sandy finding his body high on the mountain it did happen but again many years after the '24 expedition this to me cheapens the story because it was these british expeditions that were the first there and they deserve the credit","244":"really liked it","245":"the mountain climbing adventure portion was mostly worth the read but the rest boring predictable i found myself skimming thru toward the end even when the final dramatic scenes on the mountain were taking place","246":"at first i thought the juxtaposition of the 2 stories was clunky and didn't add to the whole but as it went on ruth's perspective gave a human side to mallory and put him in context otherwise kind of into thin air in the 1920s but fascinating","247":"i am fascinated by all things everest and this was a good book to read after slogging through wade davis's into the silence the great war mallory and the conquest of everest i would've liked to have learned more of ruth's story after her husband's death","248":"i'm fascinated with george mallory this book was ok at times slow especially when it's ruths' chapter i prefer abominable by simmons","249":"it was okay lost a little interest as i got ino it as it seemed to move a little slow for me","250":"well written but very slow i had shard time getting through it maybe because i knew what was going to happen i appreciate what she was trying to do though","251":"a great read wonderful premise and development of the little known wife at home for everest explorer george mallory i could not put this down","252":" i liked this would actually give it 3 5 stars i found the concept interesting switching the narrative back and forth between george and ruth but found myself impatient to get back to the mountain narrative interesting speculation about the how it all ended for mallory and irvine perhaps the hallucinations and digressions of the oxygen deprived brains of mallory and irvine would have served the same purpose as the dual narratives the only problem with that would be the author wouldn't have been able to end with ruth and her experiences after mallory's death and i found that section very moving","253":"enjoyed the story about the men on the mountain more so than the story from ruth's point of view","254":"i enjoyed the juxtaposition of ruth and george's stories and how this added to the tension of the storyline i can't say that my opinion of mountain climbing is any better after reading this and i think the author could have done more to make me understand why george had to do what he did but even with my disinterest in the action ruth kept me reading i wanted to know more about how she was faring during george's climb","255":"i recommend this book if you are a fan of historic tragedies i can't help it i just am this book blends fact with fiction of the ill fated 1924 attempt to be the first to climb mt everest by george mallory i did not know this story but google it if you don't as well very interesting the author switches back and forth between mallory and his lonely wife left in england waiting for news of her husband's quest","256":"i started this book not knowing the outcome of mallory's expedition and like some other readers here had no prior keen interest in climbing or mt everest expeditions after reading this book however that has all changed i found myself fascinated with the process of the expedition itself the planning and preparation and procedures the extreme attention to detail necessary in every moment the extraordinary physical and mental challenge posed to all the climbers the dangers and concerns faced daily and well just all of it i found rideout's attention to every little detail in the parallel love story and adventure story truly compelling and was unable to put the book down always wanting to know what would happen next i have read and loved books from this period set in all areas of the world and dealing with multiple subjects but i have to say this was one of the most educational awe inspiring stories from that era i have ever read i have a newfound interest in learning more about climbing and in mt everest expeditions especially and i can't wait to get my hands on other books with these as the main focus specifically those set in times when modern conveniences and gear were not yet available and how many groundbreaking discoveries were made that helped to lay the foundation for modern climbers the love story between mallory and his wife was mostly an added bonus giving a compelling personal side to the man and his dreams and goals and all that was sacrificed on the homefront to enable him to continually attempt to reach his life long goal of getting to the everest summit i highly highly recommend this novel just be prepared to stay up all night because you won't be able to wait to find the outcome","257":"a fascinating novel based upon george mallory's ill fated third attempt to scale mount everest in 1924 and the toll his wanderlust took on his wife ruth and their three young children i found the pace a bit slow and the rhythm uneven in the book's first 200 pages but then i couldn't stop turning the pages","258":"although you already know the ending if you know the story of irvine and mallory this fictionalized account of their climb and of the people they left behind is great","259":"george mallory is determined to reach the top of mt everest he has tried twice and failed george wants to make a third attempt but his wife ruth is not enthusiastic george and ruth have been married for ten years and he has been gone at least half of that time also they have three children--clare berry and john--who are growing up without their father's presence based on the real mt everest expedition of 1924 above all things is a tale told by three people a lecturer at cambridge 37 year old george is a celebrated and experienced mountain climber his wife ruth is a beautiful society woman a dedicated wife and mother who paints when she can sandy irvine is a 21 year old engineering student and a strong rower with some mountain climbing experience george decides he must go on the third expedition even though ruth opposes it he sets off with other experienced climbers and sandy irvine will any of the expedition members reach the summit who will come back alive history speaks for itself if you don't know what happened on the everest trek and no one yet knows the total truth of mallory's attempt reading above all things will grab your attention pique your interest in mountain climbing and cause you to turn up the heat you'll be right there on the mountain with george and sandy you'll be at home with ruth and the kids in england the story is a really good mix of fact and fiction jodi s click here to find the book at the prince william county public library system","260":"a good read if you like man against nature coupled with a love story the main characters ruth and george mallory are real it's 1924 and george is making his thrid attempt to summit mount everest the author did a good job of mixing fact and fiction in this page turning story","261":"i was disappointed with this book it was confusing reading at times and dull","262":"it's a fast read and i gained some knowledge of the early expeditions of mount everest i didn't feel great emotion for any of the characters individually but what they all went through was intense and definitely pulled at my heartstrings the book poses some real questions about priorities what is the value of accomplishing something really dangerous just for the glory of acknowledgement that you did it especially if it is at the expense of others","263":"tanis rideout joined us at kingston writersfest 2012 you can read more about tanis and the festival here www kingstonwritersfest ca","264":"amazing exciting i loved it","265":"even more interesting for the husband wife dynamics than the adventure story itself","266":"this book captured my imagination and prompted me to look up more info found a video i'd like to see the wildest dream i'm inspired to read the paris wife","267":"beautiful writing i enjoyed the fictionalized story of george mallory's final pursuit of mt everest that is part romance part adventure it falls short of four stars in that it was a wee bit slow moving for me and didn't captivate my attention as much as i hoped it would there were times when it was hard to follow as the narrative would shift suddenly to moments in the past without any sort of transition this happened regularly and was a bit annoying it deserves at least 3 5 stars as it is much better than average but for my personal rating system it falls short of four stars as it is not a book i'd rave about to all my friends though i did enjoy it","268":" above all things is about the everest expedition of 1924 the story is told in alternating voices those of members of the expedition party and those of the people left at home in england the main voices are those of george and ruth mallory it was in interesting book there was much of the compelling nature of the professional reviews but i did not find it quite as charged as some i liked that it opened up a part of history i was not familiar with i appreciate all the research the author did in creating an authentic story about two strong personalities i did want to finish the book so i knew how it ended and what happened to the people in it i would definitely recommend it to people who like climbing or are fascinated by everest or even just like history the books was sent to me as part of the first flights book program by the penguin debut author program no compensation was received for this review and all thoughts are my own","269":" i really enjoyed this book i think what drew me in so much were the selections pertaining to his wife what her thoughts feelings and daily life were like as she waited for him to return each time i have personally always thought of everest climbers as selfish to be willing to risk everything to climb a mountain i have never understood the draw never i have seen documentaries and they have angered me i think it has to be one of the most egotistical ambitions ever as the wives the children and the parents are waiting at home it's one thing to lose someone to disease or war but to this i still cannot understand he wanted to be immortalized remembered never forgotten he was obviously searching for fulfillment he was so quick to dismiss faith as he had negative experiences with the church as a child but maybe he should have revisited this book is fiction but a lot of what is there is based on the author's study of the letters written between george and ruth even knowing what the ending is it is a suspenseful compelling read highly recommend","270":" weak the author writes about mallory's wife as he is busy getting killed on everest the editor needed to chop all but maybe two of the wife chapters the climb was exciting but this is doused by the utter banality of this woman at home i just couldn't take another chapter about how she missed her husband i finally did something i almost never do and started skipping the boring bits this made the story much better however there was a serious and intentional error where the author has mallory's brother die in ww1 instead of ww2 because she wants us to be sure we know war is well bad seriously","271":"a work of fiction based on historical fact this could have been a really slow read considering how long it takes climbers to get organised then actually do some climbing tanis rideout has made it so interesting and especially the way it goes backwards and forwards from the adventurers to mallory's wife and her hum drum life and daily wait for the post to be popped through the letterbox in her front door a great book","272":"4 5 stars maybe 5 this novel made my heart ache and my head go whirring still thinking on it meanwhile i started a pinterest board about it http www pinterest com mercybay abo","273":"this is a must read an intimate account of george mallory's life ambition and love for his wife delicately written so that the denouement is even more shocking and tragic the characters were immediately brought to life","274":" reading this book was a bit like climbing mt everest long slow plodding excruciating at times i eventually got interested enough in the plot line of george mallory and the expedition team to finish it but the portions told from the perspective of ruth mallory were just too tedious for me i never really understood where the depth of her love came from and why she was so emotionally frail i kept waiting for a reveal or flashback to something important but it never came she was just a stereotype of a bygone era wife too delicate for the man's world of climbing expeditions into which she had been thrust","275":" above all things is a well written book that gives a fictionalized account of the 1924 attempt to scale mount everest the story is told from the point of view of george mallory and sandy irvine and juxtaposed against a day in the life of ruth mallory the wife left at home my only criticism of the book is rideout's liberty with the character of mallory's brother trafford something she freely admits to in the book trafford is killed in world war i but in truth he was a highly decorated member of the raf who perished in world war ii rideout explains her reason for doing this was to bring home the tragedy of the men lost in the great war and its effect on the expedition however i would have preferred she invent another brother or find a different way to convey her point but this may just be my peccadillo a good read highly recommended","276":"really great novel about mallory's climb on everest last two chapters were page turners","277":"enjoyed it now i have to read more about mallory","278":"this is a very well written fiction book that is based on a true story about george mallory's fatal attempt to climb to the top of mt everest his wife and three childrenare at home waiting for news you feel her fear and terrible worry","279":"excellent read one of those books that is so descriptive that it stays with you for awhile","280":"i would have given it a 3 5 if i could have this is a historical novel based upon british explorer george mallary the story is told over the course of his final attempt to climb mt everest while simultaneously giving an insight to life thoughts of his wife left behind in england it was interesting and i'm glad the author gave a final true accounting in the epilogue","281":"if i could have given a half star this would've been a 2 5 because i liked about 50% of this book the story moved slowly and had a predictable outcome i'm also not terribly interested in female characters who spend the majority of their time pining over the men in their lives that said there are some redeeming qualities the descriptions of the process of mountaineering at the time are interesting as is the subtext of the war","282":" i gave this book three stars instead of four because i felt it was over written toward romance i don't believe a man would have written this story this way and i do not like novels in which you can tell just by the way they are written whether they have been written by a man or a woman george mallory was 37 when he lost his life attempting to climb mt everest in 1924 he was the man who said he wanted to climb a mountain because it was there his body was not found until 1999 and the body of the man with him andrew irvine has never been found this novel is about his third and final effort to climb the mountain in particular i did not care for the chapters from the point of view of mallory's wife if george mallory was obsessed with climbing mt everest his wife was obsessed with him their love for one another would have been better served if it hadn't been constantly shoved in my face on the other hand the interaction of the characters during the climb sequences and the descriptions of the effects of cold and lack of oxygen were so well written that i kept reading to the very end overall i'm glad i picked up this novel at my local library i'm left wondering what kind of man was george mallory truly i knew nothing of him before now i would like to know more he comes off as somewhat self obsessed as well as obsessed with the mountain perhaps all such heroic types are that way he certainly was an intriguing fellow","283":" this is a fictional account of what may have happened on the mt everest expedition when george mallory made his 3rd attempt to reach the summit in 1924 climbing a mountain like this in sub sub zero temperatures is not something i could ever desire to do myself or have any one i love do this however this story was still very intriguing for me this mallory guy seemed to have a death wish in making these attempts but he really thought he could do it mallory's body was found on the mountain many years later after he was given up as lost i think this author did a great job in making this expedition an interesting read i felt at times that i was right there with the group as they made camp each night couldn't feel their fingers and their muscles ached beyond comprehension the mountain scenes were very graphic making me feel the cold u0026amp misery that these guys faced great read","284":"i lost interest halfway through i already knew the ending so it felt like a pointless tedious read","285":"very exciting read the title is very appropriate due to mr mallory's disregard for all other things in his life especially his family to be the first person to conquer mt everest too bad he had to bring along mr irvine","286":"fictional account of george mallory's third attempt at climbing mt everest and the wife and three children fact he left behind","287":"i went into this book not knowing that it was based upon a true story i think that added to my enjoyment of it it has always interested my this fascination with everest and to combine that with the first expeditions i was hooked juxtaposed in the story are the tales of george who feels the need to conquer the mountain and his wife how does one be married to a man that loves not only her but an object we read their love story positioned with such grace within each of the protagonists we see ruth so stoic and brave on the outside but yet on the inside she is a mess i mean really if it is another woman you are competing with things would be different right but what if that competition comes from a quest that you don't understand i found myself alternating between hope that he would make the climb and conquer his beast and hoping that he would realize what is important is sitting at home waiting for him the author did a great job of imposing learned information from recovering george's body and researching effects of altitude the hallucination sequences fit into everything i have read although we will never know the outcome the pages of this book are realistic","288":"engrossing the chapters detailing mallory's climb are hypnotic it probably helped that i didn't know the stories or the myths surrounding this expedition but i found the mallory chapters utterly convincing and absorbing i felt i was there on the mountain oxygen deprived my muscles screaming ruth's dinner party is absolutely perfect her final chapter heartbreaking","289":" i have to admit that climbing mount everest has never been something that i wanted to do or had an interest in starting this book i had no background or information on mountain climbing within the first couple chapters i was hooked i could not put it down ruth was an interesting to me as george was seeing how ruth dealt with being left behind yet again and raising her three young children kept me entertained george's adventures on the mountains kept me on the edge of my seat i had to know if he would get to the next camp would he make it through the night fighting off frostbite and most importantly would he make it to the summit above all things was a slow read i did find myself having to go back and re read a page or paragraph and having to page back to see exactly whose memory i was reading i didn't feel like the words were always smoothly written but yet i could not put the book down by the time george was making the final push to make it to the summit i loved this book and knew i would definitely share and recommend this book while there is romance there is so much more to this book i truly feel that men and women alike will truly enjoy reading this story","290":"i enjoyed reading the two books as a work woven together i doubt either story stand alone would have been as captivating the story alternates between george mallory and his wife ruth in preparation for and through his expedition to everest in 1924 the letters tied the chapters together as well as reflections on past memories together i thought the story was sweet and really showed the sacrifices that those early explorers had to make for king and country","291":"enjoyed the book the author did a good job of writing from ruth and george's perspective","292":" i have read non fiction accounts of george mallory and his attempts to climb mt everest so i was already familiar with a basic knowledge of his story alternating chapters between the expedition and george's young wife at home with her three children added an additional element to the story there were times when i was getting a little frustrated with the slow pace at various times in the novel but than things would pick up and become interesting again the author's strength in writing was most ably displayed in the scenes of the deprivations that the men experienced during the climb i also enjoyed reading about how his wife was coping at home i would have given this novel a higher rating except that i found a few historical inconsistencies that i could not overlook this book will appeal to those who find adventure stories fascinating or to those who have an interest in climbing","293":"i liked it description the paris wife meets into thin air in this breathtaking debut novel of obsession and divided loyalties which brilliantly weaves together the harrowing story of george mallory's ill fated 1924 attempt to be the first man to conquer mount everest with that of a single day in the life of his wife as she waits at home in england for news of his return","294":"really liked this book even though i pretty much knew what the outcome would be i rooted for the characters throughout","295":"i love love loved this book thank you so much to the goodreads first reads program for sending me and arc of this book it was one of the best books i have read in a long time this was a fictional account of the mallory everest expedition of 1924 and is historically accurate as far as i am aware apart from the ending as we do not really know what happened to mallory and irvine and a few smaller facts the author admits to changing in her afterward i found it gripping from the first page and had a hard time putting the book down despite knowing how it ends what i especially liked since i liked everything about this book these are the highlights tthe characters - each was developed perfectly the relationships were explored and intertwined you felt a part of the story i felt the emotions each character was feeling and the descriptions of events they were dealing with were exceptional i felt connected to the characters i obviously do not know much about these people in real life as they are all real people but i felt that their personalities and actions were believable and accurate based on my knowledge ti love when books switch between character views and i think this was one of the best examples of this style of writing i have ever read the detailed descriptions and emotions of the everest expedition were offset by the longing and grief of mallory's wife back home part adventure part heart wrenching tragedy tthe pace of this book was never to slow or fast the plot moved a long at just the right speed - more quickly while following the expedition and more slowly while following mallory's wife during her day","296":"i couldn't put this book down despite knowing the outcome i love reading about everest adventurers and this did not disappoint i also appreciated the intermediary goings on of his family left at home","297":"i had read a little about mallory in a previous book but i didn't know the story around him and his adventures so the ending was a surprise for me i enjoyed this story of fiction with historical facts it's perfectly showing the struggle of him on mountains and his wife being left well done","298":"if writing a novel can be compared in any sense to climbing mount everest then tanis rideout has clearly summited on her first attempt in her creation of above all things","299":"was just ok the sections on climbing everest were good but not really much different than into thin air","300":"tanis rideout's debut historical novel imagines adventurer george mallory's third and fatal attempt to summit mount everest from the point of view of george his climbing partner sandy and his wife ruth at home in cambridge lyrically beautiful and profound as well as masterfully researched this novel should appeal to fans of historical fiction and adventure stories i have seen countless television documentaries depicting everest expeditions but this book brought the beauty and horror of a climb to life in a way i didn't understand before i look forward to reading more from ms rideout in the future","301":"i really liked the beginning couldn't put it down the middle was so so and i liked the end a heartbreaking tale of one mans quest to climb mt everest in the 1920's no one had ever achieved it and he wanted to be that first one","302":"a nice addition to the mt everest historical fiction genre this traces the 3rd and last attempt of george mallory to be the first to climb the mountain in the early 1920's both from his viewpoint and that of his wife left at home with their three children nowadays people are tweeting and skyping from the mountain back then it might take months for a letter to arrive and you wouldn't know if the person was even still alive by the time you got it well researched and well written","303":"gut wrenching","304":"i loved this book i love everest history and the historical story in the book was very good and paired with the romantic side of ruth's voice it was even better loved it wish it never ended","305":"this book was incredible it pulled me in from the very beginning climbing mountains is not something i know much about and i admit i was a bit unsure if i would like it the story bounces between two points of view that of george mallory who is on his third attempt to summit everest and his wife ruth who has to maintain their family and home while he goes off on his mountain adventures the parts dealing with climbing the mountain were of the most interest to me the author goes into great detail about how difficult physically and mentally it is to climb mountains the details of what happens to the mind and body when deprived of oxygen was frightening and to know that these summit attempts were made at a time when equipment was primitive the parts from ruth's point of view were much slower but i think that was the point george was off on adventures in the himalayas and she was left at home with three children and a whole nation waiting for word of her husband's fate telegrams and letters were the only method of communication and those were often delayed for months it must have been unbearable not knowing if your husband was alive or dead above all things has sparked a curiosity in me about everest and i now plan to seek out some non fiction accounts of summit attempts i highly recommend this book i received an advanced reader copy of this book from librarything","306":" engrossing read author reimagines the relationship between george mallory and his wife ruth based on the letters between them over their marriage and the events around the third attempt to climb mount everest it deals with that period post wwi that shattered culture and created who in literature are known as the 'lost generation' those scarred by a brutal war and endless death and the search for meaning and accomplishment england had a history of great explorers men who risked all to accomplish things thought of as near impossible men who risked life to push the frontiers of knowledge and the limits of mans capacity the author captures the emotions of the men that went on these expeditions and the wives and families that they left behind while i knew the outcome the novel was so well crafted that i hoped against my fore knowledge that mallory wold succeed and return to ruth and the children he loved their letters to each other are moving and speak to a relationship that tanis rideout so beautifully fleshed out","307":" tanis rideout really made me feel what it might be like on mt everest a place i will never visit george mallory's obsession to be the first to summit is palpable his wife ruth stands by her man she loves him even if she doesn't truly understand his drive i have a very hard time understanding this need to climb a mountain just because it is there a man who is so focused on his need to be the first to reach the top of the world's tallest mountain he puts that need in front of wife and family i thought george was an a$$hole","308":"loved it really well done","309":"this is a very good debut novel about george mallory's ill fated third expedition to everest there is obviously a lot about the climb itself in here but the bulk of the story concerns the relationship between mallory and his wife ruth we get some insight into her thoughts on her husband leaving for a third time to attempt an impossible feat this was slow at first but i couldn't put it down after about 75 pages in the ending is magnificently done","310":"i enjoyed this novel very much it is a moving account of the final climb of george mallory told in the alternating voices of ruth and george using the letters they wrote to each other has a guide and backdrop the author nicely weaves their story using rich language and imagery nicely done","311":" above all things by tanis rideout is a historical fiction account of george mallory's 1924 attempt to climb mt everest it is still not known if mallory's attempt was successful or not in 1924 mountaineer george mallory and his team tried to conquer mt everest in no small part to give the war weary people of england something to cheer about mallory's wife ruth is at cambridge england restlessly awaiting his return from the dangerous expedition above all things by tanis rideout is an excellent novel which moves at two speeds slow ruth mallory and fast george mallory ms rideout succeeded in creating an engaging book filled with excellent descriptions and believable characters the parts which i found the most fascinating were the climb on mt everest the author does not romanticized the climb i could feel the chills the heaviness and other ailments which come at being at such a high altitude ms rideout brilliantly juxtaposes between mr mallory's celebrated climb and only a day in the life of mrs mallory you could not help but feel the helplessness of the couple as they missed craved and thought about each other but were still supportive from afar to the acute reader many intricate details are provided without bringing the story to a grinding halt while providing beautiful descriptions of the everest expedition while going into the mind of the climbers the story is contrasted with mr mallory's obsession with the mountain and his family while being unable to merge them both this is an interesting book to discuss the story is multilayered the narrative is poetic and the action is exciting i don't know much about mountain climbing or mr mallory's history but i couldn't find any glaring mistakes which took away from my enjoyment of the story for more reviews and bookish posts please visit http www manoflabook com","312":"great book about early british explorers to mt evert","313":" when my wife brought this novel home i thought well we knew this guy i took one look at the cover and read the flap copy and said hmmm once the book got started i could not put it down george mallory was a great hero of the day the nasa space explores of their time after surviving world war i falling love with his soul mate he still needed to bring on the challenges his adventure is viewed from both his experiences and his wife's a touching story that we knew how it ended highly recommended","314":"loved this book","315":"i liked the wife's chapters but found the husband's chapters a bit repetitive and quickly lost interest in the mount everest storyline the ending seemed to be a bit of a letdown and i wish that the romance between will and the wife had been explored in the book","316":"a tragic love story","317":"i liked the storyline and historical element of the everest trek but found it very slow moving and un engaging something was lacking in the author's ability to write passion fear or any emotion so didn't grip me the way i felt it could have","318":"a novelization of the failed or was it 1924 mallory expedition to everest i enjoyed it it put a more human face on mallory and spent equal time looking at his wife's situation and the challenge of waiting for him despite knowing how the story ends i thought it was worthwhile","319":"good book not sure why anyone climbs everest but i keep reading about them for some answers anyway do not google george mallory until you've finished this book","320":"neat book took me a bit to figure out that things were actually getting a little less coherent as he climbs up the mountain once i figured out it was not just me it was really fun a bit lovey dovey","321":" i really enjoyed this book i feel like i felt everything that the characters felt i liked the pov that mallory's story was over the course of a period of time and his wife's was that of one day i am in awe of the people who want to climb everest but i also feel angry over the lost of life on the everest facebook page they list of number of fatalities and the sheer number of people doing the climb they need to be more restrictive of who can go there are too many amateurs with a lot of money to afford it also the garbage that gets left behind i find annoying such a rugged and pristine environment to be littered like that but i do love books about everest 'into thin air' was great i will definitely read more from the comfort of my reading chair rather than the harsh environment of everest","322":" excellent - brings you to a vividly imagined moment the only thing pulling me back is i'd wished i'd written it the intermix between reality and the character's thoughts perception is beautiful and seamlesslydone which just heightens the sense of \"being there\" and makes it more credible even when you know rideout's narrative rope is really run out far beyond her last solid anchor of fact her voices are profoundly distinct and feel accurate this is such a powerful book that i hope it does not become fact that the fiction only keeps the imagination open to what may have been happened mallory was not in the trenches he was an artillery officer even though the scenes rideout imagines are credible and useful to thecharacter's motivation of guild about world war i and brilliantly ties into mallory's repulsion ofan oxygen mask as a reminder of a gas mask i trust this tale will not solidify his image since thiswas a minor divergence but it could have repercussions likewise i hope rideout is not criticized for stabbing at this - that is the rope of fiction - and what she has done is brave and bold and we need more of it she perfectly nails the period's zeitgeist regarding duty and empire and senseless loss after the great war draws the others on the expedition with enough of a cold clear eye that they seem human and you know you'd grow to hate them on an expedition too couped up together but you know you'd also drink beer with them months later and laugh and love them perfectly human rideout has many talents and knowing her characters and bringing them out on the page is one of her greatest favorite passages p85 para 5\"of course when we were first married you would climb the wall beneath the loggia at the holt and pounce on me \" i didn't say how much i missed it \"when you come back don't ever use the door again \"p171 para 2i had meant the tea set for george a gift for when he returned from everest the first time painting them was a task to keep me occupied during his months away i started them the week he left and agonized over them hoping for uniform perfection on each piece there is the faintest line of a mountain in green against a grey blue background somehow after they'd been fired they'd seemed to delicate for george he sees the world in grand views sweeping vistas in bold archetypes where everything is clear right and wrong duty and disregard not me i am always too distracted by tiny details - the warm pressure of will's hand on my back as he walked me up the stairs the feel of a name in my mouth p177 para 3when i was small i imagined love as something safe something without sharp edges only the sweeping enveloping curves of romance and happiness but it isn't not now anyway there are edges and they cut p207 para 3once upon a time i think the world must have been flat it was our minds that made it round our desire to circumnavigate it our desire to leave home certainly but just as strongly our desire to return but in making it round we crumpled it up pulling apart in places crushing it together in others thrusting them up into the atmosphere bullying the deserts the tundra the plains into george's beloved mountains peaks that stretch up from the rest of the world","323":" this is a fictional version of george mallory's climb on mt everest it is set as a love story between george and his wife ruth there are some touching love scenes and anxious stories of george on the mountain climb the story could be touching but slight i felt this george and ruth mallory could be many other fictional characters who befall a misadventure in a great effort to break a record last year i read into the void a nonfictional account of mallory's 3 attempts at climbing everest the book didn't climb into their minds like a fictional book does but i got a much better sense of who george mallory and ruth mallory were as well as the climb's fellow travelers and ruth's journeys to be as close as possible to george during his climb sometimes fiction flattens people out into a generic depiction and it is nonfiction which draws the reader in","324":" i read this book for my contemporary literature class at the institute of adult learning at chesapeake community college the theme for this semester was quests the book has to do with george mallory's final attempt to be the first person to climb mount everest the story of the climb is juxtaposed with the story of one day in the life of mallory's wife as she waits to hear news of her husband half a world away it brings up the question of obsession and if a person has the right to follow that obsession if he has a family what i particularly found compelling was the description of the mental condition of the climbers as they reached the summit without oxygen and in extreme cold another aspect of the book is great personal sadness for me since it was the last book i read for this class it will no longer be offered due to the poor health of the teacher phyllis ralph i will miss her and the class and the other participants the combination of intelligence and life experience always brought unthought of aspects to any book for me and on more than one occasion changed my mind entirely we had an excellent run","325":"the description says this is the paris wife meets into thin air i did not read the paris wife but this book in no way shape or form comes close to into thin air i could only get through 50% of the book mallory's wife comes across as a moping can't do anything while my husband is away for six months but think about when he will be back and mallory just comes across as a jerk end of story","326":"rideout's depiction of george mallory's pioneer ascent up everest allows readers to feel the thrill of the climb without paying the agonizing cost of the reality i felt the chill settle in my own bones as the oxygen thinned and the timing became critical however whole chapters should have been cut the adrenaline of the expedition was interrupted by the chapters which switched the scene to mallory's melancholy and boring wife waiting in london i began to skip those chapters entirely and lost nothing the only place ruth's story is relevant is at the conclusion of the novel even novice climbers know that less is often more for what you choose to pack on a climb","327":" the paris wife meets into thin air in this breathtaking debut novel of obsession and divided loyalties which brilliantly weaves together the harrowing story of george mallory's ill fated 1924 attempt to be the first man to conquer mount everest with that of a single day in the life of his wife as she waits at home in england for news of his return a captivating blend of historical fact and imaginative fiction above all things moves seamlessly back and forth between the epic story of mallory's legendary final expedition and a heartbreaking account of a day in the life of ruth mallory through george's perspective and that of the newest member of the climbing team sandy irvine we get an astonishing picture of the terrible risks taken by the men on the treacherous terrain of the himalaya but it is through ruth's eyes that a complex portrait of a marriage emerges one forged on the eve of the first world war shadowed by its losses and haunted by the ever present possibility that george might not come home the main reason i picked this up was because it was one of the winter penguin selects in other words their marketing ploy worked and when i couldn't get a review copy i bought a copy of above all things and it was very good one thing i really liked was the fact that george's narration and ruth's narration are told very differently george narrates in a somewhat impersonal third tone past tense whereas ruth's story is told in first person present tense this makes the reader identify a lot more with ruth one feels that they're actually there with her experiencing what she's experiencing ruth is of course the character that we sympathize with more i can see where george's passion for climbing mt everest comes from but he's really selfish i could really see through the narration how much he cared about climbing everest how that really was the most important part of his life no matter how much he loved ruth you can also see what he's doing to ruth how she can't function at all while he's away how she just sits there worrying wasting away i loved the historical details in the book as some say details sell the story and this story is sold because of the details it also had great characters although at times they were a little flat the writing was wonderful though it wasn't quite as good as mary coin another penguin select but i did really enjoy it some parts did drag a little in the middle a fate that often befalls many books one thing that was really confusing in above all things was that often the characters would have flashbacks and they weren't really clear i would be confused about what was happening in the present and what was being recollected george would flash back to his trip to new york ruth to when they first met and vice versa flashbacks are an easy but effective way to communicate back stories to the reader but they could have been written a lot more clearly however without the flashbacks the novel would have felt much flatter and less developed the cover of above all things was also really hideous and the uk edition wasn't much better i'm not even quite sure what it's supposed to be although looking back i can kind of see that the woman is both a woman presumably ruth and the mountain it's not the most aesthetically pleasing but it is rather clever above all things was an excellent work of historical fiction much better than the paris wife i would highly recommend it it was compelling and definitely worth reading although i don't love it www novareviews blogspot com","328":"this was close to my idea of a perfect book historical fiction paired with a mt everest story i'm still sad it's over","329":"see our full review over at bookkaholic the story of george mallory's fatal obsession with mount everest with historical gaps filled in by the imagination he tries not once not twice but three times to conquer the mountain leaving a wife and three small children behind for months at a time the novel mainly focuses on that crucial final attempt in 1924 it is beautifully written at times too flowery gripping and suspenseful even though the ending is well known","330":"an excellent read it keeps you interested throughout i quite enjoyed flipping back and forth between a day in the life at home and the trek up the mountain a great example of obsession and more interesting that it was based on real events i feel that i've learned a bit about mountain climbing as well as a little lesson in history looking at current climbs and findings was especially fun after reading this book","331":"i give this book a 4 5 5","332":"i just wasn't ever captivated by it the writing and the story seemed nice enough but reading always felt like a chore i think it moved along too alowly for me the parts i was excited to read were few and far between maybe this will go on the try again later in life shelf","333":"ii find the story of mallory and everest fascinating so reading this was enjoyable for me i liked the way the author fleshed out ruth mallory giving her a voice and feelings using their own letters was a nice touch giving you a glimpse of what they were thinking how they felt about each other much more so than mallory's pithy remark because it's there","334":"i really liked this book except the concurrent stories of george mallory preparing for his final and fatal attempt to climb everest and a day in the life of his wife ending with her learning of his death was very well handled and i enjoy the fictionalized aspect conversations etc that may or may not have happened except in the author's imagination but i was disappointed at the end to learn how much liberty the author had taken with established fact early in the book we are told that george's brother trafford was killed in wwi and the impact this had on his entire family but he didn't die till 1944 i don't mind a fictionalized version when that fiction actually could have happened i would have given this book 5 stars except for that","335":"i found the topic of mallory's last climb to mt everest to be very interesting i agree with others who have posted that being written from ruth's perspective did not add anything to the story and that sandy's andrew irvine character could have been more developed","336":"a gem from start to end well researched and paced with an expertise that surpasses what you usually find from a debut novelist told with excitement but never melodrama and moving emotional sensitivity that is never saccharine with the inevitable ending drawing closer each page even as the reader hopes for a different one i will be recommending this book all over the place when it comes out and looking forward for future ones from the author","337":" as a girl my favorite times were spent backpacking in the rockies and shortly after college i discovered a book by edmund hillary's wife and was entranced by the idea of mountain climbers since then i've read the few books on climbers i could find most notably into thin air several times and i love reading about women and history so this book was a no brainer choice for me lovely cover too stunning really this is clearly fictionalized history and though there's an author's note explaining some of her choices i wanted more did mallory really tear out the last page of the books his wife read were ruth's and the children's personalities based on fact or fancy there isn't enough informatin here to let us know so most of it has to be read as fiction still it's well done and feels realistic it might offend some modern readers that mallory's wife is depicted as rather helpless but again it fits the times and feels real to me opposites often attract so it makes sense that a man as driven and decisive as he might marry a woman who is less so and it was a different time for women than it is now the book alternates between the men on the climb and mallory's wife in england they really are two very different stories one is about what it's like to be left behind to be the person who holds the marriage family together the one who always looses out to the mountain the author does a good job showing her frustration loneliness anger and fear as well as love the other story is the climb oxygen deprivation competing egos the drive that pushes them to almost inhuman lengths all that is well done too it's tricky to write a book that moves between two very different lives giving equal weight to both generally it works better to have one be primary i'm not convinced that these two story lines mesh really well into one book for example there was no way the dinner party could balance the final attempt to reach the top of everest i read through several party chapters and then went back to the final attempt s and liked it much better that way too much jumping away from the more compelling story only frustrates me ultimately this is one good book that could have been two amazing books still i liked it a lot and recommend it to anyone who's even mildly interested in mountain climbing stories or books about women in difficult relationships","338":"great historical fiction i was fascinated by george mallory his attempts at climbing everest and the time period of world war i even after i finished it late one night i found myself on line looking for more details about mallory and his wife ruth i would say it is in the same league as paris wife and aviator's wife this is a great year for world war i fiction and non fiction","339":"even though i knew the ending i was mesmerized by this book a powerful personal portrait of both george and ruth mallory and his ill fated last attempt to conquer mt everest kudos to the author for putting me there so skillfully may tanis rideout write many more books","340":"beautifully written but duty seems to be different for men than it is for women duty is something men step inside and fasten around them like uniforms for women duty is a cloak draped over us that weighs us down page 262","341":"couldn't get this book done in the 14 day limit or the 21 day limit bc i renewed it but it just wasn't exciting enough for me to want to continually pick it up i will try it again later but for now moving on to something different","342":" three word review romantic disjointed slow while i liked reading above all things i don't think it's a stand out book or one that i will really think much about again the characters of george and ruth really held the book together the narrative felt flaky but the well developed characters really drove it along and made me want to keep reading you can really feel the connection between george and ruth and understand how in love they are their children too have very sweet personalities and george's climbing team were also very well written each with their own distinct nature i liked that the chapters alternated between george and ruth thus keeping a balance between them they had separate voices which suited their characters helped by george talking in third person and ruth in first however i didn't like how rideout played with time throughout the book george went through weeks - maybe months - but ruth only through one day this didn't seem very natural and bugged me increasingly so as it neared the climax and time felt so uneven i also disliked the points in george's chapters when the narrative switched to george's climbing partner sandy the book to me was about love and the intertwined lives of george and ruth sandy felt like an unnecessary third wheel whose life i didn't really care about and who seemed to be getting in the way of the supposed hero perhaps my hopes were too high for this book reading the synopsis i felt excited the 1920s in my mind a glamourous decade maybe because i just watched gatsby the setting too on everest sounded exciting and adventurous however when i read it i couldn't connect with the story with george's expedition interspersed every few pages were flashbacks and memories while these did build complex characters it also broke the flow of the story and detracted from the excitement and building tension i didn't want random paragraphs of information about their last ten years i wanted adventure as a result of the disjointed narrative i didn't feel as though i was on everest with george or in cambridge with ruth i think the book would've been enriched by rideout explaining more about how everest looked and what it was like to be there so that i could better imagine what george and his team were going through the detail and factual knowledge were there just not necessarily in the right places above all things was readable and enjoyable at the time but didn't come without its annoyances i was so desperate to enjoy it but i couldn't it's worth a read if you're interested in 1920s culture and history it seemed pretty factually accurate but it was nothing amazing i'm going to give it 54% thinking back over it all my mind says is \"it was okay\" nothing special or exciting this review was originally posted on my blog http anabundanceofkathryn blogspot","343":"this is a brillant first fiction novel by tanis rideout i admire tanis rideout research about mount everest i recommend it to every one who likes history made into fiction stories this would be a good choice for book clubs to have an open discussion about if you liked reading this then you may like to read city of women by david gillham about the height of 1943 berlin world war two","344":"in general i enjoyed this book i would have enjoyed more of ruth's story the expedition was very interesting but at times i felt it was dragging on and on i suppose the climbers felt that way too wanting the weather to clear so they could get back to the task at hand i felt the transition to flashbacks and or sandy's voice were sometimes very abrupt and i had to backtrack a couple of paragraphs to get my bearings","345":"i was eager to read this one based on all the five star ratings here however the narrative was a bit disjointed it definitely passed the time but i kept waiting for it to really pull me in never happened if you want a point of comparison watch the wildest dream an account of george mallory's climbing attempts and his relationship with his wife ruth you can really see how underdeveloped these beautiful characters were this could have been an amazing story","346":"started off slow and i didn't want to finish it but it ended up being one of my favorite books i have never had any interest in mountain climbing and still don't but i sure learned a lot from this book about climbing and about what drives people to the tops of mountains the greatest question this book considers is are you successful if you reached the summit but didn't make it back down safely","347":" i loved this story very much but at the same time i did not like the writing style at all i don't regret reading it and i think it is a book i would want on my shelf at home fortunately i did not know the story of george mallory before reading it which makes it all the better because you don't know the outcome because of this i really liked the piece at the end explaining which parts were real and which were made up the descriptions the author gave during the strenuous parts of the climb actually made me feel a little out of breath they were perfect not too technical but real enough to have a sense of what the climbers were going through i think i'm going to consider reading a non fiction book on mallory but the writing style drove me crazy on a high level the narrator changes throughout the book from ruth george and sandy i would say that about 85% of this is not current but their internal thoughts about the past the problem is that it switches so frequently that i had to keep going back a few sentences to figure out that it had changed and what was going on on top of this some of the narration is internal thinking vs hallucinating which of course happens more and more towards the end so you really have to focus on this lastly when ruth is narrating it goes back and forth between he thinking to herself vs directing the thinking directly to george as if writing a letter to him in her head the worst was when a flashback actually happened inside of a flashback the concept was good but it was just too confusing and got in the way of a truly good story oh and i meant to add that if you read this be sure to go back and read the two quotes from the intro when you are done as they become so much more meaningful","348":"received as an arc via my employer barnes u0026amp noble it's a fictional account of george because it's there mallory's 3rd attempt to climb to the summit of mt everest in 1924 the chapters alternate between him and his team on the mountain and his wife and children at home he loved 2 women in his life everest and ruth unfortunately everest won or better he lost them both i found myself reading faster as i got toward the end of the book even though i knew how this adventure would end so sad","349":" just when you think you have everything figured out in this story the author throws you for a loop the story is first and foremost a story about struggling with a disability the small things most people take for granted are shown from another viewpoint that of a man who is paralyzed from the chest down how do you deal with things such as an itch or getting a drink my heart broke so many times while reading this story there are times when i had to stop reading because the story hit too close to home however the love and laughter that the characters embraced brought hope this is a must read for everyone just don't expect a typical ending or you will be disappointed the ending was what truly brought tears to my eyes and yet a ray of hope was also there","350":"i had some quibbles with the way the book was written the verb tenses seemed a bit erratic does a person really say to himself the air was cold in the past tense the beginning was a bit rocky but the climbing sequences were excellent especially the episodes when the people became oxygen starved and hallucinated each according to the story of his own life i wasn't sure exactly how it would end altho i knew it wouldn't be good when it was done i had to look up the story of mallory's climbing and then find out what happened to his family i looked up pictures of everest i am afraid of heights so this book was scary but engaging interweaving the climbing story with the story of ruth was quite good it prompted so many questions about why people do hellishly difficult things in the end mallory had to decide whether to go for it even tho it was really too late in the day everyone who knew him said he wouldn't have thought twice if he was near the summit he would have gone for it it was his nature and his wife his son john grew up and said his mother never coddled them she took them mountain climbing for fun","351":"beautifully written","352":"this one was a slow starter for me however the second half of the book held my interest and propelled me to up my rating by 1 star great for those interested in mountaineering","353":"this was a very interesting book it's a novel but based on george mallory's ascent or was it to mount everest in the 1920's as seen from his point of view but also from his wife's point of view i enjoyed it a lot","354":"i found some passages very beautifu","355":"i couldn't put this book down the blurb on the cover promised a tragic adventure story which sounds ominous and there is a certain amount of dread hanging over the whole thing but this book is full of beauty and suspense too the name george mallory sounded sort of kind of familiar before i picked up above all things but i knew nothing about him and frankly little enough about mount everest before reading this fictionalized account of his 1924 attempt to be the first to the summit his personality good and bad leaped off the pages and i almost understood his reasoning for leaving his wife and children for months at a time to climb the chapters told from ruth's perspective certainly aren't as full of life and death as his are but they held my attention in short this story is the type of book i read historical fiction for i felt like i was there on the mountain with the expedition it took a little piece of history i was completely unfamiliar with and made it come alive and i appreciated the author's note at the back of the book where she owned up to what parts of the story were historically inaccurate and gave a list of nonfiction books for further reading i've already started to track some of those down and i recognized the photo of george and ruth that is described in the book the instant i saw it","356":" above all things by tanis rideout i i won this book through goodreads the author gave a good and realistic discription of the climb to everest i felt part of the expedition she brought out the thoughts of the climber and his family feeling back home he wanted his family to be proud of him that he was successful in the climb there were choices to continue or go back down the mountain and try again in better weather his family recalls the plans they had made for their future as a family the climbers were afraid when they had only one day remaining to reach the summit the summit was reached but they fell on the way down it was a good book","357":" take this review with a grain of salt i gave up after 100 pages it just didn't grab me i love stories of mount everest but this was terrible ruth is a whiny wimpy woman that drove me crazy i couldn't decide if george was arrogant self righteous or a good guy in 100 pages he was all three besides that this book can't decide what it is is it z love story an adventure on mount everest it's told from three perspectives which got to be a bit much i find the story of george mallory fascinating but this isn't the book for me i rarely give up on a book but if at 100 pages it hadn't grabbed me yet i give up","358":"interesting read about ruth and george mallory and his 3 and final expedition to climb mount everest written from her point of view first person and his story 3rd person back and forth hers takes place in one day and his is over a period of time ruth's day is quiet compared to the high drama of george's a bit long but enjoyable","359":"really good insight into the mentality and hardships endured by those involved in climbing mt everest and the descriptions of the actual climb made me wince with phantom aches and cold chills just from reading them bravo","360":"fabulous book fiction based on the unsuccessful everest attempt by george mallory in the 1920's i could really get a sense of the extremely difficult physical challenges given the equipment available at the time the book also portrayed very well the emotional side of climbing how driven these early explorers were and the agonies that the families and loved ones left behind went through","361":"great writing from another penguin book but the story was super slow in my opinion i really wanted to like this book as i like most if not all penguin books in general perhaps i'm not a fan of mountain climbing but the story did not hold my attention and it was a struggle to finish the writing is top notch but the story just didn't gel with me","362":" i had read a lot about sir edmund hillary and his conquering of mt everest but this is the story of another lesser known climber and his wife his name is george mallory also an upper class british man who is driven to conquer that mountain the story is told from two perspectives his on the mountain and his wife's as she waits for word back home flashbacks and oxygen deprived imaginings help to piece together their relationship before his momentous climb there are a couple slow spots with a little too much climbing detail but these are forgotten quickly and as story is a captivating one that will not let you go well worth reading","363":"i enjoyed this book about george mallory's ill fated final attempt to scale everest particularly the scenes towards the end describing his last desperate push towards the summit the scenes written from the perspective of his long suffering wife ruth left in cambridge to anxiously await his return were less successful for me at first it's hard not to feel a bit bored when you were reading about an exciting mountaineering expedition and suddenly find yourself sitting on the floor of george's study with ruth listlessly sorting through papers and worrying about why the servants don't seem to like you but i did feel that ruth became a more sympathetic character as the book went on and by the end i was fully invested in her story as well as george's i really appreciated that rideout has an author's note in which she describes some of the liberties she took with history which includes at least one pretty big alteration i was disappointed though that when she says you can visit her website for a further discussion of fact versus fiction she doesn't mean that she goes into further detail about her approach to mallory's story instead there's a short general essay on her website about the role of fact versus fiction in historical novels not really what i wanted","364":"i loved this book b c i love all things everest and this included so much more than just a climbing history really nice to read during this heat wave","365":"fascinating story of a man's passion for climbing and his determination to ascend mt everest while his wife waits for him back in england i couldn't put this book down based on real people","366":" this review and others can be found on cozy up with a good readwhat a story tanis has given readers with above all things i really enjoyed where she went with this story and appreciate the amount of work it must have taken her to research what happened to george mallory the way tanis brought to life the story of george and ruth was beautiful enchanting and very emotional this is the story of love and the power to be strong being the one left behind i really loved how tanis chose to write the story in many different perspectives she chose to show how this mountain affected so many different people each person has a different thought about what their experiences with this mountain will be like readers see how the mountain takes over george's life and how all he thinks about is being able to get to the top so that he can go home and be with his family without having to think about something that could have been the we have sandy irvine who is the newest member of the team he believes that he will be part of history and yet he continually gets left behind while the more experienced climbers trudge ahead ruth's story really affected me during my reading of this book as much as i know george and sandy had a difficult journey so did ruth she was the one who had to sit and wait for her husband and explain to her children why he kept leaving again and again i loved the emotion brought out in this book as we follow ruth`s struggles to be on her own and watch her husband continually leave to pursue this very difficult task of climbing mount everest tanis rideout has an interesting story that you can tell as you delve deeper took a lot of time and effort to research everything that happened her characters are very realistic and their emotions pour out of the pages of this book and readers really get to see how not achieving one's goal can really affect their lives the characters all go after what they believe in and are willing to risk everything for that one taste of success","367":"beautifully written","368":"above all things is a fine entry to the emerging 'wives of the famous'genre already populated by the paris wife and the avaitor's wife it tells the story of british climber george malory and his wife ruth alternating between malory's attempt at everest and ruth back home rideout's skill builds tension even if you know what happens fans of historic fiction and explorer narratives will enjoy this work","369":"i liked it interesting and historical i feel smarter having read it i had to check online as soon as i finished to find out more three people died climbing everest while i was reading this book","370":"a well written first novel that i am glad i read","371":"heartbreakingly beautiful i could not put it down but the few times i did it was to find more books on everest i loved it so much i bought a hardcopy in addition to the copy on my ereader that's book love","372":"i thought this book was a little slow in the beginning but i was hooked when i started in on the last 50 pages i grew to be very attached to the story characters and felt they were real people and became very involved in their well being and happiness a very interesting take on one of everest's first mountaineers and the people around him","373":"i found the parts of this book that actually dealt with george mallory's third attempt to summit mt everest interesting even though it deviates sharply from what is reported to have actually happened on the expedition it is a novel though and who truly knows what happened in those last hours that mallory and irvine pushed for the summit alone ms rideout may have taken great liberties in filling in the blanks but showed educated imagination in doing so as long as people keep in mind that this is a novel and not a biography it can be enjoyably entertaining however the parts that covered his wife coping with his absence didn't do much for me i found them to be weak and tepid especially inserted as they were between the dramatic chapters about the everest climb","374":" the description of this book as being the paris wife meets into thin air is perfect i became a bit obsessed with everest after reading into thin air and then following that book with the climb by anatoli boukreev and left for dead my journey home from everest by beck weathers this novel based on a crazy amount of research and a vivid imagination was as compelling and descriptive as the personal ones i enjoyed so much i liked how rideout contrasted the excitement of george's pursuit of the summit with the mundane goings on of his wife ruth","375":"a really good read fictional account of british gentleman explorer george mallory who is believed to be the first man to conquer mount everest while the story talks about the experiences of george and the climbing party on the mountain it also brings to light the wife and family that george has left behind rideout invites the reader to see hero george through the eyes of ruth his wife and how life continues when he leaves for extended periods of time to pursue his passion and dream a well written text definitely worth reading","376":" loved this book i was resistant to reading it because i had read the author's note and knew how it ended i knew nothing about george mallory before this book but i was completely drawn in to both the expedition descriptions with the unfolding drama of mallory and his team on the mountain and the agony of the waiting back home for mallory's wife ruth the time period was brought vividly alive and the language in the book resonated beautifully it is a book i will read again and share with others","377":"meh think it could've been more interesting since it was based on historical facts of george mallory's climb to everest it just wasn't that engaging u0026amp a bit technical for people that have no experience in serious climbing she could've done so much more with the era of wwi and the emotions of the time too many other good books out there","378":"i loved this book it had a bit of a slow start but soon hooked me in i was even more intrigued by the time i reached the end about the parts of real history between the pages adventure and romance with a little drama and suspense great","379":" i finished the book which actually ended on page 377 i didn't think it was bad but it also wasn't amazing the book ended with george dying and ruth just was feeling even more pain throughout the book was a series of the main characters flashbacks sandy ruth and george i think that the flashbacks were meant to be there to show how george was leading himself to his death the third time he tried to climb the mountain he was reflecting on his life throughout the book and i think he was using these memories to give himself a reason to keep moving although somewhere deep down he knew he might not accomplish his goal george had been saying throughout the book that he wanted to reach the summit so he could go back home to ruth and stay with his kids but i think that that was just an excuse he was too obsessed with the mountain to even think about other people reaching the top before he did and because of that he got many people killed and he died himself i don't think it was fair for him to blame someone else for the fact that he decided to climb the mountain a third time because overall it was his choice and you were able to see how persistent he was ruth and the kids were just an excuse to get himself to the top and no matter how many times ruth told him to stay he made himself believe that reaching the top is what ruth wanted even on some of his last moments his thoughts were mainly on having to reach the top it can be seen that george loved ruth but that love wasn't as strong as his love for the mountain i didn't really understand sandy's role on the book i mean i'm thinking it was to tell the story of a 21 year old that isn't that experienced being able to climb up most of the mountain anyways but besides that i don't think he had such an important role i thought that ruth would have some sort of change and not think about how sad she is about georges departure for some while but it continued till the end of the book ruth was basically hanging on to the memories of george and it was basically the only thing she thought about even when she looked at her kids it was kind of interesting the read about her expressing her feelings for one to will but after that it remained the same the book had started with her being sad that he was alive and on the mountain and the book ended with her being sad about him dying on the mountain personally i don't know if i were to recommend the book but it was an okay book to read","380":"beautifully written a lovely lovely book","381":"although i have no interest whatsoever in mountain climbing i am fascinated by people who are willing to put their lives on the line for this sport tania rideout does a good job exploring the mindset of people eager to take on this challenge i gave it three stars because it's too slow moving to be completely engaging","382":"great love story and great adventure story i have a thing for post wwi england and a live of everest so this was right up my alley as much as you will be tempted do not google mallory beforehand","383":" why do people want to climb to the top of the highest mountain in the world in the words of george mallory who was interviewed in the early 1920's \"because it is there \" perhaps you have heard of george mallory and his third expedition to mt everest in 1924 perhaps not regardless author tanis rideout has produced a compelling story about the mystery of george mallory a british school teacher and student sandy irvine's disappearance on everest were they in fact the first climbers to ever reach the summit perhaps we will never know certainly this novel cannot answer that question with any certainty rather rideout chooses to explore the romance and human intricacies of this excursion through a superb combination of rich storytelling and historical records she attempts to help her readers understand how and why these early climbers tackled mt everest perhaps why climbers still flock to climb to the summit of this mountain peak woven in between is the story of ruth mallory home with their 3 children hoping beyond hope for george's safe return home this novel was written based on historical records of this ill fated trip it parallels the life and ambition of george mallory and the team that set out to climb everest - a mountain that virtually guarantees death altitude sickness and extreme weather battles it is the story of love loyalty and ambition through the eyes of mallory and the young student who accompanied him sandy irvine we come to understand the pull of the mountain and the high costs it extracts from those who make an attempt perhaps giving us a glimpse of the personalities needed to make the attempt in spite of the odds yes there have been a lot of books written about climbing everest however this author attempts to break new ground on the timeless story of struggle and focuses on the motivations of george mallory and his team to understand how these men could set out on this journey in clothing we canadians wouldn't consider nearly warm enough on an average winter day what could have possibly been enough motivation to climb through one of the most extreme weather zones in the world to answer that tanis rideout suggests that we need to look beyond mallory the family friends colleagues and postwar mindset for answers this was mallory's third attempt since 1920 london was reeling after the war and looking for something significant to help its citizens become more hopeful and proud again george mallory was fixated on climbing a mountain that had never been climbed successfully in a dire attempt to bring meaning to his life rideout shares the known facts about the mallory's' lives by reading between the lines of the love letters shared she adds a dose of imagined self talk as she slowly unravels this complex story by weaving history with fiction rideout manages to produce a compelling story about hope tenacity and adventure this is a great summer read for everest enthusiasts and those lured by a sense of romance intertwined with adventure after reading this i had to find the photos - i felt like i had truly gotten to know george mallory and his wife ruth and i felt grateful for the opportunity","384":"probably more of a 3 5 for me climbing mt everest in 1924 without oxygen and all the super gear that we have now seems more than daunting mallory tries multiple times you might say it conquers him his wife is left home with three children and little contact or news from the expedition how difficult can't imagine the support team and sherpas who carried supplies and set up tents great insight into a dangerous expedition","385":" this is a beautifully written wonderful book hard to believe it's tanis rideout's debut not only did i want to linger in these pages and know more but i found myself also racing to the end it's also a page turner the story of mallory's bid for everest has always captivated me and after reading this book i still want more everything you could ever want in an historical novel is here rideout's prose made me feel i was on the mountain with mallory and at home with his wife ruth as well you will be sorry if you miss this one i cannot praise this book enough","386":"liked the story but not the writing","387":"not my favorite everest book but it was definitely entertaining","388":"i made it through 100 pages of this book and am so so disappointed when i saw this book i thought it was a sure thing and yet i liked nothing about it with a special hatred of the completely limp lifeless whiny wife ugh if you're looking for a much better historical fiction telling of the george mallory story read jeffrey archer's paths of glory","389":"excellent combined historical fiction with an outdoor adventure story it was a very suspenseful read for me because i didn't know the story of george mallory or what happened to him on his climb","390":" this was interesting enough the expedition and trekking part of the book was intruiging as it is something i haven't read about before and it was fascinating how these adventurers did what they did without all the whizz bang technology we have these days the to ing and fro ing between the home front and the expedition made a nice break in the tense atmosphere of the trek and whilst that part of the book didn't seem to go anywhere and was more like filler it was much needed otherwise you'd be fairly tense the whole way through the book","391":" my husband gave me this book figuring i'd enjoy reading a fictional treatment of george mallory's doomed ascent of mt everest normally i would i enjoy reading books about exploration and adventure unfortunately this work blended the expedition story with a melodrama regarding mallory's relationship with his wife i'm not a fan of romance novels even when they are well written and the opening chapter had me flipping back to the cover to see if there wasn't a picture of fabio there bare chested hair flowing perhaps attired in crampons the picture wasn't there but it should have been","392":"for a skinny book it was so very long i know the intention of the author was to show the perspective of mallory trying to conquer everest and the wife at home and what she is going through waiting for him it was why i wanted to read it but it turns out that i wasn't really interested in her side of the story it was beautifully written though i just couldn't get into it","393":"beautifully written historical fiction centering around george mallory famed climber whose dream was to reach the summit of everest the book offers a look at how george and his wife ruth dealt with his obsession heartbreaking but extremely interesting and riveting","394":"very solid read thanks for the indirect recommendation kathy","395":"wonderfully written incredible insight into each character the author carefully researched mallory and mountain climbing and made the book an incredible experience","396":"a very compelling look at the relationship between ruth and george mallory the author brought you to the very altitudes of everest as well as translating the angst of a wife and mother waiting for the mail to arrive hoping for the best fearing the worst i would definitely recommend this book","397":"fictionalized account of mountaineer george mallory and his attempt to climb mount everest in 1924 i didn't know a thing about mallory mountain climbing or mt everest but this book piqued my interest the author's detailed writing especially the finally push to the top left me feeling cold and breathless i especially liked the format alternating chapters of mallory's assent and his wife ruth's account as she stayed home with their three children entertaining historical fiction from first page to last","398":"recommended by staffer andreacheck our catalog http encore cooklib org iii encore","399":"i didn't realize until the very end that this was fiction i thought this was the true account of what happened with george mallory on mt everest nonetheless it sounds like she tried to stay true to the basic account of what happened and it was a great read","400":"couldn't put this one down i had no idea about the mallory expedition up everest but i feel like i know the characters well this author did a fantastic job of bringing emotion to life and giving dimension to an historical event definitely recommend","401":"this was a well written novel about george mallory and his death while attempting to reach the summit of mt everest historical fiction can be such an interesting genre and this one really takes yuou into his life both from his point of view from the younger climber who disappeared the same day hedid and from ruth george s wife i hadnever before really thought about extrememountain climbing before and found myself really intrigued by both the sport and the type of personit attracts","402":"i really enjoyed this book fiction and documentary rolled into one a thrilling documentary married to a gentle love story","403":"the everest portions were captivating i found myself less drawn to the wife's side of the story","404":"i just finished above all things and what a great book i have always been fascinated and in awe of mount everest and mountaineers so i was really glad to learn about george and his wife but what an ending i hope more can be discovered about him and sandy on that day","405":"4 5 stars i loved this book although i had heard of george mallory i didn't know his story so everything was a surprise to me the history behind the first attempts to climb everest was fascinating and intense but we also get an idea of george mallory as an individual what drives and motivates him i love that we get a glimpse into his relationship with his wife and we get the story from her perspective as well as his very well written i couldn't put it down","406":"you don't need to be a mountain climber to get hooked on the subject especially when it comes to mount everest three years ago i read jon krakauer's into thin air and was hooked since then i have read seven more books on everest followed online coverage each season and watched a handful of films however above all things is the first dedicated piece of everest fiction i have read though i was intrigued by author tanis rideout's npr interview plugging the book it left me suspicious her qualifications historical knowledge and mountaineering experience seemed limited nevertheless i snatched up my public library's copy and gave it a chance after all i find the legend of ill fated george mallory as engrossing as any fan of everest literature does the chance to experience his story as historical fiction and the story of his wife ruth was irresistable from page one i was encouraged by ms rideout's narrative style the delivery is delightfully straightforward and focused the novel's major drawback initially at least is the choice to limit ruth mallory's plotline to a single day while it affords readers great insight into the plight of loved ones waiting for news it means much of the story is excruciatingly stationary rideout compensates for this with increasing effectiveness as the novel progresses and the characters develop in particular she includes a pivotal supporting character named will his turbulent bond with george revealed in flashback and the exquisite affection he exhibits for ruth in the present provide tension and flow to scenes that would otherwise be nothing but relentless waiting after a slow start i read the latter two thirds of above all things in a single day this is comparable to my experience with other everest books even readers get summit fever as rideout and her characters press into situations undocumented by history she keeps the novel on task by exploring post war national angst as well as the competing pulls of familial commitments and personal quests by her own admission rideout takes some significant liberties with the facts but does so for the sake of effective storytelling her depiction of the final summit bid is mesmerizing at any time this book is on the verge of plummeting into schmaltzy romance yet through good writing empathetic characters and with the help of an irresistible legend rideout offers up a novel well worth reading","407":"quite a story well researched","408":"it will be a long time before i get this book out of my head the characters linger i will want to do more research on both george and his wife","409":"received book free through goodreads first reads tanis rideout has written a book that is truly magnificent from the inimate relationship between husband and wife to the obsession of a mountain both female relationships are tragic and yet beautiful i enjoyed this very cold adventure","410":"this book is described as the paris wife meets into thin air and i wish that for me that was true i have read both of the above and liked them more than this i found this book frustrating obvious and tedious maybe because i knew the story and when i got to the end and read that the author had moved around things like deaths of characters she deemed important to the plot by 20 years and had characters discussing things that happened 7 8 years after the events of the novel i was really angry","411":"a good read but i thought the end was weak it was interesting to see the historical weaved into some speculation as a novel this must have been the 4th or 5th book i read on everest i think i like more first person accounts","412":"this is a wonderful first novel rideout combines the elements of historical fiction adventure story and romance with a little obsession thrown in for good measure the technique of alternating between the men attempting to climb mt everest with a day in the life of ruth mallory is very effective in contrasting the active desperation of the men on the mountain and the quiet desperation of ruth at home","413":"i avidly read any book about mallory and irvine that i can find i was excited when this one came out like paths of glory it is a mixture of fact and fiction although i view it as mostly a fictional creation she fleshes out the characters and really brings out the tension excitement and exhaustion of the climbers she renders ruth's agonizing wait and feelings of abandonment while also highlighting her and george's deep bond and love the children are for the first time that i can recall given voices and personalities of their own it was a delightful read taking you through the peaks and depths of feelings surrounding adventurers and those waiting at home","414":" inexorable tragedy deftly told the build up including a stunning opening 40 pages to the terrible conclusion of the life of george mallory is a two sided tale of obsession u0026amp possession counterpointed by one person consumed with longing for something he can't identify or articulate and another who is robbed of the one thing in life of which she is certain it vibrates with the energy of an empire spent a world crawling out of war torn mud and innumerable people wondering how much more they must pay to inhabit their world this is the type of novel that will easily leave you reading in the bath tub long after the water has receded u0026amp gone cold","415":" this was a beautifully written book it takes place in the early 1920s and tells the story of george and ruth mallory george mallory is the famous british explorer who made 3 attempts to the summit of mt everest one of my favorite things about this book was that each chapter goes back and forth from the point of view of ruth and then george the descriptions and details of the hardships that george and his team endured on everest is unbelievable these are the early explorers who set out to conquer the harshest climate in their burberry gear while smoking cigarettes at base camp and listening to music on a victrola that they brought with them from england and had porters lug up the snow ridden slopes of the mountain fascinating stuff then we feel ruth's pain at being left behind once again with three small children for george's third attempt at the mountain she tries to understand his obsession but wonders why they are not enough to convince him to want to stay that they will never be enough for him this is truly a heartbreaking story but also one full of adventure and sacrifice it's also a love story what a wonderful satisfying gripping book didn't want to put this one down highly recommended","416":"beautifully written a great example how even if you know the ending i did being sort of a mountaineering reading junky you're still swept up in the story of these two people and an obsession","417":"delicious food for those of us who love all things everest an unsparing portrait of the obsessive george mallory intertwined with a day in the life of his devoted but let's face it abandoned wife ruth fiction but well researched personally the two characters embodied my own conflicting desires for adventure travel and the intimacy of family life","418":"a man obsessed--a woman left guessingmount everest is the highest mountain in the world its peak rising more than 29 000 feet in recent years increasing numbers of adventurers have tried to scale its summit professionally outfitted often accompanied by sherpa guides they make the perilous journey up the mountain in the 1920s an elite english gentleman had none of today's modern conveniences other than oxygen in his third attempt -- his final and fatal quest \"above all things \" a novel by debut author tanis rideout is more than just the tale of george mallory's drive to scale a mountain that stirs his blood and enslaves him it's also a love story a book spawned by rideout's curiosity about the woman behind the man -- mallory's wife ruth and what marriage to an adventurer like mallory would be like it's a relationship of long absences and incessant dread of bad news a marriage strained by empty words \" i'm done with it i don't need it i need to be with you \" a promise made after the second attempt in 1922 when mallory took what many thought were unnecessary risks leading to the death of seven sherpas lost in an avalanche two years later mallory the father of three knows he's growing older if he's going to attempt the climb again it must be now and so in 1924 he answers the siren's call by joining a climbing expedition of five which includes the youngest member of the group sandy irvine while the others in the climbing party stay at advanced base camp the two venture forward in a harrowing climb that costs them their lives to this day speculation remains as to whether or not they reached the summit \"above all things \" has wide appeal to a variety of readers -- those desiring an exciting tale of survival and others intrigued by the romance the mallorys shared on both counts the novel delivers bundle up and enjoy","419":"okay so i will admit right off the bat that tanis rideout's above all things isn't in my typical genre i'll acknowledge that it was probably an uphill battle from the start in terms of my liking it i ultimately decided to pick up the book when a friend recommended it knowing of my obsession with mountaineering literature that was probably part of this book's undoing for me i've read a ton of stories about everest expeditions and plenty about mallory and irvine rideout's characterization of them doesn't match mine u0026amp i'm sure she did plenty of research so i'm not saying my thoughts are more valid than hers george mallory came across so thoroughly unlikeable in this book i couldn't help but wonder why anyone would climb with him let alone marry him i was also put off by the novel's opening scene which was just so contrived i nearly stopped reading right there rideout certainly writes well and probably i would have liked this novel more if it weren't about everest","420":"about as interesting as watching paint dry one of the most emotionless narratives i've read trust me the description writer did a far better job than the author","421":"i am familiar with the non fiction historical event that this piece of historical fiction is based on and yet i was still so intrigued and emotionally involved with the ending very good","422":" when i was small i imagined love as something safe something without sharp edges only the sweeping enveloping curves of romance and happiness but it isn't not now anyway there are edges and they cut above all things is the story of george and ruth mallory he was a british explorer long debated to have been the first with sandy irvine to reach the summit of mount everest in 1924 she was his wife and the mother of his three children told from the points of view of multiple characters the book mixes historical fact with fiction and speculation that comes together to create perfection in 1924 george mallory is heading back to everest for a third time the last time he promises ruth who is heartbroken by his decision to leave her and their children once again but for as much as he loves ruth and their three children george loves the mountain well maybe love isn't the right word he is taken by her obsessed with her and the prospect of reaching the summit a height that no man had ever been to after two failed attempts george views this opportunity as his last hope his last chance back at their home in cambridge the story ruth tells unfolds over the course of one day in her life one day in her existence without the man who she loves and craves and longs to be with and who she feels abandoned by i was worried that the novel would would be overly technical when describing the the climb but author tanis rideout does a really great job of painting the picture of the climb and the attempt to reach the summit in the language of someone who has never set foot on a mountain and an even more outstanding job of portraying the humanity of each character since the outcome of the 1924 attempt to summit everest is historical fact i don't bad about including the spoiler that sandy irvine and george mallory disappeared on that climb in fact mallory's body was just recently found by some climbers on everest sandy irvine has never been found regardless i felt the loss and the heartbreak in rideout's novel and i cried at the end the narrative in enveloping the characters are tangible and accessible and the story is 100% unforgettable absolutely one of the very best books i've read all year i need to return the book to the library but i'm reluctant to part with the novel and the story and i'm eager to read more about the mallory and irvine expedition the fact that tanis rideout's novel has pushed me toward seeking out nonfiction is truly saying something it's not my favorite genre to read and i don't do it often regardless you need to check out this book i promise to return mine to the library so that other people can discover the story and the first novel from this author","423":"while i enjoyed the book the characters drove me a little bit nuts i confess i had trouble understanding why someone would risk his life and ultimately die to climb a mountain i mean so what climbing the mountain wouldn't have made anything any better in the world plus i wondered what mallory's wife did all day she had a maid and a cook and she wasn't employed maybe if she had actually gone out and done something to keep herself busy she wouldn't have spent so much time moping about her husband being away in the middle of the night sometimes i would wake up and read a chapter and then feel very happy that i wasn't in a tent on a mountain freezing my ass off and congratulate myself for not being so stupid as to have done so","424":"i wanted to love this but struggled maybe as mrs mallory struggled i almost would have preferred it if she had the affair ugh","425":" i'm surprised at how much i enjoyed above all things since it didn't get much buzz when it was first published many reviewers have said they didn't like the dual narration but i thought the book was structured brilliantly i couldn't tear myself away from either the mountain expedition sections or ruth mallory's quiet and heartbreaking narrative sections tanis rideout's historical characters were perfectly relatable and understandable even to this 21st century reader who has no experience exploring in any capacity i also appreciated how the novel addressed many of the biggest social concerns of the early 20th century but in a way that wasn't trite or cliche an often difficult achievement for historical fiction while i didn't experience the pathos that into thin air triggered in me i'm not sure any other book nonfiction or not ever will above all things was well worth the read","426":"this novel is the story of the third climb of george mallory on mount everest it is also the story of the love between george and his wife ruth mallory it takes place in 1924 and before the climbing would appeal to adventurers but not so much to me it is always enjoyable to read u0026amp imagine yourself in another situation out of your comfort zone","427":"the downside of reading novels based on true events at least for me and this particular story is that it was hard to stay totally immersed when i already knew the outcome i more or less skimmed through the last half of the book","428":"good book everest is a fascinating subject and the author made the sections on the mountain compelling and vivid it felt like the author handicapped herself with the conceit of using the course of one day as ruth mallory's viewpoint the sections about her from george's pov made her seem more vital than her own sections which were passive due to the format","429":"i'll review this when the american edition is released next year","430":" a fascinating look into the life of george mallory and his wife ruth as he attempts his last climb of mount everest in 1924 an interesting mixture of historical fiction that takes you up on the mountain with mallory's crew as they brave the harrowing elements of the himalayas in this treacherous feat intertwined is the story of ruth as she waits back home for his hopeful return and looks back on their relationship a breathtaking and bittersweet read i highly recommend for those who enjoy a little story with their history very well written","431":" a fictional account of george mallory's final attempt to summit everest this book is a mixed bag most of the everest scenes are gripping and the author does a great job of making the reader feel like they're right there on the mountain with mallory note to self you wouldn't like climbing everest so don't try however half of the book is devoted to mallory's wife ruth who does little more than sit around london moping it would have been a much better book if it focused solely on the everest expedition","432":"i have a fascination with books about everest although not quite as rapid paced as into thin air this story of george mallory's last attempt on everest in 1924 is just as intriging to imagine what they attempted with the very basic equipment they had is remarkable it remains a mystery to this day as to if mallory and his teammate andrew irvine actually made the summit the book is intertwined with the story of mallory's wife left behind in england with their 3 children","433":"i don't really like the rating system on good reads there are few books i consider amazing i loved this book i like historical fiction and i was amazed by what mallory attempted i had no idea he was a man possessed and a fool to risk his life for an accomplishment and a mountain he lost his life his mountain and his family lost him none of it worth it in my world","434":"after two previously failed attempts at summiting the tallest mountain in the world george mallory feels strong fit and optimistic for his third attempt at the prize it is 1924 and his expedition would be the first to set foot on the top of the mountain gaining significant honour and prestige for the british his wife ruth however doesn't feel the same way that he does she feels abandoned like she is not enough for george to want to stay home for she feels like a failure as a wife and uses small things to punish george for leaving her and the kids so easily again she knows he made the choice even though there was no choice in it as far as george was concerned mount everest is his and his alone to conquer reading about the team on the mountain was incredible there is no way to imagine the amount that they suffered and i can't believe that they were about to do what they did without primaloft and gore tex and featherlight tents the pain the anguish and the danger can only be overlooked by a special determined few and i have great admiration for them read the rest of this review and more of my reviews at www bookwookie ca","435":"i think the paris wife meets into thin air is an apt description for this historical fiction novel intertwining george mallory's 1924 everest attempt and his wife ruth's difficult wait at home i enjoyed the book","436":"a little bit slow but still a great story","437":" i bought this book at the airport in detroit and by the time i got to denver i was enthralled it is about george mallory's 3rd attempt at summiting google says that's not word but it is mt everest it was well written went seamlessly back and forth between the waiting wife and the expedition and the author very cleverly used altitude induced hallucinations to fill in the history of the characters while we may never know exactly what happened that last day i love the author's version and that is the one i choose to believe the book has very long descriptive passages on mountain climbing i found them fascinating as it is interesting to me but if you have no interest in mountain climbing it may be a bit boring to you","438":" brilliant writing you are there imagery period piece where adventure and the obsession of men attempting to reach the summit of mt everest in 1924 are juxtaposed with the waiting of george's wife ruth at home with their three young children for daddy to return for a tea party in their garden of course based on the true story well researched but with the liberty of fictional conversations between the lovers or the climbers the author canadian tanis rideout tells a superb tale in elegant form the narrative slips between time and locations seamlessly never losing the reader but on the contrary enhancing the emotions of the moment be they longing restraint or sheer compulsion really scary in parts for me it was not just the cold and howling wind leaving the men breathless as they approach the summit the freezing parts of their bodies but the hallucinations that take place they see what is not there i had goose bumps i had to put the book down it was that good","439":"i loved this book the passion for the mountains that i appreciate but do not share the feeling of being left behind of being so scared but so proud at the same time his feeling of being torn between his wife and children and the need to conquer the mountain the writing was so passionate and so intense especially toward the end a great read","440":"not knowing the outcome of this fictionalized account of george mallory's expedition to climb mount everest was a bonus for me as it kept me in suspense several times i thought that the interleaved story recounting the domestic life of his wife ruth was bland and repetitive but overall i think it lent a useful contrast to mallory's experience i read this in anticipation of an author reading at the arnprior book shop","441":"this was a deviation from what i normally read i found the layout and writing interesting even though it is fairly short i felt that it started to drag on in the middle already seeing the outcome however the 50 pages or so captured me and i had a really hard time putting it down","442":"this book sent me researching george mallory and the early conquests of mt everest very interesting","443":"original review http alexandrampatterson com 2013 0 summary george mallory has been to mount everest on two climbs but his teams have never reached the summit when the chance for a third expedition comes his way mallory is willing to drop everything to be the first to the top george's wife ruth is less than pleased that her husband is willing to risk his life again for the sake of fame and glory above all things chronicles mallory's climb to the top and ruth's attempts to cope with her husband's absence rating 4 5 starsthis is a stunningly beautiful story of love and passion to me above all things shows love in a much more real light than in many historical novels -- it's made clear that mallory loves everest almost as much as he loves ruth rideout's writing is crisp and clear putting you right in the center of the everest climb this book was so close to receiving 5 stars but ultimately i couldn't get behind the way that rideout alludes to an indiscretion ruth has while george is away it felt as though there was so much more to say there and the storyline didn't have room to breath that being said above all things should go straight to the top of your must read pile for its imagery and love story it would make the perfect valentine's read","444":"the harrowing story of george mallory's ill fated 1924 attempt to be the first man to conquer mount everest alternately told with the story of his wife waiting at home it just wasn't quite compelling enough for me","445":"not really knowing what happened to george mallory and if he made it to the summit of everest this book gives a good sampling as to what may have gone on","446":"i read paths of glory a while ago and enjoyed it this book gives a far different perspective especially mallory's and the other guy's final hours","447":"i have mixed feelings about this book it was horribly depressing but also at times fascinating i understand the author's interest in the story of george mallory's wife how he must have felt being left behind but i found it an interruption from the real story the author in her note said she fell in love with george mallory in her writing of the book but that wasn't transferred into the story at all he was portrayed as a selfish single minded character the ending left me unsatisfied leading me to google him after i finished there are of course unanswered questions in his history but for some reason wikipedia provided the answers i was looking for in the book and i'm not even sure what those were i probably won't recommend this one","448":"wow what a book from beginning to end this has been a very detailed book it is a book i will not soon forget this author makes these characters human he shows their anger there hurts their sadness is their lives the author shows the characters interactions with each other some are good sometimes you can feel the tension we also see and know how george's wife feels i cannot even imagine being the wife of an explorer that would be truly difficult","449":"this book sounds like a twist on the paris wife u0026amp the aviator's wife enjoyed both of them but this inside look at a famous marriage was just tooooooo slooooooow","450":"historic fiction i had scant info regarding george mallory his name was only vaguely familiar after reading rideout's depiction of possibly the first person to reach the summit of mt everest i'm hooked on his story and have non fiction books films about him on order a fascinating read rideout weaves the mallory facts with an imagined perspective realistic in my opinion of his wife ruth mallory","451":"an interesting blend of historical non fiction and fiction i enjoyed this book about george mallory's attempt at conquering mount everest in the 1920's with its fictional story using him and his wife's perspective of that journey","452":"in the end it didn't work for me this fictionalized version of the mallory story the mystery of the actual climb doesn't need help i skipped the mrs mallory sections beginning early on and improved my read there's better literature out there","453":" above all things follows the mountaineers of britain's 1924 mount everest expedition in particular it's about the relationships between the men who dared to climb in conditions unfit for humans and about the people they left behind back closer to sea level if you don't know much about this expedition or george mallory i urge you to read about them after you've read this book it'll be more fun that way everest as uncharted territorythe mount everest of decades past had more in common with the deep dark unknown of the ocean or the fiery belly of a volcano than with the rest of the earth that we know inhabit and call home today everest remains deadly and somewhat alien but it's not so unknown expensive commercial packages that include trained guides state of the art equipment and an ample supply of food and oxygen enable novices to make the dangerous climb this has turned everest into a crowded trash ridden feces covered place each year thousands ascend for bragging rights meandering among those who remain frozen in place if not in time more pictures here it's hard to imagine such crowding--and frankly such comfort--when reading tanis rideout's above all things in 1924 everest is uncharted territory an untamed beast rideout forces you to consider how scary and desolate the uncharted part must have been mountaineer george mallory and the others don't only have to survive the mountain's bitter cold with inferior equipment they also have to climb with no map to guide them being first has its drawbacks worse some who climb already have failed attempts haunting them rideout brilliantly communicates the climbers' anxieties leaving you with a sort of claustrophobic panic as each character's life depends on watches compasses and gut feelings above all things is detail oriented and rideout does much to place readers in the time period and draw attention to the expedition's primitive equipment george woke with his feet numb from a small drift of snow that had gathered in the tent near them the flap had come undone in the night and the canvas rumbled and snapped almost tore apart as the wind ripped at the material the roar of it was deafening but they weren't snowbound not yet as a fan of stories about people struggling to survive--perhaps i'm a sadist --i expected to enjoy following the mountaineers every snowy step of the way but i didn't expect to care about them so deeply many historical fiction novels are heavy on information but light on character depth rideout avoids this by telling the story through the characters' relationships every success or failure the mountaineers experience on everest is influenced by their sometimes close sometimes strained relationships with one another or by their memories--and vivid hallucinations as the air thins--of friends family and lost loves half a world away even now he felt torn part of him hated being separated from ruth and the children and another part hated himself for being so damn sentimental it was weak still there was the luxury of freedom this far from home he felt different away from ruth away from everyday life and he was never quite sure which person he was which he wanted to be rideout gives voice to those left behind too with some chapters dedicated to the first person perspective of ruth mallory george's wife ruth who is listless and forlorn in george's absence is not always fun to read she is a woman with no identity outside of her husband and to a lesser extent her children however having read rideout's closing notes about ruth i think ruth may be accurately portrayed here and simply a product of her time and status her life is small and dull but the characters that surround her--men and other women from her and george's rather incongruous life together--mostly make up for it and though ruth can be frustrating she adds to george's complexity and to the narrative overall the final third of the book is where rideout really finds her pacing you grow more and more nervous the closer the team makes it to the summit with each mistake or sacrifice you want them to turn back but they don't they're blinded by it--whatever everest is to them in george mallory's famous actual words they have to climb because it's there above all things left me with the hollow sweetness that comes from finishing a good book and i've since thought a lot about the expedition and rideout's interpretations of the people who went on it i'm not sure i'll ever understand the impetus behind wanting to conquer mountains but i do have a greater appreciation for those who first climbed everest after all you can't help but be in awe of people who argue over the sportsmanship of using oxygen to survive quotes from the book apply your own positive negative connotations their hands described reckless adventure sailing over longitudes and latitudes past here there be monsters and the arched backs of the sea serpents painted on the blue of the indian ocean and into the port of bombay it's just that the bad turns make for better stories no one wants to hear about the hike you took where nothing happened then the coolie's hands thawed he went on i don't know which was worse the freezing or the thawing both were terrible reminders that the body was nothing but pulpy meat easily ruptured broken frozen thawed that was the worst of it knowing the myriad ways a body could be destroyed","454":"i loved this book i couldn't put it down i found myself holding my breath several times","455":"tedious unbalanced melodramatic slow but enough interesting bits that i read the whole thing tempted to put it down the entire first half author weaves timelines a lot and it doesn't always work","456":"it took me several attempts to really get into it but such a story of determination and obsession and incredible bravery or was it slightly mad definitely poignant in its tie in with the discovery many years later just imagine climbing everest in a tweed suit","457":"this review has been hidden because it contains spoilers to view it click here even though i ended up skimming this i'm upgrading the 3 stars to 3 5 as the writing was excellent why i didn't read it word for word was because even though the history of climbing everest in the 1920s was interesting the mountaineering details and descriptions became a little tedious and i suppose i should have brushed up on my climbing history as i was bummed at the ending","458":" i became enamoured with the story of george mallory after reading jeffrey archer's paths of glory since then i have read a few more books on the subject and watched a couple documentaries while reading this novel i told my husband i don't know why i read books about mallory they all end the same way it's like watching a cowboy and indian movie hoping that this time the indians finally win that being said it was a wonderfully novelized account i could sympathize for ruth and her anger love and confusion also somewhat with george and his need to finish with everest the authors notes in the back were helpful clearing up discrepancies","459":"\"above all things is a work as brilliant as sunlight bending off snow \"tanis rideout's debut historical novel above all things is skillfully and beautifully written charmed readers will be transported back through time and space placing them right on the slope of treacherous and majestic mount everest and right inside read full book review of above all things by tanis rideout at new york journal of books","460":"i'm a big fan of anything about mt everest i certainly learned a lot about how really horrible it is or was to climb it","461":"i can't honestly say i give this 1 star because i only lasted 40 pages i found it badly written the conversation was stilted there were mistakes in recreating the english style spoken at the time too many canadian american expressions which point to bad or shoddy editing or proofreading this just put me off from continuing","462":"this book didn't grab my attention at first but stick with it it is a gripping tale i like the contrast between george's experiences on everest and the account of one day in ruth's life","463":"i loved this book first of all i am a sucker for those mountain cllimbing legs and fingers freezing ice ax slipping who of the group shall we eat because we are stranded in the wild kind of novels secondly i was fascinated by the love story of ruth and george mallory as well as by the times in which they lived","464":"dcover|isbn 978 0 7710 7635 0the paris wife meets into thin air in this breathtaking debut novel of obsession and divided loyalties which brilliantly weaves together the harrowing story of george mallory's ill fated 1924 attempt to be the first man to conquer mount everest with that of a single day in the life of his wife as she waits at home in england for news of his return a captivating blend of historical fact and imaginative fiction above all things moves seamlessly back and forth between the epic story of mallory's legendary final expedition and a heartbreaking account of a day in the life of ruth mallory through george's perspective and that of the newest member of the climbing team sandy irvine we get an astonishing picture of the terrible risks taken by the men on the treacherous terrain of the himalaya but it is through ruth's eyes that a complex portrait of a marriage emerges one forged on the eve of the first world war shadowed by its losses and haunted by the ever present possibility that george might not come home drawing on years of research this powerful and beautifully written novel is a timeless story of desire redemption and the lengths we are willing to go for honour glory and love my review i thoroughly enjoyed this novel the alternating chapters between different days of george's legendary climb and only one day in ruth's life was a brilliant concept on ms rideout's part the exhilaration suspense and gripping writing is amazing the vivid descriptions of the bone chilling cold the cutting wind and the glaring ice made you feel as if you were there climbing with the group i felt a special affinity for ruth who waited at home in england to hear word from george a man she loved very deeply ruth did not want george to go on this expedition but knew deep in her heart that it was something george just had to do the call of everest was just too much for him to resist above all things would make for an interesting discussion among book club members or just between two friends there is so much to review in this phenomenal story i'll be highly recommending it for sure","465":"this book is terrible horrible drivel i read about 50 pages and couldn't waste any more of my life on this thing","466":"mount everest is something that almost seems mythical to one like me who is so far away and far removed from it yet it's something we've all heard about possibly thought about in some way or another for me it's always been one of those things that i've thought \"it's sooooo far away and so very high \" and that's really as far as i've ever gotten because i have to be honest with myself i'm no mountain climber and i don't think i ever will be i live in a state where people pride themselves on climbing 14ers mountains at or above 14 000 feet high which they will devote a day to and that in itself sounds like a bit too much mountain for me this book gives you a bit of that kind of perspective in the form of ruth mallory wife to the british explorer george mallory ruth fell in love with someone who is in love with the mountain and even though everest is not her passion she has to deal with it on a regular basis george on the other hand is kind of obsessed with the idea of reaching the summit we enter the story in 1920 close to the beginning of their courtship and go from there to the day that george takes off in 1924 for his final trip to everest the trip he assures ruth will be his last his one final attempt to conquer the mountain to read the rest of my review please visit my blog","467":" a well written and researched novel i have a particular passion around everest one of the the first books i remember reading was edmund hillary and tenzing norgay's account of climbing everest and thus started my love affair with mountains i have read so many books on the quest attended talks with mountaineers who summited and failed before the latest commercial expeditions started the author captures the passions and unfathomed risks taken by mountaineers with the passions and struggles of those who love them care for them and try to understand why they go off on these adventures i found the time frames around letters and telegrams and the actual timing of the events on the mountain absolutely fascinating overall a complex love story on several fronts that explores the multilayered relationship between mallory his wife and his climbing partners and expedition members past and present if a book keeps the light burning late into the night as this one did it has to be good great passion went into creating this story","468":"i give this 3 5 stars i wanted to like the book more it is a fiction book but focuses on real life people and events i liked how the story focuses on the tribulations on the first people to do an expedition to mt everest their passion and hard work to hopefully realize a dream and also focuses on the family at home they leave behind and the sacrifices they have to endure also as their husbands dads and friends are gone for months at a time hardly knowing if they are safe or going to come home at all the author could've done a better job with chapter headings and explaining who the story was switching to and who was speaking i would start reading and be confused about what storyline i was following the author did her research though and the facts were interesting","469":"i'm a sucker for a novel creating a fictionalized but plausible story about a real person and george mallory is right in my wheelhouse although we kiwis uniformly don't believe he made it up and died on the way down but neither does rideout it's a weird feeling to be rooting for sandy irvine to finally get his chance to attempt everest with mallory and have to remind yourself that it doesn't end well i really loved rideout's descriptions of altitude induced hallucinations poor ruth","470":"a wonderful and adventous read i thoroughly enjoyed this book and would recommend it to anyone who enjoys reading about adventures and in this case the extreme adventure of climbing mt everest it kept me interested from the first to the very last pages i enjoyed the fact that the author told both the experiences of george and his expedition on the mountain and his wife back home a great captivating read for anyone who is in to great adventures","471":"although some readers do not like the amount of space devoted to mrs mallory ruth i enjoyed the alternating storylines that followed both george and ruth mallory during his last attempt at conquering mount everest the concept is good what happens to the family left behind while the adventurer does exactly what he wants to do in life i do not spoil so i will not reveal much of the plot i did enjoy the detailed writing on the subject of mountain climbing and i learned a lot","472":"i really liked this book for getting me to learn the true story of george mallory and his everest attempt i think it will stay with me the way the novel was put together and the style of presentation wasn't my favorite though","473":"enjoyed this well written well researched debut novel","474":" have you ever felt guilty of not going through a book faster i have though rarely but with this one i'm having a massive guilt attack why am i taking sooo lonnnggg it is excellent every minute that i spend reading it i enjoy tremendously so why bad timing yes raphaelle started school and it's been quite an adjustment for the three of us have i gotten too used to the ibook and or kobo format probably my sight is definitely starting to go down and i love being able to adjust my books to what i feel comfortable with plus the best time for me to read is when i put raphaelle to sleep so my ipad with it's minimal light in night reading mode comes in handy does that mean it's the end of the book as an object for me well it's the beginning of an end and unfortunately it starts with an excellent novel that should have been read in so little time had it simply been in another format i get hot spells and my eyesight is going down what can i say i'm getting older doesn't mean i'm not as sharp as i used to be though this is simply a wonderful novel so i'll keep pn reading even though it's written too small for my comfort zone keep posted i won this book in a goodreads giveaway it's such a beautiful book the chapters alternate between george mallory's expedition be the first ones to reach the summit of mount everest and the anxious wait of his wife at home one of the fascinating things for me was the concept of time as presented in the alternate chapters the trip and climbing covered a lenghty period of time takes place at the beginning of the 20th century when travel was much slower yet were presented as going by so fast as if the narration took root in action while the narration of the chapters that covered ruth's wait was more contemplative all is thoughts emotions feelings most of it took place on the same day perhaps to represent time stopping every day looking the same being the same while waiting for the man she loves so that part of the novel represents a much shorter span in time but we get the impression that it is sooo long this wait as if time was almost standing still the rythm is langourous the distinction between action and emotion is not as distinct as the separation between the chapters telling georges' story and the ones telling ruth's we of course find action in ruth there's a scene where she allows herself to feel angry that rings so close to what she really might have felt there's the impetuousness of george's character who doesn't do anything halfway and his emotions his obsession with the summit as well as his love for ruth are in accordance with his character there's also his sidekick sandy young impetuous driven and his slow grasp gradual realisation of what he really got himself into which is emotionnally charged the very technical details are fascinating even for someone like me who doesn't know anything about alpinism my jaw dropped as i read the list of what they were bringing along on the expeditions i went to read the list along to my husband knowing he would find it fascinating what a difference a century can make in what we consider primordial to bring along in an expedition fasinating also to read some real facts at the end to think that these people really lived of course it is a novel it is romanced but george and ruth mallory existed and although we can't know how they really felt it is a more than acceptable version of what they might have been like it is beautiful and fascinating i highly recommend it","475":"i love certain historical fiction very well researched i agree with goodreads that it is paris wife meets into thin air both books i enjoyed the last 30% of the book is riveting your teeth chatter as you can feel the cold i dreamed of the ending the night i finished the book","476":"this is a fictionalized account of the true story of george mallory who made several attempts to climb mount everest in the 1920s i found it slow going at the beginning i guess you can't hurry your way up everest but then found it fascinating it was almost as if i were there on the mountain too read on my kobo","477":"i liked it it was not quite as good as i had hoped the second half definitely better than the first half once i got halfway i felt like i knew ruth and was eager to find out what happened with her and george and the book picked up for me the characters were powerful and they made the book work for me left me wanting to learn more about everest and the mountain climbers who tried to tackle it","478":"2 stars this was a bit of an odd reading experience i did know about george mallory and his attempts at mt everest so this isn't a new to me story though i was curious about it being fictionalized i found the book more romance y than i expected and just couldn't get past feeling it a bit disappointing because of that while i appreciated the two perspectives george's on the mountain and his wife ruth's at home in england ruth's teetered too closely to a mrs dalloway feeling for my l 2 1\/2  stars this was a bit of an odd reading experience i did know about george mallory and his attempts at mt everest so this isn't a new to me story though i was curious about it being fictionalized i found the book more romance y than i expected and just couldn't get past feeling it a bit disappointing because of that while i appreciated the two perspectives george's on the mountain and his wife ruth's at home in england ruth's teetered too closely to a mrs dalloway feeling for my liking unfortunately 'mrs'd' is a book i really dislike and with george's parts of the novel i didn't feel particularly on edge the drama of the challenging undertaking wasn't all that dramatic in its conveyance which was too bad the characters also felt immature perhaps they were in real life i did enjoy the time settings and felt rideout did a great job with them more","479":" i was asked why read a fictional account of something that really happened when i started this book i didn't really have an answer to it other than i just wanted a good story and not a bunch of dry facts as i read more about everest and george mallory in above all things and in my own online research i realized that there was so much mystery that still remained about his life and his death reading this fictional account of mallory's last attempt at the summit of mt everest let me experience mallory's journey in a cohesive manner it wasn't just about what he and his colleagues had accomplished but about the lives they left behind them in this effort to reach the top of world with a large collection of letters between george and his wife ruth i do believe that a lot of the emotion that is so central to this story is genuine and not something that would easily come through a simple historical account part of the reason i think this book spoke to me was because the characters' emotions felt so real narrated in alternating chapters by george and ruth the reader becomes almost like a confidant for both parties even when george is hallucinating in the thin mountain air the reader is right there beside him i ached inside for the suffering these men endured but at the same felt relieved that i couldn't quite imagine the coldness the frostbite the struggle to breathe and the hunger that must have all but overwhelmed them when i was safe in the warmth of my apartment if you're a big fan of the sweeping bio fiction that covers the entire subjects life then this might not be the book for you above all things is centrally focused on george mallory's third and final attempt to climb mt everest in 1924 there are a few flashbacks about how george and ruth met fell in love and got married but everything revolves around 1924 and the separation between a husband and wife this is perhaps my only critique of what i believe is a very well written and researched novel mallory when not climbing held a position at cambridge had a wide social circle fought in wwi and was possibly bisexual some of these events are mentioned in passing but a lot of them are fairly cryptic especially the failed relationship with a man at university if you really want to know who george mallory was then this novel should be followed up with a good biography that would supplement the image of mallory the explorer family man that this novel emphasizes because it was there george mallory's offhand remark about why he wanted to climb the time's tallest mountain peak has gone down in history as a historical precursor to the yolo life doesn't happen sitting around in your living room and mallory was one for experience energy and the present not how the future would see him or what his successes and failures meant for the people who loved him this is a heart wrenching tale of ambition obsession and loss there were times when i considered putting the book down because i knew what was going to ultimately happen and yet i was drawn to the ending to see how the author would tackle the ultimate tragedy this is a book worth sticking to and i would definitely recommend it to lovers of historical fiction and the great outdoors or those interested in just how far the human body can be pushed before it breaks not having read wild by cheryl strayed i think that this could be a good pairing because of the insurmountable odds that both faced in their adventures","480":"what is it about adventure stories that are so easy to get lost in i love the way the author tells this story through the lens of george and ruth with everest looming in the background she strikes a fine balance between sentimental and technical and left me wanting to know more about these people it must have been so much fun researching and writing this story","481":" phin chose this one for me from the browsing shelf at the library the edition has lovely cover art and promises an adventure story so it seemed logical the author's note explains that rideout first encountered mallory's story while working in a gear store this detail helps to explain why the depictions of the climbing action in the book include strong detail and a sense of exhilaration that one might expect from a climbing enthusiast the chapters focusing on mallory's wife while still carefully rendered and engaging create a rather flat perspective on ruth rideout has done extensive research on ruth's relationship with george mallory and her portrayal of this aspect of ruth's life has power without any balancing aspects though ruth becomes merely the woman who waits instead of having a full humanity of her own the pacing of the chapters exacerbates this issue as ruth's chapters primarily cover a single day while george's span weeks or months depending on how you count tracking time remains challenging across both voices though because memories so frequently swirl in unexpectedly i like the regular integration of the mental lives of the characters but i would have appreciated clearer transitions in many cases especially with ruth who does not have oxygen deprivation as an excuse overall the technique is sound a rewarding i just feel that rideout overuses it as a final whinge ruth's voice often shifts between addressing george in the first and second person i never worked out a theory on why these shifts occur and they definitely annoyed me by the end of the novel i hadn't known anything about this everest expedition before picking up the book i'd say that was actually an advantage for me in reading since it allowed me a greater degree of suspense but now i want to learn more about these people thankfully rideout includes a useful list of resources in the back for just this purpose overall i recommend this as a relatively quick read on an interesting topic with a few stylistic quibbles and in my opinion an excessively passive female leading character","482":"i really wanted to like this the prose was lovely but it was also very deliberate and to me very plodding like several other readers i thought ruth's portions were tedious and whiny after a few of her meandering thoughts on george and their marriage i'd skip back to him and the fellows up on the mountain after a while even his bits didn't work for me and i gave up i have too many other things i want to read","483":"this is a very interesting and good read if you are interested in history mountain climbing or the psychology of of human behavior and obsessive thinking you will get a dose of it all","484":"this review has been hidden because it contains spoilers to view it click here what an amazing book i am indeed impressed with ms tanis rideout's debut novel i don't know why i am so attracted to nonlinear plotlines but the author handles this technique brilliantly note if you don't know the story of george mallory and mount

technique brilliantly note if you don't know the story of george mallory and mount everest because it's there don't read on having said that i will continue the story's emotional impact comes basically from two things first is the shifting from mallory's struggles on everest to his young wife ruth's waiting for his return in cambridge england second is knowing that george has tragically fallen to his death yet ruth is reading late arriving letters and doesn't realize she is a widow theirs is such a beautifully tragic love story worthy of the greeks or shakespeare before ruth ever knows george is never coming back she makes this statement to a friend when i was small i imagined love as something safe something without sharp edges only the sweeping enveloping curves of romance and happiness but it isn't not now anyway there are edges and they cut ms rideout has thoroughly researched her subjects and from this research has produced a story that will stay with me for a long time more","485":"this book came to me highly recommended it is a beautifully written account of george mallory's drive to be the first man to reach the summit of mount everest the rich description of the climb is juxtaposed with the love story between mallory and his wife who is waiting at home for him to return a great read","486":"just finished racing through the final 80 pages of my advanced reading copy of this stellar book and i am still tingling with breathlessness can't wait for its release in june when i can share it with and recommend it to everyone it is described as a cross between the paris wife and into thin air which it is but i would even compare it to one of my all time faves alias grace by margaret atwood it takes brilliant writing technique and storytelling ability to take a story out of the history books when we all know how it's going to end and still shape and craft an intimate portrait with so much tension that we still hope for a different outcome i can't tell you how excited i am by this book","487":"sounds amazing there aren't enough books like this out there","488":"i tried to hold it together and at the end finally burst out crying very touching book","489":"tanis rideout's debut historical novel above all things is skillfully and beautifully written charmed readers will be transported back through time and space placing them right on the slope of treacherous and majestic mount everest and right inside the conflicted hearts of these memorable characters above all things centers on george mallory the real life handsome charismatic obsessed british explorer who made his third and final attempt to climb mount everest in 1924 especially compelling this novel weaves together fact and fiction to reclaim george mallory's wife ruth from obscurity bringing her alive on the page in all her deeply affecting humanity against the backdrop of war ravaged england george mallory and his team of fellow explorers wage their own war against nature and geography attempting to be the first to reach the summit of mount everest for the glory of man and country you can read the rest of my review here http www nyjournalofbooks com revie","490":"one of those times when i need a fraction 3 5 3 75 a look at the challenges that faced the early climbers of everest ms rideout did a very good job of blending the facts with fiction to create an interesting story","491":"great book could not put it down esp in the end historical fiction if you liked loving frank paris wife this book is one you must read","492":"i really enjoyed this book which is a fictionalized account about edmund mallory and his fatal attempt to climb everest in the 1920s the book shifts back and forth between the expedition and his narrative to the narrative of his wife who is left behind with their 3 children as he makes the attempt the book becomes as much about their relationship as about the climb the book is well researched so it's very believable","493":" this is tanis rideout's first book and it's a masterpiece as far as i'm concerned after i had finished it i discovered that she had taken licence with some very minor items in the story of george mallory who died on everest in 1924 and chose to describe his death near the peak the truth of how he died has never been explained so rideout wrote a plausible description of what may have happened rideout's decisions meant the book became a novel however as i didn't find out till the end i believed i was reading some of the best creative nonfiction i'd ever read the author has interwoven the story of the 1924 summit attempt with a day in the life of mallory's wife ruth through her we see the toll his obsession with everest takes on her his children and other family members though it sounds a clunky way to do it it's not it is crafted superbly and gives the reader a perspective into mallory's character we haven't seen before how this expedition achieved what they did is astounding i was horrified at the hazardous conditions they faced so poorly equipped and clothed for the climate and ferocious winds on most of the climb food was scanty at best rideout describes their determination and courage to endure so well the reader feels that they are on the expedition the research has been rigorous deep and careful rideout has used archival sources media of the day letters etc but her book is not scholarly in fact it was so compelling i read late into the night on at least four occasions above all things will appeal to adventurers explorers and extreme sports fanatics and i highly highly recommend it for history buffs climbers outdoorsy types and geography nerds","494":"i'm sorry this was not for me my husband brought it to me because i'm fascinated with all things everest and i love fiction sounded great but i think mallory's story is best left to the non fiction genre i didn't care for the way the expedition was romanticized with fictionalized feelings and conversations and reading the author's notes i learned that some very key events which drove characters' actions in the book didn't occur until years later which seems pretty ridiculous","495":"very hard to put down not a necessarily original tale but a well told one","496":"this review has been hidden because it contains spoilers to view it click here i don't think i would have read this book on my own it was our book club selection and the author is coming to talk about it so i was excited for that reason but otherwise nothing in the description appealed to me mainly because i don't understand why anyone would want to climb a hill much less a mountain i'm not one for adventures in the wilderness nor reading about them that being said i enjoyed it it was well written and i quite liked the parts that took place off the mountain when yo i don't think i would have read this book on my own it was our book club selection and the author is coming to talk about it so i was excited for that reason but otherwise nothing in the description appealed to me mainly because i don't understand why anyone would want to climb a hill much less a mountain i'm not one for adventures in the wilderness nor reading about them that being said i enjoyed it it was well written and i quite liked the parts that took place off the mountain when you know the character will die at the end it makes you not want to reach the end so i struggled to make myself get there i did learn some things about hypothermia and everest lots of interesting tidbits in the book i would recommend to readers who enjoy stories based on real people events adventure stories and climbing more","497":"good but not great interesting i learned a lot about mountain climbing and about mount everest in particular","498":"excellently researched and written i loved how the story followed both george and ruth","499":"this book was richly written reminiscent of canadian great michael ondaatje in my opinion anyways made me feel lovey dovey and heartwrenchingly sad at the same time a gorgeous evocative adventure story set when parts of the world still hadn't been seen can't believe it wasn't so long ago","500":"first if you haven't read a book about everest let this not be your first choice this is my third book on the subject after reading into thin air and becoming an everest fanatic and so far nothing compares to krakauer's true account this however is my first fictional endeavor inspired by true events rideout delivers a seemingly authentic narration based on george mallory's attempt for the summit 1924 the story doesn't start and stop with just mallory and the expedition though it takes you into the heart and mind of ruth his wife waiting and bearing the burden and competition that lie between her and the yet unconquered mt everest it is about love and sacrifice and above all obsession always nearing the summit i am riveted and this was no exception","501":" last month's read for the britmums book club was tanis rideout's above all things a work of historical fiction following the exploits of george mallory and his intrepid group of climbing buddies desperately trying conquer the mighty everest for the first time in the 1920s that may sound very boys' own adventure story but it also follows the parallel life of his wife left back at home desperately worried and also rather put out at being abandoned once again due to her husband's incapacity to resist the lure of his mistress mountain full review on my blog http madhousefamilyreviews blogspot","502":"though everyone who rated it loved it i could not get into it and did not finish it i found it very wordy and i couldn't keep interested in the characters i found them whiney and dull","503":"could not put it down so riveting and well done","504":" my thoughtswhat an amazing book i loved the way the author decided to present the story we follow george on his fatal attempt to summit mt everest in 1924 we follow ruth during one day as she waits to hear of her husbands success or failure but as we are reading about the expedition george's thoughts frequently turn to ruth how they met time spent together and past conversations the same happens with ruth we see her go about this one day but get to read her thoughts about george how she views their marriage how she struggles with being married to an explorer and her hopes for their future together it's through this process that we really get to know george and ruth and makes the story come alive because of the author's ability to write so vividly i often felt like i was on everest with the climbing team my heart ached for ruth because i knew the outcome of the climb and while we are with her she does not this is ms rideout's first novel and i thought she did a fantastic job many many thanks to penguin group and netgalley for allowing me to read this in exchange for an unbiased review usa publication date february 12 2013","505":"i enjoyed this book very much and look forward to discussing it with my book club it would be an interesting one to discuss from a feminist perspective in ruth's words i've tried to understand why he goes away so often i tell myself it is a matter of duty of honour but duty seems to be different for men than it is for women duty is something men step inside and fasten around them like uniforms for women duty is a cloak draped over us that weighs us down","506":"pretty good story of climbing mt everest good love story","507":"\"why did you want to climb mount

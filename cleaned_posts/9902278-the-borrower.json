judgmental and kinda stupid she abdicates all her responsibility to this little kid - everything is his decision and therefore his fault pastor bob runs a program to teach gay little boys to be straight we don't really learn much about pastor bob except that he and president bush are evil people we also learn very little about ian's parents and there is no empathy for them the characters are all stereotypes with little depth i did enjoy some of the stories about lucy's russian family and i liked the bit at the end about the importance of books other than that this book was a bust for me sure there were lessons learned in the end but not done well enough to make it worth slogging through the story the whole thing felt very preachy to me and i don't enjoy that no matter what side of the issues the preacher supports i listened to an unabridged audio version of the book read by emily bauer and that only added to my displeasure the reader's voice was not convincing except when she was reading the part of lucy the protagonist her voice as ian was just irritating i had to hold my earphones away from my ears when the reader was singing i wanted to like this book i really did and i did like the premise of the book i'm sorry that it just didn't work for me i was given a copy of this book on cd for review","8":"it wasn't all i hoped it would be but i enjoyed it the references to children's books were fun to read even if they didn't always contribute a lot to the story i felt that a lot was lacking in character development but i couldn't help rooting for the basic premise","9":"loved this book easy read unusual plot and literary references throughout","10":"great premise idea lost in translation story goes nowhere","11":"this is a bizarre book don't read it as a librarian expecting to get a realistic viewpoint of what a librarian is read it as a story of a woman who makes a crazy choice and how she grows from it i loved it and while it doesn't have the ending i want it was a great ending","12":"a thoroughly enjoyable novel about a mixed up children's librarian who accidentally kidnaps her favorite denizen of the children's library a 10 year old boy named ian and goes on the lam with him another goodreads reviewer described the borrower as a love letter to libraries and that's exactly right this novel features a wild ride of a plot a cast of quirky characters humorous dialogue clever insights and dozens of references to well loved children's and adult books some reviewers have been turned off by lucy the librarian's quest to liberate ian from his overbearing evangelical parents who are worried that he might be gay and others didn't think the plot was realistic i found that it really helps to suspend your judgements and disbelief and just enjoy the ride as a child who haunted the children's section of my local library and spent countless hours lost in a good book the borrower brought back so many good memories and made me smile it's an impressive debut novel and i look forward to the author's next book i hope it also stars a renegade librarian or another slightly unhinged bibliophile","13":"enjoyable read very quick initially i read the back jacket cover and i couldn't fathom how this story could last over 300 pages and still be interesting it is makkai does an excellent job revealing different aspects of the main character and makes this very improbable story entertaining i chose this book because i didn't want to read about death or murder but still wanted a fully engaging read the borrower delivered","14":" in general i really enjoyed rebecca makkai's style of writing she did not follow the main stream continuous and often stuffy structure instead she opted for a more stream of consciousness set up that established a more direct connection with me breaking away from the narrative to inject humor and wit by adding lists and diagrams absolutely cracked me up i very much look forward to reading her upcoming work as i honestly felt connected and engaged to her as an author subject matter it was refreshing to get the take on a gay issue from the perspective of a strong willed straight female narrator gay literature tends to be extreme either essentially erotica or snooty uppity literature that prides itself on being so droll and witty this novel casts no such aspersions it's genuine in its heart speaking of which it's difficult for me to engage in literature that i can't relate to in some way i've noticed a lot of novels are about women who are losing their mind not so into that what i took out of it mainly i got out of it that sure you can go off on this whirlwind adventure attempting to save a kid from pain and suffering but at the end of the day you can't change someone's home family running away from your problems isn't going to solve them dorothy gale much there will always be parents even if one cuts communication off from them as the person in the situation it's going to take time to grow and mature lucy was expecting an epiphany from ian a ten year old needs to figure stuff out not necessarily be told as an outsider to these kinds of situations despite being frustrating and even painful to watch one just always has to provide help in any way they can but rash unplanned undirected action really won't solve anything it's just movement not progress it is however necessary sometimes to break out of the routine and reveal new truths at least that's what i got out of it","15":"sigh what start out with such tremendous promise in the beginning 7 or 8 chapters completely flatlined and went on and on and on and on for an additional 35 chapters i was so deeply in love with the beginning of this book made me smile oh how it made me smile and chuckle and then lucy takes ian from the library where he's found camping out and the rest makes for one frustratingly loooong painful journey where you realize that lucy is ridiculous and whiny and allows a confussed 10 year old boy make the decisions i found myself screaming at her ridiculousness and to just take the friggen boy home it was one asthma attack after another and she still leaves the decision of where to go next including the canadian border up to ian i first resisted this book because i thought i would be a little creeped out that the story is about this woman that takes a boy and they disappear for about 2 weeks but as i said in the beginning it was very amusing well constructed and i thought i would be wrong but no right up until the very end i was completely frustrated and weirded out that this 26 year old girl having an identity crisis makes off with a confused little boy that she's convinced herself she's saving and she lets it go on and on and on and on nothing in their travels was interesting at all and she gets away with it plops the kid on the greyhound bus in the end and continues her disappearing act while she very whiningly tries to figure out who she is and what she's doing even in the end she continues to believe that she is saving ian and what may be thought of as kind of neat and going along with the beginning lecture of the book she secretly gives him a reading list for the rest of his years is actually still incredibly creepy since she can't leave this 10 year old boy alone i did like lucy's russian father though good stuff there but as to trying to sync the russian life of torment and running away with lucy's current american life falls seriously and utterly flat the book finally finally came to an end and i no longer had to scream at lucy for being such a stupid moron anymore and i am so happy about that so in the beginning where i shout from the rooftops you must read this please ignore save yourself it is so not worth it","16":"this book was a gift from a friend it is a great unique story about an accidental kidnapping which was an exceedingly odd concept it ended up being quirky funny and a rather heart felt it was definitely not the run of the mill book","17":"emily bought me this book for my birthday thinking rightly that it was up my alley it features the following a quirky young child a road trip a children's librarian literary allusions parents with secrets and skepticism about christian extremism all things i like it did not disappoint i can see lots of people i like enjoying this book and specifically want to put it in a couple friends' hands i will admit that one has to suspend disbelief a bit really she let it get this far but i found myself eager to see how it'd all end how lucy would get out of the pickle of having kinda sorta mostly abducted a child who himself ran away also i particularly appreciated the demystification of ian toward the end of the book was he really as brilliant and misunderstood as she'd believed or was she projecting on him all along oh and way to throw in a religious relic in for laughs god i love religious relics this is a terrible review of a great book forgive me i'm tired and also i never write good reviews i don't aim to i write these blurbs so i'll remember what i liked or didn't like about books as i am forgetful jones so heather remember this you liked the idea of an unqualified woman getting to work as a children's librarian because you'd secretly love to switch places with her you liked the strange well read boy with the oppressive religious parents and you liked that the librarian found ways to sneak him the best books you liked taking a vicarious roadtrip and you liked ending it sort of anticlimactically you also liked that it ended with a thread of hope and a reading list","18":"how could you not like lucy hull she's funny charmingly neurotic and puts her beliefs into action how could you not like ian drake he's funny he's bright and he isn't a bad panhandler either they make an odd couple a twenty something children's librarian and a ten year old boy and their adventure is wild and makes for great reading the many references to children's books has me wanting to hang out in the kid lit world for a refresher course","19":"the description of the book held a lot of promise however i didn't feel like the book went anywhere how did the main character not get in any trouble how did the little boy sell his story well enough that his parents didn't care where he went i also found it a little unrealistic that she would even kidnap ian to begin with","20":"ok this was lovely preachy and political in parts but just lovely","21":"a curious story about a children's librarian and a very bright 10 year old boy who is being stifled by his evangelical parents it's an unreal adventure and it ends with real questions","22":"so enjoyed this one","23":"lucy hull hadn't intended to be a librarian but when offered the job of children's librarian in hannibal missouri she accepted because she had no other prospects and didn't want to live at home this is the one element in the book that really strains credulity because clearly she was born for this job in fact she is so good at it that a 10 year old misfit whose born again parents keep censoring his reading talks her into running away from home with him this is a wonderful funny sad and engaging tale about lucy's flight with ian from missouri to vermont ian can be positively obnoxious he's 10 after all but their shared love affair with books and frustration with evangelical america ian's mother has enrolled him in a reeducation program for possibly gay kids is one i know i'll read again","24":"but books on the other hand i do still believe that books can save you and because i knew the people books had saved they were college professors and actors and scientists and poets they got to college and sat on dorm floors drinking coffee amazed they'd finally found their soul mates they always dressed a little out of season their names were enshrined on the pink cards in the pockets of all the forgotten hardbacks in every library basement in america if the librarians were lazy enough or nostalgic enough or smart enough those names would stay there forever pg 320","25":"the plot in this one is fairly loose a young woman working as a children's librarian and one of her most avid boy readers a fifth grader named ian embark on a journey it's not clear who ia abducting who as they make their way from their home in hannibal missouri through chicago pennsylvania and eventually to vermont what is best about the book is the mention of numerous children's books that are well worth reading even for adults above and beyond harry potter","26":"hmm totally unbelievable plot from the mixed up files of mrs basil e frankweiler for adults as a parent it's difficult not to sympathize with the parents of a missing child and what they might be going through even if they aren't the best parents in the world in this case they are the typical creepy overbearing totally unlikeable christian fundamentalist parents trying to force their beliefs u0026amp book censorship on their possibly gay you can tell this at 10 years old son as a follower of christ i hate being lumped in with these types of people and i hate how there are rarely any role model christians depicted in media today just crazies but i digress despite the very holy pun intended plot there were a lot of great moments and humor in this book some of the chapters include a section where the author writes in the style of a well known children's book like madeline if you give a mouse a cookie goodnight moon makkai has a great sense of humor which surprised me many times the story kept my interest and if i didn't take it to seriously i found i could enjoy it and just go along for the ride","27":"the side story about lucy's russian heritage made this much more enjoyable for me","28":"i loved the ian character this story is fun and wacky and touching at times but i wasn't surprised to find out the author is a short story writer i think she dragged this iut a bit to make it into a novel","29":"it was well written and went by quickly bibliophiles and library lovers will really like this book i couldn't identify with any of the protagonists in the book not the author's problem hence the 3 stars based on my enjoyment","30":"not sure it met up to all the hype about this book","31":"amazing if you only read one book this summer this is it a beautifully written sensitive novel of an 'accidental' kidnaping and road trip with one of the most endearing kids you will ever encounter read it","32":"this is a delightfully quirky book about a young children's librarian and a ten year old boy who unexpectedly take a road trip it requires suspension of belief a bit but makkai does a good job of making various scenarios lucy for example gets a job as a librarian without the proper degree and that's just the tip of the iceberg in lucy u0026amp ian's world actually seem plausible my favorite feature is all the references to children's literature such as the chapter written in the style of if you give a mouse a cookie there are many humorous treats like this throughout the book makkai is talented even the title has layers of meaning slight spoiler below my main complaint is my disappointment with lucy at the end she hasn't grown enough as a character she still has issues and is in the same place we don't see her true personality either and that was what she was supposedly looking for all along","33":"this book was ok it went on a little too long for me and was totally unbelievable maybe it's the social worker in me that doesn't agree with kidnapping children though","34":"interesting premise and story of discovery raises questions without providing pat answers","35":"i got this book for the literary references but lucy's refusal to actually do anything made me furious so i just couldn't enjoy this one","36":"i thought this book was great the story revolves around lucy a young librarian who runs the children's area of the library in a small town in missouri she has a fondness for ten year old ian a misfit who loves to read and spends a lot of time at the library lucy finds out that ian's parents are religious fanatics and have enrolled him in a program to keep him from becoming gay one day she discovers ian is running away from home and lucy leaves with him driving him half way across the country as they both decide what they're looking for it's kind of a buddy road trip story but without the usual characters lucy has to confront whether she should really be saving ian from his parents and if it's just ian that's running away i thought makkai's depiction of ian was spot on and she gave lucy who narrates the story such honesty there is alot of humor in this book which was very refreshing for me my own fault since i'm always reading the dark depressing novels","37":"only another librarian can truly appreciate this zany adventure we get caught uo in the lives of our readers as much as the characters of our books every thing we do in iur life can relate to a book","38":"interesting book great selection for a book club meeting","39":"lucy is a librarian just because this is the first job she happened upon when she graduated college ian is a young boy of ten that is an avid reader ian visits the library incessantly when ian's mother begins to monitor his reading choices lucy grows protective she makes huge assumptions about ian's family based on a letter she finds about a religious camp ian is attending and his mother's behavior one day lucy arrives at work to find ian has spent the night in the library she makes to drive him home but instead listens to a ten year old kid and drives him across several state lines before she reasons he must return home lucy's character is immature and undeveloped we can only speculate why she does what she does but in the end it's not really clear why she responds to ian in such a rash manner also there is little dialogue between the two of them to suggest a close bond or any time of implicit understanding of what the other knows lucy's father is russian and there is an attempt at a plotline that suggests lucy's actions are tied into her runaway heritage all in all i found this book meandered and had no clear point it wants to make a statement about gay rights making choices conservatives but i'm not sure what that statement is when it's done i think what annoyed me more is i read the book hoping for a payoff and i never got it if you do read it suspend your disbelief from the get go because it's the only way you can get to the end","40":" this book has a great beginning and a great ending but the middle is sort of a mess the train went right off the suspension bridge of belief and down a cliff it's a shame because as i said the premise that books will save you is wonderful librarians and booksellers will love that part of the story on the other hand this ridiculous trip to save the boy is the same trip that huck made with jim as is pointed out by the narrator so maybe i'm being too critical and the ending is so wonderful that some not all is forgiven this author i'm glad i read it","41":"i didn't love this book i couldn't identify with the main character or really understand her decisions throughout the book when i was done it left me wondering who this woman really was and what was the point of this story","42":"what a unique read the borrower tells the story of lucy a small town twenty something librarian who inadvertently finds herself caught up in a cross country road trip with one of her favorite library patrons a 10 year old boy named ian lucy suspects that ian may be gay and that his parents are sending him to one of those infamous pray the gay away camps when lucy discovers ian has run away to the library exactly where i would have gone when i was 10 lucy scoops him up and they hit the road but who exactly is the kidnapper and who the kidnapped lucy's life and feelings about her home aren't the most stable is it possible they're both simply runaways the constant references to favorite childhood stories will delight any life long reader for those of us who dreamed of our own huck finn esque adventure down the mississippi and escaped countless nights under the covers with a flashlight and the boxcar children who whoever it may have been this book strikes the right chord","43":"i enjoyed this quirky gem of a book a quick read and entirely fun","44":"this is a road trip story ten year old ian is written very well lucy the librarian is well young and a little muddled i liked the parallel stories about lucy's russian father about his running away about the things he felt guilty for having done when he was young i also liked what ian and lucy learned on their trip ian learned that adults are sometimes wrong lucy learned that she can't save anyone but \"books can save you \"","45":"kind of all over the place and nonsensical plot wise but still manages to be charming makkai does a nice job of capturing ian's voice and the in betweeness of every good 10 year old with more brains than sense","46":"i didn't particularly like this book and i did not finish it","47":"i really liked this book despite how sad it struck me i think i was drawn to the theme of how far someone in a position of authority of any kind can intervene meddle in a minor's life while i was never tempted to kidnap a student when i was teaching holy bad judgment protagonist i certainly saw a few variations on the ian of this story come through my classroom and speech debate team--and i may have encouraged orchestrated at least one student in a direction that was not part of the trajectory his her parents intended it is difficult to sit by and allow irrational closed mindedness to win but of course this is the gist of the book is that ok it is clearly not ok to kidnap a kid but if this is just an extreme interpretation of the theme well where is the line as much as i rolled my eyes at lucy's inability to assertively commit to her sort of chosen profession--and her terrible judgment--i seethed along with her throughout the story","48":"i liked this book it was humorous and upbeat considering the subject matter","49":"hoped to enjoy this more but the quirky delightful references to children's books and librarians fizzled quickly slightly redeemed at the end but just didn't deliver","50":"this is a book for people who love books it follows lucy a library who inadvertently kidnaps a 10 year old patron and takes him a cross country road trip in a desperate attempt to instill in him the message that it's okay to be whoever you are sprinkled between chapters are clever parodies of popular children's books like if you give a mouse a cookie and goodnight moon which leave the well read reader feeling like they're in on the inside joke i'm not sure i would recommend this book to someone who wasn't an avid reader because i don't know that they would appreciate it fully but for any lover of literature the borrower will undoubtedly become a favorite that you'll want for your own bookshelf","51":"okay the very beginning of the acknowledgements goes like this although i've had to demolish my childhood fantasy that penguin books is somehow run by mr popper's penguins of course what follows is both a brilliant homage to the whole of children's literature and a daring voyage of self discovery for both a librarian and an eleven year old boy when she abducts him to save the boy from his evangelical parents who are carting him to a workshop every week to turn him straight because they suspect he may be gay amidst the adventures of the epic roadtrip are the spoofs on if you give a mouse a cookie and the hungry caterpillar a chapter entitled the bfg and more the one criticism i have is that i would have liked to know more of ian's inner emotional landscape it is never clear you could argue that it makes sense that you don't see it he is eleven after all and pretty confused but at some point you really need something from him not just what people around him think however i found the book a completely delightful tale of books and people who love them and the power they have to change lives","52":"give it a 4 5 after reading reviews in both parade magazine and the star ledger i had to put this debut novel right on my \"to read\" list makkai did not disappoint librarian lucy hull and her favorite \"book addict \" ian go \"on the run\" after a few disturbing details of ian's life are revealed as the story moves forward we learn that lucy the librarian has a few details of her own that need some explaining but not before she creates a crisis that in lucy's mind must be lived out parodies of several children's literary works are found throughout this unraveling tale of friendship moral complexity and finally triumph in the craziest way a reader could imagine one thing is for certain--lucy like many of us believes in her heart that books can save people she states she knows many who have been sustained--\"professors and actors and scientists and poets \" books help us realize the world is a bigger place i think in my heart books most likely saved lucy hull and rebecca makkai and surely donna reinhardt more than once in their lives this book reminded me of another book i read last summer--everything i need to know i learned from a children's book","53":"i believed books might save him because i knew they had so far and because i knew people books had saved they were college professors and actors and scientists and poets they got to college and sat on dorm floors drinking coffee amazed they'd finally found their soul mates they always dressed a little out of season their names were enshrined on the pink cards in the pockets of all the forgotten hardbacks in every library basement in america if the librarians were lazy enough or nostalgic enough or smart enough those names would stay there forever","54":"woman who works in a library kidnaps a gay 10 year old almost surreal road trip filled with inconvenient coincidences not a librarian with a strange russian family and a unbelievable boyfriend consider it a fantasy not a great library novel","55":"3 5 stars i liked this book but i didn't love it the characters were just a little too unbelievable for me","56":"a long drawn out littany of self loathing diguised as a kidnapping adventure","57":"just finished this on audiobook a good choice because for large chunks of the narrative i was distracted but no big deal because nothing happens for large chunks of the narrative also a bit irritating were the obvious observations the protagonist lucy makes about herself ian her family show don't tell right but with all that said this was a good enough read listen it helped that the ending was ambiguous","58":"i enjoyed this book i loved the young boy character especially and could identify with the librarian's feelings some very funny parts in this book and i loved the clever insertion of children's books","59":"how could i not love it not that i would ever drive away with any of the adorable kiddies that use my library witty and fun with memorable characters even if the plot is a little far fetched","60":"from the first set of comments i'm reading it appears this book is unrealistic fair enough i thought i was reading a book and not spending a day in the life of someone else i found the book to be well written accurately developed and very well paced with that being said this books subject matter and premise are not for everyone it does stereotype it does make bold assumptions but these are things that are necessary for the book to develop in this odd set of circumstances that story that comes about is funny and clever i say give it a read if you have the time","61":"if you are a reader this is fun just for the literary references but also a good one in the tradition of bildungsroman and road trips","62":"i don't know my friends if you spoiler kidnap a kid shouldn't there be more consequences","63":"an interesting idea and mostly well written just a tad too heavy on the gay rights preachiness","64":"i received a free copy of this book through the amazon vine program it's an odd premise a twentysomething librarian in the children's library finds herself kidnapped by a 10 year old boy and travels around the country with him i found the story fun to read and loved the references to children's books we all have stories of being allowed to read or banned from reading or forced to read certain books ian loves reading but has his reading severely censored by his mother nevertheless he smuggles books out with the aid of the librarian then one night he stays overnight in the library finding him the next morning lucy attempts to take him home but they get sidetracked and she drags out her time with him finding it harder and harder to return him to a family she feels treats him badly the journey is entertaining as lucy finds the situation snowballing with all sorts of odd characters on the way i won't spoil the ending but it's as much a journey for lucy to find out where and who she is as it is a physical journey","65":"this book definitely had a different writing style i liked the prose modeled after children's books i was hoping for a different kind of ending so it fell a bit flat at the end for me","66":"unconvincing and abrupt","67":"cute and funny as long as you suspend your parental feelings","68":"i really liked this book read it in one sitting it was worth staying up late or early as the case may be for a very impressive first novel looking foward to the next","69":"the writing style itself was just fine i blew through the book in no time but i found that i didn't enjoy the characters or the story itself too much once it became clear what sort of book this would be i suppose i didn't enjoy the main character herself because the book was flowing with how her viewpoint in the onset was absolutely correct and she needed to save the kid i did enjoy that it took her a while to really move into action and do what she did it shows that she isn't too careless and quick to action i suppose the story also goes skews a little too much towards one specific viewpoint that sort of made me feel as if it places believers of any other in this weird zone when it comes to this sort of topic i enjoy how authors like john green are able to handle it in a much more subtle less beat you over the head manner","70":"this is a great engaging read the ending left me wanting a little something else but beyond that i really enjoyed it all of the literary references to classic children's books enrich the experience for those who are well read i definitely recommend this book and am glad someone recommended it to me","71":"needs a little willing suspension of disbelief but all in all an enjoyable book about the courage of your convictions thanks rebecca books can and do change people","72":"the reference to children's books throughout this story was particularly appealing to me since i am an elementary school teacher i also thought that the character of ian was written perfectly all his quirks and mannerisms were so spot on i could just picture him spinning circles wearing his green glasses and walking backwards this author knows kids the story slowing reveals itself and it is a thought provoking book that makes you think what would i do i believe books can save a life","73":"short read but i found the lead character annoying and hard to understand","74":"riveting i love how funny the main character was her actions are sometimes confusing but this is definitely a literary page turner i stayed up late last night because i couldn't put it down i also loved the references to children's books throughout interesting themes russian immigrants the role of teachers u0026amp librarians in helping children with weird parents growing up with sexual identity issues failure to launch honesty","75":"i did not know where this book was going but i couldn't stop until i knew the end","76":"if you love books and know kids and the books they read you'll love it not what you'd expect but fun","77":"this is a sweet little book well written for a first novel and it appealed to me as a book lover and because i worked as a library manager for a year and can relate so much to all the little library references it's the story of a lucy the daughter of a russian immigrant to america who ends up working as a children's librarian in a small town where ian drake lives he is an 8 year old who everybody thinks is gay to the dismay of his evangelical parents who sent him to a sort of 'gay boot camp' where young children are sent to 'be corrected' before they realise who they actually are so ian runs away camps in the library where lucy finds him one morning so they end up running away together and it turns into a sort of road trip where ian is searching for a fictional grandmother and lucy is learning the true story of her family history i'm kind of torn how to rate this book i wasn't sure whether the storyline was particularly credible and i didn't really like the ending for lucy and feel perhaps the various themes weren't brought together to a satisfying conclusion but it was filled with delightful book references and lovely moments such as 'give the librarian a closet' or her message sent back to ian via her gay actor friend it is told with a good sense of humour and there are some enjoyable characters involved worth a read","78":"slow getting into but the last half really took off i couldn't wait to see how it ended it ended with a moral and a good feeling at the end which i always like in a book i could see this one being made into a movie","79":"this is going down as one of my all time favorites","80":"this debut novel has all the ingredients which usually make a book irresistible for me - take one children's librarian add one ten year old boy who loves the books his god fearing parents hate stir in a road trip and sprinkle with references to classic children's literature and voila... well unfortunately the result was more of a sunken souffle for me the story opens well with our narrator lucy hull a young children's librarian in hannibal missouri taking an interest in the well being of her most regular customer 10 year old ian drake in the course of guiding this avid reader towards the best of children's literature lucy discovers that ian's very religious mother has enrolled him in anti gay classes run by pastor bob her hand is forced when she discovers ian camping out in the library and they find themselves on the run in an eventful road trip from missouri to vermont there is some confusion as to who has \"abducted\" who ian is the arch manipulator playing lucy in the way a child can turning on the tears changing the subject but lucy is so easily \"played\" she lost all credibility for me there are lots of weird and wonderful characters including lucy's russian immigrant father with his shady past and plenty of amusing incidents from ferrets to the sinister figure who stalks lucy and ian although it has glimmers of brilliance the borrower left me unsatisfied and slightly disappointed i felt left behind and didn't feel any real connection with any of the characters it seems to be a marmite book though and will provide plenty of discussion for book groups","81":"this was quirky lucy hull is a children's librarian with a special relationship with 10 year old ian ian is a voracious reader with a wide variety of interests not always associated with stereotypical boy interests his parents are worried and have enrolled him in religious anti gay classes which he hates lucy allows herself to be talked into helping him run away temporarily their trip would never happen in real life and the anti gay folk are painted here with too narrow a brush but i understand the librarian's sentiment and i especially liked the little vignettes she writes where she uses the rythmn of well known children's stories good night moon the very hungry caterpillar etc to advance the story","82":"lucy hull a young children's librarian in hannibal missouri finds herself both a kidnapper and kidnapped when her favorite patron ten year old ian drake runs away from home the precocious ian is addicted to reading but needs lucy's help to smuggle books past his overbearing mother lucy stumbles into a moral dilemma when she finds ian camped out in the library after hours with a knapsack of provisions and an escape plan desperate to rescue ian from his homophobic parents lucy allows herself to be hijacked by ian the odd pair embarks on a crazy road trip from missouri to vermont with ferrets an inconvenient boyfriend and upsetting family history thrown in their path but is it just ian who is running away who is really escaping from their family history there is a love of books and reading throughout this book which is quite enjoyable lucy's relationships with ian her family and her friends will keep you interested but for a character who claims to be open minded she is very preachy about her personal beliefs and why everyone else is wrong which i found annoyingly ironic","83":"as a portrait of an aimless questioning twentysomething's life in contemporary america the borrower is not without merit if only it wasn't such an obnoxious portrait lucy hull is a rich 26 year old trying to build an identity outside the shadow of her father's money she gets a job as a children's librarian in small town missouri where she spends a lot of time thinking about how the other librarians are dumb and incompetent being vaguely condescending about guys she thinks are interested in her and feeling superior to her town's boring inhabitants because she's descended from russian immigrants which practically makes her a revolutionary man no one else in missouri of course is so special as to be descended from russian immigrants lucy meets befriends and projects a whole lot of her own psychological issues onto 10 year old ian ian's parents and lucy's coworkers and friends think ian is gay not because he says he is or shows any romantic or sexual interest in boys but because he likes girl stuff like singing and doing a school project about betsy ross ian's parents are conservative christians so they send him to a sort of gay conversion camp where he's supposed to be taught how to be manly but without anyone ever bringing up the topic of sexuality since this is the kiddie version of gay conversion camp one day ian runs away from home hides in the library and begs lucy to drive him out of town instead of sending him home to his family because she is even more of a child than he is and wants to save him she does so then they road trip across the eastern us on her dad's money until she realizes that she actually has no power to save him and in fact doesn't even know for sure that he's being mistreated lucy assumes that he's running away because of the gay camp but he never says so the complaint he actually voices is that his mom is strict mean and doesn't let him read the books he wants so she sends him home alone on a greyhound bus except for a former kgb russian mafia guy as escort really looking out for the kid's welfare there i mean the story kind of works as a satire albeit a mean and stereotyped one of the millennial generation the lack of direction the sense of self importance the privilege and self consciousness about it the focus on gay rights as the defining good evil issue of our times maybe the savior complex but it isn't actually a satire and its exploration of young white middle class american culture lacks depth insight and especially empathy lucy never feels like a real person and the other characters really mere props in her self focused moral drama even less so it's like the character is cobbled together out of those why millennials are so entitled articles that occasionally pop up in the media in addition the chatty but not intimate style constant meta navel gazing about how the story is being told and re telling of the story in the style of popular children's books makes the book feel padded even though it's a quick read overall an annoying reading experience","84":"there are a lot of children's literacy references throughout this book hence the borrower s title it's an easy read that i was just ok with but her last few chapters really tie the story together and made it one of those books that i'd recommend not a must read but decent 3 5 stars","85":"current 26 yrold librarian hannabal mo ian 10 yr old borrower she believes he is abused sent to christian de gay commune so when he runs away into library she travels with him to vermont to find his grandwmother they stop by to see her rich father russian gangster in chicago a twist everything is not what it seems","86":"i absolutely loved this book it is perfect makkai captured everything the sadness despair wonder hope hopelessness etc someone on the outside who just wants to help who just wants to make things right but has no clue how like i said perfect oh and my favorite line in the whole book the narnia comment loved it","87":"this is one of the best books i've read in a while i highly suggest it","88":"kind of a weird story read the blurb about it if you're curious but set amongst it were some interesting observations about life humanity america etc this is another book that i probably should have read with my eyes rather than ears but i'm trying to have one of each audiobooks keep me from watching stuff in the evenings i might go back and flip through a print copy to enjoy the twists on classic children's stories good night moon v hungry caterpillar etc those were my favorite parts of the book","89":"this is a story about lucy a twenty something children's librarian by accident and a daughter of a russian mafia father by fate and a 10 year old ian a bookworm whose mother doesn't let him read books unless there's a breath of god in them and who later enrolls him to antigay classes deeply appaled by that and eager to save him lucy allows herself to be kidnapped by ian one fine morning and the two soon hit the road and somewhere along the way lucy learns some truly important things about herself and her family and tries to comprehend the true purpose of their running away i also found lucy's final gift to ian extremely touching and beautiful too i'd like to believe that it will really help him survive childhood and adolescence and finally grow up to be the person he really is both main characters seemed pretty genuine to me though at times i was a bit annoyed by lucy's behavior in certain situations and especially her willingness to isolate herself from other people also there were some absolutely implausible plot twists that somehow made the story unrealistic hence 4 stars but on the whole the story flowed very well and it held my interest so well i couldn't put it down actually i found it on my ereader one lazy saturday evening decided to read a line or two just to see if it was any good but ended up reading deep into the night instead that's how amazing it was so i'd recommend this book to any book lover out there because it truly is a thoroughly enjoyable read about the power of books and reading","90":"an excellent book not sure but it could be in its very own genre the literary road story","91":"i got an arc from the publisher right before my move so i just go to this one this week makkai's dated depiction of library life kind of ruined this one for me maybe there are some 26 year old librarians who feel utterly defeated but 26 year old librarian me was just starting out and totally on fire with library love just a few years ago and i still am lucy didn't seem to be keeping up with contemporary reading trends either regardless of my qualms of how libraries are shown i just never became fully immersed in this book the plot trudged along and i wanted to see how everything would be resolved but i didn't really care lucy is so self involved and the other characters are not terribly interesting folks i did like the russian family themes that haunted lucy and i did find her character funny at times overall though this didn't really go anywhere and things wrapped up a little too tidily for my tastes okay","92":"i received this book for free through goodreads giveaways and i really liked it the fact that the main character is a children's librarian pretty much ensured that i'd like it but the story was very good too i loved the discussion of first amendment issues and the dilemma of censorship especially for children who are interested in reading controversial books i adored the many references to various children's books both in homage see madeline on p 35 if you give a mouse a cookie on p 56 this is the house that jack built on p 136 the very hungry caterpillar on pp 218 219 etc and merely in mention throughout the book but especially on p 6 35 319 as happens more often than i think is purely coincidence i had a strange coincidence in my reading selections on p 6 miss hull mentions that she recommended d'aulaires' book of greek myths to ian and we just happened to start reading that book the same day how wonderful new words ritardando fabulization aurochs books recommended in this book

bit iffy but that's okay the references to children's literature were really fun the political ranting was a bit much for me quick read kept me interested for a few days","94":"the borrower is a fantastic read one of those rare novels where when i reached the end i was so overwhelmed with the pleasure of reading it that i needed a second to pause and catch my breath that's not to say that the end is euphorically happy it's not but it's just that i so enjoyed the story that i needed a pause to savor the moment on it's face the borrower is a simple story young bored children's librarian in small town reluctantly assists one of her young patrons in a runaway scheme and the two of them embark on what has to be one of the strangest road trips in literary history they elude the librarian's drunk boss travel to chicago to stay with her parents her father a russian immigrant and soviet union escapee with possible definite ties to the russian mafia is one of the greatest characters in the book then to pittsburgh to make a slightly shady delivery to one of her father's russian friends also amazing characters up through new england and finally back to the small missouri town where they started off this is called the borrower remember that which is borrowed especially from libraries must be returned but what the borrower really is is a funny sharp occasionally melancholy study on running away why do people run away and where do the go sometimes we think the answers are clear they run persecution political and personal they run from ties that bind they run to see what's on the other side of the trail they run towards freedom and physically that often means they run towards the us of a but what if you're already here in america and what if its the days of george w bush the borrower is set in the early days of the patriot act and the erosion of american civil liberties that brought where then do you run to these are the questions that drive the storyline of the borrowers and in each of the characters story and each of the answers they find there's at least a kernel that any of us can relate to at some point in their life everyone is on the run since the main character is a children's librarian the themes and rhymes of well known american children's books are woven in throughout deliciously twisted by the sardonic voice of the narrator those of us who were great readers as kids and those who have had the great privilege of getting to hand down those secrets of literature to another generation will get special joy out of these parts if you weren't a reader or a bookseller or librarian you'll still probably find them very funny and slightly sick the power of literature especially literature for children and young adults to save you and direct you is a big theme throughout the borrower ian the runaway boy finds solace in the library where he escapes his parents narrow minded religious views they make him attend reorientation classes led by a shady ex gay minister to curb his early homosexual tendencies they tell him he can't have a birthday party unless he invites only boys they censor his reading so that he only gets books with the breath of god in them his librarian friend and later reluctant kidnapper is his ally in this his superhero who slips him forbidden books when no one is looking the books are his lifeline the reason he chooses to runaway to the library and later with the librarian and the librarian in turn even when the borrowing period is over makes creative plans to ensure that the lifeline will continue a terrific novel for everyone but especially for the readers and runaways in each of us","95":"really enjoyed this quick read laughed at the author's references to familiar children's books like the lost ness of the character in her 20s like the young boy character a lot","96":"this is a delightful novel it is not entirely realistic but novels don't have to be the story is entertaining and the characters are fun to spend time with this is light reading a little romp off the beaten path i enjoyed this book and highly recommend it to anyone looking for a real fictional interlude","97":"if you fell in love with reading as a child this is a book for you while it explores complicated situations it is truly a heartwarming read i can't remember when i enjoyed a book so much","98":"if you ever worked at a library especially as a children's librarian you should read this impressive debut novel twenty pages or so into it and i'm chuckling and nodding wonderful writing style enjoyed 26 year old children's librarian lucy and her abductee 10 year old ian immensely lucy's favorite library patron's parents worry he's gay so cart him off to pastor bob's special youth group where he promises to turn ian straight and normal with god's help lucy seeks to protect ian from this madness to save him in a different way you'll go back and forth as to who's running away and who's in charge lucy's parents' personalities especially her russian mafia father leap off the page too makkai blends humor sadness social commentary hope and that feeling so many share what am i doing here in the strong yet vulnerable voice of lucy many will nod and smile when she speaks of those unforgettable children's books we devoured at ian's age","99":"great kid character great idea for a plot children's librarian tries to save intellectual quirkly kid from his ultra conservative parents not so great development of the great idea but it comes back together at the end","100":"quirky smart and quickly paced","101":"i enjoyed this book it is well written and for readerrs who appreciate children's lit it has some great and clever lines the story focuses on lucy hull a children's librarian and her favorite patron 10 yr old ian who runs away from home to the library in ficticious hannibal mo lucy and ian begin a road trip that take them across country as a librarian i thought makkai got a lot of the details right in this novel i was a little suprised that some librarians were upset with the book because lucy did not have a mls degree i am not upset or offended that lucy does not have an mls i know many many fine librarians who do not have an advanced degree and they all do a terrific job it's a treat to read a clever novel with a children's librarian as one of the main characters","102":"this book was fun the borrower was very well done as a child growing up in the public library and an adult pursuing a masters in library science i found this book especially heart warming the basic premise is that a young librarian named lucy inadvertently kidnaps a ten year old boy named ian i feel that that is all that i can say without giving too much away what made this book so great was the added allusions to popular children's books throughout if you are a lover of books you will love this one","103":"terrific story well written good characters and a fresh clear voice","104":"a children's librarian aids her favorite patron 10 year old ian in running away from his overbearing overly religious mother but the more she gets involved the harder it will be to get out of it without losing her job or going to jail i loved all the references to books i often recommend to my students who love reading and good books the story was fun though it sort of petered out toward the end which seemed a little too easy and convenient enjoyable and original story though","105":"you might have to be a children's book connoisseur to really enjoy this book i loved the clever picture book remakes it dragged in the middle though especially because the reader is pretty confident of the outcome by the end of the first chapter and might have done better as a short story","106":"who's kidnapping who who's really running away who needs saving a quirky fun book with humorous parodies of other books i feel that the topic was too over the top making it heavy handed when it could just have been a fun romp a little too preachy and negative the author is talented and i enjoyed her style could have been 4 5 stars except for the above","107":"this one sucked me in devoured it in less than 24 hours","108":"fun for those who love children's literature and libraries","109":"the best thing about this book is how it plays with other books it's like a mini literature quiz though literature might be too grandiose a word for some of the books there's a little choose your own adventure bit i found myself going yep read that one or huh don't know that book throughout the story the story line itself is thin a young woman takes a road trip with a young library patron who kidnapped whom is a little up in the air she does stuff the kid rides along they get to the end of the road literally and then she sends him home the simple line is padded with interesting things and thoughts which make the book enjoyable why i can't give the book a higher rating i'd go for 2 1 2 if that were possible is that the narrator doesn't change in any perceivable way i guess you could see her as an anti hero in heroic tales the main character is supposed to accomplish something learn something and while i guess she does it's to give up it's not supposed to be hopeless i don't think but it's not an i'm comfortable in my own skin ending or i see a brighter day ahead it's just this happened and now i'm here probably appropriate for our times however a lot of people are just here","110":"children's books rarely have unreliable narrators","111":"fun easy book almost a summer beach read best part was her homage to various children's books as part of her plight my favorite was the house that jack built the mess that lucy made recommended for book lovers and librarians","112":"a compelling page turner about complicated people making questionable choices highly recommended","113":"interesting concept of a single librarian kidnapping a child that she sees as needing a better home how many of us have been in a situation where we look at a child and say if i could only bring him her home i could make such a difference","114":"i enjoyed this book the author has a very clear voice and the characters are rich and well drawn if one or two may seem to be a bit of a stereotype the best way to describe the story i think would be to call it a youth fiction book for grown ups","115":"this book starts with a young boy of 10 an avid reader whose mother forbids him to read anything with deep interest he reads everything but his controlling anorexic mother comes to the library where our heroine lucy hull works and gives librarian lucy a list no wizards no wars no interesting books just those with the breath of god in them he also isn't allowed candy as the book reads you see that the theme in part is about those who paraphrase and pick through the bible for verses they can pervert to their own ends in this instance the part of the bible that says that men should not love men little 10 year old ian is apparently gay and the possibility seems to horrify his parents causing him to be forced into anti gay classes lucy isn't convinced the boy is gay and not sure it matters for a boy this young she connives with him to get him the books he wants checking them out to herself so he can read what interests him she is forbidden to let him read harry potter or pendragon but finds a way to let him read things like this at some stage he breaks wanting to run away like every child at some point in their lives one instance of his rebellion shows up at hallowe'en for the costume contest which i felt was very well written he finds a reluctant accomplice in the librarian who is offended by those who take offense at those who are different and lucy agrees to take ian away from there the story gets a little odd but when lucy meets with her parents we find this is the story of lucy not ian her lack of consideration when she takes off was a bit disconcerting as up to that point she seemed to be the soul of cooperation except for sharing the forbidden books this lack of consideration is at odds with her desire to call back and make sure her role at the library is covered and all tasks performed as they should be as the book progressed i saw that this book was a journey into lucy's personal history and how her knowledge about her parents and their past has influenced her own thoughts on her self and her belief in her future i disliked glenn and thought tim was delightful wondered about rocky and was intrigued by the kgb agent i was a bit annoyed with lucy who seems to hover on the periphery of the people in her life not trying to find out more about people jumping into bed with glenn obeying the rules set out by her landlord tim and just running away with ian but she does grow in the story learning about herself and making some personal growth a great travel book but would probably be annoying on paper","116":"i loved this book just the fact that the author addresses how someone with no mls can be working as a librarian is a triumph really so many good things happening here about the stories we love the stories we tell ourselves the ways we predict our own futures just terrific","117":"this book kind of threw me for a loop at the end i spent much of the novel somewhat frustrated on a variety of levels with the author i even contemplated not finishing then the end sucked me in and i'm much happier for having finished it the moral of the story the finest point i'd certainly recommend this to others","118":"i liked a lot of things about this book but hesitate to give it 4 stars it was well written and replete with literary references that while intelligible were not obnoxious self indulgent or in your face it did seem to have a political agenda gay rights not that there's anything wrong with it but i felt a little preached to which was annoying","119":"both of the main characters in this book are sociopaths and not in the good way","120":"i really really wanted to like this book because its narrator is a children's librarian and it starts in missouri and there's an obvious love for children's literature that literally glows throughout the book the reinterpretations of classic picture books are well thought out and really funny i loved ian drake one of the most awesome and authentic child characters i've seen in adult fiction i just couldn't click with the librarian herself she seems slightly ashamed to be a librarian and to be living in missouri but i honestly couldn't tell quite what caused her ennui and self disgust because i didn't get her i think i kind of missed the point of the long middle section of the novel which is a shame because there are some transcendent moments in the book especially the final chapter and the epilogue","121":"first novel i liked it probably the writing style first then the characters the librarian was someone i liked i would have liked a little more strength and development in the understory thanks mary","122":"loved the premise loved the writing didn't care for or always agree with the author's political views and would rather not be bludgeoned with political views in fiction reading regardless some cautions due to this and some strong language","123":"fun book very imaginative yet very realistic ian and his parents sound like real people in today's world of wackos would like to know more about rocky","124":"left me flat even though i wanted to love it saving graces gems abound for librarian readers and anyone who has evern enjoyed a wacky roadtrip with a friend from another generation","125":"fun quick read i was done in three days i think this is a record for me","126":"boy did i love this book lucy hull is a children's librarian in hannibal missouri in general she lacks drive--she keeps doing her job because she enjoys it but she doesn't really want to pursue anything else she keeps personal relationships at arm's length and she doesn't care that her life is fairly boring but all that changes as she deals with one of the library's most voracious readers 10 year old ian drake when ian's evangelical mother tells lucy she only wants ian reading books that contain the breath of god in them as well as those that focus on stereotypically masculine characters and don't include magic or fantasy lucy helps ian check out the forbidden books in secret and when lucy finds out that ian's parents are sending him to religious classes in order to cure him of any potential ssad same sex attraction disorder when he gets older she doesn't know how to help him one morning she arrives at the library to find ian camped out with a knapsack of provisions including his pool pass if he needs to show identification somehow he part convinces part threatens lucy to take him on a road trip and lucy sees this as an opportunity to free ian of the restrictions being placed upon him by his mother yet the road trip like much of lucy's life doesn't have much of a plan and ian starts trying to lead her all over the country they head from hannibal through chicago to pittsburgh and vermont as lucy tries to rationalize her actions and draw ian into telling her he needs her help and along the way lucy learns a little bit more about herself and her family which she has always kept a distance from and how what you think is the truth is never quite absolutely true while clearly implausible in many ways this was a terrific story it had the potential to be preachy but it skated around the controversial issues fairly well and while i felt that rebecca makkai made lucy's russian family and friends seem a bit stereotypical i felt that the rest of the characters in this book were unique complex and fallible--you wanted to know their story and you grew to care about them even if you didn't like them 100 percent i would have liked to have known what happened to ian as he grew up even though that might have killed some of the book's magic but overall i really really enjoyed this any book about the love of books does right by me","127":"not something i'd recommend to everyone it would most likely offend my more conservative christian friends but perfect for the right reader it really resonated with me because i felt a strong connection to the main character a young woman in her 20s immersed in the world of books trying to figure out her place in the world overall the story was engaging and well written and it ended on a note that enforced the power of books and reading a belief i always love to see acknowledged","128":"so far this book is really annoying not sure if i'll finish giving up on this one","129":"i enjoyed the librarian elements and the book references the story takes some weird turns but kept drawing me in with these nuggets of self discovery and truths a great road trip too","130":"i just flat out loved this book from all of the literary references to the ridiculous road trip it was a great read","131":"children`s librarian and 10 yr old reader who kidnaps who must read for children`s librarians books can save you","132":"lucy hull a young children's librarian in hannibal missouri finds herself both kidnapper and kidnapped when her favorite patron ten year old ian drake runs away from home why would a librarian listen to a ten year old and ruin her life it may seem kind of unbelievable but i could see myself doing it you have to be very insecure and never want to disappoint someone so if the boy asked me to do something i'd do it just so he wouldn't hate me about half way through the book some aspects of the librarian's family history are revealed and you can see she is very sheltered and gullible the title makes no sense unless it plays off the book \"the borrowers\" which is mentioned in the book and which i have never read is it the same as the movie \"the borrowers\" or maybe the librarian is borrowing the boy who knows i'm just saying don't dismiss the book because of the title she tends at times to be philosophical psychological trying to figure out why she does the things she does and predict why she will do the things she will do won't have kids because she won't want to feel what these parents must have felt i've never done this before i finished the book and started to read it again what does that say about this book i guess because the book didn't end the way i expected it to so i went back to see if i missed something","133":"this book is all about right and wrong only it is poorly written it follows a children's librarian as she runs away with a young gay boy to keep him away from his homophobic parents she plays right into his hand the librarian was more the child than the boy it irritated me to no end any adult would have given the child a safe place to talk and even maybe helped him find pflag however an adult would not allow a small child to talk her into taking him on a crosscountry adventure without any reparations or even getting caught lucy the librarian was boring as an individual and it was horrid being inside her head she could barely make the correct decisions for herself let alone for a child don't bother just talk to any indefinite adolescent of the recent generation","134":"i left the book somewhere and haven't had a chance to get it back sigh i was enjoying it","135":"really enjoyed this probably read it far too quickly over a weekend because i was enjoying the story so much ian the 10 year old protagonist doesn't always talk like a 10 year old but the dialog was funny and fitting enough that i was willing to overlook it","136":"as someone who spent much of her early childhood wanting to be a librarian until i was 12 or 13 this was a wonderful book of adventure and emotions although the idea of a children's librarian kidnapping a child is rather farfetched it comes under the suspend your dis belief don't let that keep you from reading this story makkai does a wonderful job of creating a sense of place whether it is a mid size midwest town and it's cultural environment or church street in burlington vt or the house of russian immigrants in pittsburgh her characters are quirky and sympathetic and fun to read about for me the book was about two things how the environment you grow up in shapes your view of the world in ways you don't necessarily understand until later on in life and how people who are a part of that life can leave a last effect you may try to escape that past but ultimately what are you trying to escape from","137":" forget that that the book is decidedly liberal forget that it's anti george dubya bush forget that it's pretty much anti evangelical a librarian should not be so obsessed with a 10 year old boy and her infatuation with the boy starts the book out on the creepy foot everyone has decided from the get go that poor 10 year old ian drake is bound to become some kind of homosexual including his parents so ian goes to anti gay classes and russian american librarian lucy hull hulkinov wants to save ian problem is lucy's not a very interesting character she tries to convince us she is but she's really not i finished the book only because it was a book club selection lucy's obsession with ian however hits a high point when she and ian hit the road from hannibal missouri and drive across the country to vermont with stops in chicago and pittsburgh they somehow kidnap each other except what happens along the way isn't really all that interesting somewhat interesting characters like glenn lucy's sort of boyfriend and rocky walters readers are unsure of lucy's romantic status with him are dropped in only to be disposed of thoughtlessly by the end of the book to be honest i wasn't sure what glenn added to the story except for a twist during one scene lucy makes it all the way to vermont with ian and how will she and ian get back to missouri well she put him on a greyhound bus with some reliable former ex kgb operative lucy however decides to hightail it back to chicago where her parents live and loaf around for a while leaving her job in hannibal as a children's librarian lucy learns she can't change ian and i think the road trip was a symbolic journey that was supposed to change her and it somewhat does but as a reader i don't care i am not invested in lucy her father is an interesting character but lucy herself is not as interesting i guess this is a long enough review there were some good parts to the book i'd give it 2 5 stars but the ending was disappointing to me especially since lucy technically didn't have to own up to anything or face any consequences for her actions the beginning didn't capture me either it might have made for a more interesting book if she'd confronted ian's parents but that's just me","138":"i couldn't stand the kid in this and kept calling the heroine a dumbass in my head the whole book i initially only gave it 3 stars cause lets face it i will probably never again find a book in which the main character is from chicago young and a children's librarian just like me except i am not a dumbass as the book wore on i came to like the story much more but it took a while","139":"i really liked this book at times suspension of disbelief was difficult this normally is not an issue for me i love to read sci fi but i think it came through because the writer was concerned about the lack of believability the writing was very strong though i really liked her voice and her turn of phrase plus all her references to youth literature were delightful additions i always love reading writers who love books i especially liked this paragraph i believed that books might save him because i knew they had so and because i knew the people books had saved they were college professors and actors and scientists and poets they got to college and sat on dorm floors drinking coffee amazed they'd finally found their soul mates they always dressed a little out of season their names were enshrined on the pink cards in the pockets of all the forgotten hardbacks in every library basement in america if the librarians were lazy enough or nostalgic enough or smart enough those names would stay there forever","140":"lucy hull a young children's librarian in hannibal missouri finds herself both a kidnapper and kidnapped when her favorite patron ten year old ian drake runs away from home this was a wonderful quirky funny and a little far fetched novel that i thoroughly enjoyed i loved both the characters but especially ian lucy made me want to be a children's librarian you just have to go with this story line not object with too much logic and enjoy the ride","141":"i wavered between really liking this book and being frustrated with it worth a look i was a fan of the literary references though","142":"oddly this reminded me of special topics in calamity physics which i also enjoyed despite it being overlong","143":"the borrower may well be the most rewarding book i've read this year while the plot itself a children's librarian accidentally kidnaps her favorite young patron in her efforts to save him from his overly evangelical mother appears disturbing the smart reader will know that it is the story beneath the plot that is important makkai's recurring themes of running away and self discovery are reinforced with great writing and literary allusions to classic children's literature my favorite part of the entire book is the author's witty mimicry of eric carle's the hungry caterpillar on monday the bewildered librarian and the very strange child had a three musketeers bar a coke some pringles a greasy pepperoni pizza and two cheeseburgers but they kept driving all in all the borrower is an excellent book that warrants rereading to catch all of the goodies the author has carefully placed within the story","144":"chalk me up as one of the people who couldn't stop thinking but this is child abduction it's not a bad book i managed to finish it in less than a day just as long as readers don't think too hard about the ramifications of the central characters' actions it's a fun read lucy hull the head children's librarian at the small public library of hannibal missouri and recently graduated from college is worried about one of her patrons a ten year old boy whose parents belong to a fundamentalist christian church the parents especially his helicopter mother limit what he reads to books with the breath of god biographies factual books about animals tales from the bible and the like his mother monitors his activities in the library and any books he brings home from same forcing him to return unread everything she considers unacceptable many children's classics and popular works such as the harry potter series and most of roald dahl to compound lucy's worries she discovers that his parents have enrolled him in a pray away the gay after school program as they think he's at risk of becoming gay things come to a head when she arrives at the library first thing one morning to discover that ian's snuck into the library and stayed the night there camping out in the children's department and reading all the forbidden books to his heart's content she hustles him into her car intending to take him straight home but he refuses to tell her where he lives instead they end up going on a road trip of sorts first to her parents' apartment in chicago then to deliver a package to her father's friend in pennsylvania and ending up in northern vermont penniless i wanted to like the book more than i did it's a well written book this may be makkai's first novel but it's not her first fiction writing and that shows enough that i'll almost certainly read her subsequent works makkai's adaptation of various easily recognizable children's books to the problems the characters in this book face are amusing unfortunately the characters weren't terribly well developed the objectionable parents have no redeeming qualities whatsoever we're supposed to hate them because the author finds such people annoying and some of the plot points bother me for starters makkai doesn't seem to have a firm grasp on library operations or at least doesn't evidence it in the book lucy needn't rely on ian for his address and phone numbers pretty much every library i've ever known kept a record of the patrons' names and addresses1 all lucy need have done is log into the library's circulation system and bob's your uncle her lack of any advanced degree in library science isn't quite that large a problem though her lack of experience cheeses me off in smaller libraries only one or two staff members will have an m l s the child abduction aspect is another minefield while it's not entirely clear who's abducting whom in the book legally lucy's in the wrong all the libraries i know have fairly strict rules about what staff may do with children and popping them in your car to drive them home without notifying another staff member the parents or the police is a no no the fact that ian's a reasonably willing partner if not the instigator of the escapade does make enough of a difference to allow me to at least finish the book although i would have liked to know more about his motivations he seems to want to get away from his parents but in the end returns willingly to them and even suggests he do so i don't know enough about the russian immigrant experience to go into any detail about that although lucy's family and family friends struck me as being off i'm not going to touch the curing homosexuality aspect at all i just hope she trots any subsequent books past members of the groups involved before she submits the work s to a publisher balancing plot construction against character development will come with time 1to confirm whether the patron's in the library's service area to call when a book they've requested has come in or has an overdue or has signed up for an upcoming event or","145":"absolutely brilliant","146":"i only ready the first 60 pages or so and skimmed the rest i didn't buy the plot at all the main character is pathetic and a little whiny there are a lot of coincidences in the plot and it felt a little heavy handed in full disclosure i am a librarian so that might be a reason i had such a big problem with it i just didn't find it realistic and an adult who gets tricked by a 10 year old even a smart 10 year old should be working at a fast food joint and not a library","147":"compelling central character and not just because she's a librarian loved the literary allusions at the front the off kid in a small town and the wanting for the best of it i was amused by the rest of the story got a little fed up with the journey half way through but was charmed enough to keep going til the end enjoyed the message and the whimsy","148":"3 5 pretty good","149":"love a good librarian turns out this is a not a real librarian no mls degree as far as story absurd didn't engage me","150":"i really enjoyed this story about a children's librarian and a misunderstood ten year old boy with very clever renditions of childhood classics like goodnight moon and a very hungry caterpillar that made me laugh out loud it dragged a tad bit toward the end or i would have given in five stars","151":"this book was based on a cool premise and had some funny moments but a cool premise and some funny moments do not a great novel make the main character a stereotypical millenial has the stereotypical millenial problem a disappointing sense that she's not in control of her own life combined with a crippling fear of accepting any consequences of taking control the plot happens to her more than she makes it happen this might make her an exemplary model of her generation but it also makes her a crummy protagonist i often felt like makkai wanted so badly to write a novel so now so zeitgeisty that no publisher could bear to pass it up that she wrote with a ripped from the liberal blogosphere headlines circa 2006 checklist tacked to her wall fundamentalist christians check helicopter parents check reparative therapy check patriot act check though the book was released three months ago as of this writing it already feels dated not in the sense that its references are outdated but in the sense that it was written for now not for posterity one hundred years from now humans will still be reading shakespeare but they probably won't be reading the borrower if you enjoy this book and want something even better or if this book leave you disappointed and you know it can be done better i recommend handling sin by michael malone","152":"this interesting character study has a strong beginningbut this reader found the central road trip to be a littletoo long a good first novel","153":"average rating by group members was 2 5","154":"now i have a huge heartachey need to be in the library of my childhood rereading about 100 books and sitting on the industrial carpet and smelling the distinctive smell of library floorwax and woodpolish and touching the spines of thousands of stories four lovely stars despite some initial irritation with the voice and the constant nervous why why why at lucy's many bad decisions wonderful","155":"i personally liked it i would warn you it can feel long in the middle but everything has its own purpose so please be patient with this book it's the hope that made me like this book i think you'll like that part of the book the best","156":"is it a kidnapping when the child is the one instigating the escape our erstwhile kidnapper librarian makes plenty of bad decisions in this novel but her motives are admirable if misguided a misunderstood child and our kidnapper librarian make quite the pair","157":"enjoyed much of it but less than i thought i would overall the book is children's librarian bait with lots of references to children's books and libaries and would be very good for discussion lots to talk about","158":"it was a much different book and much more readable than i expected after the first paragraph i quite loved it especially how elements that initially seemed absurd ultimately fit seamlessly into the highly realistic plot will read more makkai","159":"entertaining and fun particularly for the children's lit references requires a willing suspension of disbelief but it's fiction so that's not necessarily a bad thing in my opinion thoroughly enjoyed it","160":"not feeling the love for this one","161":"it's funny how the format in which i purchase a new book predetermines how much i assume i will like it if i find a novel in the grocery store a small paperback or out of the bargain section i assume it will be cheap and forgettable a trade paperback can be of high quality or not depending on if it was on sale and hard cover books purchased at full price will always be amazing achievements of timeless quality and ever life changing i know this is totally illogical i mean all of the plum mystery books and every piece of crap written by james patterson is first available at full price and in hard cover and those are all awful i purchased this particular novel from the full price hard cover ritzy shelf during border book's going out of business extravaganza so i assumed it would be wonderful and so i am somewhat disappointed instead of a literary masterpiece i found an air head protagonist and other obvious and stereotypical characters practically nothing in this book was believable however the story was wrapped up quite well despite its unbelievability the end was touching and quite hopeful the borrowers it turns out had the unique ability to be both an adventure story and end with a very important lesson to always be yourself","162":"i really liked this book i loved the literary references the author made as you read it just go along and enjoy the ride","163":"a road buddy story with the unlikely characters of a children's librarian and a precocious patron i loved the quirky characters the anti brainwashing message and the note of hope at the end of the story i didn't think it was hilarious as the book jacket suggested but it supplied a few grins the references to treasured children's books supplies a nice warm fuzzy librarian feeling","164":"quirky book with quirky characters","165":"this was a fun book it was recommended to me and i am glad it was it is the tale of a children's librarian named lucy who kidnaps is kidnapped by a 10 year old boy named ian they run away together on this cross country trip from hannibal missouri to vermont along the way they have encounters with her russian mafia father her boyfriend glenn and a variety of people i am not sure if the journey was more of a self discovery for ian or lucy but i think lucy she discovers more about herself and her family history i am not sure if ian really learns anything but atleast he gets away from his family for awhile there is a message here about being who you are and that it is ok to be gay and books are great all good messages and not shoved down your throat they are told with humor and insight i liked the characters in the book they are quirky and fun i have to admit that the book did start out pretty slow for me and didn't really pick up until they hit the road which was about 1 3 1 2 way into the book but the story was fun and enjoyable not very realistic but fun i was a little shaky about the ending because there didn't seem to be any consequences for either lucy or ian and it was just a bit too easy but overall it was a good book i would recommend it to my library friends","166":"a quirky novel about a librarian who kidnaps a young boy who comes into her library because his religious family is sending him to pre emptive same sex attraction disorder therapy recommended to librarians and bibliophiles who like out of the ordinary fiction","167":"for anyone who loves reading and who loves for kids to read a different tale","168":"brilliant and i read it one sleep deprived night","169":"a very compelling and enjoyable read about the madcap adventure of a 10 year old boy and a 26 year old librarian a witty lovely read with a lot of references to books i liked it very much","170":"a book for book lovers","171":"i had a hard time getting through this book it's an easy enough read and it has some light hearted moments but it's hard to get around the main character's snarky judgemental outlook also the plot development stays pretty shallow and at the end of the book the reader is left scratching one's head about the ultimate message should really be","172":"this is one of those novels i was supposed to love but didn't there were glimmers of brilliance but it never materialized for me it's a preachy novel i have no problem with criticism of right wing evangelical christianity but the borrower didn't bring any new ideas to the table or talk about the issue in a new way despite its far fetched plot the heart of the novel was hardly new or different i share many of the narrator's qualms and opinions about right wing politics but i don't enjoy reading novels that just pander to or repeat popular opinion challenge my assumptions change the way i think don't just cater to what your readers already know and believe i also felt absolutely no connection with the protagonist so much so that i constantly forgot her name she just wasn't a very interesting person to live inside for the length of a novel her character development her insights her growth all seemed routine on the part of the author woman goes on journey of self discovery woman discovers truths about herself woman grows sort of like the simplistic political views in the novel lucy didn't strike me as a very complicated or unique protagonist i originally rated this book at 2 stars but the ending saved it for me funny because a lot of other reviewers didn't like the ending for me it was the perfect ending not because of lucy i still don't care much about what she learned or how she grew but for ian what other ending could there be sometimes things just end not happily not unhappily ambiguity is part of life i loved that lucy's last gifts to ian were reading lists for each year of his adolescence i don't happen to agree with lucy's dismissal of the idea that you can never go home again home isn't a place it's a concept and it changes the moment you leave it so no i still don't think you can ever actually go home again i enjoyed the borrower more before and after the road trip while they were actually on the road the novel seemed aimless and directionless and i found myself just waiting for it to end somehow in the mushy middle i didn't think this novel would leave me with something valuable and i was half right as i said above glimmers of brilliance but the novel never shone","173":"really liked this book i disagree that the librarian was stereotypical and the kid reminded me of many 10 year olds nerds i've met as stated in another review this book isn't for everyone","174":"loved this book","175":"there's something to be said about this book it was weird not hugely weird it's just an interesting concept i liked it but i don't think i'd read again quickly","176":"i started out thinking i was really going to like this book lots of good children's book references adventure and the like however i was very much thrown off by the abduction portion of the book as i found myself questioning the reality of it all while the authotr's intentions were good my originally higher rating dropped as i read further tho she did do a decent job of wrapping things up","177":"this book is just so much fun for a children's librarian the protagonist often frames her experiences in classic children's book format including a hilarious version of goodnight moon","178":"this one had me lost me then had me again book lovers will find a lot to relate to realists and anti neurotics won't","179":"really ended up loving this book","180":"i loved everything about this book i loved that ian had someone to escape with when he needed to that his comfort was found through reading and that lucy needed ian as much as ian needed lucy it sucked me in and refused to let go until i finished it","181":"there was something really appealing about this story it was such a goofy different premise that i think the originality of it paired with the references to children's books made it a compelling read for me there were very different underlying themes religion family moral dilemmas friendship that didn't completely mesh but in the end it worked what didn't work for me was ian he was written both too old and too young not totally off the mark for a 10 year old i suppose i liked that he was not mainstream as that is part of the premise of the book and the relationship between him and lucy was funny and strange but there was just something that didn't quite work for me about him maybe it's just that i have a 10 year old and i'm comparing too much to what's in front of me regardless an interesting quick original read recommended","182":"the borrower is a book which creeps up on you with it's intelligence wit and heart at its core this is a tribute to books to a deep love of reading beyond that ms makkai gives us a strong if lost narrator who truly makes you fall in love with our flawed broken world this book isn't a page turner you will not rush to finish it but it's better that way it sneaks up on you and by the end you will feel rather as if you have gone there and back again yourself but most of all you will be reminded that not all stories have idealistic endings but perhaps not all stories need endings at all","183":"i really wanted to like this book i like books about books and libraries this particular story just did not ring true the librarian basically runs away with a little boy to rescue him from his parents who send him to classes to ungay him while i would want to rescue any child in that situation driving him half way across the country and sending him back home on a greyhound bus with a former kgb agent isn't the right way to go i enjoyed all the book references that are scattered throughout and despite the fact i didn't believe there was any way it could have ended the way it did i went from disliking the librarian lucy to liking her a lot i really loved the final thing she did for ian my problem is i didn't start liking lucy or the book till the end","184":"i enjoyed the beginning of this book and it certainly had some charming moments but i feel that the author lost steam along with the main character at about the 3 4 mark i finished the book because i wanted to read how the situation was resolved but i was really looking forward to finishing not a good sign i may look for some of her short stories that may be a stronger form for this writer","185":"i so loved this book i may have to reread it again before school starts a great journey story both in place and of self discovery combined with wry references to children's literature","186":"i loved this story especially the message that books can save you","187":"i loved this book from the first page and all the way through witty humorous touching i will read more of this rebecca makkai's work nina read this","188":"an interesting tale of a children's library who happens to kidnap a young boy full of humorous connections interpretations of children's stories woven into this humorous tale","189":"cute book the local children's librarian takes a road trip ie kidnaps with her best reader who may or may not be a gay 10 year old boy after his parents take him to reform classes amusing read","190":"i enjoy books about how books change or improve someone's life this was excellent","191":"unrealistic but very well written i couldn't quite bring myself to give it four stars despite my usual rule of giving a debut novel a one star bump but is an impressive effort for some the underlying subject matter will be a turn off and it does feel as if the author had a clear agenda she was putting forth but good writing coverith a multitude of sins","192":"a book about a noble librarian who helps a child escape a bad situation at home sign me up unfortunately as the novel wore on i had a hard time believing or caring what was to become of the librarian and found the mini chapters based on kids books choose your own adventure if you give a librarian a closet etc slightly irritating also this book will inevitably lead to more people believing librarian stereotypes","193":"i loved this quirky little book it's an adventure story featuring a librarian and a 10 year old runaway supporting characters include a composer russian mobsters theater people and religious zealots it's a feel good novel for people who love books","194":"i gave up on the borrower after reading 100 pages the main character lucy hull is a children's librarian in a dead end town in missouri she finds herself both as a the kidnapper and kidnapped when her favorite patron a 10 year old runs away from home the two head out on a road trip to vermont the title is described as smart and engaging uproariously funny and an electrifying debut maybe it gets better after 100 pages i couldn't stick it out lucy hull analyzes everything about her inane life she's bored and boring the story moves along at a snail's pace i am moving on to my next book","195":"i liked the plot but sometimes there was too much inner dialogue too wordy for me loved the use of children's books within the context of the story","196":"i enjoyed the plot and characters it was like no other book i have read before as a reader it was fun to see a library from a librarian's point of view","197":"as a librarian who has worked hard and is still working hard to complete the professional qualification i find the possiblity of an unqualified person of her age and apparently not crb checked running the children's library to be very unfeasible p 163 he sang with a british accent there is no such thing as a british accent for the millionth bloody time this book is a bit confused there is some sweet stuff about the salvation of books but i just think it fell short of what i hoped for","198":"it took me a while to get into this but by the end i cared about what was going to happen to young ian and and his sort of kidnapper librarian friend lucy in one sense it's a road book in another sense it's a journey into the heart of lucy's family the question being can any of us ever truly reinvent ourselves well drawn characters and a successfully meandering plot a good book","199":"i got a real kick out of this book i loved the boy ian drake just loved him we should all be so lucky to know a kid like ian the story was a little far fetched and would likely never happen but hey it's fiction","200":"i suspect i'm giving this 4 stars because of its magnificent applicability to my own life no i'm not about to start taking off on long road trips with avid readers who might be experiencing emotional if not physical abuse at home but the belief of makkai's heroine that reading changes lives and that every pain can be healed or at least anesthetized by reading yep that would be me while the ending is somewhat of a letdown it is in keeping with children's librarian lucy hull's odd apathy she falls into librarianship almost by accident and discovers a deep and abiding love for children's literature and her young readers among those readers is ian drake an odd duck who lives to read but is hampered by an evangelical mother who insists on his reading only the most vanilla of children's books when ian is discovered by lucy early one morning having spent the night at the library in an attempt to run away she must choose whether to do the conventional thing and return him to his parents or aid him in his escape her choice and its consequences well you'll have to read the book makkai's gentle irony is a far cry from the overwrought stylings of most literary fiction today lucy's distinct voice reflects a generation accustomed to success but unsure of its real value ian's voice rings true as well but the apathy that congeals like cold oatmeal eventually leaves the reader with unsatisfied tastebuds and a wish that lucy would just get out from behind that checkout desk and do something","201":" i couldn't stop reading and i loved the references to both children and adult novels the child ian was wonderful i loved his quirks and reading habit and his determination to leave his parents' craziness i'm not sure about the ending it's a wizard of oz ending not sure about that but i cared about both ian and lucy and i couldn't stop reading why is that what about the book was so compelling i haven't figured it out but it was","202":"a children's librarian finds herself kidnapping a young wily patron and then can't figure out how to return him very well written","203":"what a marvelous book just loved it","204":"a quirky first novel about a librarian and the 10 year old who mutually kidnap each other very entertaining","205":"this would make a good book for discussion how do we encourage growth in a student while respecting the family unit do we really know the circumstances in any one person's life do we have all the answers is the truth somewhere in between i appreciated the book for drawing out these questions and i definitely appreciated so many of the somewhat quirky characters especially ian however one has to suspend reality a bit to buy in to the kidnapping situation it was a creative story however and i especially appreciated the librarian's desire to help ian discover the world through reading","206":"i really enjoyed this beautifully written without being precious and so wryly intertextual in the best way a wonderful debut novel","207":"i received this book from goodreads to review so where do i begin this was a book that was difficult for me to like the storyline seemed to need something more and i kept waiting for the plot to quicken a little to account for lucy a librarian kidnapping a ten year old boy named ian because of her disapproval of how the mother was raising her son lucy herself seemed to be just as naive and prejudiced as ian's mother which led me to be annoyed with both","208":"loved this book yes mostly because the heroine was a children's librarian who was not a conservative gray haired shushing school marm but a smart funny and slightly nutty liberal with good intentions","209":"parts of this books were wonderful loved all the references to children's books throughout but the story was just too far fetched and lucy was not a particularly sympathetic character liked the ending with the lists hidden in the magazine","210":"read for a book club discussion which should be really good considering the controversial topics in this book the main character lucy annoyed me throughout the book i loved the little boy and worry about his future his parents are my worst nightmare","211":"ian drake a ten year old boy and frequent public library book borrower is friends with lucy hull the young children's librarian who knows he's not allowed to borrow books that don't agree with his mother's ultra christian views sometimes lucy checks these very books out for him in her own name one morning miss hull finds ian has camped out in the library overnight and is ready for an adventure lucy hull allows herself to get hijacked from hannibal missouri and borrows ian for a while so that she can get him away from his parents and pastor bob who runs the anti gay classes ian's mother has enrolled ian in to get saved lucy and ian's crazy road trip takes them to some interesting adventures in chicago vermont and the canadian border but all the while lucy knows there's no place like home for ian throughout the journey the author cleverly refers to children's books and even uses their writing styles in paradies and reminds us that when people fail us books can save us","212":"okay not great i liked all of the popular children and young adult fiction references but i thought that the title lacked creativity and that it was completely unrealistic","213":"librarian helps a little boy runaway from home incredibly unique story some truly emotional moments","214":"a well written story with lots of affectionate references to many children's classics the borrower is largely concerned with boundries or lack thereof ian a 10 year old boy who loves to read is smart enough to create a co dependant relationship with a young librarian his mother wants him to read only books with the breath of god in them also she sends him to an anti gay class the librarian has different ideas she secretly checks classics out on her own card for him and tries to subtly give him the message that whoever he may be is just fine all of this leads to the 2 of them heading out on a road trip away for quite some time good intentions run completely amuck a thought provoking read","215":"3 5 stars overall i enjoyed the quirkiness of this book about a 26 year old librarian who ends up on a road trip borderline kidnapping escapade with a 10 year old but i never found either of the main characters that compelling and couldn't figure out why lucy was letting herself get bullied by ian","216":"this is a book lover's book filled with references to literature glad i didn't know the plot before reading it or it would have changed my expectation of it","217":"meh i wanted to like it but i it lacked the ability to make me believe","218":"loved it i want to be the narrator","219":"a good summer read about librarians libraries and the power of reading but in a fictional novel my favorite take away is not the characters or plot but the message stories can get children and adults through touch life situations intact and librarians have often been and can still be the conduit by which those books are delivered the story contains at gtlb story line and some wonderfully crafted statements on intellectual freedom and the freedom to read","220":"a new author good book but it would slow down every once in awhile not sure i liked the ending but don't think i can tell you how i think it should have ended","221":"i could not put this one down i read it in one very long sitting and have the backache to prove it riveting amazing heartwarming and gives insight into what's perceived as right and wrong","222":"i loved this novel about a librarian and a 10 year old boy who share a love of books","223":"i picked up this book from a display at the library and had just begun to look at the blurb when a librarian passing by announced oh you'll love that book several on our staff have read it and it's great i can see why she was so enthusiastic anyone who has worked with children in the library has probably had a similar experience though for me it was many years ago the child you're concerned about but you know there's not much you can do to help in this case the librarian is lucy and the child is ian things get complicated when ian runs away from home and ends up staying over night in the library lucy plans to take him home but somehow forgets they have ian's address and phone number in their library records and ian won't tell her where he lives has lucy kidnapped ian or has ian librarian napped lucy the farther they stray from home the harder it is to turn back","224":"this was recommended to me by the librarian lucy is a small town children's librarian who doesn't seem to have much excitement in her life she begins to worry about a little boy who frequents the children's section ian because of marks on his face and an email she finds ian is a kid who might be perceived as gay lucy finds out that his parents take him to a special youth group for kids like him one day she comes into the library and finds that ian has run away from home to the library she tries to drive him home but ends up leaving the state a fun road trip ensues this was an interesting read but there were many moments where i thought what is she thinking","225":"slow very rarely engaging the narrator is a pathetic and annoying and says insulting romanticized and pejorative things about libraries and what they mean i didn't make it through the whole thing","226":"this book was really hard to get into first of all it was very unbelievable can a 26 year old woman really be that clueless and spineless it was long boring and didn't even have a very satisfactory conclusion","227":"this was fantastic it is one of the best most delightful books i have read in 2011 i fell in love with both of the main characters the book was clever and charming the references to various books primarily children's fiction were very enjoyable as i read the last few paragraphs two thoughts flashed into my mind 1 maybe i should become a children's librarian and 2 i can't wait to read this author's next work","228":"really good and interesting made me think about a lot i loved ian lol","229":"as a former librarian i really enjoyed this book","230":"wonderfully quirky characters and unusual story fun to read","231":"this is a little gem of a story filled with wonderful characters a compelling subject and a worldly humor that i totally enjoyed lucy hull a children's librarian in hannibal mo is a young woman whose life is floundering until she meets 10 yr old ian drake who changes her life dramatically i loved lucy u0026amp her russian immigrant family by the way it is lucy's coming of age story in the end and any lover of reading will enjoy this story","232":"loved this book very clever play on favorite children's books interesting topic and unusual way of having the story unfold","233":"originally published at www apatchworkofbooks comthough the plot of this wonderful little novel is completely ridiculous unbelievable and completely not plausible i loved it the bookish quotes and references were perfect for my personality and fit into the story perfectly i loved the characters the slow moving plot and the emotional descriptions makkai used fun narration i thought bauer's voice was perfect for the book and for what i imagined lucy to sound like young enough to still be naive without sounding like a little girl","234":"interesting read i couldn't see how this would wind up and it ended in a way i never would have thought of i liked the author's sarcastic style but at times i felt the novel drag a little still liked it overall","235":"this was absolutely delightful","236":"five stars woo hoo i loved this book probably because i could really relate to the narrator a hip young librarian like moi and i adored the little boy it was a great ride which i couldn't put down","237":"enchanting well written well plotted and hey it's about a librarian how could i not approve","238":"this came highly recommended from a few friends and i tried to look beyond the atrocious cover artwork that suggested it was a pathetic self published e book and have an open mind i had heard as well that a willing suspension of all disbelief is required to truly enjoy the book as the protagonist literally throws her life away to transport a ten year old boy she hardly knows across state lines when he runs away from home these trappings are typically the type of thing that makes me roll my eyes through a book but there certainly is a lot of heart to this novel the book doesn't do much to hide the author's agenda here lucy a twenty six year old daughter of russian immigrants who takes a job as in the children's section of the public library in hannibal missouri is struggling to find her place in the world she took the job on a whim partly to escape her pseudo mafia father and she quickly becomes far too focused on a ten year old boy named ian who she discovers is likely being sent to a religious conversion camp for potentially gay children where they are conditioned to heterosexuality lucy is aghast as makkai expects the reader to be and when ian runs away she takes the opportunity to run away with him the plot devices here are a bit clunky and overly convenient after leaving town with only the clothes on her back lucy has conveniently left her passport at her parents house in chicago view spoiler also lucy had a gay friend in high school who committed suicide hide spoiler and she feels somewhat guilty over the incident her snippets of the backstory that are peppered throughout the book though hold true to the difficulties good kids face when encountering homophobia and other bullying in schools though she writes at one point that the view spoiler death had been my fault as much as anybody's and there were things i could have said and when brian willis made a joke in calculus about how darren was late because somebody dropped their soap in the locker room shower i could have stood up and punched him in his swollen freckled face hide spoiler while wholly true and realistic all of this is never sufficiently developed to provide the basis for her cross country road trip and kidnapping similarly we never really discover why exactly ian runs away it's hard to believe that a ten year old who clearly doesn't understand his own sexual identity yet is escaping a camp where they teach the bible and how much god wants the boys to act like manly men there are hints of some psychological abuse but again is a ten year old really capable of breaking the cycle of such subtle oppression aside from the various elements of absurdity the basis here is a great idea and i wonder if a more gifted writer would have created something truly special as it is i didn't hate the read but i do worry that it is for sexuality what some view to kill a mockingbird is for race some argue that the problem with harper lee's masterpiece is that contemporary white readers identify wholly with atticus when the reality is that in the circumstances very few people would have the strength and fortitude to do what he does then with so many self identified atticus finches running around we all start to think race is no longer a problem i worry that people read books like this and identify with lucy while never realizing how flawed she is without addressing those flaws within ourselves and standing up to the brian willises in the world well in advance of needing to kidnap a child to protect his sexual identity not a whole lot will change","239":"although i did like this book very much i found it difficult to decide just what the author was trying to say with it lucy seems unable to form a plan and stick with it and also unable to function as the responsible adult at times the basic questions of who we are what we can change in life and what is actually true are certainly raised and worth thinking about some of the humorous parts such as the ferret shampoo were laugh out loud funny the beginning and the end seemed rather contrived even so i would recommend this book to friends who enjoy reading and believe books can bring insight into everyday life","240":"interesting story but i felt like the author was focused too much at times on showing us all the books she has read","241":"3 5 stars author seems to have a dim view of librarians however the story was original and i loved how she would insert kids book esque vignettes into the overall composition","242":"i love the authentic voice of the child in this novel and also appreciated makkai's many allusions to various works of literature fun and charming read","243":"oh where to start i just couldn't buy into the premise no matter how much i really tried when you have a book that essentially a two hander you need to like both characters lucy just irritated me too much for that to happen which is too bad because the book parodies and games are charming lucy is the head children's librarian at a small public library in missouri reporting to an alcoholic director living over a small theatre and no real direction in life one of the children that comes into her space is ian a voracious reader unfortunately ian's family is some flavor of evangelical and his mother comes down to the children's area demanding that he not be allowed to borrow books that didn't have the breath of god in them the paranormal for example including classics like tuck everlasting ian rebels by hiding the books he's borrowing and lucy abets by checking them out under her own name lucy and her friends sophie and rocky suspect that ian is gay and when lucy learns that ian is being sent to a sexual rehabilitation camp she's eager to do something to help him escape what she now feels is a horrible abusive home one day her chance arrives ian's run away much like claudia and jamie do only he's hidden in the library instead of the met for reasons that elude lucy and the reader she decides to take him home a trip that ends up in vermont near the candaian border she also lies about her whereabouts who ian is and where she's going what she's doing there's much here to delight if you give a librarian a closet for example but lucy's motivations bothered me as did her demeanor i'm not going to get into the argument over her even being a librarian she doesn't have her mls nor is she in library school or her feeling that the first amendment trumps all even the second amendment it was more her certitude that she was saving ian who clearly wanted an adventure but seemed to not see that he needed saving per se and her clumsy handling of how to save him in addition to her eagerness to believe in the power of story to the extent that i think she buys into the kidnapping because it's just another story i'm sure i'll be alone in this which is fine arc provided by publisher","244":"the premise is a little far fetched but the plot kept me reading so that i finished this book in one evening","245":"a few months after starting off with great enthusiasm actually decided it was a waste of my time and stopped reading about halfway through the premise is good but the story itself is lackluster and just boring","246":"lucy hull is a children's librarian in a small town in the mid west not by choice but because that's the job she could get with a bachelor's in english there she meets ian drake a 10 year old boy who is most probably gay his parents are bible fanatics who force him to attend pastor bob's classes for wayward children it's essentially a pray the gay away camp for kids they learn things that boys should be doing like playing lots of sports and talking about eventually becoming good fathers remember these boys are young like under 12 ian's mother won't let him read much of the great literature for children lucy sneaks them to him or lets him read whatever he wants at the library one day lucy finds ian camped out at the library he informs her that he has left home and has no intention of going back lucy decides she can take this a step further she packs ian into her car and off they go for a soul searching trip for both lucy and ian they cross many state lines and finally end up in vermont ian finally decides he needs to go home but recognizes that he doesn't want lucy to get into any kind of trouble she ends up putting him on a bus home with the help of a russian stranger a friend of her fathers' from the russian mafia she eventually finds a way to let him know that she's safe and gives him lists of books to read at certain ages during this trip lucy herself confronts and eventually makes peace with her own father a russian who escaped to america during the cold war she admits to herself that a father who makes his 6 year old daughter go out into the hall of their upscale chicago apartment and steal the neighbors dry cleaning is not an honest man in the end lucy hopes she's done what she can for ian","247":"absolutely wonderful read this without stopping it was that good do yourself a favor and read this book especially if you believe that books save lives","248":"my brief review is up on my blog bookrastination blogspot com","249":"this book was a delightful romp with some light preaching most of the way through and then it went of the rails and became a depressing diatribe sad to lose steam at the end like that","250":"ugh what a disappointment i feel like i wasted precious time reading this when i had so many other books that i could have read it dragged from page 1 and i ended up just skimming the last 8 or 9 chapters just to get through the book and see how it ended not worth your time save your money","251":"a terrific read about a young librarian who ends up on the road with a precocious ten year old boy who she may have kidnapped by accident all the parts about her russian father and his cohorts are hilarious and of course all the references to canada","252":"this book was just really lame honestly i was drawn to the premise which could have made for some great satire a children's librarian ends up inadvertently kidnapping her favorite patron who happens to be a 10 year old boy whose parents have him in anti gay therapy and restrict his reading choices i also felt like i had to read it because it is set in hannibal mo and i grew up in small town missouri but right away i was annoyed because main character becomes a public librarian on a whim when a job is just handed to her with no training or experience as someone who desperately wants to be a public librarian and has the mls i owe $50 000 for and experience and cannot get a position i was really irked by this plot detail also i doubt the author has ever been to hannibal i feel like she chose mo because she is from the chicago area and mo probably just sounded like a bigoted place she could use as an example i do give it two stars because there are some clever bits and i did find some of the stuff with her father and his shady connections pretty humorous but the main character may be the lamest main character since bella in twilight she is completely lacking in personality or motivation and doesn't seen to believe she can control anything the plot and the characters don't seem to go anywhere they just drive around in a car for awhile and it doesn't really make any sort of point","253":"my local independent bookstore recommended this book so i thought i'd give it a try at first i really loved this book the author is very witty and being the child of a librarian i could identify with the setting but after a while i found the plot to be a bit unbelievable who would embark on a road trip with an eleven year old without letting the parents know he's ok i could buy the premise of the big escape just not the premise that it is morally acceptable to not inform the parents their missing child is healthy and alive still i will look for more by this author","254":"this is another book that has been fast tracked to the best of 2011 list lucy hall is a children's librarian and the story is about her dealings with the ten year old ian drake the book includes gay conversion the russian mafia and oodles of classic childen's lit so much that i had to start a list of all the titles i want to re read","255":"this is a book about an accidental child abduction by a well meaning but naive librarian i loved reading about ian a precocious 10 year old who reads voraciously i also liked lucy the librarian but that was a little more difficult given that she doesn't even know what she thinks of herself the characters even the ancillary ones are drawn well and i found them believable as others have said the plot is not super believable but it makes for an interesting read and the author does a good job of keeping the reader dialed in i for the most part liked the questions posed in this book what role is it appropriate for an adult to play in a child's life how much do we really know about the people around us when we are trying to help are we really be warned though some people will find this book preachy and others may be offended ian is taken to classes to ensure his heterosexuality which lucy takes serious issue with i was not offended because it is clear that though lucy thinks her view on things is the correct one it is clear that she knows very little about ian's real life or anyone else's and there really may be no dragon for her to slay certain segments of the narrative are structured to read like specific children's books which i enjoyed some were repeated such as if you give a mouse a cookie i also liked the writing style in general this is a unique read for lovers of library books and quirky adventures","256":"don't bother incredibly poorly written","257":"in contrast to my previous read this book was pretty squarely up my alley i definitely put being a reader high on my list of qualities that define me and i have a love for books about readers and books i'd actually been looking out for a copy of this one discounted used for a while and was very excited when it arrived the protagonist of the borrower is a children's librarian who pretty much happened upon that line of work when she was looking to use an english degree a bit of a nitpick here in that i have lots of friends who have gotten master's degrees to pursue library careers and didn't so much buy her falling into the work the librarian feels a special attachment to one young patron who shows a love for books but has a very controlling mother who tries to limit his reading choices and sends him to a group intended to reverse suspected homosexual tendencies one day the librarian finds the young boy has run away and is hiding in the library and the two take off on a road trip as with many books that i've been anticipating i did feel a bit let down with this one but i'm still happy to give it 4 of 5 stars i enjoyed the young boy's character the most and felt a bit mixed on the librarian i did appreciate that the narrator very much acknowledged she might ot have made the smartest choices i do like my flawed characters especially when they are a bit self aware and the book clearly didn't attempt to make her actions seem perfect or even heroic she wants to be a hero but knows she's a flawed one there was a bit of writer magic in the ending but it also didn't fall victim to the too perfect all wrapped in a bow finale i wasn't thrilled my the former but appreciated the latter i'm rambling so will try to sum up it isn't a book i'd put on a shelf of honor but it was a fun read for a book fan and rewarded being well read with lots of references","258":"this is a good read i kept wondering where the heroine was speaking from prison exile didn't see the conclusion coming until almost the end great handling of how life can happen to you when you're not paying proper attention should make anyone who reads it suspicious of taking media reports at face value real life is wierder than we think","259":"i couldn't get into it the neurotic librarian and the abused confused 10 yr old did not get my attention after reading over 100 pages","260":"a children's librarian sort of kidnaps a young library patron with sort of good intentions i think her intentions aren't sitting right with me i just never was convinced she was justified in her actions and she sort of bemoaned her situation throughout but it was hard to feel sympathetic so the tension of what would ultimately happen was an unpleasant tension without that sympathy there were some fun children's literature references throughout which i enjoyed","261":"i found this a truly enjoyable book with some insightful glimpses into the minds of we book addicts funny opinionated the plot may be a tad far fetched but it is worth suspending disbelief to go along on the ride the last couple pages stunned me with a beautiful musing on nothing less than life itself","262":"the first 150 pages had me thinking so so but the last 100 really sucked me in even though the storyline is pretty implausible i loved all the literary allusions the author used and i especially liked the self discovery of the main character and actually highlighted a couple of passages i wanted to remember ones about going home and how where we're from makes us who we are","263":"this story will resonate with anyone who works with children in the public sector every once in awhile there's that child you want to take home with you the child who you are sure would be happier if they could just get away from the circumstances of their home life well this is the story of one such children's librarian who found herself in that position in one spur of the moment decision she then found herself on the lam with a 10 year old boy in an attempt to shelter him from his restrictive parents i loved this book i was constantly wondering if they would be found out or arrested how would the story end would the boy ian discover his true self why did the librarian's lucy father have so many versions of his escape from the ussr who was the man in the blue car and why was he following them so how did the story end well i'm not going to say you'll have to find out for yourself","264":"i really loved this book it tells the story of a book loving runaway child and the librarian who runs away with him the characters were lovable and i couldn't book the book down as i had to find out what was going to happen thanks for the recommendation kim","265":"bangs head on desk ok this is preposterous at one point after kidnapping a 10 year old boy who ran away from his parents and driving across several state lines she considers dumping him somewhere and running away hull is annoying and vapid so many story points are strung together awkwardly throughout that never come to a whole lot of resolution one extra star because she writes better than stephanie meyer","266":"i made it to about page 130 and decided to just hang it up i truly couldn't care less about these people so why waste more time with them i have to give makki credit for getting in lots of great literary allusions that was the best part of the book but the writing seemed choppy and the story forced she tries to justify lucy's actions in being complicit with aiding in the runaway of ian a 10 year old patron of her library but it really doesn't ring true honestly i could have overlooked this but the writing style and characters both annoyed me i was hoping for a well written novel with quirky well drawn characters instead i got a wannabe well written quirky novel","267":"it was hard to read sometimes as a parent it made me quite anxious a lot of the time but in the end i loved the characters and i will probably find myself thinking of them as real people for a while how can you not love a book that does that","268":"loved the book chat but the story not so much","269":"i picked this up in a flea market the only thing that attracted it to me was the title it reminded me of the borrowers i loved it u0026amp read it in 2 sittings well 2 baths the story was well paced and right until the end it wasn't quiet clear how the events would pan out a very very good portrayal of the thoughts and feelings of somebody in lucys position lots of referrals to books u0026amp also some mild russian history in there too i recommend highly","270":"so it took me like 4 months to read this book it was the first non ya fiction book i had picked up in a while at the time and i suppose it was far easier to start and stop because of that less of a crazy teenage roller coaster i think i prolonged the experience also because i was worried about how it would end a librarian 'kidnaps' one of her regular patrons whose parents have sent him to anti gay youth group with someone named pastor bob too terrifyingly realistic of a scenario for me to feel comfortable reading all at once","271":" despite this children's librarian's phenomenally poor choices this little adventure was fun to read echoes of children's literature were liberally sprinkled throughout but not overdone i found the conclusion a special delivery of a christian teen mag modified by lucy hull especially for ian highly satisfying particularly because i'd wondered a bit while reading how she was going to wrap this one up unlike lucy and ian i am not the type of reader that skips ahead to the last page and now i believe i am going to have to reread danny the champion of the world","272":"this book was just ok i felt the plot just took way too long and nothing significant really happened at times the ending was pretty good though","273":"an excellent book and hard to put down i would love to a follow up book to see what happens after the story has ended recommend this book to anyone who enjoys a good read","274":"this started out wonderfully i was immediately drawn the liberal librarian and the winsome boy whom she sneaks books to books his parents obect to but which are children's classics the librarian's rationale is that the boy wants to read those books and she is not a censor the ethical and moral issues here are never worked out do parents have the right to judge what books are suitable for their children do parents have the right to decide what religious beliefs their children should hold apparently not since the parents are presented as unlikable tyrants the librarian who goes against their wishes is portrayed sympathetically actually ethical moral and ultimately legal issues abound in this book which is what kept me reading at the end makkai seems to suggest that people who meddle but who are on the right side of the fence may be as guilty of playing with someone's life as those who are on the wrong side most readers will detest ian's bigoted mother and parson bob the anti gay crusader but lucy's intervention doesn't square with ian's beliefs and what she does to save him is reprehensible in my opinion what was she saving him from to what lengths will she go to save him the plot finally fizzles out nothing is resolved nothing is changed as far as i could see thhe very real ethical issues raised are not resolved the second half of this novel is an on the lam road trip this should have been exciting especially considering what went before makkai has drawn several memorable and interesting characters and portrays their activities with wit and vivid vignettes so i found myself slogging through the road trip thinking it would get better it didn't it wasn't a bit believable we learn nothing new about our heroine or about ian journeys are usually written into novels to show character development this one showed nothing except perhaps that the fbi and the police are mighty casual about an ostensibly kidnapped child makkai has talent that shows in the first half of the novel but the road trip is written in a very pedestrian manner and the ending is unconvincing at least to me","275":"i couldn't finish this book the premiss was sweet librarian rescuing kid who is being forced to change who he is but i only got half through the book the librarian ms hull was really irritating i could not connect with her the kid ian was also really irritating so halfway through i gave up","276":"oh good another librarian stereotype","277":"bittersweet tale of a library associate although she refers to herself as a librarian i'm a bit snippy about that because she doesn't have her masters and a sensitive intelligent 11 year old patron who go on a road trip because of her overwhelming concern for his well being makkai does an excellent job of portraying life in a public library alcoholic clueless technologically challenged and cynical coworkers as well as our occasionally complicated relationships with our patrons she also does a great job in depicting 11 year olds who are both wise beyond their years and tremendously naive ian's non sequiturs are particularly brilliant yes the story takes liberties and sometimes situations are too convenient to be even somewhat plausible but sit back and enjoy the ride it's a great yarn","278":"review to come","279":"bleh you'd think i'd love a book about a children's librarian since i specialized in school library media but no the characters were just a tad cliche or trying too hard not to be i kind of enjoyed the first third but wasn't into it enough to plow through the rest","280":"thoroughly enjoyed this story of a children's librarian who kidnaps or more accurately is kidnapped by a 10 year old boy who frequents the library lots of references to a life and books i can identify with fun and thoughtful","281":"what a boring book half of it was just blah blah blah having to do nothing with the story don't waste your time","282":"more like 1 5 sigh the title brought me in the story couldn't keep my interest i got bored about half way through and skimmed the rest the last one hundred pages of the story translated like this blah blah blah","283":"a sweet and touching story featuring many lovely and thoughtful allusions to classic children's literature that i recall from my own youth number the stars the hobbit lord of the flies where the red fern grows harry potter alice in wonderland to name only a few lucy hull is smart sassy and trying to figure out her life when young ian comes along they embark on a road trip which is when we meet some of the most interesting characters in the book lucy's father the labaznikovs mr shades frankly for me the book's primary weakness is ian but that's probably because despite my love of children's lit i don't actually like kids especially the whiny bratty variety that ian often embodies still that's a minor quibble overall the book is delightful and endearing","284":"i read this book in one sitting and really enjoyed it the two main characters are enjoyable my favourite was lucy lucy first meets ian at the library where he goes often as he has a real love for reading his mother does not approve of a lot of the books for children such as harry potter etc believeing books about religion to be more beneficial ian does his very best to sneak the books he likes past his mother with the help of lucy ian's mum fears that he is gay and has him going to a place where he can be cured of this lucy feels sorry for him and tried to help him when ever she can one day ian goes missing and little does anyone know but it is lucy that has taken him he hid in the library one night and was there when lucy arrived the next day he talks his way into lucy taking him in her car and so off they go lucy seemingly kidnapping this boy or has he kidnapped her blackmail useful if you're a kid the two travel together to unplanned destinations covering a lot of miles i was very interested in how lucy was going to get herself out of this mess i fully expected her to be arrested the ending was unexpected and i was slightly saddened by it as i would have liked another ending this was a really great book and i do recommend it reading this book about a boy who got so much joy from reading was pretty great","285":"please click here for my interview with author rebecca makkai note interview preparation was based on complimentary review copy received from the publisher","286":"i was first recommended this book by some library friends they said i reminded them of the main character at first what a funny story then ew the children's librarian doesn't have an mlis and there's this line from a musician character paraphrased i was once a librarian in a music library i erased pencil marks from sheet music um you were not once a librarian i had to stop just a few chapters in call me a snob i don't mind","287":"it has been quite some time since i just wanted to book to be over it was like a long wait in the dentist's office loads of wasted time and nothing really happened in the end and the whole thing was so ridiculous why would a librarian go on the run with a possibly gay boy and they just randomly drove for hundrends of pages that said it helped me fall asleep at night so it was of some use i suppose","288":"there were parts of this book i loved and parts of it that made me want to quit and throw it out the window even though i did borrow it from the library there were times that i loved the characters and other times when i wouldn't care if they drove off the road into the mississippi what saved the book what helped me get through to the end was rebecca makkai's great talent as a writer and the promise of a good ending","289":"i hated this book with a burning passion this really deserves no stars but i pity the author so much i gave it two","290":"if this book was given to me in workshop i'd probably quibble with the plot of the middle of the book but it was a published book so i just got to curl up and enjoy these characters the best kid since malcolm in about a boy the best book about a librarian since the giant's house it takes on big issues with heart and peppers the prose with literary chestnuts readers will love to find i really loved these characters and i'm sorry to see them go would be a five if i couldn't see the scaffolding of the middle so clearly but i will keep this book and recommend it","291":"i loved this book all the allusions to other books were fun and the pure love of reading shone through an unconventional children's librarian and a curious young boy hampered by strict parents make an unlikely but extremely interesting pair","292":"didn't like it didn't even finish it slow slow slow not my cup of tea","293":"i challenge anyone connected with books to not picture their own ian as they read this book about a children's librarian on the lam great references to books including some of the chapter titles","294":"nothing like i thought it would be makkai's book kept me alternately delighted and frustrated i think the problem for me is the narrator she is too bright to be making many of the decisions she makes and makkai too blatantly skewers those whose beliefs she does not share she champions the importance of children being able to read widely even those books which do not fit parents' beliefs parts of the story were laugh out loud funny while other parts had me shaking my head certainly readers must have a strong willing suspension of disbelief to accept lucy her family young ian and the kidnapping which it is no matter lucy's reasoning which is often hard to accept i'm still thinking about this book","295":"i just couldn't get through that premise of taking the kid as a mother there is no way i could go with it not even as a joke just didn't do it for me","296":"this sucked me in even though the plot was kind of implausible and the mousy librarian thing was overdone","297":"oh my gosh i loved this it was such a quick read for me one of those books you can't put down but that you hate for it to end i really felt like i could identify with the protagonist i especially appreciated that the author listed so many titles of books that she felt would be great for this kid to read several were books i've read as a kid or as an adult and there were even more that i'm going to be adding to my to read list i borrowed this from my local library to read on my kindle fire however i'll be attending a conference next month that the author's supposed to be at i'm thinking i'm going to buy a copy to have her sign i really enjoyed this and would love to read it again","298":"well this was just the most surprisingly lovely and poignant and hilarious book i have read in so long ian oh ian i love you so read it if you love the random the make it up as you go ness of life i lead a sort of structured life so i was really stinkin' drawn to the way they burst the world wide open too loved it just loved it well done ms makkai","299":"wow if you are the kid who escaped to the public library because you just couldn't stand your life read this book now special note to my friend lindsay please read and let me know what you think","300":"a really unique story","301":"i really like makkai's literary allusions and the initial plot but her main character is just too wishy washy and i never really felt like pulling for her in her quest to rescue ian from his domineering parents","302":"i liked it but i thought it could've been way more exciting considering the premise that is set up a 28 yr old librarian finds one of her favorite 10 yr old patrons ian hiding out in the library because he has run away from home she lets him talk her into fleeing on an impromptu road trip as a 1st person narrator the librarian says she didn't know what her motivation was except that she must've been wanting to run away herself she ties this into her family's history of running away from russia i would've liked if she really loved ian and had more emotional invested she just liked sneaking books to him that his religious mother disapproved of she should have gone to jail because really she is a kidnapper i don't believe that the authorities and parents would have bought ian's story she wouldn't have gotten away with it","303":"reading the borrower is like having a long sit down with an old friend full of asides and references you're supposed to know it's great i could pick this book apart if i wanted to lucy is not a believable character she's super smart but has no career plans gorgeous but doesn't date or have friends falls into a job that requires an advanced degree she doesn't have and allows herself to be led into a criminal act by a ten year old boy butit is a fantastically enjoyable read makkai gives a great turn of phrase and the book is fun at the same time it's about the fictions we allow ourselves to believe about ourselves and just about everyone else we meet and how that keeps us apart passages i want to remember excepting the books i never liked to amass more possessions than could be moved in a cartop u haul you never know when the cossacks are going to invade p 31 in a library in missouri that was covered with vineslived thousands of books in a hundred straight linesa boy came in at half past nineevery saturday rain or shinehis book selections were clan des tine p 35 too much tequila by margaret wise brown the very obvious nose job by eric carle p 59 i'd watched the music man enough times as a child to be wary of smiling musicians the way they waltz into your library singing swinging that con man briefcase and telling you to be spontaneous they tell you this town could be saved with a little luck and a good marching band p 68 i do crazy miss being a children's librarian","304":"i loved the lines picked up from other books a fun read","305":"of course i'm going to read a book about a librarian who finds herself in a peculiar sitaution with a young patron and though there weren plenty of times i wanted to yell at the protagonist for her unprofessional ways her ability to be responsiblie but the story is quirky enough the characters sweet enough and the plot twists interesting enough to keep even a non librarian reader interesting just don't come and tell me that all librarians are like her when you're finished","306":"of course i wanted to read this book it's about libraries and books but it is about so much more than just that i admit at peeking at the reviews ever so briefly on my kindle one day recently i placed the book on reserve at my library and forgot about it when the notification came that it had arrived i happily picked the book up and stated to read it i was worried since i read reviews that this book was anti christian but rest assured it really wasn't it was anti hate anti fundamentalist extremism but all about love really lucy hull is the children's librarian in hannibal missouri not exactly where she had expected to end up after growing up on lake shore drive in chicago but a gig she accepts and even embraces she is entranced however by one particular borrower 10 year old reading enthusiast ian drake the son of a seemingly anorexic and controlling mother who does not want him t check out certain books she even produces a list to of books to lucy he is not allowed to read i will admit to having a twinge of worry when lucy rants on about the christian fiction genre because really can any of us really criticize what others read being a book snob very much like lucy but also a mother i understand what some folks may call censorship' i call parenting i wnat to protect my children from bad things in books that may hurt them like graphic descriptions of sex and violence mostly sex mainly but i trust my smart kids to be intelligent readers and to understand a subversive type message when they read one this is where maybe lucy and ian's mother both go wrong no matter how worried you are about someone else's child unless you are ready to call child protective services you really need to mind your own business but our lucy she is a rebel it's in her blood she admits more than once she takes after her father and no matter how worried you are about some trait you see in your own child subjecting them to emotionally abusive therapy practices like marcus bachmann's kind of therapy is pretty abusive in it's own special way lucy waxes elegiacally about wonderful books she wants ian to be able to read and her desire to help him finally overrides all common sense and she does something crazy she borrows ian although he easily lends himself this book is timely does ms makkai have psychic abilities in being able to predict the a bachmann's anti gay therapy debacle and a must for book and library lovers alike the ending was absolutely perfect i actually cried the book has some flaws i felt things floundered a little bit midway through the book but ms makkai manages to pick it back up and straighten things out no pun intended lucy is a flawed heroine which is good and the other characters in the novel are drawn lovingly and very respectfully this is one i can heartily recommend","307":"very interesting book about a librarian and a ten year old boy which also tackles issues about various things such as sexuality the feeling of loss after finishing a degree and dual nationality families sometimes a little confusing in parts as the storyline jumps around and there are random chapters which don't appear to make sense but looking at the novel as a whole they make sense a very good read and one that i struggled to put down","308":"this book was an easy read and i enjoyed it had some slow parts but overall a good story","309":"simultaneously sweet sad and uproariously funny","310":"the beginning was great the middle was ok and the ending was fantastic ian drake has now become one of my favorite literature characters of all time","311":"ian is a 10 year old boy who loves reading and visiting the library he develops a friendship with lucy the young woman who is the head librarian in the childrens' department she not only recommends books for ian to read but also helps him accomplish his goal when he decides to run away from home this book started out very slow but then got more interesting the further i got into it","312":"i absolutely loved this book i thought it was a wonderfully imaginative story though many will have issues with an adult aiding and abetting a 10 year old runaway also if you believe homosexuality is something that can be and should be cured don't even bother picking this book up","313":"witty lines i just wish that lucy and ian would meet again in the future","314":"this was a coming of age adventure like catcher in the rye exceptthere are two heroes a 26 year old librarian and a ten year old boy ian parts of this book i found delightful others were a little weird","315":"brilliant book quite intense at times brilliant story and really well written you discover the characters as the story progresses","316":"i wanted to like this more the first chunk was very enjoyable funny and well written then it got improbable but i finished it because the author is a bread loafer and because it's vacation","317":"3rd strike in a row this book is just marvelous to read makkai wove the story so expertly you can't put this book down till you finish it","318":"rebecca makkai's novel is about an adventure kidnapping involving a 26 year old librarian and a 10 year old boy the borrower is a reference to the library patron the kidnapping itself and the text of the book which is filled with allusions and references to other literary works most of the famous novel variety that would be easily recognizable to a high school ap english student i was slightly irritated by some of these especially the book's presumptive references to lolita lucy the librarian as modern female non sexual humbert humbert driving ian across america makkai demonstrates many talents particularly in the way her voice feels fresh in its humor and worldview but this is no lolita i found the story very flat at times but i'll read more by this author","319":"this book had a few incredibly touching moments and insights that were beautiful i think it would have benefitted from a bit more editing as the story seems to run on and on for a while with little direction it is uneven but the author displays promise","320":"what i loved about this book was that it had the spirit of a children's book like from the files of mrs basil with adults assisting the young hero through a character building adventure in the face of common sense of course it's absurd to think of a librarian kidnapping a boy but it is wonderful to think for a moment that reading could turn a young boys life from heartbreaking to rewarding and that alone was worth the read","321":"children's librarian lucy hull either rescues or is hijacked by her favorite patron ian who may or may not be the son of abusive evangelicals their road trip is anxiety producing and funny--and raises the question who's really running away into fiction a fascinating first novel","322":"this was kind of a weird story the librarian runs away with a 10 year old boy because the boy has run away from home and does not return why she does it is never quite clear from that point it is the story of their journey","323":"i will preface this with this statement this book is pretty implausible overall and i think you just have to get past that to enjoy it it was not hard for me to get over it and i found myself really enjoying the pacing various methods of writing within the book and lucy's overall sentiment in the book i am sure that it has something to do with the impending doom of starting school but i thoroughly enjoyed spending my afternoon reading this book and waiting excitedly and nervously for what would happen next after finishing a book where i detested the ending this one was much more satisfying to me i am excited to see what else makkai writes in the future","324":"ultimately i just didn't enjoy the characters nor the plot as well as i had anticipated the idea was interesting and i thought it would be intriguing for the narrator to be a librarian but in the end the story was very far from reality also i felt as though there were a couple different secondary characters who were introduced and then fizzled out towards the end of the book but i did enjoy the different references to books throughout the text i just felt the whole book was somewhat bizarre","325":"a colleague adores this book and insisted i read it and love it as much as she does well i found the precocious ian charming at times and occasionally annoying lucy the protagonist was overly neurotic and self righteous as many women in their early twenties can be fresh out of college but not really experienced in life what i liked most as the novel seemed to trudge on and on were makkai's clever use of imitative narrative styles in some chapters designed to mimic favorite children's books and the minor characters the gay neighbor landlord and his crew of friends fellow actors are wonderful and his final appearance in the story is truly marvelous so i liked it but i don't think it has earned a place on my favorites shelf in spite of how much my co worker friend digs it","326":"a really well written first novel i loved the characters the writing style was original and a really interesting plot but on finishing the book i wasn't really sure what the writer was trying to say hence four stars instead of five","327":"every librarian in the world needs to read this book it will make you laugh and make you cry lucy hull is a children's librarian in hannibal mo she meets ian drake a 10 year old regular library patron whose mother becomes concerned about what ian is reading and brings in a list of acceptable books for him to read lucy finds out ian is now attending a day camp for children who may be gay and she believes he may be abused at home one morning she finds ian in the library where he has spent the night and they run away together as the trip progresses the reader learns lucy is running away from her past as well as taking ian away from his present who has kidnapped whom ian wants lucy to take him to his grandmother's house in vermont and as they travel lucy discovers more about her father's past his life as a russian under stalin and then his escape to america how does it all end how do you return a kidnapped child without being caught how do you escape your past and find a future this is a story about growing up and discovering yourself","328":"the borrower by rebecca makkai has an intriguing premise that grabbed my attention right away lucy a disenchanted twenty something children's librarian inadvertently kidnaps one of her favorite patrons when she finds him hiding in the library after he runs away from home instead of returning him to his strict overbearing mother she allows herself to be cajoled into taking him on what ends up being a cross country road trip there's a lot to like about this book from its quirky characters to its many literary references something kept me from loving it though and i'm finding it hard to put my finger on exactly what there were times when i felt like the author was a little too heavy handed with the way she treated certain things like lucy's russian immigrant father who though humorously and vividly drawn veers headfirst into a russian mafia cliche or the way in which lucy's conflicting feelings about her actions seem to repeat the same cycle throughout the story to the point where i felt like i was being hit over the head with her inner conflict since the plot itself is a bit outlandish to begin with i thought it could have been better balanced by more subtle treatment of certain characters and themes overall an interesting worthwhile read especially for library lovers but not a favorite","329":"i kept reading because the periodic opening chapters based on children's books were really well done in the style of goodnight moon for example the plot however never really went anywhere i felt that there was a buildup of the action only to be letdown with an internal epiphany by the main character that had nothing to do with the physical plot","330":"i picked this book up for a few cents at the borders going out of business sale because i thought it looked good it turned out to be such a great story i felt guilty for having acquired it so cheaply i absolutely love this story - it is another great book lovers book lots of well placed meaningful references to other titles especially children's and young adult titles that will likely bring you back to that place of recognition and comfort very funny and beautiful at the same time especially meaningful if you love the library love youth literature especially matilda if you are the child of immigrant parents hehe if you have ever found yourself siding with a child in an argument over an adult and bravely withstood the questioning angry stares or if you have ever ever experienced profound alienation and believe that books saved your life it is really really good conservatives non progressives be warned","331":"favorite book i've read yet this year funny sweet touching weird the ending had me in tears","332":"interesting concept but a little too long loved the writing wish the ending would have been different don't take the story literally not realistic to think lucy can kidnap ian but the mutual love of books was a great concept","333":"i was a little slow to warm up to this book but by the end i was cooking dinner with one hand and holding it in the other so i could see how it turned out lucy one of the main characters kind of alludes to how it turns out throughout the book but i just couldn't figure out how i particularly loved the descriptions of how a ten year old does certain things like how ian says goodbye or at one point ian begins talking like a robot out of nowhere and i thought yep that's a 10 year old boy the children's lit references throughout were clever and i felt frustrated when i knew it was a lit reference and i didn't get it i also liked the underlying you are okay just the way you are message overall delightful","334":"the story a librarian in the small town of hannibal missouri aids and abets a young runaway who is her favorite patron at the library the review i really liked the way this story was told lucy is a children's librarian and she gets caught up in the life of ian a young patron who decides to run away from home as the narrator lucy begins by wondering if she is the hero of the story or the villain and she puts herself with all our other beloved characters deliberately appropriating famous lines for example in talking about our beloved heroes she says they tell me to light out for the territory reckon i'm headed for hell just like them they say i'm the most terrific liar they ever saw in their lives for those of you who don't teach those two novels and thus reread them on a yearly basis lighting out for the territory is the adventures of huckleberry finn and the most terrific liar is holden caulfield in the catcher in the rye the allusions and references and appropriations continue throughout the story and lucy tells parts of their adventure as if you give a mouse a cookie the very hungry catepillar and a choose your own adventure book i loved that and thought it was really clever i also don't think that you have to be me or a relatively prolific reader like me in order to get the references and appreciate what makkai is doing there so don't let it deter you the story itself is a little dramatic and angsty lucy constantly questions what she is doing and how wrong it is so part of me was thinking yeah you are an idiot stop making bad choices nevertheless i really enjoyed the book because of the clever way makkai told it so i recommend it","335":"although i was intrigued in the beginning of the book y halfway through i found the librarian and ian the by she runs away with very irritating and unbelievable i'm not sure i will be able to finish the book","336":"hated it just couldn't get into the narrator her ho hum self pity and her affection for the boy early on was unrelatable the stark contrast she created between herself as a non degreed librarian first amendment supporter and the boy's mother censor was irritating also the fact that she so easily got a job as a librarian w out a degree stretches acceptable reality for me as i have a degree in library science and compete w over 300 candidates for every job to which i apply oh and then her apartment above the actors it was all too cutesy i gave up and do not feel bad about it","337":"sad and beautifully written i had a few qualms about specific things of being a children's librarian but you know that is just because it is my job so i know it in and out","338":"hugs to jill for gifting me with this wonderful book about a young librarian and a boy who loved to read the droll references to well known children's literature and the general story line had me laughing out loud and stamping my feet","339":"i enjoyed the book especially the allusions to several novels but i don't think it's a great book librarians u0026amp english teachers will probably enjoy this story as it is an easy read","340":"i didn't really finish this i listened to the audiobook but i didn't like the voice of the reader i stuck it out as long as i could but the story wasn't interesting enough for me to struggle through her voice my husband read it i'll have to ask him how it ended","341":"i liked the first section of this book pre road trip the book itself is well written raises some interesting issues and anyone familiar with some children's books e g many parents will find certain sections entertaining however once the kidnap road trip section started it was really hard to continue with the story as it became to me less and less plausible if you can buy into the the 2nd section of the book covering the trip you may still enjoy the book but it wasn't for me would add that while i liked the view into this young librarian's work life or her observations about it there are some real gems in the book but i was only marginally interested in her life outside work and her own musings about post college identity family etc","342":"as my husband put it it's like porn for librarians enjoyed the references to literature and the nuances of working in a public library not totally believable","343":"this book started out strong but then kind of went on too long it was a bit long winded but the premise was interesting","344":"silly but original and there are iots of lovely moments i really loved ian","345":"i was a little iffy on this one at first i was won over though quick summary liberal librarian accidentally kidnaps a ten year old library patron tree hugging and russian mafioso ensue spoilers ahoy ahoy i really hated the narrator of this novel i'm a liberal and her self righteous ultra liberalism bothered even me but the author makes a point in the first few sentences to tell us we're not supposed to like her she makes her point stronger by having her anti heroine tell the reader herself that the story does not paint her well the unfolding of the accidental kidnapping is done very realistically to me the justifications for miss hull's decisions can easily be chalked up to the fact that she isn't fully participatory in her life i very much enjoyed reading these passive aggressive reasons for not returning a young child back to his parents because i have often found myself using similarly flawed logic to do what i want to do i don't have the book around as i'm writing this review but i will fill in examples at a later date it was an enjoyable read especially after the gawky first few chapters it was evident to me that this was makkai's first novel but i'll be reading her next one because i could tell she was coming into her own as i read","346":"it's a good enough book but it just feels like it's missing something i liked the characters the literary references the ever present idea that the right books can save a person but it felt like the author was playing it safe or something like she was cautious about going too far falling too deep into her own words and instead she sat on the edge of the pool just dipping her feet in","347":"this was a perfect book for me at the time the humor was dry and i loved the way the author referenced children's books in the way she wrote the chapters i didn't have long stretches of time to read so i appreciated the breaks within the chapters so i could stop more easily and then pick it back up great read","348":"wow moved slow through the the first third of the novel stick with it it is worth the ride","349":"a librarian in hannibal mo inadvertently kidnaps her favorite reader ian she does return him to his parents with a reading list appropriate until his 18th birthday with the hope that reading can and will change his destiny","350":"as a librarian and a former teacher i got this book the humor and situations at the library rang true but the plot was so improbable i had to look at it almost as fantasy lucy a children's librarian takes ian a precocious runaway kid who considers the library his second home on a road trip from missouri to vermont in search of to escape from ian is escaping a mother who restricts his reading to christian literature and from pastor bob's anti gay boys group lucy is searching for a more interesting life perhaps they both get what they need from their wandering","351":"poignant funny and sad all at the same time all librarians or educators have known a kid like this but maybe not gone so far as to rescue him from his parents references to children's literature sprinkled throughout add to the easy read","352":"this book is on the light side the plot is implausible and the protagonist is not likable or rather i kept thinking i really shouldn't like her still this is an engaging story and i couldn't stop rooting for the plucky young librarian","353":"this the is second novel in a row i have read where the christian is the villain in the book a new trend 10 year old ian runs away to the library librarian lucy takes him on an adventure rather than home because she believes him to be abused he isn't she just disagrees with his parents' values i would have enjoyed the book more if she were rescuing him rather than feeding him her beliefs","354":"i enjoyed the book but it wasn't one that i just couldn't put down i was curious as to what would happen though","355":"great idea great beginning but slow mid way great for any ya children's librarians","356":"a quirky concept for a book lots of references to titles characters plots and even rhymes from classic children's literature can't imagine this will get a big following with general readership but for anyone who is has been a children's librarian it has a special appeal slow going in bits but if you read to the end it has it's redeeming moment too","357":"cute u0026amp funny book but it lost a bit of steam towards the end","358":"what a great story library workers put this on your to read list now","359":"i got halfway through this book and couldn't continue the beginning of this book really intrigued me but as soon as the the grand adventure started i couldn't suspend my disbelief and or the stupidity of lucy","360":"i loved this book it's a quirky funny sad and highly original account of a road trip most of the reviewers talk about it being a booklover's book the heroine is a librarian and the child hero a keen reader however i felt it was a more profound and political novel than that would imply the narrative is about the extent to which you can and can't run away it deals with issues around freedom and individual choice what it means to be american and the extent to which we carry our family history around with us the central dilemma about whether one person can or should 'liberate' another is handled with considerable subtlety and there are lots of excellent portrayals of minor characters to enjoy along the way","361":"quirky u0026amp fun i like all the references to well known titles passages and classic fave books","362":"i had high hopes for this book about a librarian that goes on the lam with a kid she suspects is being abused by his religious right parents but was disappointed her writing style is clever but the story dragged once they hit the road","363":"quirky tale of a children's librarian that inadvertently kidnaps one of her young patrons very cute book great weekend read as a librarian i thought makkai did a pretty great job of capturing some of the daily drudgery that can happen working at a public desk though not necessarily the job of the librarian it can happen in small towns and there were several laugh out loud moments 3 5 stars","364":"who ever thought being a booklover was so dangerous this is a great story about about the 'secret life of a librarian' and a little book loveing boy throw in themes of homophobia and religious extremism told along a roadtrip across america what else can i say but i loved this book it was one of those stories you wanted to go on and on forever","365":"3 5 stars i really liked this book i won it in one of the good reads giveaways it's a cute little story that leaves you guessing until the very end very clever writing and the homages to other children's books is so creative my favorite is the play off of if you give a mouse a cookie underlying gay theme and a little bit of language for those of you who are sensitive to that","366":"i liked the story and the writing was good but overall it kind of lagged i think there was a lack of character development particularly from the main character it was a quick read though definitely something to check out","367":"first let me clear something up i am a librarian and proud of it i worked hard at getting this to be my chosen career so some of the protagonists portrayal of herself as a library worker rubbed me the wrong way apart from that and a couple of other minor nitpicky annoyances with some minor details i quite liked this book i especially appreciated the interludes styled after classics of children's literature also i feel like everyone should have the opportunity to have some version of an ian in their life","368":"not even able to maintain crdulity for a bus commute read","369":"quirky premise hard to believe even a young librarian would go out on a limb to this extent to save a young child rather naiive premise","370":"wasn't sure how this book would end and i was very skeptical i thought it was less plot and more an excuse to get the author's politics across none of which i disagree with from what i can tell but the literary references were fun and drew me to the book also the writing near the end redeemed this book good enough but not great","371":"i did not love this one it's true that emily bauer isn't among my favorite readers largely because the way she reads everything sounds to me like a slightly whiny teen but i also didn't care for or about lucy the novel's narrator or the story line lucy struck me as immature among other things and though there was plenty of room for her to grow she did not despite frequent and eventually repetitive ruminations about her family's past her place in life and how she might have ended up there i disliked the direction the story went feeling all along it would be nearly impossible to resolve satisfactorily which in my opinion turned out to be true rebecca makkai is certainly a promising writer but i was happy to put the borrower behind me","372":"the story is a bit far fetched but i did like the characters","373":"i'll admit i picked this book up because i liked the tagline she borrowed a child he stole her lucy hull who is a children's librarian runs away with ian drake when she finds him hiding out in the library one morning she's always enjoyed him when he visited the library even if she did worry over his mother and the insistance that ian only be allowed borrow books with the \"breath of god\" in them and definitely not those ones with magic and satanism in them and then lucy finds a note making her believe that ian is being sent to anti gay classes she isn't really kidnapping him she is rescuing him continues http www susanhatedliterature net 2","374":"quite different than i expected a serious subject but also amusing held my attention throughout and would recommend this debut novel she has short stories published the last few years in best american short stories but our public library's most recent anthology is from 2005 sadly a runaway boy kidnapped by a librarian interesting","375":"i really enjoyed this book i found it witty and entertaining","376":"this book was so much fun and my being a librarian surely added to my enjoyment but truly any book lover would enjoy this well written clever story i fell in love with ian and lucy right from the beginning the best part is the true heroes in this story are the books and their power to change lives loved it","377":"the ending was the best part about this book although even with it i would have preferred if she had decided to go back to school and get her library degree the book gives the impression that librarianship is where where people float to when they don't have any aim in life and i find that very irritating","378":"the story kept me reading but the main character's personality grated on my nerves","379":"i initially wanted to read this book because i love libraries i also liked that the book centered around a librarian i don't think i've ever read about about a librarian before after reading this book i glanced at the reviews to see others take on it many have raved about this book and many hated it for me i liked it it wasn't bad nor was it outstanding i liked the pace of the book and i liked the story over all this story is all about lucy wanting to protect ian from his own parents i understand her motives i just don't agree with her methods putting what i disliked about lucy aside the book was written is such a way that wasn't boring it kept my attention from pg 30 336 in one sitting with that said i still had a hard time relating to lucy not only did i have a hard time with lucy i could not believe ian either he's a very manipulative little boy my niece is 10 she'll be 11 in a few weeks she never has had tantrums like this little boy did it's crazy to me how he was able to manipulate lucy that's really how she got into this disaster of a situation too bad she couldn't think her way around a 10 year old's manipulation then again maybe she didn't want to and his kidnapping her was a good excuse for her to help him lucy is clearly missing the voice of reason that tells you not to do something even though the entire time she has thoughts of getting arrested it's like she couldn't stop the train once it left the stop i can't not believe she got away with what she did yes her intentions were good at heart but she totally crossed the line and had no consequences at all this story was totally void of realism in that regard i'm not really sure how i feel about the supporting characters especially lucy's dad he sounds like a great role model there can you hear my sarcasm then this random piano player lucy carries on with really there is no purpose to that story line i think that he just helps pad the story more ian's parents seem pretty lame to be quit frank trying to un gayify is that even a word your child that's sad not letting him read or do anything that's not religious that's even more sad we don't live in boxes in my personal opinion sheltering children to that extent does nothing but hurt them in the long run i can totally see ian rebelling completely as he gets older and even into adulthood even though unrealistic i'm happy with the ending i'm glad that nothing detrimental happened to ian and maybe he learned a lot along his road trip with ms hull his favorite librarian this story touches a lot of hot spots for people homosexuality religion parenting etc i recommend this book for book clubs because i'm sure there will be some heated conversations and varying perspectives on this book","380":"i thoroughly enjoyed everything about the borrower this was a book where the description given by the publisher is too focused on the actual plot rather than on the essence of the story the adventure revolved around a spontaneous road trip when librarian lucy hull inadvertently drives ten year old ian around the country when he runs away from home i thought that sounded random and sort of boring but the novel has so much more heart to it than can be described lucy and ian are likable characters that drew me in from the first few pages ian and lucy become friends through conversations at the library where lucy nurtures ian by recommending different books to him she learns that his parents think he is gay and are making him attend a religious class with other boys so that he can be taught to be straight so when lucy finds him hiding in the library she tries to help him not kidnap him lucy's good intentions are a driving force for her actions and with each chapter her compassion and sympathy for ian expounds all the crazy characters surrounding lucy only help ian's plight but in unexpected ways ian is a great character because he is sharp and articulate well beyond his ten years of age i loved the lists of things ten year olds do that could be found every few chapters like how a ten year old brushes his teeth this is a great example of a book where everything ties together and nothing is unimportant the adventure reminded me a lot of where'd you go bernadette with zanny characters who do unexpected things the themes of friendship and humanity emerge in honest ways through the excellent writing i wasn't sure what i wanted the ending to be and i am both satisfied and unsatisfied with it it was touching but in a sad way because it showed how sometimes good intentions will not be enough to change circumstances of life i liked that the author managed to take a humorous approach to serious subjects that were thought provoking anyone who loves books and loves when books are the focus of a novel think guernsey would really appreciate the role literature played in this plot this was another one of my favorite reads this year read more of my reviews on my blog http fastpageturner wordpress com","381":"while i tend to agree with the main characters outlook on political social views i have to say as a parent i was shocked i kept swinging back and forth between the horror of having my child missing and feeling that sometimes children need to be saved i don't know i'm a bit of a mess with this book but the bottom line is that i finished it in 24 hours which is unheard of for me and i was enthralled with the story and wanting to see the outcome on that front the book gets high marks there were a lot of themes running through this story the characters were very entertaining and engaging maybe a bit unbelievable in some parts but overall i enjoyed it it is one that has stuck with me the last few days","382":"i have a few problems with this novel i expected to like lucy hull but i didn't in fact by the end of the novel i was pretty close to not being able to stand her she lets this 'kidnapping' happen without having the ounce of common sense it would require to get ian safely home and then proceeds to drive aimlessly around america exploring her mixed up feelings on her russian heritage and not doing a whole lot to change ian's life though that's her weak justification for their jaunt lucy didn't even feel real to me though many of the other characters did the whole russian mafia and stories lies from her family history felt fake concocted and not even absurd as they were supposed to just irritating i felt like as a reader i deserved better than this jumbled half hearted mess the book is also hugely dissatisfying in the end while i'm well versed in the modernists and am perfectly capable of recognizing and appreciating the way in which this whole plot amounted to nothing it was in a bad way not a good way ulysses does it right this novel does not also i cannot believe lucy just abandoned poor rocky the way she casually discarded him and sophie bennett makes her just seem cruel i was also really annoyed by how hard the author tried so hard to make her own writing nabokovian yes nabokov is great no you are not nabokov and lucy's so called crime does not even come close to those of nabokov's infamous villains it really bothered me the way she kept forcing the story her style into this nabokovian defense of the accused type thing however there were elements i did like i liked ian i liked tim and the theatre lucy lived above though gay actor is an easy enough cliche to write i liked the christian magazine filled with reading lists that was a really nice touch i just really didn't like that we found no meaning in the end and were left with annoying philosophizing lucy trying to sleep at night waah poor her i feel like i've been unnecessarily harsh with this book i did enjoy it otherwise i wouldn't have bothered reading the whole thing this book proves a fun read but not particularly amazing life changing or moving","383":"i might be the villain of this story even now it's hard to tell those first two lines pulled me in immediately the author goes on to show a friendship growing between the narrator lucy a just out of college children's librarian and ian a ten year old boy who loves to read and whose parents' religious views begin to worry lucy while i loved the writing overall at times i found the tone a little jarring particularly the asides told in the form of tongue in cheek lists other people might really enjoy that aspect of the book also i never quite understood lucy's initial isolation from most people around her all the same i loved the book and i believed lucy would do everything she did despite that she takes quite a few wrong turns literally and figuratively sometimes i found myself flying through the pages to find out what happened and made myself slow down to enjoy the prose the ending left me near tears and i wished that i could meet these characters in real life and find out what they did and what their lives were like over the next ten twenty or thirty years","384":"i picked this book up from the new books shelf at the library having heard nothing of it as i was checking out the librarian told me she had tried to read it but could not finish but she also said she has a hard time reading books about librarians i wonder how much this colored my reading of the book really it was well written and interesting one part that i loved was how the author had her character a children's librarian make up her own versions of well known children's stories to fit what was happening in the book very clever and funny i recognized if you give a mouse a cookie goodnight moon and the very hungry caterpillar some i was not sure of the name i will have to look them up the thing that made me hesitate about this book was the fact that it was uncomfortable the main character made me uncomfortable i wanted her to wake up to what she was doing there seemed to be a whole lot of talking about being aware and it grew difficult to read uncharacteristically i did skip to the end and considered not going back to finish it overall an interesting book though and eventually i finished it unlike my librarian","385":"a woman commits an accidental and incidental kidnapping the young boy the kidnapped is hilarious and sweet excellent funny heart warming read that was totally unexpected","386":"this was funny and different young librarian ends up a fugitive through silly decisions or lack of them i got a bit fed up with her almost strident attitude about gays okay already you like them i get it so do we all we just don't have it on top of our minds all damn day and i still am not sure how she could just up and leave a whole life and not really have much to show for her present one kind of hollow there but on the whole it was a charming and entertaining read the frequent mention of books i loved as a child added a nice dimension of nostalgia too","387":"though i enjoyed some of the chapter headings based on books some of the book references and adaptations of style i just felt throughout how sadly uninteresting this story was the childish and pompous nature of the kidnapper grated i kept thinking before you take on rescuing someone else's life grow up yourself","388":"loved this one","389":"not just for librarians but it may help that i am one","390":"rebecca makkai's first novel has engaging characters and a suspend disbelief plot ian is a brilliant 10 yr old boy who depends on the recommendations of a young librarian lucy hull when ian's unhappiness becomes extreme lucy investigates the weekly class his controlling mother takes him to run by a pastor specializing in reprogramming gay children then the disbelief part begins a road trip that ian coerces lucy into taking and continuing across multiple state lines lucy is an ivy league graduate who lacks common sense ian has many talents one of which is manipulating lucy both likeable main characters have a lot of baggage to work through and lucy at least seems to have a few aha moments as a result of the road trip ian reminds me of a very likeable 6 yr old prodigy bertie in mccall smith's 44 scotland st series bertie is dominated by a mother who insists that he study italian saxophone u0026amp yoga and doesn't let him pursue things he really wants to like boy scouts unlike the case in the borrower neighbors worry but don't intervene","391":"okay i am a children's librarian so i was bound to enjoy this book about a children's librarian right it's something that every librarian should consider reading i think because it deals with issues in the library bill of rights that are vital to our profession censorship privacy laws freedom of speech and thought and so much more what i did not expect though was such a delightful story to espouse these principles i particularly liked how the author tied in a few excerpts and themes from classic children's books to the story there are some marvelous insights and it's also filled with humor this all sounds like it might not be appealing to anyone other than marion the librarian but i really do think others would like it too","392":"great novel for a lover of children's literature i should have become a librarian","393":"okay so i loved this book so very much i do seem to fall in love with books about people who love books well this is one of those books a well written enjoyable tale of a precocious boy and a bored librarian that is entertaining in that it's additional cast of characters is as interesting and enjoyable as our main two protagonists i believe this was voted one of the best books of 2010 it is well deserved","394":"the narrator was one of those characters who rubbed me the wrong way and distracted me from the rest of the story i found the main character of this book completely unlikable i couldn't get past my antipathy for her to care about anything else happening in the book stepping outside of my annoyance with her i realize the troubling situation the young boy was in reading about it from her pov however i was distracted from it by what i perceived as her self absorption","395":"this was cute i checked it out because i heard her read a short story on this american life really liked that story would read that collection","396":"i thought to keep my librarian cred i should read this book i also liked the fact that russian identity and chicago played into the plot it did keep my attention long enough to finish it maybe because it was a quick read but it's didn't quite deliver on it's promise if you're looking for something that will occupy a few hours in a pleasant way then i'd say read it if you looking for a book that you'll go back to this one probably isn't it","397":"reminded me of so many children's books with a clare quilty type interspersed throughout excellent road trip librarian avid reader book","398":"review originally posted here the borrower is an utterly enchanting tale one that i should have gotten around to reading about a year ago instead it had languished on my shelves until i finally decided to apply strict order to my review piles i don't know why i didn't read this right away because i loved it if only i had opened the book up and read the very first page i would have made space in my schedule for this novel rebecca makkai's writing is charismatic and charming though her storytelling is largely straight forward first person she also plays with other styles in ways that are incredibly clever and entertaining she mixes in for example a couple of charts like ones illustrating how many of the ten commandments and seven deadly sins lucy has committed even better makkai mixed in little snippets where lucy imagines her predicament as told in the form of a children's book the only two i recognized the books for were in the style of if you give a mouse a cookie and goodnight moon but i'm sure an aficionado could identify the rest these snippets captured lucy's humor and her knowledge base so perfectly obviously i'm a bit biased towards any book whose heroine is a librarian lucy works as a children's librarian and i loved identifying aspects of librarianship that i recognize from the stories of others the library parts are so true to life that i really think any librarian will seriously get a kick out of this story especially children's librarians i think librarians and educators are perhaps especially well placed to appreciate this tale since much of it is about the concern for what adults to youth in trying to mold them into a particular type of person ian drake is the ideal child for a librarian he's that kid that keeps the librarian motivated and interested in her job because she so loves encouraging his passion for reading ian has one of those mothers the hyper religious kind that wants to keep her child from reading anything untoward instead forcing him to read only books he's not interested in fearful that ian might be gay though he's only ten he apparently has some sort of flamboyance that makes them suspect his parents book him in one of those rage inducing to me anti gay programs lucy finds out about this and wants to do something especially as she witnesses the change in ian like his reduced interest in reading and the library because of this when ian runs away she's disposed to help him rather than wrangling him back home when she should inadvertently she becomes a kidnapper and while i don't condone her behavior i do see how it happened in this makkai walks a fine line between caring and creepy between humorous and unsettling and to my mind does so very well the main focus of the borrower is one of identity ian struggles to find his true self while his nature his parents pastor bob lucy and everyone he knows try to make him be one thing or another lucy tries to balance her american half and russian half she desperately wants to be independent from her wealthy possibly russian mob parents so has thrown herself into librarianship because it was the first career to come her way but she has no idea if that's actually what she wants to do lucy's father too seems to wrestle with his identity and his past through his stories in which he re ensvisions his time in russia i love this quote on the importance of being oneself and must share it on my mental instant replay i realized that obliquely comparing his family to the nazis was maybe not my finest moment he was quiet a second and then he said 'did you know that hitler anted to be an artist but since he couldn't get into art school he turned into a nazi ' 'yes i remember that ' 'just imagine if he got into art school the whole world would be different ' i said 'it just shows that people should be allowed to be who they are if they can't then they turn into nasty sad people ' he started to laugh 'what if you went to the art gallery and the guy was like here you see a beautiful money and here on your left is an early hitler wouldn't that be weird ' i couldn't think of any subtle way to turn it back around again he said 'you would go to the gift shop and buy hitler postcards and you'd go oh look at this beautiful hitler i'm going to hang it in my room and people would wear hitler t shirts ' 'yes ' i said 'that would have been better isn't that amazing i just love the way the book was written different though they are in some ways i think this book would make be an excellent readalike for jonathan safran foer's extremely loud and incredibly close they share a similar whimsy with young adventurous heroes who have a unique view of the world both cover dark topics but through a sort of humor if you like these quotes i've shared by all means get yourself a copy of this book to enjoy this is a definite must for any book lover","399":"what a delightful book it concerns a sort of listless librarian and her friendship and sudden adventure with a 10 year old boy who might be gay to the horror of his very christian parents there are references to all kinds of children's books which all readers who were bookworms as children will have fun recognizing and remembering what i loved most about this book is the manner in which it pays homage to those formative reading experiences and acknowledges that for many of us books contain truths around which we can shape and live our lives as much as a religion or laws as someone who grew up reading seeking escape solace knowledge and unwittingly a framework to make sense of her world in books i practically cheered reading the concluding pages of the borrower how fun it was to feel again that sense of yes me too i have felt that way exactly i find it doesn't happen as often as an adult reader but it's just as thrilling when it does","400":"i loved this book makkai crafted a creative writing style borrowing heavily from familiar children's books her story also sounded a great note loved it loved it loved it barbara martin munster i agree heart breaking but also really funny though you might disagree with the librarian's decisions anyone who has worked with young readers will understand the emotions that affect her thinking chris griffith","401":"this book managed to be both cliche and predictable at the same time while also pigeon holing ethnic sexual and religious groups there were moments of humor and dimensions of the characters that were appealing but it was such a preposterous story line i had a hard time getting into it i wouldn't waste your time","402":"after the long week of scoring ap essays i can usually barely get my eyes to focus on the page let alone read for pleasure but i had started rebecca makkai's the borrower while my students were testing on the last day of finals and i couldn't wait to get back to it it is a literary kidnapping novel lucy hull a 26 year old librarian takes ian drake 10 year old book craving library patron on a spontaneous road trip when he runs away from home and she finds him hiding in the library the writing is clever the references to beloved children's literature are plentiful the story is sweet and it can't be the best book i read this summer already but i have a feeling it might be","403":"story fairly implausible literary references and librarian speak scrumptious","404":"this is easily my favorite read of 2012 it's a fun and funny picaresque with very serious undertones to keep the story anchored it's like the ms hempel chronicles meets thelma and louise","405":"i thought the borrower was humorous and clever a 26 year old children's book librarian inadvertently kidnaps a 10 year old boy who visits her at the library all the time the librarian thinks she's helping the boy escape his anti gay and possibly abusive christian family but she's really fulfilling a family legacy of running away don't worry lolita this is not i liked how most of the book chapters had to do with the titles of children's stories and i also liked that sometimes the author would start writing parts of the story to mimic the way certain children's books were written such as if you give a mouse a cookie if you give a librarian a closet","406":"to all my library friends out there you have to read this book which naturally i picked out from the librariana collection at the school of library and information studies library the book is about a twenty six year old renegade children's librarian lucy hull who kidnaps one of her patrons the young ian drake ian's parents are members of an evangelical christian cult and consequently have a long list of prohibited topics about which ian can read think j k rowling tolkien c s lewis none of which the highly intelligent ten year old ian can read and they think ian is gay he's ten so ian has been enrolled in straightening classes and so lucy and ian embark on a road adventure protected along the way by friends of the russian mafia friends of her russian father who knows more about lucy it turns out than he lets on i believe the book has received mixed reviews and some have been disappointed with the ending but i loved every moment of the book crazy as the tale may have been makkai the author has a wicked sense of black humor and it adds a wonderful edge to the book but maybe the reason that i enjoyed the book is because i do believe in the power of books to change lives even if just one person at a time or at the very least believe in the power of books to transport us away from wherever it is we are at that moment even if it's to a more miserable place consider the book i'm now reading for example being the testament of jessie lamb this book is a tribute to the work of librarians everywhere i don't advocate the kidnapping of minors but please keep doing what it is you do","407":"very enjoyable book highly recommended especially for anyone connected with libraries and or young adult literature i particularly appreciated the intertextuality many references to and parallels with other books for readers of all ages and the self consciousness of the story","408":"this novel is for anyone who believes that a book can save your life the literary references are endless and the hope that our two runaways find what they are looking for is the glue that holds it all together","409":"i rarely read fiction this was one of several books i loaded for a vacation it was interesting and held my attention it helped that it had a socially progressive agenda i can't recommend or not because for me it was so lightweight thus the irony of it being about people who appreciate and discuss books of lasting value","410":"a rather hapless children's librarian by trade not training attempts to help a young patron whose ultra conservative parents suppress his natural creativity interspersed in this occassionally sweet mostly hilarious account of a sort of kidnapping of the child are puns and rewrites of famous children's picture books to fit the circumstances though stereotypes abound this is a moving account of the power of literature on a young mind sadly the book is marred by a wishy washy main character the truly brilliant paradies on children's books that may be missed by the masses of individuals not familiar with the titles","411":"this was stressful to read for me but i loved it","412":"a light read without a lot of complex plot twists and characters but a message theme i haven't read about before religious family with an effeminate son seen from an outsider's pov if you have a kid in the 5 12 age range you will recognize the author's references to children's books i found them very entertaining","413":"lucy is a children's librarian in a small town in missouri she grows attached to a 10 year old patron named ian who is addicted to reading but has to sneak books past his evangelical parents she learns that his parents have enrolled him in weekly anti gay classes to combat his emerging flamboyance so besides just helping him smuggle books past his parents she is determined to communicate to him that some aspects of who we are aren't choices and can't be changed her involvement with ian escalates when she comes into work early one morning to find him camped out in the children's room at first lucy knows that she must try to return ian to his parents but through a series of hazy decisions and blackmail on ian's part they end up on a cross country road trip together in the course of the trip lucy learns a fair amount about her own family history and has to grapple with new truths that come to light but most importantly she tries to imbue ian with a sense of self acceptance that will stand up against the misguided ideals of his parents and church leaders they end up all the way in vermont with ian deciding that he is ready to go home because he wants to audition for the spring play at school lucy is certain that his return to hannibal will be the beginning of a jail sentence for her but with the help of her father and his russian mafia connections ian is returned without her being implicated after his return lucy learns that his parents have started to homeschool him which presumably means that they are stepping up their evangelical brainwashing fearing that because of her ian is worse off than he was to begin with lucy figures out a way to smuggle him reading lists for the next 8 years of his life books to keep him afloat until he can escape from his parents lucy herself starts a new life in a new town and is kept afloat by the belief that books can save people and they will surely save ian this was one of those books i didn't want to end because i loved it so much books save","414":"i listened to this one and i didn't like the narrator's voice so that probably colored how i felt about the book the little boy was irritating at times","415":"a fabulous book not a happy read but really good it makes you think made me a little angry a little sad you would like to say things like that don't exist in the real world but they do","416":"did she ever weed her shelves liked the book though although a little hard to believe nobody was frantic over the boy's disappearance","417":"oh my i didn't even try to skip to end on this one cross my heart not even one peek i let the ride pull me along and i enjoyed it--especially the unexpected and major russian soviet mis history aspect another unusual reaction i appreciated the loose threads and open ending this wasn't the kind of story that would serve tied up in a neat bow i am happy to speculate on ian's future years and happy too to let lucy and all her irritating qualities fade into her graduate school library if i never heard from glenn again it would be too soon etc etc yes read this book","418":" this is a fun quirky book it's really an homage to children's librarians u0026amp classic children's books i can't imagine the plot ever really happening the way it did to me the story didn't really have a good outcome lucy the librarian of the story meant to save ian from his unhealthily restricted home life by running away with him in the end she actually forced him into even more restrictions by now being home schooled but i did like the way some chapters were framed by popular children's books and i did like the list lucy left ian with to help him learn by reading important books at certain ages its too bad that lucy's plan though well intentioned didn't have enough planning to make it really worth while for ian it sounds like i didn't enjoy this book but i really did because i like children's books so much it was fun to be in that world for a while","419":"very unrealistic especially the ending if you are looking for a quick easy read then this is it it wasn't written poorly but it wasn't very entertaining","420":"super cute loved all the library and book references an interesting look at running away and cultures as well which was unexpected","421":"i was really on and off about this book and especially the characters i wanted to like it but i just couldn't do it the main character lucy hull gets on my nerves quite a bit she's pretty self centered and seems to treat everyone poorly her best and only friend from hannibal she realizes about two thirds through the book she knows next to nothing about and she self admittedly avoids him because she thinks he's in love with her it also seems like she thinks she's such a good person because she's the only one who'll spend time with him because he's in a wheelchair and it ends up coming off as a bit self congratulatory she's also quite a jerk to her boyfriend she pretends to like his music while laughing at it in her head and then instead of just ending it with him herself she basically tries to be as cruel as possible to him so he'll break up with her he's a bit attached to her but he comes off as a fairly decent guy bringing her flowers and attempting to be good with ian for her she loves to insult her library coworkers constantly as well her boss is apparently a perpetual drunk which she takes advantage of to trick her into believing she's agreed to things like vacation time and the other children's librarians are incompetent idiots who can't even handle story time without her she constantly is bitching about others' faults and looking down on everyone while framing herself as a revolutionary standing up for justice but enough of my rant on her the boy ian is similarly infuriating but that's more because i find most children frustrating he manages to blackmail lucy into taking him on a cross country trip which i guess kind of annoyed me that he didn't bother to think about what he was putting her through or didn't care also lucy was a complete pushover idiot to be pressured into this by a ten year old he throws tantrums every time he isn't getting his way and he's generally very moody i was never really sure quite what he was running away from he has a system set up for smuggling books from the library and his only complaint about the anti gay classes he has to attend is that they're kind of boring i guess he just wanted an adventure the story is pretty much taken up with traveling on the road and buying gas stop junk food lucy trying to tell ian it's okay if he's gay and just being extremely awkward and condescending instead lucy imagining scenarios in which the fbi track her down and she goes to jail for kidnapping lucy having a tirade against someone popular subjects include pastor bob with his anti gay classes and ian's supposedly anorexic evangelical mother ian being fickle and throwing tantrums so what i thought was going to be an exciting and possibly philosophical road trip turned into a whiny wandering mess in the end this book kind of beats you repeatedly with the message that fundamentalists are bad and books are good which i agree with in general but the book just seemed so awkward about saying it that it was uncomfortable and i disliked the character who was on the good side so much that i found myself trying to rationalize the behaviors of anyone she opposed the only really redeeming parts of this book where when there were russians involved mostly because i had fun reading their dialogue in a horrible russian accent big disappointment though considering the description sounded so good and the first chapter or two were initially intriguing","422":"myeh it was ok not engrossing as the reviews claimed it to be","423":"i loved this book although i sometimes got impatient with the pace of the story because i wanted to get to the end and see how it turned out a quote from the book i no longer believe i can save people i've tried and i've failed and while i'm sure there are people out in the world with that particular gift i'm not one of them i make too much of a mess of things but books on the other hand i do still believe that books can save you how can you not love that","424":"i wanted to read this book because the blurb said it was about a children's librarian well that wasn't exactly true the protagonist is a twenty something college grad who happens to work in the children's section of a small town library but she has not actually had any professional training no masters degree in other words i couldn't see that she had had any prior experience of any kind with children so one wonders how she landed this job there must have been a dearth of applicants and the pay must have been very low she does seem to have been very familiar with children's books in fact i really enjoyed the little bits of doggerel written in the style of well known children's classics which appear throughout the book somehow i couldn't really sympathize with lucy in fact she drove me crazy with her ill thought out jumping from one plan of action to another was the author trying to hint at her immaturity she was also extremely strident in her viewpoints i don't know i somehow found her quite irritating the young patron she befriends ian was also somewhat irritating to me oh heck the whole book was a disappointment i'll leave it at that","425":"4 5 stars was ready to give it a 3 until the ending which was lovely","426":"wonderful book about a librarian and a young male patron of the library who is experiencing difficulties with his parents both of these characters are so lovable i just want to meet them i particularly like that the librarian although quite young had a certain nostalgia for the pre computer method of checking out books right on that card was a history of who had read that book it reminded me of my volunteer days in the school library when i could see who had read a particular book for years in the past as i was reading this book i could not think of a possible good ending but the author surprised me the ending was wonderful and the book left me smiling","427":"annoying at times but overall very enjoyable","428":"makkai has the modern day children's librarian nailed i enjoyed this as it was a trip down memory lane for me i must admit i never 'borrowed' a kid nor did a kid 'borrow' me","429":"didn't love the story or the main characters there was a lot going on in the book and i didn't feel like all of what i thought were story lines were fully developed i think this book could result in some good conversations at a book club","430":"adorably demented or maybe dementedly adorable preposterous tale engagingly told","431":"an entertaining book simply because the main character was a librarian","432":"charming story of a children's librarian who tries to help a 10 year old boy whose parent's are sending him to be church program to prevent him from becoming gay","433":"a great fast read wonderful especially for me since i work in a library as does the main character the situations she recreates in the book are spot on as to the daily goings on in a public library and the plot is intriguing and current","434":"i'm not the hero of this story i'm not even the subject of this prayer loved this book looking at reviews i see quite a few people bitching u0026amp complaining that makkai must not be a parent and should never be a parent due to her writing a novel about a librarian who allows herself to be manipulated into going on a road trip with a 10 year old patron she often spends time trying to figure out if it is ian or herself that is motivating the continuation of it all recently i read huck finn for the first time which is hugely banned for the use of the word nigger the uproar against the borrower by makkai reminds me of that on a _much_ smaller scale 1 it's fiction if you want completely everything is as it should happen fiction this isn't the book for you nor are most books out there 2 very rarely do authors actually write with a social agenda they write to tell a _story_ to entertain i highly doubt makkai had some stick up her arse about christians or that she is so insensitive to parents that she gleefully went about trying to figure out the best way to stick it to them in a novel 3 i am a christian so i do speak about feeling like she was attempting to stick it to christians 4 if you're too obtuse to not fall in love with her makkai's use of children's books as storytelling devices to not fall in love with conflicted lucy who you might get pissed off at but she is loveable to fall in exasperated love with ian who never comes out and explains exactly why he did what he did but you gert a pretty good idea and it's not what you think to fall in love with lucy's questioning about heredity and the tales we inherit from our parents as well as their genes then you probably are the type that should stick with extremely safe reads","435":"a charming book about a small town librarian and a young library patron when his parents send him to a pastor who teaches anti gay classes the librarian takes him on the road to get him away from his parents the novel is filled with literary examples especially childhood literature a fun book with alot of heart","436":"huh the premise of this book really grabbed me but the reality not so much which is almost exactly what happens to the narrator there are some very clever takes on classic children's books that made me laugh as well as some insider librarian sorts of jokes there were references to great works of literature and their impact on youth struggling to find survive themselves that i enjoyed shared ultimately i guess i didn't like either of the main characters i didn't enjoy the feeling of impending doom that followed them throughout the story and while i was glad for a happy ending it didn't feel earned there was a description of the hobbit from a simple perspective i'd never considered a small man sets out on a journey and conquers all the monsters is that why i prefer the hobbit over the trilogy there were a few succinct summations like that which helped me look at books i thought i knew in a slightly different way and what more can i ask of reading a challenge to my perceptions an expansion of view that's why i read in the first place so maybe i should be giving this book a 4","437":"vaguely coupland esque you know before he sold out","438":"there were aspects of this book that i liked and i thought the author was getting at some interesting themes but i just couldn't get past the initial premise of the story librarian essentially kidnapping a child and i didn't find lucy to be admirable or sympathetic","439":"i am completely annoyed with this book the prose is good the descriptions are vivid the danger feels dangerous but here is a female character lucy whose entire life seems to be at the whim of whatever man happens to be closest be it her father a ten year old which she is grateful for when he takes charge a flighty theater owning landlord or a mysterious sunglass wearing man who follows her and the ten year old on their dubious road trip makkai's protagonist floats around like an empty bumper car being pushed one way then knocked another ending with neither transformation of character nor consequence for her reckless choices the other females in the book are one dimensional at best one's a drunk and references to her drinking follow her around one's a bitter mother and that's all we apparently need to know in short if a guy wrote this book all women would be justified in dismissing the tome as sexist misogynist and un empowering still makkai got some good press for it so good on her","440":"i gave this book 5 stars because it was such a joy to read for anyone who loves books who read anything they could get their hands on as a child and considered the library a second home this book is for you","441":"i'm at about page 100 and so far it's like a wet dream for a librarian","442":"started off really great but then became absurd","443":"this novel leads us on an improbable road trip with a wonderful if exhausting 10 year old boy and his um russian american librarian yes though with the amount of pages devoted to the librarian's self doubt and conflict between her actions sanity and reality what you want most of all is for her to just admit that she indeed kidnapped in her own way this child and that's a pretty unstable thing to do despite a sometimes redundant narration and a far fetched but not magical or fantastical foundation there are charms to be found between these covers the parodies adaptations of classic children's books to this story for example if you give a librarian a closet and the sweetly funny boy himself see how to brush your teeth like a ten year old boy and thank god or literature that she wraps it all up in a manner befitting the rest of the story no jail bars no violent drama but a just humorous and still uncertain finale","444":"what i really liked most about this book was the way it captured the whimsy of a children's book it was like a children's book for adults and full of humorous allusions to classic children's literature","445":"we need more books with children's librarians as the main character what a great concept and the ending was perfect i loved that i was reading this during a long car ride with lots of hotel stops from indiana to south dakota because the librarian is on a long car ride too without knowing her destination or when the trip will be over the other main character in the story 10 year old ian is great too i can picture him perfectly smart as a whip and funny and charming in many ways but extremely annoying at times i highly recommend this to all the librarians i know plus my sister who is an honorary librarian","446":"3 5 i'm awarding a 5 for all the references to children's literature overall i think this book could benefit from some friends wisdom you don't go taking people's babies so back off i will admit it was a page tuner though because i wanted to see if she got hers","447":"what happens when a librarian cares too much it's a cautionary tale for all of us a librarian at a small public library in a small us town tries to save her favourite boy borrower from his religious parents by taking him on a road trip along the way she realises that the boy is smart and resiliant enough to survive all that life confronts him with i haven't quite finished it so i don't know how it ends how can it possibly have a happy ending","448":"funny off beat enjoyable requires suspension of disbelief but worthwhile","449":"lucy hull is a children's librarian ian drake is a very precocious 10 year old and lucy's favorite patron ian's mother is a very strict conservative christian who puts a lot of limits on what ian can and cannot read no harry potter occult witchcraft wizards homosexuality fantasy etc one day quite by accident lucy discovers that ian's parents are sending him to a weekly \"camp\" with a minister who is \"famous\" for his seminars and classes to change people from homo to heterosexual when lucy inadvertently kidnaps ian or is it that ian librarian naps lucy they are in for an epic road trip from missouri to vermont with lots of interesting stops and characters along the way this book had me laughing uproariously at times probably because i am a librarian as well for example lucy and her co worker rocky go out for coffee frequently and turn just about everything into a dr suess book with hysterical results also lucy makes some great lists that are usually a spoof of a children's book case in point \"if you give a librarian a closet\" i loved the dynamics of lucy and ian's friendship ian's unwitting sarcasm and aptitude at lying to keep he and lucy out of trouble was great ian reminds lucy of a friend she had growing up and she feels the need to protect him ian loves that lucy will conspire with him to check out whatever books he wants they care deeply for one another unconditionally this built on their shared love of books and reading and lucy would do just about anything to get ian away from his folks and pastor bob i also loved how makkai interweaves the storylines of famous children's books throughout it was a fun fast read parts of the story did drag a bit especially when lucy's boyfriend was on the scene...but he provided necessary tension but that would be my only complaint","450":"a precocious boy runs away to the library and a young librarian decides they will get out of town on a long meandering road trip i loved the description of libraries and books as safe havens for those of us who don't fit in i loved the librarian's recommendations for books as almost prescriptive for coping with difficulty a passage at the end made me cry when reading in public i believed that books might save him because i knew they had so far and because i knew people books had saved they were college professors and actors and scientists and poets they got to college and sat on dorm floors drinking coffee amazed they'd finally found their soul mates they always dressed a little out of season their names were enshrined on the pink cards in the pockets of all the forgotten hardbacks in every library basement in america if the librarians were lazy enough or nostalgic enough or smart enough those names would stay there forever","451":"a quick read but a very strange book it reminded me of the elegance of the hedgehog i think that the author was trying to hard to prove that she is well read","452":"a fast read and some beautiful moments i'm not sure the plot ultimately hangs together and the novel is heavy handed in its treatment of those with whom the author disagrees politically and religiously but i do love the books can save your life theme on that point i think few avid readers

the book unfortunately the padding around the adventure too often feels like preaching to the choir censorship is bad libraries and independent booksellers are good and the frequent references to children's books--including a choose your own adventure interlude--quickly go from cute to irritating there's great potential but it's buried in unfortunate fluff june","455":"really 3 5","456":"if you wanted to be a librarian like i did or if you were a nerdy kid who loved to read and the library was your favorite place like me then you'll probably enjoy this quirky little book","457":"maybe 2 5young children's librarian lucy hull kidnaps or is kidnapped by precocious 10 year old ian drake frequent library patron she suspects he is being abused at home by his fundamentalist mother and ironically wants to save him many extremely clever references to children's literature and the writing is often very good but the story stretches credibility and what is the author actually trying to say in this book humorous light interesting characters","458":"i was compelled by lucy's story and mystified by her inability to take charge of the increasingly insane adventure it was easy to see how her circumstances could spiral out of control that i could relate to what i couldn't understand was how she let ian make all the decisions i tank this is lucy's self help story with ian along for the ride certainly a good read i especially enjoyed all the literary library references it was a trip down memory lane","459":"this is a surprising little book and an excellent first novel stop me if you've heard this one before a young mid twenty something children's librarian meets a young boy in small town america librarian meets boy's evangelical family discovers that said family will only allow boy to read so called holy books and later finds that the boy's family's idea of salvation for their child is something far more sinister there is so much to love about this book at points the narrative simply soars makkai's librarian lucy's interaction with the boy ian and his family are written with a starkly appealing simple realism and laced with a wicked sense of black humor toward the middle of the novel however when the big event happens i wasn't initially sold but as i continued reading i found makkai's writing to be rather genius and something that resembles a modern adult young adult fairy tale the world of the borrower is very much our own filled with the oppression of children the bigots who use extremist religion to justify their hatred and the salvation found in the world of fiction the history of books and yet the adventure that salvation takes our characters on is such it seems right out of the world of the children's novel the fairy tale and it suits the tale beautifully the final hundred or so pages of this novel are so wonderfully written they deliver an amazingly affecting ending one i did not expect the culmination of our story comes at you seemingly out of nowhere or at least on a level you do not expect it has been quite some time since i was so moved by the ending of a novel i expect great things to continue coming from rebecca makkai","460":"so i have conflicting feelings about this book i really liked its politics and i enjoyed the cute sy imitations of children's books throughout i liked the idea of the main character a 26 year old english major from college who works at a small town library because she doesn't know what else to do with her life however the whole plot was unbelievable and remarkably boring for so much of the book lucy and ian just drive around and randomly go from one place to another i was not compelled i was not surprised that eventually she would send him home i was not even all that interested in how things were going to turn out in the end i was also not completely convinced in ian at times he seemed 7 othertimes his actual age 10 i have a precocious well read 10 year old son and ian just did not always ring true for me however there were a few good quotes i was strangely deflated when they left it didn't feel quite right to invite myself along and i had to work the next morning but i still felt somehow that these were my people these crazy brave and unapologetic souls and yet as useful and i'd been as a prop they had failed to scoop me up and adopt me to recognize me as one of their own i love the emotion captured here in feeling simultaneously accepted and yet not wholly part of the group i no longer believe i can save people i've tried and i've failed and while i m sure there are people out in the world with that particular gift i'm not one of them i make too much of a mess of things but books on the other hand i do still believe that books can save you enough said overall it was entertaining enough but not really stellar","461":"struggled thru to finish it depressingly interesting in a bland kind of way had to finish it but the journey was not enjoyable","462":"a little light for my taste","463":"delightful details surprise you around every corner in this fresh funny story about a 26 year old children's librarian who unwittingly kidnaps a 10 year old patron i loved the constant references to classic children's books but those were by no means the only gems the exuberant smart probably gay kidnapee comes to life through spot on dialogue and insertions like how to brush your teeth like a 10 year old step seven is intentionally drop toothpaste tube on the floor and say 'i'm so crestfallen get it ' and that's not even getting into the russian mafia father story line or the gleeful antics of the theater troop neighbors there's so much more to this story than the accidental kidnapper plot which isn't bad in itself bottom line read this book you will not be disappointed","464":"review to follow","465":"i had high hopes for this because the main character is a librarian a children's librarian in fact and lots of references were made to classic kids' books throughout the text which was sometimes fun but it never really captured my imagination which is unfortunate because i fully agree with one of the main points which is that reading can change your life especially if you're a young probably gay kid living in a conservative household in the midwest on a technical library note there was at least one time when my brain went how would you even do that what sort of integrated library system are they using and where are their ethics library ethics people so that was fun","466":"a children's librarian finds herself abetting one of the library regulars a ten year old boy when he runs away from home what i liked the many references to children's books what i didn't like the librarians voice as she agonizes over the fix she's gotten herself into and the tidy way all the loose ends are tied up at the conclusion and really miss hull needs to get her mlis degree if she wants a career as a librarian","467":"it's not

running away who is the man who seems to be on their tail and should lucy be trying to save a boy from his own parents can't say that i really liked this book it is rather hard to believe that she could take a boy for several days and across several states without getting caught or any consequences maybe the parent in me couldn't relate to someone taking your child and it being a positive thing","469":"i liked this one a lot","470":"i loved this book","471":"librarian and 10 year old on a road trip","472":"i enjoyed the library references but the storyline was a bit bizarre","473":"strangely enough given that this book is essentially about inadvertent kidnapping i found this book to be delightful it was very witty particularly the statements from ian and the internal musings of lucy which i did not expect particularly when ian and lucy summarise their adventure towards the end it pokes fun at the absurdity of some elements of the plot that somehow made it feel more authentic like 'you can't make this up' the book also broaches a great deal of morality which lucy herself muses over who knows what's right and what's wrong really lucy is such a strong character to believe in her own beliefs yet she highlights that there are other perspectives i also loved the issue of trust and the way lucy sways between who she can and can't trust there is a real 'character journey' in the metaphorical sense too in this book as a library employee and library lover myself i loved all the little discussions about what goes on in a library and the statements about what a librarian should be or strerotypes at least in particular there is a discussion of the horrible librarian stereotype in the film 'its a wonderful life' something i've frequently had a tirade about despite loving the film so if you have ever worked in or spent significant amounts of time in a library you'll love the little details in this book","474":"what a strange little book a children's librarian kind of accidentally kidnaps one of her 10 year old patrons because his parents extremely fundamental christian control freaks afraid he is going to be gay are sending him to a religious bootcamp to cure him","475":"cute and entertaining if you suspend your disbelief that it would ever happen","476":"i'm really struggling with this book i enjoyed the beginning but now i'm wondering where the author is headed and how it can be ended it's really dragging in the middle with very little being added to the story i've renewed it from the library a couple times finished it not sure there was a point","477":"just the right amount of crazy well done entertaining read","478":"this is going on my favorite books list i work in a library and was drawn to lucy before i read the book i have seen some of the things that she had to deal with plus children like ian and his mom i feel like her sometimes wishing i could change things that i feel are not right this would be a great book club book it was fantastic i would recommend it to everyone especially those who work in a library","479":"very enjoyable can hardly wait to meet the author next week","480":"i've abandoned this book in the words of my smart friend sandy young there are so many good books why waste your time reading one you don't like abandon it","481":"a fun concept that i was generally willing to go along with i particularly liked the way the classics of children's ya literature including many of my favorites were used as narrative devices and the overall message can't be beat books are essential and reading is possibly the only harbor in the storm that is adolescence","482":"two stars seems harsh but although i liked this book in some ways it left me feeling cold in others","483":"for anyone who loves to read and sees the value of the written word as a means of enlarging and enlightening our world will enjoy this book humor and pathos and fear and frustration permeate the pages as the story unfolds in the end nothing truly is accomplished but the realization of how the future may be ameliorated by the many stories within so many novels leaves the reader with hope","484":"mixed feelings about this novel i most enjoyed lucy's father and the bits of reflection on the ussr but it was hard to finish because it felt like it stalled controversial topics aside the way the story was told seemed to drag on 2 25 5 stars","485":"i loved the main characters the librarian is the librarian i strive to be i loved ian but somewhere along the way the story became less about ian and his plight and more about the librarian's lost youth and misguided career her russian mafia family was a kick but i would have loved to just keep the story about her and ian and more of her borrowed tweaked quotes from well known children's classic it will make you laugh and get misty eyed but you will also be a bit disturbed","486":"a young children's librarian in a small town in missouri has a favorite patron an effeminate and brilliant ten year old boy who loves reading but whose parents are evangelical conservatives who place tight controls on what books he's allowed to read she tries to help him as best she can but sees him becoming more and more unhappy and she suspects his mom might be abusing him then she finds out he's being sent to a program run by a pastor who claims he can cure homosexuality in boys this is where the story gets implausible when the boy runs away and hides in the library she kidnaps him they run away together on a road trip to an unknown destination the children's librarian is a frustrating character she knows that what she's doing is wrong and crazy but she justifies her actions because she can't stand not being able to help him and she finds intolerable the idea of having to watch him as years pass and he gets squashed down and trampled because of his differences and never grows into the person he deserves to become the person whose life is changed by books and ideas i believed that books might save him because i knew they had so far and because i knew the people books had saved they were college professors and actors and scientists and poets they got to college and sat on dorm floors drinking coffee amazed they'd finally found their soul mates they always dressed a little out of season their names were enshrined on the pink cards in the pockets of all the forgotten hardbacks in every library basement in america if the librarians were lazy enough or nostalgic enough or smart enough those names would stay there forever \"i found this book frustrating because i couldn't see how it would end in a realistic way but i ended up liking it recommended reading for youth services librarians especially","487":"this book is about a children's librarian and a 10 year old boy the boy is a passionate reader and is probably gay his mother tries to censor what he reads and sends him to an evangelical class to make him heterosexual when the boy runs away to the library the librarian helps him and essentially kidnaps him what makes this book great the references to children's literature the reverence with which it treats reading and the growing learning and forgiving process of the librarian it took me to the end to appreciate what a great book it is","488":"i read this book in one long gulp i loved it i don't care if it is not realistic or if lucy is particularly likable...though i did like her her seemingly floating in the world until she is tethered by the love of ten year old ian did feel real...maybe because i was pretty untethered in my twenties i loved the parodies of the famous children books that are in my bloodstream as someone who was once a child and now as a teacher who reads to children and the odyssey lucy and ian take as unlikely as it is well i did worry about the kidnapping implications but her motivation to help him accept that he is all right being who he really is a friend who did not and committed suicide helped me to justify what she had done i have known so many kids like ian not in the possibly gay aspect but as bright charming and incredibly irritating a lot of the time that he seemed like a very real child the ending is wonderful","489":"i didn't love this book but i was curious as to where it was going so i finished it","490":"engaging a story of a unexpected journey of personal discovery","491":"i shouldn't count this book as read since i skimmed over a huge chunk of the road story i just couldn't get into the protagonist's passivity but i still cared enough to wonder how the story ended","492":"a delightful voyage and on many levels one filled with opportunities for discovery reflection and introspection...i love the provocation its reading was and is","493":"i liked it kind of quiet and maybe a little preachy but preaching what many could stand to hear good building of tension and final resolution especially liked the characterization of the narrator's family","494":"clever allusions to other books kind of fun","495":"you have to admire a book that puts its politics right out front central to the narrative what the whole thing is about a librarian helps a young boy escape his repressed family and their road trip is definitely a new variation on the road buddy story the plot is thin somewhat predictable and promises a grand resolution that never quite occurs but there are wonderful ideas along the way and you will definitely never think of a russian expatriate in the same way in the end this novel is above all a love story to books how they connect us how they open worlds to us even which ones we ought to read at certain ages books are the center of a thoughtful life an expanded and compassionate one and anyone who seeks to limit access to ideas and stories is suffering from a malnourishment worse than physical hunger lovers of books will love this book","496":"i really enjoyed the beginning of this book after they started on their road trip i started to become disinterested i don't know why it just somehow got less interesting i think that i really enjoyed the description of her life as a librarian the library itself and her actor neighbors all of these things no longer or barely existed as part of the story once they left hannibal which caused me to get bored a bit","497":"i found this book interesting because it is told in first person narrative by a quirky librarian i found it difficult to stick with the book but the reference to various children's books i've read or want to read kept me going the story line was lacking some though i felt the author totally busted me when stopped reading at page 115 and turned to the final page #324 and found the following text here are the hopeful last words for the peekers ahead the ones like ian and me who couldn't help but read the last sentences first yes for years i admit i have read the last pages of books before i reached the mid way point in the book i don't know why but perhaps on page 230 of this book i finally have a possible explanation 'it's that i always have to look back and see how many pages there are so i know when i'll be exactly halfway through but then when i see the last page it's like my eyes suck up all the words ' yes at that point i was hooked into completing the book i have quirky habits like several of the characters in this book would i read it again no but at least i know how it ends and what happens at the beginning middle and end","498":"one of the things i loved about this book was how easy it was to describe a children's librarian borrows a child of course that wasn't all it was and there's much more in the book like the occasional chapter that mimics a classic children's book and the zany company of actors and the strange but almost delightful family it's not a perfect book but it's a highly enjoyable one and one that has me thinking still long after i'm finished with it","499":"another one of those would have made a great short story books the main character was impossible to relate to the last chapter was the most redeeming quality of the book","500":"this is the story of lucy a children's librarian in hannibal missouri who one day runs away with a ten year old library patron ian or she kidnaps him or maybe it's him that kidnaps her either way this is lucy's way of saving ian from his evangelical parents who send him to a get straight school as it seems he may or may not be gay i loved the fact that this book has a lot of library related content i love the way she incorporates well known children's books into the story we hear what lucy and ian eat on the road in a very hungry caterpillar way but oddly it was a story where i felt i was waiting for something to happen even while feeling that too much was happening that shouldn't be i loved the characters i loved the plot but this was a case for me of all the parts not equally a whole i'd still recommend it though especially to my library co workers","501":"creative read about a road trip with a children's librarian and a 10 year old where i really didn't know where the story was headed i enjoyed the imaginative references to children's literature such as madeline good night moon and especially if you give a mouse a cookie or as the author wrote if you give a librarian a closet","502":"another book i'd give 3 1 2 stars to","503":"i have discovered from the reviews that you either love this book or hate it there is no middle ground i gave up after 100 pages i really didn't like lucy hull the librarian all that much and wasn't much fonder of 10 year old ian drake either","504":"lucy a children's librarian helps a 10 y o boy smuggle books past his overbearing religious mother the library stories sound familiar are you there k she also finds that the mother is forcing the boy to attend classes with pastor bob to steer him away from his tendencies to appear gay then when the boy is found camping out overnight at the library with his backpack lucy allows herself to be hijacked and the odd pair embarks on a crazy road trip the trip goes a bit beyond believable but the insights about books and their influence on life is the crux of the story","505":"after i finished this book my sister asked me what it was about \"a librarian who steals a boy \" i replied she seemed nonplussed by this answer \"she's russian well half russian something about potatoes in exhaust pipes chocolate factories...\" i trailed off as she stared at me as though i was in the process of losing my mind what this tale serves to illustrate is that it's quite hard to put into words what exactly happens in this novel and even harder to explain why it's so charming while not exactly believable the borrower is realistic in the sense that it describes the day to day comings and goings of lucy hull a children's librarian in a small american town who seems to have stumbled into her job almost by accident one of the regular features in her ordinary unsatisfying life is ian drake a young boy with a voracious appetite for literature and a troubled home life one night while she is locking up the library she finds ian hiding there and the two of them set off on an unplanned adventure the narrator's constant references to her russian heritage teeter on the edge of being annoying on the whole i found these references quite amusing and touching though other readers may find them tiring lucy isn't the most likeable character and i struggled slightly in sympathising for her seemingly non existent problems however this novel was charming and enjoyable waterstones sent me a free copy after i entered a competition on their website and while i might never have chose it myself i'm glad that i was given the chance to read it","506":"i didn't love this book i couldn't identify with the main character or really understand her decisions throughout the book when i was done it left me wondering who this woman really was and what was the point of this story","507":"just wonderful best to read vladimir nabokov's lolita before diving into this love letter to literature very creative and a joy to read","508":"stories within stories within stories so many stories and each person with their own perspective each life an open ended story because even after we're gone our chapters are in the minds of those we touched","509":"what a delightful book as i used to live in a small town with a community library eerily similar to the one featured in this novel i found it very easy to relate to while at the same time populated with quirky fantastical characters and outrageous plot twists to make it fun a joy for anybody who believes books can have a life changing influence on us as people","510":"a really good and interesting read i think that some of the doubt and internal monologue towards the end could have been shortened but it was otherwise a beautiful story i really liked the characters and the plot that was so different from anything else that i have read","511":"i received this book as a gift and had not heard or read anything about it prior to reading it the premise of the story that of a children's librarian kidnapping one of her patrons intrigued me and i was interested in seeing how it would evolve the relationship between lucy the librarian and ian the child was a kernel of the story and was developed gradually during the course of the book i was enjoying reading the book so much that i didn't want to finish it and was sad to finish that to be is the sign of a good book i would recommend this book to others to read","512":"this book requires a suspension of disbelief given that the plot takes quite unrealistic turns having said that i loved it i loved the two main characters and enjoyed the peripheral ones as well at heart this is a paean to children's literature and really to literature and reading in general and i got a kick out of all the allusions to and plays on children's books the book is terribly clever and very well written","513":"a children's librarian is sort of hijacked by a ten year old patron this is a fabulous book and i'll admit i was sobbing at the last fifteen pages or so before that i was alternately laughing maniacally and twitching nervously in other words maybe not the best book to read on the train i've read this author's short stories and loved them and they are actually very very different from this novel a lot of dark stuff and academic stuff and i picked this up because of how much i liked those but i liked the novel for entirely different reasons ian the kid has been enrolled in a marcus bachmann type pray the gay away program and lucy the librarian is horrified and watching his spunky personality unravel the author could have made the kid way too cute but instead he's a very real if very quirky ten year old manipulative and funny and strange this manipulative quality makes the moral conundrum even trickier there's a lot to be debated here to put it mildly and the very first sentence of the book is i might be the villain of this story whether lucy hull is the villain or not is up to you to decide but it's a more complicated question than you could imagine someone in another review said it made them want to go back reread all their neitzsche from college and i agree are a person's parents always in the right just because a child is their genetic offspring here's the question i plan to ask my book club i think we'll read when it's out in pb if ian were being actually literally sexually abused at home but they were living in a society where that wasn't in any way illegal would we understand lucy's decision to take him away from his parents for a few days with no real plan just because she couldn't bear to bring him home and if so is there any difference here where the case is a subtler but in ways perhaps just as insidious form of abuse the answer to that is going to depend very much on your political views but to play devil's advocate what are the long term results of sexual abuse presuming no physical damage confusion shame self doubt low self esteem mistrust of adults possible alienation from family risky sexual behavior what are the long term results of taking a gay kid and putting him in this kind of program and telling him over the next ten years that everything he feels is a sin i'd argue they're basically the same results sorry if this is more of a discussion and a debate as monologue but i can't stop myself from discussing this book and my club hasn't read it yet argh but to give it a proper review there's brilliant writing and description here fabulous one liners memorable and funny but not caricatured characters riffs or parodies on classic children's books that provided great comic relief but also poignancy at just the right moments and an affirmation in the end that books are what connect us to the world and sometimes the only things that can save us i stayed up till three one morning to read it and if i hadn't had work in the morning i'd have stayed up till four and finished it oh and can we talk about that gorgeous cover i'm talking us hardcover edition i love how vivid it is without slapping definitive descriptive details onto something we're supposed to imagine for ourselves i hope the same author does the paperback too and they don't just put the back of a woman's head or something to sum up loved it loved it ate it with a spoon","514":"strange story about a librarian who gets kidnapped by a 10 year old boy who is running away from home lots of literary references i found this to be a very slow read but in the end it was satisfactory","515":"didn't like it as much as i thought i would though i did enjoy the references to children books and book characters","516":"this author can not be a parent first of all to create this kind of storyline however her character can't recall her name now obtained this 10 year old boy purposefully or not just the fact that she didn't call his parents from moment one makes me feel like jail is a proper sentence for her as a mom i would have had an agonizing week wondering what kind of perv or loon had my kid along with all kinds of horrendous images unforgivable then it was suggested in the beginning that the parents were in some way abusive there was a very negative image presented of the parents as the story went along i realized that unless i missed something big the issues given regarding the mother were that 1 she wanted to ensure her 10 year old was reading appropriate books christian oriented to complement the family values u0026amp 2 she had enrolled her son in a religious class dealing with self actualization thinking it may be possible that the boy was gay u0026amp if so the class should prevent it this right here just gets me on sooo many levels first he's ten years old how could you possibly make those kind of assumptions about a child he was a smart kid kinda geeky maybe didn't relate well to kids his age that kind of thing so what where do you get gay from that and then who does this librarian think she is to decide that if he were gay she knows the correct and better way to handle it than the parents she questions him about the 'self actualization' class he took at the church u0026amp there was not one thing in the experiences he related to make me think that it was in any way inappropriate he was absolutely clueless to the message it was that she was trying to convey when she told him the class u0026amp the church were wrong in their way of thinking u0026amp he should just ignore that u0026amp be 'who he is' because these are things you cannot change and her expertise dealing with such issues is what to make it in any way appropriate for her to have been involved in any way at all much less kidnapping the kid to tell him that being gay is okay my point is that parents have the right to parent according to their values there are so many children with parents who don't care if their kids ate for the day much less pay attention to what books they're checking out at the library this was certainly not a case of abuse or anything remotely similar to that this was a case of an author who has some kind of beef with christianity u0026amp set out to create an appearance of christian parents as overprotecting bullies who don't agree with her line of liberal thinking look i'm not a religious fanatic i rarely even go to church but this just has me steaming as a former social worker i've seen real abuse neglect cases overbearing parents may not be perfect but they're certainly preferable to those who take no or negative notice of their kids i really didn't realize this book affected me to this degree until i started ranting on this review i felt better that in the end the main character admitted her inability to become a parent herself and sort of acknowledged the experience she helped put those poor parents through for over a week to me this was just a silly attempt to make the author's liberal views known hoping to hijack my feelings and achieve a 'feel sorry for the poor forced christian kid' as a tactic to see it her way uh uh quite obviously worked the opposite on me putting two sentences together u0026amp having the ability to make it sound pretty okay does not an author make who published this anyway","517":"i really enjoyed this cute story about a young librarian who is coerced into kidnapping one of the young library's patrons although unbelievable it was fun and i loved all the references to children's books a great read that went too quickly","518":"as a librarian i wanted to love this book as a reader i struggled full disclosure i didn't finish i got 40 pages in and hemmed and hawed about whether or not i wanted to continue ultimately deciding to pass it was an amusing and relatively true to life depiction of what it's like to work in a public library but i couldn't stand the narrator a self righteous judgmental and intolerant woman who condemns people exactly like her but on the opposite end of the religious and or political spectrum i don't always need to love the protagonist to get into the plot however first person narratives draw the reader into a very intimate relationship with the main character and i just didn't want to spend time with her again i didn't finish so perhaps the one dimensional characters rounded out and became more redemptive i didn't even make it to the rising action so take my reaction for what it's worth this book wasn't for me but it may be for you entertaining read nevertheless","519":"this book about a small town children's librarian who gets bamboozled into taking a 10 year old patron on a road trip which may or may not be a kidnapping only who kidnapped who has flashes of brilliance some of the author's descriptions of what it is like to work in a public library are spot on and painfully hilarious and the experience of being a librarian and that strange feeling that you have to constantly apologize and say but librarians aren't really like that though you are surrounded by librarians who are like that and then that desperate hope that at least hopefully i'm not like that well let's just say i know it and yes fellow librarians i now plenty of you who aren't like that but you know you know plenty who are i e my librarian friend who told me we didn't know where the story hour was in the mall so we just followed the women in the denim jumpers and we found it but this book ultimately made me too uncomfortable to say i really loved it because while i sympathized with lucy's outrage against 10 year old ian's parents who apparently already had him in an evangelical group dedicated to making sure the boys in the youth group don't go gay i couldn't be comfortable with someone taking a child from his parents and running away kudos to the author however for being willing to write a prickly funny book with a strange and unresolved ending that i will likely think about for a long time","520":"a really amazing debut the kind of book you could read on the surface just for fun or you can really think about it and the more you think the smarter you realize it is great for book clubs but i hope it isn't entirely relegated there","521":"i have mixed feelings about this one i absolutely loved the way ian and lucy were written but certain plot elements were so forced","522":"i've just read through some of the reviews on this book and i see that it has been quite polarizing i thought it was whimsical and compelling and sweet and ultimately innocuous the author is clearly not advocating kidnapping she has simply written a work of fiction i am amazed that this fact needs stating but obviously it does i breezed through it smiling at the literary references and laughing out loud at the quirks of ian and lucy i definitely recommend it unless you're going to freak out and write a crazy diatribe on here about it in which case please spare us all and just read twilight again instead","523":"i thoroughly enjoyed this book it had a quick pace and kept me reading unfortunately the book slowed down in the last few chapters overall very good though i wouldn't necessarily say that this book was funny","524":"this is so very clever a must read for any public librarian really enjoyed all the characters especially the young boy if you work in a public library you may never meet this librarian but you have met this little boy","525":"it was a very winsome story funny at parts and tender at others the part that irritated me was the portrayal of evangelicals as crazy psychos who withhold reading material from their children and try to coerce their children into their religion oh they are also homophobic i found that stereotyping sad","526":"entertaining enough to read as the main character does about the same job i do but the whole thing seemed kind of unconvincing and unlikely a librarian goes on a long road trip kidnapping with one of her favorite patrons a 10 year old boy who is probably gay and has christian parents who are sending him to a special class to eradicate his gayness","527":"buckle up for this wild ride with lucy hull a children's librarian in hannibal missouri lucy didn't set out to kidnap her favorite patron ian drake but that's exactly what it would look like to an outsider ian a curious 10 year old bookworm has to hide the books lucy suggests from his mother because they don't fit his mother's religious agenda as if the mother's suggestion that lucy censor books isn't enough to concern her lucy also discovers that ian is being sent to a class focused on \"curing\" gay children one night lucy discovers ian has been hiding out in the library and doesn't want to return home what results is a multiple state road trip where lucy starts to wonder if maybe she's running away from a life she doesn't want either bibliophiles and readers of children's books will enjoy all the references to picture books and classic children's novels that pop up throughout the narration","528":"loved every single page i read this one in about 23 hours only took time out to eat and to do therapy exercises for my shoulder oh and to sleep this should be required reading for the human race","529":"i enjoyed the borrower but was frustrated that lucy never asked the question that was foremost in my mind why did ian run away yes his mother was overbearing etc but why did he choose to run away on that particular day what was the catalyst that pushed him out of the house i was willing to wait patiently for the answer throughout the book but was disappointed at the end why didn't she ask","530":"as a lover of children's literature i appreciated this narrator -- a children's librarian -- as well as the author's use of famous children's books the pace of the book is inviting and i was eager to find out what happened it was just toward the end that i grew annoyed with the narrator and not in a good way the ending was satisfying though the characters rich and the narrative often funny and always interesting note i actually listened to this book on cd rather than reading it","531":"i really enjoyed this book it went in a direction i did not expect and i found it very hard to put down loved the main characters and the book had a great message","532":"an ok read it was pretty far fetched an inadvertent kidnapping and the main character didn't have much common sense an inadvertent kidnapping which got fairly annoying after a while and it was kind of irritating how stereotyped the librarians in the novel seemed to be maybe that is just because i work in a library myself however there were some redeeming elements like literary humor and issues dealing with gays i'm glad i read it but i would definitely not re read it","533":"the first half of the book was exciting to read and then trickled off into a bit of repetitiveness i was hugely disappointed in the fact that the librarian hated her job and made very poor decisions ian's character could have been a little more developed","534":"lucy hull is a children's librarian who has a truly engaging patron named ian drake ian is an avid reader but his mother wants to have tight control on what he reads his family is also involved with a religious group that has definite ideas on what is and is not acceptable including sexual preference you get the definite idea that ian's family has some notion that he may be gay thus they have him in special classes with pastor bob early one morning lucy discovers that ian has been camping out in the library overnight desperate to supposedly save him from what she thinks is going on she allows herself to be hijacked by ian and they embark on a strange cross country trip this had a very strange resolution but an interesting story all the same","535":"loved this book and all the children's book references","536":"with 800 reviews i don't really need to say much about this novel it's a very readable charming novel i mean that in a best way the middle sagged a bit for me but the voice is so strong it carried me through i have a few issues with parts of the plot but ultimately the novel works out i'd say you either accept how the plot unfolds in the novel or you don't and if you don't then i don't see you liking the book much a couple months ago i got the chance to hear makkai read from this novel as well as short story and it was really fantastic also i got to chat with her at a reception following her reading and she seems to be a really nice genuine person for whatever that's worth i think she's got a short story collection in the works and if her track record with best american stories is any indication the collection should be great","537":"4 stars i really liked it this story had me at hello because the author and the narrator borrow freely from every imaginable writer from vladimir nabokov to eric carle and they make no secret about it not to mention it tells the story of a librarian who loves a kid recommends books and fights for the first amendment the freedom fighter and english teacher in me was thrilled my relationship with the book got more complicated as it went on and began to caricature evangelicals the author develops the rest of her characters with ingenuity and discretion from old anecdotes to revelatory appositives but the evangelicals are one dimensional uni vocal and worthy of the reader's disgust yuck still the journey is one worth taking there and back again and while she does get quite preachy at times the author succeeds in getting us to ask important questions about how we parent how we love and what it means to influence another person's life most of all she wants us to sift through our stories the ones we read the ones we tell the ones we think we know and even the ones we think we're living she dares us to try and find the glimmers of reality those accrued stories this is difficult prospecting that has as much to do with our own crooked hearts as with the lives of those we touch and i for one am glad makkai asked me to do it","538":"loved it i don't know what else to say i am interested to know if people who are not book loving librarians feel the same way","539":"novel's first third is interesting and unusual with some very amusing writing and a unique main narrative voice the last two thirds of the book are marred by an unbelievable russian american mafia subplot that is ridiculous also the novel lost all credibility for me toward the end when a vulnerable character experiences a bout of asthma due to a rather extreme amount of animal allergens and yet remains in that location successfully for more than 24 hours without access to an inhaler yeah right there are at least three endings to the novel one of which involves the magical existence of a platinum credit card for emergency use which was not mentioned previously","540":"i love this of course it is about women books and travel but hey it is great i had to change the rating because i can't stop thinking about it you must read it","541":"well i'll be honest i joined goodreads just so i could review this book it is one of those ones that makes you want to grab strangers on the street and force them to read it while you watch their face to see their reaction but more about that in a minute i do read reviews on goodreads from time to time usually after i finish a book oddly and two things were bothering me about the responses to this book and i felt compelled to respond to them it seems i had to join to do that first it's odd to see so much moral judgment of a character in a book where the very first line is i might be the villain of this story it's almost as if other readers have conflated the author with the narrator and figure that if in the end the narrator is culpable then it must have failed as a book how very strange a response i'd love to see these same readers' responses to crime and punishment let's give the author a little credit here if she'd wanted to make this a clear moral case it would have been so easy maybe too easy to do that instead she chose to make her narrator just as flawed as ian's parents and that's what makes it a great story i've been troubled in recent years by the obsession with likability people demanding that their characters make good choices or become better people in the book but i digress secondly as a retired school librarian i need to say this to the librarians on here saying they refuse to like the book because lucy doesn't have an mlis first of all there absolutely are libraries way out in the cornfields where someone could end up in even an administrative position with nothing more than a ba i even know of two different public libraries where the head librarian argue if you will about whether that should be her title has no mls to me this was sufficiently explained in the book by the boss being drunk and not caring and being in crisis over losing her children's librarian to cancer when lucy's resume showed up in her mailbox and in a very small isolated town it seemed fully in character this is not a real person who took a job away from a real qualified librarian for pete's sake but regardless of all that who in the hell cares my husband was a surgeon for forty years and if he dismissed out of hand every tv show movie and book that didn't play true to life on medical details he'd never have enjoyed anything this is a book that every politician in washington should be forced to read before they even dream of cutting library funding this is a book that is a love letter to libraries and librarians who quibble over the little details are missing the point and back to my main point this is an amazing book it's very of the moment with michelle bachmann's reparative therapy business in the headlines and it's a book that every pflag member every school guidance counselor every gay adolescent should read and everyone else too","542":"normally i'm a big fan of librarian main characters but this book left me conflicted this librarian basically kidnaps a kid and while she moans quite a bit about guilt pays no real price i did read until the end and the ending has a great moment in it but i can't recommend this book","543":"the borrower seems like a decent attempt at a novel although makkai has apparently written other pieces i'm unfamiliar with them i am guessing this is her first attempt at something longer i could be mistaken i don't think she's trying to project herself onto the main character but it seems apparent in the writing that this is someone who is pretty familiar with children's and young adult literature if i were to try my hand at a novel i doubt it would come together as well as this one however that doesn't take away from the fact as i see it that the plot is contrived the characters are one dimensional and the writing is clunky the one aspect that i actually enjoyed well enjoyed a bit better than the the rest were the segments where makkai wrote a bit of her story in the well known style of another choose your own adventure my personal favorite if you give a mouse a cookie the very hungry caterpillar and goodnight moon jump to mind some of the other literary references seemed to be forced into the narrative in a way that doesn't really work really expecting atticus finch to be there when you woke up one of the things that really bugged me is something i only realized after watching the latest episode of once upon a time in both of those stories there is a 10 year old boy who basically takes command of adults women no less around them perhaps the fact that all manipulated adults are women has subconsciously bothered me but i find myself annoyed that the adults are not acting like the adults they are supposed to be look i don't mind giving children leeway and freedom but not like what is portrayed here in this story it seems like lucy is essentially afraid of a temper tantrum sure ian's threats to claim she kidnapped him seem a bit plausible she never should have gotten into her car like that in the first place though but lucy seemed way too submissive to ian's moods seriously and ian on the one hand he's supposed to be this precocious 10 year old on account of all the reading he's done yet his behavior seems more on par with a 7 or 8 year old maybe i just have to witness these 10 year old temper tantrums to see that they're age appropriate as in yes 10 year olds throw fits like these or maybe it's just another sign of the repression he faces in his family i know some people were disappointed at the lack of any kind of reprisal against lucy for her obviously illegal behavior but i wasn't the entire story just seemed to kind of wander here and there until it ran out of pages and almost wandered out of the back cover stories are usually about growth and changes i didn't see any of that here yes lucy and ian went on a road trip together which usually helps you get to know someone well but it was such a weird contrived road trip ian ends up going back to his family lucy stops working at one library and starts working at another what was the point was there any lesson learned not to get involved in kidnapping a child you've only imagined is emotionally abused but even then if lucy did have that kind of lesson it's sort of a self realized one not one with any repercussions simply one that makes her look back and say huh maybe i shouldn't have done that weak the supporting characters are similarly weakly developed the drunk boss the gay actor landlords the handsome but dull boyfriend the ethnic father the anorexic controlling mom rocky the overlooked best friend is somewhat interesting at least compared to the others but we hardly see him","544":"maybe it's because i work at the library maybe it's because i feel protective toward children maybe it's because the book is simply wonderful whatever the reason i love this book i happily tagged along as a librarian's life became unconventionally entwined with that of a child patron some readers may see this as 'not possibly ever happening in real life' but i see it differently for me the story was very possible given the right set of circumstances the story uncovers some of what we see as employees at a library it's hard not to sometimes feel close to young patrons that we see often over many years sharing their accomplishments and woes conversations revolving around books authors life dreams etc can be magical when the experience is being told by a six ten or nine year old i hope makkai will write more books incorporating children and libraries into the stories","545":"the plot is pretty straightforward highlights include detailed descriptions of librarians library work and reflections on american identity and that palpable desire to run","546":"librarian runs away almost accidentally with kid patron whose mother doesn't appreciate his reading starts out with humorous eccentricity eventually bogs down as the plot fails to keep up the tone","547":"funny inventive screwball of a debut about a rootless children's librarian and her friendship with a nerdy 10 year old library patron whose mother believes he should only read books with the breath of god in them it's not entirely successful but it's a fun ride especially for anyone who loves children's literature","548":"all librarians should read this partially because some of the observations of library life are pretty astute the story is compelling as well and strikes the perfect note of dread given the subject matter quite a few paragraphs that will really stay with me","549":"this is a great read for anyone who who has a passion for reading we are not alone and not often does a book make laugh out loud","550":"this book was well written and entertaining i liked the quirky characters and unusual situations they found themselves in however as i read the implausibility of the main storyline was irritating and not sufficiently resolved at the end","551":"i loooooooved this book here's something cool i figured out after the fact and it actually made me appreciate this book even more oscar diggs the priest in vermont is the real name of the wizard of oz it started making me wonder what else i had missed that's not a spoiler btw just something cool for others who have finished it this book was so funny and beautiful and the ending was sort of amazing favorite book of the year so far no doubt","552":"there are two things i loved about this book 1 the hilarious heavily accented use and mis use of american expressions by the russian father here in america there is world class kgb to be had on the cheap and 2 the use of phrasing techniques from clearly recognizable children's books in a book about a children's librarian and a boy who loves to read sadly the depressing weight of the knowledge that their adventure could not possibly end well seriously impaired my ability to maintain that love sure it ended better than i thought would but only because the resolution was not particularly plausible as a reader of fantasy novels i am certainly not anchored in realism but don't ask me to suspend my disbelief at the end of a book whose plot is otherwise fairly mundane","553":"while i enjoyed the references to kids literature i found both the woman who borrows the boy and the boy himself really annoying and it seemed like a long book to read to come to the conclusion that books can save lives","554":"i didn't like or relate to the protagonist very much but i loved the irrepressible child character and the emotionally intense reading experience","555":"there were parts that were funny and entertaining but i finished reading it because i wanted to see how it would end","556":"a children's librarian runs away with a ten year old boy whose fundamentalist mother is trying to have him deprogrammed as she thinks he may be gay such an entertaining story with a very precocious kid lots of name dropping of children's books something i love","557":"\"what do you call a would be revolutionary stuck at a desk antsy maybe trouble a dormant volcano \"lucy hull second generation russian immigrant to the usa and hugely over qualified children's librarian is captivated by one of her regular patrons when he appears unhappy at home and runs away she helps him hide... a little too eagerly this started very strongly but sort of petered out as lucy and ian went on their bizarre road trip i enjoyed both characters and thought makkai did a particularly good job with ian making him both precocious and your regulation issue annoying 10 year old boy \"that's the other thing about my symphony all the piano parts would just be for your right hand \" lucy was fun an apathetic russian american but her actions made less and less sense as the book went on \"i hated that i'd started to look like a librarian this wasn't right in college i'd smoked things my first car had angry bumper stickers i came from a long line of revolutionaries \"\"he's so far in the closet he's like back in ing narnia\"\"in soviet russia library book checks you out\"\"i refused to have bookshelves horrified that i'd feel compelled to organise the books in some regimented system - dewey or alphabetical or worse\" which begs the question what regimented system is she thinking of with \"worse\" \"george eliot and jane austen shared a stack with thackeray because all i had of his was vanity fair and i thought becky sharp would do best in the presence of ladies and deep down i worried that if i put her next to david copperfield she might seduce him \"i'm going to stop now you get the point but the plot was lethargic","558":"loved this book almost all the way through lucy is a children's librarian in hannibal mo who finds herself helping a 10 year patron ian run away as they embark on a road trip across the us lucy learns more about herself and her russian immigrant father lots of good discussion topics for a book group and i truly enjoyed the adaptations of a lot of famous children's books to help tell her story","559":"this is the story of lucy a children's librarian who runs away from home with ian an odd and endearing young boy who is a frequent patron of the library the premise is far fetched definitely but ian is such a wonderful character that i didn't mind the craziness so much there are lots of in jokes related to children's literature and anyone who loved to read as a kid will want to give ian a big hug there were many moments that made me smile in that lump in your throat kind of way i think my siblings in particular would probably like this one","560":"i think the primary reason why i mostly enjoyed this book is because i hate the narrator so much the narrator lisa is a awful awful person","561":"had a bit of a hard time finding common ground with this girl that 'kidnaps' her library patron but i enjoyed the library talk and the structure of the book and the writing also realize i need to read more children's books","562":"this is a very odd unbelievable story as our children's librarian tries to help out 10 year old ian who may or may not be gay but his christian parent's think he may be so they send him to an anti gay minister treatment and only want him to read god filled stories this author does have a good grasp on children's literature with the quotes and characters from other books however as a librarian not so much when ian runs away to the library and ends up in lucy's car they end up on a road trip and this where this story goes off the rails for me lucy talks about oh what i'm doing is wrong but she doesn't take the boy home just because his parents don't let him read the books he wants to read i'm sorry as a librarian i am all for intellectual freedom but i also believe that it is a parents right to decide what their child reads he is 10 years old and who are you as a 20 something children's librarian to decide what is good for him i felt she was helping enough letting him read what he wanted while he was in the library and helping him smuggle out books but the whole road trip kidnapping was just going too far lucy and ian are both a bit annoying and actually unsympathetic and i found it really hard to continue with this book but since i received this as an early review copy i must finish between the story the characters and the audiobook narrator this is really hard to keep going honestly i have tried 4 times to finish this one because i have to stop for awhile and get away from the grating voice and whiny narrator i listened to this on audio and i just want to clarify i listen to a lot of audiobooks in a month and i have heard some wonderful narrators unfortunately emily bauer isn't one of them she sounded like a little kid while narrating lucy then when she was doing the voice of ian it was even worse and was extremely grating if she was narrating as a child she may be ok but she is narrating the voice of an adult and sounds like a whiny preteen however her voice and the story grew on me... i wrote the above when i was half way through the road trip as a whole had its cute parts but it was still really hard to understand why there wasn't an amber alert and the parents weren't on tv wringing their hands so i decided to kind of put it in my head it set in an earlier decade it was easier to suspend my thinking and just enjoy the story all in all this isn't a bad book you just have to be willing to suspend your belief about the circumstances and just let the story tell itself hovering between 2  1\/2  and 3 starsfyi my rating system 3 stars good book but some things didn't connect with me2 1 2 stars just didn't connect to this book but was okfull disclosure i received this book from librarything early reviewer program","563":"a bit far fetched but i loved the references to the children's books","564":"this was a fun book i didn't know what to expect and i loved the way the author mimicked familiar children's books to bring humor to what could be a dark story i was very plesantly surprised","565":"what a delightful journey this book took me on","566":"saw this book as a local librarian recommendation so i've been looking forward to reading it i even almost bought it before border's completely went under didn't realize it would pursue two controversial topics coming out and child abduction it does fair by both the children's librarian non mls voice starts out accurate but then deviates into this odd russian philosophical head trip that i eventually found tiring problems are solved by an obvious deus ex machina resulting in an empty ending unless you felt caught up in the narrator's internal drama in short it has its high points but oversimplifies characters to present philosophy which may not be a terrible way to push acceptance for emerging sexual identities","567":"liked a lot enjoyed the library observations although their journey was compelling it was troublesome to me that she had kidnapped a child instead of taking him home","568":"the borrower is a book for bookworms anybody who was an obsessed reader as a kid or reads children's and ya now for that matter what a cool premise lucy a young children's librarian in a small southern town loves suggesting books to 10 year old ian whose mother is an evangelical who tries to censor what he reads the list is hilarious and includes witchcraft magic weoponry the theory of evolution halloween and roald dahl lois lowry harry potter and similar authors they are also sending him to a christian group to try to deprogram his early signs of being gay so when ian shows up at the library to run away lucy ends up on a roadtrip with serious implications how awesome is that makkai weaves book titles and illusions into chapters and chapter titles and it's just a delight the dialogue is so crisp and lucy's relationship with her russian mafia father is terrific too and the desperate hope that reading can save lives is one most avid readers share he's so far in the closet he's like back in fucking narnia i was all for catching terrorists but not at the cost of turning the libraries from temples of information into mousetraps","569":"for her first book i think makkai did a good job i feel bad only giving this book 3 stars really i feel like 2 5 stars because i think makkai is a great writer and the way she wove themes and styles of well loved children's books throughout the novel was clever and worked really well it didn't feel stupid or cheesy which was impressive the story itself was fairly interesting to me but never felt like something i could relate too there were a lot of threads that she was trying to tie together but i didn't really feel like it was working out that well i felt like the whole storyline of her family history only somewhat gelled with the storyline of lucy and ian's journey i took issue with makkai's blatant attack on all christians mostly because she made some pretty sweeping assumptions i do like that she had lucy admit that she was self righteous that made me feel a little better but makkai never made any effort to admit that these issues are nuanced and complex yes i agree with her that putting a 10 year old boy in an ex gay class is not good but i also acknowledge that parents who sincerely believe that being gay will send their son to hell would be acting in what they believed was his best interest also the classes ian was going to did not appear abusive but mostly not all christians would censor their child's reading send them to ex gay class etc all in all i found lucy to be a weak selfish person that i didn't really like again i felt she admitted that but for some reason that didn't placate me right now that's making me give this book a low rating maybe i'll change my mind it's possible","570":"this book is the perfect book for those that have fond memories of the books they read as a kid its about a librarian who sees one of the boys that visits the library daily in need of some help the library seems to be the only place he can escape to its not really clear on who kidnaps who but the two go on a road trip that leads them each to discovering something about themselves this book proves that you can be saved by books","571":"i want to love this book more than i did took me about 3 weeks to read which is not the norm for books i like love the references to children's books but annoyed with the 10 year old and the librarian makes it difficult when they're the main characters","572":"this book seemed like it would be entertaining but it kind of disappointed a little it started out well but fell into a trap of a good idea that doesn't really know where it is going it felt kind of gimmicky i wish it had been a little bit more thought out","573":"second book i have read recently with this sort of theme don't like the idea of a character doing something like this and not suffering consequences although there was no harm done in either instance","574":"any reader will love this book","575":"fun book totally improbable i liked the library connection and the librarian's russian connection it felt like it should have been a young adult book and could have been with some editing out of some stuff about her boyfriend and maybe her family history","576":"this would be a delight for librarians children's book lovers elementary school teachers i enjoyed it although i realized that my knowledge of children's books stops about 1970 u0026amp younger readers may get more out of it than i did for example i've never read the borrowers bothered me that the librarian wasn't actually a librarian sigh","577":"what a great fun wonderful book i need to go give sharon a big hug for recommending it i don't think you have to have ties to a library to love it but it can't hurt nothing turned out the way i thought it might it was unexpected and delightful it might be one of the few books that i will have to make time to read again if i could pick a sticker to put on the spine to classify it i'd choose a big yellow smiley face","578":"such a great novel i loved all of the literary references within","579":"during children's book hour librarian lucy hull would ask the children who is the hero of this book this was easy it was always the main character in children's books there is rarely an antihero an unreliable narrator p 6 the borrower thus begins a witty and literature filled ride driven by lucy herself as the unreliable narrator some reviewers have indicated that the plot premise is implausible but i suggest otherwise lucy sets herself up as an old main washed up librarian but in reality she is only 26 and just figuring out who she is not to say that her actions make a whole lot of sense but certainly anything is possible slight spoiler below the only thing that troubles me is lucy what happens to her after this episode and is this really the defining moment of her life because while there might not be legal repercussions for her actions i think the mental ones are deep","580":"is it possible to run away from home as an adult is helping a kid run away the same thing tagging this as adventure because it kind of is in its quiet way i enjoyed this and was pulled along through the story and finished really hoping things turn out okay for everyone the audio was pretty good too","581":"in the beginning i was really into this book yay books and libraries yay little gay boys yay giving the finger to wacko fundamentalist christians and then it devolved into a long boring and poorly thought out road trip kidnapping blech","582":"i read this book by chance i was leaving the library the other day and it was on display so i just grabbed it it's about a children's librarian who kidnaps a ten year old boy whose family is sending him to an anti gay camp the author does a good job of maintaining a moral balance between the librarian doing what is right by saving the child from psychological abuse and the methods she uses to save the child the epilogue is especially moving this is not a deep read but a fun read","583":"the main character is a children's librarian with no library sciences degree hmmm sounds like me i loved it","584":"i thought this story started out slow and i was at first a little annoyed by the protagonist's passivity as the story got rolling though i found her much more sympathetic and began to enjoy myself told in the first person i found the narrative voice unreliable but quite funny the kid is a riot of course a certain suspension of disbelief is required in order to get on board i thought the end was perfect","585":"cheesy i read this book for a book club discussion the premise is that a lonely librarian kidnaps a little boy and they go on adventures together i just simply did not care about any of the characters in the book including the major and minor ones this would be a good book if you were looking for a gift for a conservative reader cute but nothing much past that","586":"lucy is a children's librarian who one day sort of accidentally takes her work home with her actually she kidnaps one of her regular readers well perhaps not kidnaps but something very close to that only not so malevolent ten year old ian suffers at the hands of his fundamentalist parents although it's not exactly crystal clear how and he runs away somehow he manages to drag lucy with him as they spend 10 days wandering aimlessly through several states leaving mountains of lies behind them lucy questions her sanity as well as her ethics they soon begin to run out of funds and suddenly realize they are being followed and it seems that this story can only end badly yet eventually one thing becomes increasingly clear sometimes the worst choice turns out to be the best choice very tenderly told this is a sweet tale of books family identity and surprisingly love","587":"what an interesting kind of book the ending leaves you with a couple of different thoughts but no true answer but based on the story itself kind of come up with your own conclusion","588":"reasons i loved this book the main character was a children's librarian children's books were scattered throughout the story the author included some great take offs from my favorite kids' books in a library in missouri that was covered with vines lived thousands of books in a hundred straight lines a boy came in at half past nine every saturday rain or shine his book selections were clan des tine what's not to love well i never really got the motivation behind why the main character lucy did what she did i really couldn't believe that she would do it and that it could end the way it did the premise just didn't make sense but the kid lit references made it worthwhile for me","589":"let me say it straight out this book isn't going to be everyone's cup of tea those who cherry pick the bible - who ignore the parts that say \"you can't ever eat pork or shellfish and women should cover their heads and you can't plant two crops in the same field\" yet laser in on two little verses that may or may not imply that god doesn't like gays - will likely be offended certainly the existence of those who believe not in absolute rights but in their particular absolute right offends the protagonist lucy hull a young children's librarian her heart goes out to her favorite patron a young 10 year old boy named ian drake who is likely gay his uptight mother rather than accepting him as he is promotes a strong anti gay evangelist agenda wanting him only to read books with \"the breath of god\" when lucy finds him camped out in the library after hours she makes a split second decision she spirits him away from his parents and finds herself on the lam on an improvised road trip to chicago and points east it is here that i felt the book goes temporarily off course if this were not a parable but a story about flesh and blood people surely lucy would understand the ramifications of leaving abducting a young child and certainly she would quake at the consequences of such an action and seriously consider what she was doing her motivation - or should i say lack thereof for such a bold move nearly derailed my reading experience fortunately i stuck with it and discovered the book was less about ian's own journey toward his coming of age intellectual awakening than lucy's lucy - the daughter of a russian mafia father - has lived with illusions her whole life as she finds out everything is not so black and white in one's personal history and along the way she learns that there is also no happy ending in many cases lucy runs head on into her own sense of hubris when she reflects on her key goal in fleeing with ian \"there was a picture from somewhere of a place i would take him maybe a place from a book a white walled sunny house where people took care of children...\" yet as she discovers \"i had failed to understand that the reason you can't change who you are is that you can't change where you're from \"there are some delightful plot twists and some implausible ones the characters can be engaging...at times infuriating...and in at least one case superfluous the theme though remains constant we cannot lazily rely on accepted platitudes or religious homilies instead we need to be mindful of our journey of self discovery... and sometimes that journey takes us back to a place called home i applaud the author for taking on such an emotionally charged topic 3 75","590":"audio book skipped 2 cds and didn't miss anything in meandering journey initially interested in gay 10 year old character but way too preachy","591":"quick read that left me satisfied great weekend book","592":"it was a bit slow at points but i enjoyed it overall","593":"i'm 30 pages in and already i want to marry the narrator just so i can have an excuse to slap her across the face that's how it works right she's really just too pretentious and self assured for me to handle i don't think i'll finish the book","594":"this book was delightful and surprisingly so i have to say when my mother told me the novel was about a children's librarian who ends up kidnapping a ten year old boy i was a bit skeptical of how the author might manage pulling that off in an interesting and believable way but rebecca makkai surely delivers with the borrower the reader feels immersed in the story with the main characters lucy and ian as they journey together to no definitive location and what a journey it is full of laughs surprises and a fitting ending this book is a must read","595":"i want to review this book higher because it is such a unique story it is so easy to just disregard the story because lucy is well stupid ok not fair but no librarian or even sane adult would abscond with a young boy and not get into any trouble but that isn't really the heart of the story if you can overlook that and get to the heart you will see what i mean the heart of the story for me is not that everyone fears that ian is gay it is not that he has extremely evangelical parents who enroll him in a pray the gay away type of program it is not about the russian kgb it is about books period it is how books create bonds with like minded people it is how this love of books bridges the age gap between anyone it is about a boy who went on an adventure along with a woman who was on her own adventure it would be easy to say that they share the adventure but they clearly don't lucy learns to grow up and accept who her family is and ian just gets his adventure while being safe with someone he trusts at first i hated the ending i really wanted to know how ian turned out but after thinking on it i have decided that i liked it just how it was written i especially liked the asides which were caricatures of children's books i like to think of ian growing old keeping lucy's final messages hidden and adhering to them and growing more secure as he ages because of them i didn't really give much away here but if you do read this just go with the story give yourself over to it don't get caught up in the realism of how these two characters get to where they are","596":"that is one hell of an ending","597":"i loved this book it was so inventive and exciting and i loved the theme of books saving children's lives i also thought the chapters that she interwove based on the style of other books was a really amazing touch so many details that made the book one i will be thinking about for a long time highly recommend and i can't wait to see what she writes next","598":"a fun read i really enjoyed the point of view of the 26 year old librarian should rate it a 3 5 star since the writing wasn't completely amazing but it was enjoyable good travel book about traveling across u s gays weirdo catholics and books","599":"the characters in this book had very distinct voices at least in my head fun and easy read things were wrapped up a little too nicely for my taste and the afterward took the shine off her nice ending","600":"the borrower by rebecca makkai was a welcome retreat during my short break between the end of my hectic summer class schedule and the beginning of my even crazier fall class schedule the other day while talking to a friend about the book i realized that i was not able to give the novel justice with mere words but i will give it a try anyway a story about a hapless librarian and the boy she had inadvertently kidnapped is the most succinct and encompassing description of the storyline now you may be asking yourself how do you inadvertently kidnap a child well apparently you can in a faling down the rabbit hole kind of way to truly understand you must read this novel especially if you are an aspiring children's librarian as i am anywho makkai envelopes you in the story with her informal conversational prose that is mixed with a splash of elegance and surreality the numerous references to beloved children's literature is also a delight when the story begins you are immediately hooked into lucy the librarian's seemingly innocuous and blase life in small town of hannibal mo soon you are swept away in her accidental kidnapping of a book loving 10 year old boy a runaway from his book hating stifling parents what begins as a journey of escape and rescue for this little boy turns into lucy's own self discovery and reawakening to the realities of her own life and identity a must read for sure","601":"this story is hilarious it seems like something that would never really happen to anyone but the more you read the more it feels real to you","602":"this is such a great book with older ya crossover potential a young female librarian rescues a young quirky boy whose overly zealous religious parents are pushing him to attend a church camp for sexual orientation realignment they think he's gay each chapter is rife with wonderful literary references the plot fast paste writing great humor and pathos strongly recommend","603":"as a librarian i was a bit annoyed at the beginning of this book that lucy didn't have the right qualifications to be a librarian and that she was promoting all kinds of librarian stereotypes i was pretty surprised that this book overcame that hurtle and won me over anyway first the numerous and creative plot related references to children's literature in the borrower are downright brilliant every character even the minor ones are totally quirky and the tone of the books is alternately hilarious and sweetly touching the plot seems totally ridiculous a librarian who kidnaps a child but at its heart the novel explores the meaning of family relationships being a refugee and returning home","604":"makkai is a terrific writer with short stories chosen for the best american stories collection four years in a row an astounding feat and two of her stories this year have just been nominated for pushcarts this is a lovely novel that stretched my credulity too much at times but was a thoroughly enjoyable read and it ends with a rhapsodic and resonant paean to the power of books which kristen quotes below","605":"wonderful i hate calling a book an easy read as some may find it insulting i've heard that writing an easy read is the hardest book to write the borrower was an easy read as i could not put it down and when i would i easily picked up where i left off this was truly a book i enjoyed %100 of the way through i couldn't help but root for ian and lucy ms hull on their journey but i also waited for what i thought was the inevitable defeat a great story of a friendship between a young women and boy and the journey that follows a must read","606":"i still believe that books can save you page 255","607":"3 1 2 this book had many factors which i found entertaining such as the main character being a children's librarian albet a reluctant one many quotations from childrens book and an avid 10 yr old reader named ian i'm not to sure i consider the ending plausible though but the quirky characters were a definite plus","608":"it was a little slow going and sometimes a little too preachy but just for the last few chapters alone i would read it again","609":"lucy the young librarian befriended a young 10 year old boy named ian who decided to runaway from home because of what i describe mental abuse of a child who is possibly gay his parents are involved religious cult and pressured it upon him it would have been nice to read how ian's parents reacted about him running away personally i did not fall in love with this book as it still was an ok read","610":"intriguing book for my library friends to read","611":"this would have been a perfectly fine novella that included just the intro and denouement it would have dealt with and rendered well the elements of the book that ever stood a chance of working instead though we have this book 200 pages too long it wasn't a bad idea it was just the wrong format","612":"a children's librarian with family connections to the russian mafia goes on the run herself when a frequent borrower child runs away from home and directs her on a strange cross country ramble filled with tourist stops visits to family and friends a box of contraband and past secrets good","613":"\"the covers of this book are too far apart \" -- ambrose bierce really seriously long a 150 page story in a 300 page book then the protagonist acted in an unrealistic manner the story was too far fetched right from the start the mother of the kid comes to the librarian and tells her she doesn't want her kid reading certain sorts of books yes the mother is a horror story however and maybe it's because i've been reading a lot of children's literature but i immediately thought of a dozen titles she could have recommended to the kid now i'm a bleeding heart liberal pinko tree hugging whale saving sort and this left wing fantasy of rescuing a possibly gay child from his religious fundamentalist wing nut parents should have appealed to me but it just never rang true for me","614":" this book really leaned toward four stars the storyline was compelling i enjoyed the wry humor often in the form of retold beloved childhood stories i thought the author did a great job of imagining an energetic curious creative ten year old and i even liked the unexpected twists and turns with the protagonist's father but the thing that holds the book solidly to three stars is the complete lack of anything happening once lucy and ian began their grand adventure the whole reason that lucy agrees to be kidnapped is because she can't stand what's happening to ian and yet during the entire ten days that they are together she barely broaches the subject and certainly doesn't spend any time trying to get him to understand that it's okay to be himself that who he is is awesome etc it was like the author had a really great description for the book jacket but was then lost when it came time to follow through with the rest of the story don't get me wrong i did enjoy it really it's more 3 5 stars than a mere 3 but i spent a long time waiting for the car trip to actually go somewhere and i was sad that it really never did","615":"liked the premise","616":"you know i liked the book but i could never quite get lucy's motivation i just didn't believe that she wouldn't do something at the beginning i had to keep reminding myself to just go with it","617":"this was must read for me after spending 25 years a a public librarian truly did enjoy it and it was a page turner to see how it all turns out somehow i know that ian will be alright but am not so sure about lucy ian will be one of those characters who stays with me for a long time","618":"phenomenal i wish it could have 10 stars any lover of books that helped escape or form your childhood will appreciate the love of books and stories used to shape ian's journey loved all characters and thier complexities","619":"this book will have its detractors and i imagine that most of them will have missed the sort of tongue in cheek this didn't really happen aspect of the book once the narrator tells you that you're supposed to call the town hannibal missouri but that it's not really hannibal missouri and then confesses twenty pages in that she's already lied to you i think all protestations of a story being unrealistic are null and void lucy is an unreliable narrator my favorite kind and she takes you along on a very uncomfortable ride lucy sort of kidnaps a child or is kidnapped by him depending on how you look at it makkai could have made this a much more clear cut case and we'd have been more naturally sympathetic to the narrator but i think it's to her credit that she didn't this book is weirdly post modern and not just in its borrowing of other texts but in the way it yanks you around and makes you question what's even going on to begin with overall one of the best debuts i've read in a really long time and i never say this but i mean it in the best possilbe way forgive me literary people it would make a hell of a movie","620":"this wasn't a bad book but i just couldn't get past a few of the details of the plot and had some trouble getting into the story i just couldn't believe it but i loved the references to classic children's lit and the ending was pretty great","621":"this was not my favorite book however i did think it was fodder for thought on several pertinent questions i felt that it made an effort to delve into the transitions from life at home with the parents to life on your own","622":"ok so i admit i loved this book before i even read the first page i've read several short stories by rebecca makkai in the last few years in various publications and on her website and truth be told i can't remember how i first discovered her just that i fell instantly for her story lines her prose her startling truths about life always my favorite and so it was that i had forgotten all about her forthcoming first novel and happened across it one day in the library when i needed nothing to read just to use the facilities and burn a few minutes before a job interview thank you rebecca the borrower is about a 26 year old children's librarian with a deep russian streak of self righteousness and fight which she inherited from her father and his illegal illicit ways she's also like so many of us at that age dissatisfied with her life gently flailing if you will and unsure what to do next naturally she follows the instructions of ten year old ian drake on a fictional grandmother goose chase from small town hannibal missouri to the upper reaches of vermont along the canadian border poor ian has runaway from home from his oppressive narrowly religious parents who are sending him to gay rehab classes all of this lucy knows about and feels she must rescue him makkai writes humor into this wonderfully fictional tale i could never see it going down like this in real life but love the what if and why not of such a premise and captures the silliness and energy of a ten year old boy with just enough cute to make you fall for him of course there is the matter of lucy's father and his heroic tales a very literary horn reference to a facial imperfection and an inner battle for good over evil truth over lies direction over running away i love this book for it's beautifully concise sentences which i know makkai spent hours combing through despite the ease with which they read giving me the feeling that she knew exactly what she was doing when she wrote the first sentence and it's humor it's truths it's fun bravo","623":"ah youth i vaguely remember what it was like when i was 26 and knew everything idealistic raging against whatever perceived injustice the world served up that day clearly author rebecca makkai is in touch with her inner 26yo it is only our heroine's age that forgives somewhat many of the harebrained decisions she makes over the course of this novel while several of the peripheral characters read more like caricatures theater neighbors russian mafioso the young man central to the story was thoroughly likable partially because he is yet even more naive than his rescuer in that he is even more young and thus oblivious to the larger sociopolitical sentiments at play he's just unabashedly himself which ultimately is what our heroine wants for him here's to hoping he can hang on to that bonus points for the author's insertion of many many quality j and ya references","624":"this is a great read the author captures the essence of the 11 year old character his quirkiness and complexity without making it feel forced i kept trying to guess how the plot was going to be resolved and i was pleasantly surprised with the way the book ended it's a funny book with solid heart to it i hope to see more from this writer soon","625":"author has a very smart and unique voice ten year old ian is an adorable and totally lovable character a good story and i found the russian cultural references interesting","626":"a liberal librarian goes on a road trip kidnap insanity with a 10 yr old boy whose parents are uber conservative","627":"i loved this book i think lucy's values are pretty similar to mine and thus i related to her well it was fun to see the world through the eyes of a children's librarian and also to have so many children's books i'm familiar with referenced i really enjoyed how ian the fifth grade boy was portrayed as being smart quirky and often naive as so many elementary kids are the reason i didn't give this five stars is because there were some issues with believability as the adventure got wackier and wackier still this was a gripping read i whole heartedly recommend especially to people who work with intermediate aged children","628":"i really liked this story moving and interesting","629":"i am suspicious of librarian narrators especially children's librarian narrators so when i picked up this book i held it at arms length as i tried to ascertain how much it would disappoint me that was two days ago now fast forward to this afternoon as i skipped going to the farmers' market in order to lie on the couch and inhale the book's final two thirds some may question the plausibility of librarian lucy and her 10 year old patron ian kidnapping each other and setting off on a huck and jim adventure but that was part of the charm for me because even as the book wrestles with serious issues and is most certainly not a lighthearted romp it still has the quirks of a roald dahl story where a road trip via a peach sounds just about right lucy's voice is earnest but also sarcastic and self deprecating the kidlit authors and titles scattered throughout jive with my tastes and the direct homages to specific books are also clever without distracting from the story ian is every librarian's dream patron he took off the empty backpack that i realized just now he'd been wearing the whole time and unzipped it 'fill 'er up ' he is also a real kid who knows how to manipulate struggles with simple math doesn't quite understand the adult world sings for longer than anyone wants to hear him and delights in putting change in a parking meter he is one of those characters that will stick inside me for a long time and i've already made my own epilogue for his story that i hope will come true","630":"why did it take me so long to read this book as a children's librarian i was charmed by the children's book references and of course fell in love with the sweet bookworm ian i believe that each children's librarian i know has their very own ian i know several what a lovely and thought provoking story","631":"in this funny and ultimately moving debut novel children's librarian lucy hull runs away with 10 year old ian drake whose love of reading is thwarted by his fundamentalist parents almost everybody pegs ian as destined to be gay and his parents send him to a re education program run by ex gay pastor bob little ian doesn't know from gay and he doesn't question his family's fundamentalist beliefs but he defies his parents in reading dangerous books he is an enormously appealing character and one who rings true to anyone who has worked in a library a quirky picaresque adventure told by an admittedly unreliable narrator lampooning certain elements of the christian religion and touching on questions of emigration and ethnic identity probably not destined for the bestseller list i loved it for its droll humor its heart its reverance for books and its depiction of libraries and librarians which the author mostly gets right","632":"even though it had its why doesn't she just take the kid home moments they ultimately benefited the outrageous kidnapping plot i really enjoyed makkai's dark humor and clever wrap up of the story an especially good read for children's librarians loads of amusing juvenile fiction picture books references","633":"started this at 10 30pm and read straight through to 2 30am which isn't good since i had to be at work in the morning i loved this book even though it isn't perfect the narrator is a young paraprofessional librarian and she tells a road story about going on the lam with a 10yo library patron who is fleeing persecution funny funny book which reveres children's lit and introduces many delightful characters","634":"mostly on audio but was missing a few sections so had to finish in print while i had a lot of issues with the narrator of this book i loved the overall feel of it and the creative homages to classic literature","635":" lucy is the childrens librarian in a small town ian is an 11 year old boy who is there constantly and lucy provides him with suggestions for books to read ian's mother is an overprotective religious fanatic who won't allow ian to read anything that might be considered evil anything with wizards is considered dangerous lucy helps ian sneak books out so he can read them anyway one morning lucy arrives early and finds ian has slept in the library and is intent on running away lucy ends up being an unwitting kidnapper and they begin a cross country driving adventure with no destination lucy and her friends all believe ian is gay and ian's parents are sending him to some christian school to help him not be gay there were parts that i enjoyed the library stuff and lucy's reminiscing about books i was uncomfortable with the whole gay plot and lucy just driving an 11 year old across county for days was too much of a stretch some language probably 2 1 2 stars","636":"i liked it until the final few chapters the epilogue hurt to read","637":" this book leaves me very conflicted if you are a reader and have an appreciation for what good ya fiction can mean to a developing young person you will love the literary references throughout the story if you are a person who believes that acceptance of those who are different is a core value you'll love how lucy stands up for and in her own way nurtures ian however i'm still stuck with the implausibility of the plot a seemingly mentally stable responsible 26 year old kidnaps or aids in the running away of a 10 year old driving him first to chicago then to pittsburgh then to vermont before finally putting him on a bus back to hannibal missouri with no repercussions and a neat tidy ending willing suspension of disbelief is definitely required i wanted to love this book as i love each character and the entire moral of the story but it was all too far fetched that said i'll definitely read the next book by this author","638":"as a retired children's librarian i loved all the familiar titles of books that are dear to me they brought back memories of the pleasure of being able to give just exactly the right book to the right child and saying i think you will love this but even though her taste in books was great and her heart was definitely in the right place i thought this librarian was too irresponsible and the book not too well plotted","639":"for the librarians out there on of the reasons i really liked this book was that i had no idea how it was going to end that doesn't happen very often for me","640":"wanted to like this book more than i did a kid who loves books a librarian a homosexual converting christian bad guy what's not to like but for some reason the story didn't work for me i think it was the russian lineage side story that lost me and seemed overly ambitious and not particularly helpful in telling the story i thought miss hull however was convincing in her manic mental dialogue just what you would expect someone in her position to be experiencing","641":"as the author's first book i found this an interesting read a children's librarian develops an attachment with a young boy whose mother doesn't want him reading any titles that are not of a moral religious nature the librarian ends up on a road trip with the boy when he runs away from home and her life changes because of it this was a fitting read for banned books week","642":"a flight of this author's imagination she is dead on with some of her knowledge of library culture pretty perceptive with her portrayal of a 10 year old exceptional child i'm still trying to figure out the significance of her allergy to her desk chair librarians myself included are a target audience of this thought provoking story","643":"a quirky novel about a children's librarian who kidnaps a young boy and takes him on a bizarre road trip her motives are unclear she ostensibly wants to save him from his nutty christian fundamentalist parents who deny him freedom to read what he likes and have also forced him to begin attending a program that allegedly prevents gay youth from becoming gay adults as the journey begins we somewhat understand lucy's motives in running away with ian but as the journey progresses it becomes more murky as to why she is continuing to run obviously she has a fondness for ian but one gets the impression that is she who is doing the running away and that ian is just an excuse i loved how the author incorporated children's books into the narrative including the title which borrows from a famous children's book that was fun ian's parents were rather stereotypically horrific christian fundies it might have been more interesting if they were more complicated and less demonized","644":"not nearly as good as the hype made it out to be it was readable but i'm not sure i would recommend it plus it was a little insulting to this ex librarian the author could not stop with the typical stereotypes about boring sheltered librarians","645":"this was a fun story and i definitely related to it because i'm also a 26 year old librarian although i've never stolen a child very nice story although the ending seemed a little blah to me","646":"i really enjoyed this it's a book for people who love to read about books libraries and bookstores with a bit of liberal thought sprinkled amongst great vacation novel","647":"while i loved the concept i didn't like the delivery as much as i wanted to the character's lack of taking control of her circumstances was exhausting and the weaving of generational stories didn't quite work for me despite this the concept kept me going and i really liked the ending","648":"i was enticed by this book based on two short stories by makkai that i stumbled upon in tin house and best american short stories what i learned is that makkai is best suited to short fiction and or she gave in to marketing pressure by adding cutesy touches and unnecessary embellishment to a storyline that perhaps on its own would have fallen flat the relationships between the main character and her parents lover friend and her victim remain locked in shallow archetypal parameters because this is a character driven story that cannot rely on its weak a to b plot or barely investigated and topical ideas this lack of strong human bonds results in a failure overall","649":"lost main character gets more clueless as she tries to save a young boy whose religious parents are trying to deprogram from being gay preachy at times about being born gay and about banning books with no characters to like or to root for","650":"this one started out really well but i felt like the ending was a bit disappointing a children's librarian in a small town in mississippi is upset when one of her favorite young patrons whose parents are evangelical christians begin taking him to a church that specializes in curing homosexuals on the spur of the moment one sunday after she finds that ian has run away from home and is sleeping in the library she puts him in her car and they start to drive over the course of a week they get further and further away from mississippi and lucy gets more and more confused about what to do next i loved the many references to children's books sprinkled throughout the story and the spontaneous kidnapping but things really slowed down too much at the end i want to know what happens to ian down the road so i hope that someday there's a sequel","651":"this quirky novel features lucy a young librarian with an outlandish russian father who works in a small missouri town and a flamboyant ten year old library patron from an evangelical family named ian in what could be construed as a kidnapping of ian by lucy or a hijacking of lucy by ian the two end up on a road trip that leads them to chicago philadelphia and northern vermont throughout their journey they encounter other strange characters and lucy ends up learning quite a bit about herself while attempting to help ian do the same","652":"what could have been a sweet fun novel was somewhat dreary happily it was saved by the ending going forward it was difficult to believe there could be a believable ending that did not break your heart well break your heart if you liked the characters more i write this cause maybe i could have let myself like them more if i knew i would be pleased with their fate","653":"i kept thinking that this book couldn't hold up that it was too good and something about the story would have to fall apart that it would be one of those books that was so promising but the author couldn't figure out how to end it nope it remained brilliant until the end did not disappoint i predict we'll be hearing a lot about rebecca makkai and this her debut novel","654":"enjoyed this tale of a librarian and a boy who loves books a little far fetched but a good read","655":"i'd honestly say it's more like 3 1 2 stars i'm still trying to decide how i feel about the ending maybe when i sort that out i'll write my review","656":"i just didn't like this book i appreciated makkai's writing hence 2 stars instead of 1 and i got the humorous improbability of the situation however i just found the the circumstances of a 26 year old librarian going on a road trip with a 10 year old boy without his parents' knowledge unsettling i was also put off by the preachiness i'm fine with a novelist's expressing a particular point of view but i prefer a little subtlety","657":"a fun story about thinking you are saving someone and the person you are saving saves you interesting characters and believable scenarios i really enjoyed the time i spent reading the barrower and enjoyed the heroine's self depreciating russian humour","658":"it was a good book though i never felt for the protagonist while she loved books as much as i do i never connected with her not felt any sympathy i don't know why","659":"good first book from this writer","660":"strong characters and writing and clever homages to children's books but the pacing slows halfway through the protagonist's motivation lacks believability she is too easily manipulated by a ten year old child and she becomes rather unlikable due to this and her narrow and self centered point of view","661":"3 5 stars children's librarian lucy just can't figure out her young patron ian drake the ten year old seems to long for attention and is eager to read more books than most children his age are interested in yet lucy senses something is just not right his parents are righteous christians who won't allow ian to read certain authors or books the ingenious boy manages to slip a few forbidden books into his backpack or down the front of his pants anyway after lucy discovers that ian has hidden overnight in the library the two embark on a journey in her car lucy justifies the trip as keeping ian safe from who know what is going on at home she also seems to be filling a void in her life the adventure is fun but far fetched who would take a child she barely knows kidnap him in such a manner i did enjoy the book though","662":"i thought i would enjoy it more than i did the message is great be yourself help others to see that they can be themselves but you can't force it i suppose i just wanted more resolution in the end","663":"a strange little ride maybe a kind of pg lolita","664":"this book started out fantastic but as it went on i found it harder to stay interested i did however love the way the author played with words and kept inserting references to and parodies of classic children's lit choose your own adventure heck yeah fantastic prose but the storyline and characters just didn't develop enough for my taste","665":"i thoroughly enjoyed this book it's very well written there are occasionally very short sections written in the style of a beloved children's book e g goodnight moon that are brilliantly done this was obviously written by someone who loves books and that comes through very clearly the story serves as a good reminder about the power of books to save people or at least give them hope the characters are fully developed and feel very real i can definitely identify with how the protagonist feels highly recommended","666":"the storyline had great potential but i was left feeling unfinished at the end i'm not the type who needs everything tied up in a nice neat bow at the end but i felt as though the author could have resolved the conclusion with a little less ambiguity i felt a little ripped off after investing so much time in the characters disappointing","667":"rebecca makkai can certainly turn a phrase much of the book contains an inner dialogue our librarian protagonist is having with herself and many of her lines made me laugh out loud i would think i love this author i must read everything she has ever written however her story does seem to get bogged down in the middle i'll definitely give her another shot though love her style","668":"this book was wonderful for people who love to read and certainly for anyone who works in a library just reading it remind me of a journey through oz it is a classic in the making","669":"i really loved this book about a children's librarian who gets kidnapped by a precocious ten year old boy who loves to read there are so many great messages in this book and the author is a creative writer if you've ever read to a young child you'll recognize many of the children's books that she patterns some of the dialogue after forget that the plot is farfetched or that the subplots are distracting except the one about her family this is a loveletter to people who love to read and believe in the power of books to save or change your life and to public libraries","670":"i loved the authors use of language and her wonderful literary references the story itself was a bit too far fetched and i thought the ending didn't do the story justice","671":"as a children's librarian that works in a library that sounds surprisingly similar although mine is definitely smaller to lucy hull's library i may be partial to this book but i have to say i couldn't put it down i adored it i read another review that said it was unrealistic and it didn't matter at first i thought that was a useless review but upon finishing the novel i realized it was entirely perfect and you won't quite understand until you finish it yourself what matters it that it is well written that it incorporates favorite children's tales and that you love the characters read it read it if you've ever read a children's story just read it","672":"i know has good buzz but not a fan it didn't ring true for me","673":"this story is about a children's librarian lucy who finds her favorite 10 year old patron ian hiding out in the library having run away from his parents ian tells her he wants to go to his grandparents' house which is in another city long story short she ends up driving him from missouri to vermont and back again with many adventures along the way the premise of the story is interesting and the writing is good however a few of the characters swear and there is a scattering of r rated language which was not necessary to the story not enough to be a complete distraction but disappointing nonetheless","674":"library journal named this novel as a top pick that plus the fact that it featured a librarian and a reading obsessed boy as the protagonists made me pick it up i enjoyed reading about the duo's adventures does the librarian kidnap the boy or just help him escape his miserable home but the ending was a disappointment i know it was realistic but after spending so much time with the protagonists i was hoping for something a little more positive for both of them","675":"beyond far fetched beautiful writing","676":"the chapter titles are clever there's a lot of mention of classic reads like the borrower the wonderful wizard of oz and johnny tremain the main character is 26 years old and working in a public library she meets a ten year old boy who loves to read and she worries about his home life situation she also learns that she doesn't know as much about her father as she thought she did and that a journey could feel like such freedom","677":"i just really loved this book it will be my new favorite to recommend i thought the author did a great job of getting a ten year old boys ways so right i loved the little references to old childrens classic books with a twist very enjoyable will look forward to her next book","678":"i would recommend this to all librarians and mildly subversive people the messiness of life and the dream of change what if you were brave enough to do x or stupid enough to ignore the consequences brilliant characters and a believable ten year old rather than a stock character like 'sweet' or 'smart' or 'bully' provides many searching questions and very few answers moving","679":"i sensed from the first few chapters that the author was trying too hard at something but i wasn't sure what until later on she is trying really hard to make a moral point but it falls flat and the protagonist ends up losing my respect try as she might she cannot justify kidnapping a child even if her motives are to save him from his evil parents it also begs the question of why she assumes her morality overrides the law and the right of parents to decide how they will raise their children","680":"a delightful edgy story about a renegade librarian what's not to love the other protagonist a precocious 10 year old boy is clever and sassy without being bratty or inauthentic and the central theme of how to rescue a child in a tricky family situation is handled deftly and subtly in philosophy despite the extreme circumstances of the plot","681":"i loved this book despite the fact that the author took some real liberties but i was okay with that could not put it down the book's jacket does a far better job than i can of describing the story","682":"clever and fun a questionable heroine i could identify with","683":"i liked the originality of the story line it was a quirky book i just couldn't get excited about the main characters and found the story dragged in parts","684":"i really liked this book definitely a book for a person who is in love with books","685":"this is a fun read about the power of books the main character lucy is the epitome of an unreliable narrator and the story is often implausible but it is a fast paced story with some interesting twists and i ultimately forgave this debut novel it's flaws and just went along for the wild ride","686":"lucy is a children's librarian in a small missouri town who just wants to connect children with books they will love one such child is ian drake he's a great lover of books but his mother doesn't approve of most of his selections so lucy helps him smuggle those books past her then one day everything changes when ian runs away to the library and the two of them embark on a journey they will never forget the book starts out wonderfully with anecdotes and book references that anyone but especially children's librarians will appreciate once they begin their journey though thought provoking and still littered with book references it becomes something almost uncomfortable to witness as the reader imagines there can be no happy ending to this story it's hard to classify this book in any particular genre as it seems to touch on several without fully committing to any in the end it's a reminder to parents teachers and librarians everywhere that what they do really does affect the children around them","687":"this story reminded me of a modern day huckelberry fin i love adventure stories the characters were great and the references to other books kept me on my toes","688":"interesting book can't stop reading it i love that she refers to lots of children books","689":"this is an easy read cute and enjoyable includes references to famous childen's books nothing all that deep here the voice of the book has a bit of a sarcastic sense of humor","690":"i went into reading this book full of anticipation as the premise was good however i found myself having to decide to read this book and making a concerted effort to finish rather than wanting to get there the ending was predictable from the beginning maybe it was all about the journey but i didn't buy into or identify with it enough","691":"funky and entertaining couldn't totally buy in but a good read all the same","692":"thanks to maggie smith for recommending this book about a librarian and a young gay boy and their journey together running away from their lives a very enjoyable read","693":"an absolute gem of a book i couldn't put it down once i picked it up the author masterfully weaves literature child wonderment and innocence and a supense filled tale of what happens next reading this book took me back to my childhood visits to the local library i even remember the check out cards that told each individual that had previously checked out a book this is a book that warms the heart","694":"this book definitely requires a certain amount of suspension of disbelief ten year old possibly gay boy takes off on a road trip with the librarian and temporarily escapes his overbearing homophobic parents who are trying to cure him through religion but in exchange for this suspension of disbelief you get a tale woven with references to literature and especially kids books that is totally rewarding the ending feels like a bit of a let down but when religious reform cure of gay people is bashed throughout the book i really can't complain","695":"this is a very well written book which will appeal to the literary minded and to book lovers everywhere a homage to a childhood of books and examples of their power pepper this story in which a librarian is abducted by a child those who say it is the other way round have missed the point the child is kidnapping the world of books in my view if you liked matilda as a child then you will probably enjoy this ian is the book mad ten year old who hides out in the library and lucy the librarian who wants to 'save' him from the homophobic christian sect his parents have become involved with the characters of ian and lucy are complex and not easily pigeon holed at times the reader is pleasantly confused as to who is the adult and who is the child during their extended road trip through most of america but this is like life and feels refreshingly honest the journey itself is somewhat aimless and for me this is the only weak point of the book that the middle seemed a little too long but then the plot soon picked up again and i was once more hooked if you are an evangelical christian then you may have to consider if it is for you as the fundamentalist parents and pastor bob who wants to rehabilitate gay teenagers back to the straight and narrow are truly gruesome however i do not feel the book is deliberately anti christian i feel that makkai made the choice she did for a reason some christians use what is written in a book to determine their behaviour and say the book is the literal truth what makkai is pointing out is that in the end it is only a book written on paper like every other book in the library and as such the child or anyone could always choose other literature as their raison d'etre at the same time makkai shows how real events become fictionalised as in the bible by including an episode from lucy's father's and grandfather's past where exactly this happens and the real events grow into something more than they were in short this is an intelligent novel one to make you think about the power of books definitely worth discussing in a reading group and spending your money on i look forward to reading makkai's next","696":"all librarians should read this book","697":"this book had moments of brilliance mixed with in with a lot of navel gazing and some plain old mediocrity i loved the parts about books and the library especially lucy's reading lists for ian as he gets older and the author clearly knows librarians well even down to the struggle of being a young librarian and trying not to look like a librarian i feel like the author was trying to make deep connections between lucy's life feeling directionless discovering her father's lies about his past and ian's situation with the gender reorientation classes and his fundamentalist parents but that part just didn't come together so lucy ends up running away with ian her 10 year old patron but's unclear whether she is the kidnapper or the kidnapee ian is a precocious child and the adults in his life suspect he might be gay there's a lot of lying to her boss her friends her boyfriend her parents herself there's also a former kgb operative and a finger relic","698":"a book about the power of reading with a runaway kid an unlikely bond and a road trip of self discovery thrown in for good measure the writing is a joy the characters eminently believable and the last page arrives too soon","699":"i found the premise a little troubling pseudo kidnapping but i can't resist a good road trip book and of course i loved all the playful references to children's literature","700":"lucy a librarian in a small missouri town finds herself librarian napped by a young boy about whom she's become increasingly concerned ian drake is the precocious son of very fundamentalist parents who are convinced that he is gay and determined to avert this horror by enrolling him in weekly rehabilitation classes held by pastor bob a preacher who was himself saved from the gay lifestyle ian seems to find his only solace in the aisles of the children's library despite the fact that his mother refuses to allow him to read most of its books because of their satanic influence when ian convinces her to run away from their town lucy unwittingly agrees setting them up for a long journey across the country where they encounter various interesting characters including lucy's father and her sometimes boyfriend and are able to stay one step ahead of the law for a while during their trip lucy endeavors to rid ian of his brainwashing and make him realize that people can't change who they are meaning that is that if he's gay he has a right to be and shouldn't let anyone try to convince him otherwise angry at his parents and pastor bob she attempts to save him from their influence believing that she's following in her revolutionary russian ancestors' footsteps but as they get farther and farther away from missouri lucy begins to realize how mistaken many of her own beliefs might be and to question everything that she's doing will she succeed in helping ian before she's hauled away to the police and does ian really need that help anyways it's hard for me to give a succinct review of this book as i am torn in how i feel about it i liked the premise of the book the idea of a librarian and little boy stealing off to explore the world and found the characters to be well developed and the plot intricate enough to keep me interested and reading until the end however i couldn't abide the blatant anti christian pro gay message that seems to run through the entire book and which certainly imparts a cynical negative propaganda like feeling to it on one hand the author criticizes christians for grouping all radicals and gays into one generic category and condemning them all while on the other hand she is doing the very same thing to the people she's criticizing yes there are horrible people like pastor bob out there who twist god's original message of love and salvation for their own means but not all christians not even the majority of christians are like that she condemns all things and all people christian not even giving them the benefit of the doubt that she herself asks for how hypocritical i also found the pro gay message of the book irritating i am a christian and would never condemn anyone for their sexual orientation or persuasion just because i don't believe that it's right just because i struggle with different issues doesn't mean that i'm any better than anyone else or have any right to condemn them for their choices lucy howeve r seems to believe that as a christian i should encourage them to pursue something that i think is wrong this is a very touchy issue and i don't want to get into the politics and ethics behind it but i just had a big problem with her essentially condemning all christian belief in right and wrong besides whether or not i agree with her stance for a book of fiction that was supposed to be entertaining i didn't exactly want the author throwing this preachy social doctrine at my head every two pages in conclusion though it started off promising i can't recommend this book the ending was unsatisfactory and the plot and characters though well written did not make up for the negative feelings that the book imparted i'm sorry that a book that sounded so good could end up so disappointing","701":"as a parent i struggled with what the parents must have been experiencing while ian was missing but as someone still searching for something i could relate to lucy i enjoyed the references to the youth books and how the author would write in prose of some of the more popular ones at time i also enjoyed the idea that books can save us","702":"a must read for librarians library staff or anyone who frequents a library the title could refer to borrowing in many senses a book a child a lifestyle but it's a great read no matter what i recommend that you borrow this book preferably from your library","703":"yes there are plausibility issues but i still really enjoyed this book i thought both lucy and ian were well drawn and i really wanted to know what happened i could barely put it down","704":"who would have thought that this precise book its about my current life as a librarian wanting desperately to save some children's lives best quote i make too much of a mess of things but books on the other hand i do still believe that books can save you","705":"loved the literary references but at the end of the book couldn't help feeling that for someone who went on a journey lucy hadn't really gone very far i just felt that the ending let the rest of the book down a little","706":"really liked this one wonderful characters touching really funny in places having a 10 year old myself i appreciated the humor the energy the perspective the indefatigableness is that a word it was a really touching book","707":"i really liked this book it's a treat for those who love libraries and classic children's books i did get a little frustrated with the main character for not really finding a way to break free of her own issues","708":"a decent read but not exactly what i expected after reading the summary as a children's librarian i appreciated the oblique references to adult and children's literature and some of lucy's comments and experiences connected with her profession i understood lucy's need to save ian from his parents but the journey itself was rather disappointing to me i could not immerse myself in the story enough for me to get past the need to shake some reason into lucy i really did like the ending most children's librarians would but it wasn't quite enough to get me past my irritation with lucy and her immature thoughtless behavior in the end i felt that her actions had little to do with helping ian and more with indulging herself and her need to rebel to escape her current life","709":"i chose the borrower for my store book group this month and am still actively thinking about how to discuss it in that context but really i want to have just read it for pure pleasure because that's what it was the narrator lucy hull a 26 year old children's librarian in hannibal mo is a real spitfire funny flawed and smart the kind of reading mentor i'd wish on my own children alas they weren't so lucky as evidenced by my own statement in sentences one and two of this review she's sensitive and thoughtful but also more than a little irreverent i'm pretty sure i'd like her company on a long drive as much as ian drake the 10 year old boy with whom she runs away from hannibal ostensibly to rescue him from his anorexic mother and the fundamentalist pastor who wish to 'cure' his apparent gayness","710":"i was never terribly impressed with this book and it stretched my bands of reality","711":"this was surprisingly bad it pains me to say it considering that i am the absolute target market for this book and i felt like the author tried really hard normally i am a total sucker for literary allusions of any type and this book had some decent ones but generally they were eye rollingly heavy handed i felt like i was being hit over the head with one message after another rather than having the story and characters and motivations unfold for me the outright comparisons to nabokov humbert and lolita really pushed me over the edge i mean if your main character is constantly asking the reader am i a reliable narrator can i be trusted what are my motivations then your story is no lolita and you ma'am are no nabokov","712":"the plot was interesting and creative there was humor as well but i just found myself speeding through to find out how the author resolved the situation i had no real connection with the plot or characters still it was enjoyable","713":"i loved this book in fact this is the book that i wish that i could have written lovely prose and great details i borrowed it from the library so appropriate but i know i will want to read it again and again and again so i will be off to find a used copy asap","714":"i'm still trying to sort out exactly how i feel about this book but i think i can safely say that it's amazing lucy is a 26 year old coasting through life her job as a children's librarian is the result of an alumni connection and her only friend is another library employee who is apparently in love with her her only goal in life is to not be like her father a russian immigrant with obvious underworld ties she's likable and relatable although i wanted to shake her many times sometimes for her lack of motivation and sometimes because of her lack of restraint the premise of the book is that ian one of the library's young patrons runs away from home and then persuades forces lucy to take him on a cross country trip of course there's more to the story than that lucy has already come under fire from ian's fundamentalist christian mother for giving the boy books that do not contain the breath of god and she's discovered that ian is enrolled in anti gay classes as lucy's poor albeit well intentioned choices snowball out of control she learns new things about her own family and friends that make her question many of her assumptions about her life you know from the beginning that everything won't turn out well if common sense doesn't dictate that the prologue gives a good clue and yet this book was impossible for me to put down i had to see it to it's final painful although not completely hopeless conclusion the story in itself is excellent and thought provoking what pushes this book over the top is all the literary references from nabokov allusions to emulations of various well loved children's books if you give a librarian a closet an untitled addition which could be called the very hungry librarian etc","715":"what a good idea writing a novel about a children's librarian gone bad news of the book's publication flew through my library community and this is what many of us chose for summer reading 2011 the borrower is funny and provocative oddly reminiscent of our childhood favorite the borrowers invisible children's librarian makes off with 10 year old patron whose plastic fork facial scars she discovers on the road have been self inflicted ending each chapter is a lyrical bow tie that makes librarians smile like 'where's papa going with that ax ' said fern i don't care what anyone says the borrower is better than mccracken's the giant' house a romance novel about a librarian who falls in love with a giant kid makkai weaves themes of childhood censorship freedom librarianship and stereotyping into a tense but funny road trip what do non librarians the borrowers think about rebecca makkai's first novel that is what i want to know the borrower","716":"i loved the premise of this book and at times the humor was great but was disappointed by the end the main character was a little bit real but more so unrealistic and whiney the humor of using children's books modified to fit differing circumstances throughout the book was the highlight for me unfortunately there wasn't enough of that going on an ok fluff read","717":"enjoyed it so much i read it in one day","718":"luv this character quick read","719":"was interesting to see what happens when a librarian chooses to act on one of my fantasies saving kids from their narrow minded parents parts of the plot were not very believable but a fun read anyway","720":"i believed that books might save him because i knew they had so far and because i knew the people books had saved they were college professors and actors and scientists and poets they got to college and sat on dorm floors drinking coffee amazed they'd finally found their soul mates they always dressed a little out of season their names were enshrined on the pink cards in the pockets of all the forgotten hardbacks in every library basement in america if the librarians were lazy enough or nostalgic enough or smart enough those names would stay there forever","721":"sometimes i think there are publishers who will publish a book simply because the main character is a librarian a silly librarian superhero in this case and assume all libraries will order a copy okay i'm kidding but this was a pretty silly plotline the librarian sort of accidentally kidnaps her 10 year old patron because he might be gay and his parents might be punishing him for this the addition of her russian family history was a bit blind siding as well where did that twist come from or rather why the author did do a great job of characterizing the young boy very ten year old boyish","722":"i can certainly see the reason for the highly varied ratings and reviews i adored this book i enjoyed the writing style and the sense of hope the author tried to portray the story was a roller coaster but i felt the overall theme was this journey of self discovery the thing that struck me the most was the idea that you can't discover who you truly are by living in the shadows of past generations or by trying to save future generations from making their own mistakes you can however work to discover the truths in your world and weaving them into your existence","723":"3 5 stars really i was immediately taken by makkai's narrator a mid twenty something who works as a children's librarian at a small midwestern library as a book geek and especially a children's book geek i adored all of the references to famous works of children's literature that peppered the book i expected great things from the premise lucy the librarian discovers that one of her favorite charges ian has run away from home and is camping in the library ian's parents have recently been sending him to evangelical christian classes designed to re educate or pre educate as the case may be kids not to be gay lucy is appalled and on the strength of these feelings sort of kidnaps ian i say sort of because he is not unwilling to go with her and goes with him on an aimless road trip to try and save him from his parents meanwhile she ends up discovering some things about her own family history and herself it was this part of the novel that didn't resonate with me so much i'm not sure if it's just that i can't relate to lucy's experience or what but while she ended up going somewhere significant psychologically i wasn't quite able to go along with her emotionally i felt detached from her experience and a little bit like it wasn't quite enough for its setup i did admire the end of the novel which not only wasn't what i expected but did not try to tie everything up in a comforting bow whatever my reservations i think this is still a worthy read for literature lovers both those who enjoy good literary fiction and those who just adore those books they read when they were young","724":"i haven't read a book in months i'm literally shaking my fist at the dissertation i am supposed to defend this month this one was fairly easy to plow through the gey sucked me in the writing did not","725":"it had a strange premise and i couldn't imagine how this story could ever end i did like the ending more than i thought i would though just not my favorite","726":"there's a lot going on in this book a quirky road saga that's launched with a sort of kidnapping running social commentary about fundamentalists with anti gay views ruminations about the power of books a young women's discovery about her family's history an ambitious batch of themes for a book even if the main character weren't a mope but alas she is so the whole enterprise ends up feeling like a swim through murky cooking oil the heroine frets about her lusterless life dithers about whether or not she's doing right by her young charge and drones on about every detail of their seemingly endless road trip and the plot has enough oddball twists that perhaps we're supposed to ignore its more preposterous premises and believe that it's just quirky except that it lacks the snap and crackle and humor that quirky needs","727":"very excited to start this one","728":"i enjoyed this road trip story ian is an interesting character and the narrator lucy is relatable and yet oh so not this is a well told story and a fun read but at the end of the day it has to be called far fetched which just may be what the doctor ordered some days read and enjoy with a book lover's light heart","729":"greatly enhanced by extensive knowledge of current children's fiction an improbably story but highly entertaining and some interesting social commentary","730":"farfetched but clever and engaging nonetheless","731":"loved this book children's librarian inadvertently kidnaps 10 year old boy library patron loved the kiddie lit connections and adventure was a very fast read although dragged a bit towards the end","732":"the borrower by rebecca makkai is a mystery realistic fiction book where the main character lucy hull finds herself kidnapper and kidnapped by a ten year old boy trying to escape his mother and her evangelical actions to change who the boy ian drake is as person lucy finds herself going on a wild trip from the town of hannibal missouri to chicago pittsburgh and then all the way up to vermont","733":"i have to give this book four stars because i identified with the narrator and the young boy so much both are avid readers like myself can there be any better place to be than at a library if you answer no of course not then you'll love this book and it is laugh out loud funny at times i found the portrayal of the young boy believable and priceless highly recommended","734":"i enjoyed this book interesting story and great characters i loved all the references to children's books it was a book that reminded me why i love to read so much","735":"the audio version of this book was more entertaining than i had anticipated some sections especially the beginning drag a bit but overall a fun listening experience","736":"the things the boy did and some of his observations made me laugh however the situation is a stretch and the main character has so little self awareness i wanted to shake her","737":"such a great concept that was executed very poorly","738":"i loved this book could almost be classified as ya but it just sails along treating a difficult subject young gay boy great plane or beach read","739":"this book was a trip i experienced it as a bizarre account of ian an intelligent book loving manipulative 10 year old boy ian is the son of two fundamentalist parents concerned that their son might be gay ian hooks up with a book loving quixotic librarian who kidnaps him for several days they are on the run for hundreds of miles until little mr sunshine is returned home i thought the plot of the book had potential the writing was average i struggled with whether to read this book as a slapstick comedy of errors and laugh or toss it aside as story gone south","740":"as a youth serving librarian myself the first part of this story following lucy's life as a children's librarian ring alternately uncomfortably true and annoyingly inaccurately stereotypical however it was refreshing to see someone document the often overlooked relationship between librarians and the youth for whom they're often the most reliable and caring adult whether working in an urban setting or a small town like lucy all of us have had an ian drake the 10year old protagonist in this tale who desperately needs to be saved whether their being abused neglected or in ian's case evangelically brainwashed out of their burgeoning sexual orientation we're often powerless to do more than be a listening ear a recommendation of resiliency building books and programs and a connector to agencies with more teeth thankfully ian takes matters into his own hands when he runs away from home and into the library where events transpire to lead ian and lucy to kidnap each other and embark on a road trip across the country along the way there are humorous moments with lucy's russian father and his suspect business partners family friends with ferrets and the observations of a very creative 10year old boy unfortunately there's also a lot of whining lucy's not particularly likeable sure this is a bit of a post college bildungsroman but that's a bit annoying in it's self the self indulgent ramblings of a trust fund baby who can afford to feel self congratulatory about not taking daddy's money she dates a man she doesn't particularly like from the moment she meets him and mocks him behind his back her response when she learns that her best friend's wheel chair is due to his actions as a war hero is to whine that he should have told her seriously get over yourself the ending is rather pathetic too with lucy playing the role of tom sawyer to ian's huck or jim for that matter and then whining about her fate the little picture book inspired inserts are a fun touch and librarians will no doubt keep checking it out and recommending it since it contains one of their own but overall i felt like a went for a long ride and ended up nowhere","741":"i checked this one out based on the premise a children's librarian trying to save a gay child by taking him on a road trip this was an enjoyable read for me although i'm left with an overall vaguely unsatisfied feeling as though the sum of all the funny bittersweet thought provoking and criminal underworld caper bits didn't add up to a whole great book it made me chuckle at many points empathize with many of the characters and muse over the moral dilemmas lucy and ian are quite a team but my favorite parts were with lucy's father and his cohorts","742":"this was my first e book checked out from the library and i read it in 13 days because i couldn't check it out again lost kids' books i haven't yet found mean my account is frozen and i refused to even contemplate buying it for my kindle i never read anything quickly but this time i did this was passable fiction a hybrid caper road story the 10 year protagonist has an authentic voice as does the female librarian protagonist's father but the librarian miss hull i never felt like i knew her or what motivated her she was busy figuring it out for herself but i didn't buy it a fun part of the story is that since miss hull is a children's librarian various parts of the narrative are written in the style of well known children's books the very hungry caterpillar and goodnight moon are two examples and since i'm very well acquainted with kid book titles it was silly good to be in the know still hoping my brain adjusts to reading e books so frustrating to want to go back to a certain point in the book the 'abduction scene ' in one case and have no idea where to find it with a real book i'd have a physical imprint of how much of the book i'd read when i hit that point kindle offers you a chance to mark passages but most of the time it's not until you're past a particular episode sometimes much past that you recognize its importance and want to go back to see how it all played out initially bummer decent book it bites off a social problem agenda writing as makkai is about a boy whose parents are trying to have his incipient gayness reworked by a christian ministry but the book felt too amateurish to deal with this topic well childrens' librarians will probably get a kick out of reading it","743":"rather bizarre story of a non kidnapping of a possibly gay kid by a not really librarian no violence no abuse which was good and all ended well ish but it was rather like a road trip idea that got out of control but didn't actually go anywhere the writing itself was very good not at all stilted or self concious or 'cutsey' i liked that","744":"loved loved loved this book very full and interesting well written quirky characters","745":"a book for anyone not fundamentalist who loves to read i loved this story","746":"in parts i enjoyed it little snippets like the state of the union costume party the literary references or the details of how to do x like a 10 year old boy some felt heavy handed the recurring parent child thing and some seemed ridiculous the whole road trip really mo to vt with zero suspicion how is that even possible i found lucy to be somewhat annoying but that may be because i was equally annoying at 26 as a whole it was just eh","747":"i'm not sure exactly what to say about this book it was off beat and quirky definitely an original plot and a unique way of telling the story as a lover of all things book i really enjoyed the many book references that were sprinkled throughout the story i'm still on the fence about how i feel about the main character lucy through most of the book i was thinking to myself what is wrong with her she is an adult i was a little disappointed with the lack of development in the other characters but in restropect that was probably done on purpose in order to keep the story focused on lucy and ian overall i liked the book but i definitely don't see it being mainstream popular","748":"i love the feeling when you get to the end of a book and you just feel this glowing satisfaction maybe there were a few stumbles along the way plot points that could have been cleaned up and addressed an ending that came together a little too cleanly but i don't care i liked it i liked it because it perfectly encapsulates the feeling of reading to escape and the fictions we tell ourselves so we can go through the business of living our lives the surreal feeling of unreality throughout the running away to nowhere the realization we can only ever save ourselves these are the things this book captures immortalized in print for just a fleeting moment a soul mate waiting to be discovered on a dorm room floor","749":"an interesting concept and filled with respect for children's literature but some of the characters including the lead did not ring true to me as a children's librarian albeit in a school i could empathize with the desire to protect and save a young boy who was so absorbed by reading and so clearly troubled at home but i could not really imagine the steps that followed","750":"lucy is a children's librarian in a fictional hannibal mo where she meets and becomes involved with a 10 year library patron ian this book is disturbing in a number of ways as lucy uses her father's russian bolshivist past to justify her own actions in many ways she is completely spineless and useless the question becomes is ian manipulating her more than she is working on him there are questions raised and never completely answered about library privacy the patriot act intervention for the safety of a child and religious extremists the last chapter of the book really has a stalker ish feeling to it in some ways it reminded me of room by donahue oh and chapter 8 was pretty funny and true to this librarian's past","751":"a sort of listless librarian and her friendship with a 10 yr old boy there are references to many children's books which i had fun recognizing and remembering we even took a recommendation and checked a book out i also share a trait with the bookworm that reads the last page of the book before even starting it when i see the last page it's like my eyes suck up all the words","752":"loved this book easy to read and enjoyable","753":"as a librarian i find it nearly impossible to pass up on a book that is about books and the love of reading and to find on that actually features a librarian in the lead role well that is the perfect read for me the borrower rebecca makkai's debut novel sounds a bit outrageous but it is actually a very heartfelt delightful novel lucy hull is a young children's librarian working in a small library in missouri although she did not intend to become a librarian she enjoys her work and has formed a special bond with one of her young patrons ten year old ian drake ian is a voracious reader and a little flamboyant unfortunately ian's parents are extremely religious and begin censoring ian's reading material excluding most of the children's room canon ian's ostentatious nature also has his parents concerned about his sexuality to the extent that they enroll him in special classes to ensure his masculinity when lucy stumbles on ian \"camping out\" in the library after running away from his parents she leaves town with him and the two find themselves on the open road wondering who exactly kidnapped whom along the way both ian and lucy discover things about themselves but it is really lucy's journey to understand herself her family and her motivations that captivate the reader at times tremendously funny and always heartwarming and thought provoking the borrower is full of literary references and will delight readers and book lovers alike i can't wait to see what makkai does next","754":"this book was tough for me to rate there were many things i loved about it and many things i did not i enjoyed all of the references to children's literature the characters were engaging and compelling and the story had some nice plot twists i also had some issues absorbing parts of the book there were some moral commentaries i would like to have avoided while not explicit they did exist throughout overall engaging and entertaining this won't be a read for e everyone but it was worth the time","755":"i first learned about this book through the giveaways on goodreads and unfortunately wasn't chosen so i requested it from the public library the story is an interesting one and for the most part i liked the way the author wrote my main criticism is that she imitated certain children's books as a literary device that i think ultimately interrupted the flow of the story","756":"i loved this so refreshing","757":"ian drake 10 years old takes control of his own life escapes from the anti gay religious program his parents have placed him in and kidnaps his favorite children's librarian whimsical not quite believable on a plot level and yet internally consistent with itself this book made me laugh","758":"fun to read if you work in a library as you'll be familiar with many of the books and situations described","759":"the borrower was a beautiful and touching story i was shocked by how much it got to me especially considering it was a book i picked up on a whim because i liked the cover the characters are all strong the dialogue is perfect and the pacing moves along in a way that makes the minutes because this was an audiobook fly by i espeically loved the way each chapter ended with a variation on a traditional children's story ex goodnight moon choose your own adventure dr seuss etc notes on the audio a great audiobook production narration was smooth yet exciting and kept you engage highly recommended","760":"i loved this book so unlike any other i have read i felt like i was on the trip with ian and lucy and it will really make you think","761":"the borrower has a very interesting premise that i found really attractive while reading the plot after reading the book i didn't find it that fascinating anymore the story wasn't actually boring but it seemed quite plain for me it was monotonous because i couldn't find any climax or dynamic in the story the story mostly told about the adventure of lucy and ian running from their lives not such an exciting adventure though i was just wondering about their situation the whole time there were actually many things they could do but they didn't do instead there are too much references of russian idealism that i didn't really understand usually i like a book that tells good details about the things that the characters feel or the situation that is happening this book do tell many details but they are not so important to be told some details are even repeated again and again and again that was a bit bothering for me overall i liked the idea of the story and i liked the ending everything is made clear by the end no mysteries left i also liked the fact that this book gives many references to other books since it is a story about a librarian and a boy who loves reading one thing that i learned from the borrower reading can save everyone's life","762":"a strange book wonderful for a librarian to read but there was always a barrier between me and the allegedly deep feelings of the protagonist","763":"i grabbed this book from the library shelf accidentally i meant to get the beginners by rebecca wolff but when i read the inside jacket i knew i wouldn't be disappointed the borrower takes the reader through some classic children's literature a walk down memory lane while simultaneously endearing us to ian a precocious somewhat irritating young boy and a confused librarian undergoing a quarter life crisis parts of this were rather unrealistic but it read more like fantasy than reality because of the charms of the librarian to introduce ian to the ways of world i cried at the end and found myself wishing and hoping that there will be a sequel","764":"i really really enjoyed this book i was drawn in by the cover but put it back to get something else about 15mins later i went back and got it because i just couldn't get it out of my mind a fairly easy read about an interesting topic interesting characters and it all gets wrapped up well imo would recommend to people","765":"a 26 year old librarian named lucy hull works at a library in small town she hides books in a closet she deems not good enough for anyone to read something i would probably do one of her favorite patrons a 10 year old boy named ian frequents the library flamboyant people in the book point out that he is gay and witty - he loves to read but soon his uber religious mother approaches lucy with a list of books he is not to read books dealing with magic the occult anything roald dahl wrote etc lucy finds out that ian's parents are not only limiting his reading material but also trying to reprogram him essentially into a straight boy by taking him to these icky classes every weekend lead by an infamously gay turned straight but really i am still gay pastor named bob lucy finds ian hiding in the library one morning and they take off on an unplanned road trip the book is about that road trip and her making amends with her inability to change someone's life path or beliefs i would recommend this to anyone wanting to read a witty sometimes dark book filled with literary references oh and i would recommend it to anyone who gets really pissed off about uber christians telling gay people it's a choice","766":"anyone who loves children's books and any children's librarian should read this one the narrator's voice was honest self aware and very funny it's an original idea too and i loved the way she incorporated beloved children's book references into many of the chapters ian while an exceptional 10 year old also came across as a real one the author hit a nice balance between the unbelievably strange lucy's dad's mob connections the whole idea of an inadvertent kidnapping and the realistic flawed characters good intentions going awry awkward relationships i did have a problem with lucy and friends labeling ian as much as his parents and pastor bob did even if their intentions were more supportive the fact of the matter was ian had never said anything one way or another about being gay and his character was only 10 after all i think this hypocrisy was probably intentional on the part of the author which puts another check in the realistic column this was a great first novel and i'll be keeping my eye out for more from rebecca makkai","767":"great story wish there were more by her","768":"i never got past the basic premise if this book just never found it believable","769":"this book was a good read a real escape ooh pun intended and a book i thought about during the day when i wasn't reading that's what i want in a book","770":"different read keeps you wondering enjoyed it although a little dark","771":"this was so promising in the beginning but as soon as the roadtrip begins the book seems to fall apart partly because ian stays a shell instead of developing into an actual character partially because the rest of the book focuses on lucy's neurotic introspection at a pitch and intensely unbearable level still i do have to give rebecca makkai credit for her excellent taste in children's and ya literature that alone may make this book worth buying if you've ever wondered what other books your kids should read after they've finished harry potter hunger games you'll find a list of books scattered throughout the borrower that will be inspiring","772":"awesome read any one who loves reading cannot help but love this book","773":"gave up ok book but didn't feel compelled to finish so didn't found out from mum the ending","774":"enjoyable but also felt too long at times as if about 50 pages here and there could've been excised occasionally i felt as if i was being instructed on the right way to think about people although i did find myself agreeing most of the time with that way unfortunately though i did grow a bit tired of what i perceived as preachiness the most commendable facet of this book is the character of ian a 10 year old captured in all his endearing quirkiness reading this reminded me of all the students who have passed briefly through my life i know them for 10 months and they're gone like the narrator lucy i'm left to only wonder what becomes of them and attempt to guess how the many blanks of their future lives will be filled i like how makkai didn't attempt to tie up ian's future in a neat package instead lucy and readers can only hold hope for him and let him go","775":"best book of 2012 so far more later","776":"i am probably halfway done with this book it's from the library i can't renew it so hopefully i can finish it before it's due i finished it it was a good book i'll have to read it again to pick up on all of the references to childrens books","777":"i have never read anything like the borrower the main character lucy tells her story from first person perspective and warns the reader that this is not a happy book she isn't cynical per se but a realist her story is tumultuous and she deals with the flip flopping emotions she encounters while on her road trip with ian ian is a whirlwind of a kid and while he is a nice foil to lucy's character he can be annoying at times makkai's writing is what i love the most she blends the styles of various famous children's books and makes them relevant to her own story it is done respectfully and masterfully like she'd written the originals i would recommend this book to anyone who has ever loved a librarian anyone who ever wanted to save a child or anyone who ever loved a road story edit i cried at the end yeah i did","778":"i loved the beginning of the book then it got a little slow still would recommend","779":"a librarian and a boy on the run when i read the reviews on this book they all seemed to imply a lighthearted caper which confused me as it also seemed to be about a librarian who kidnaps a child now having finished it i didn't find the book to be very light hearted and it's not about a kidnapping you can quibble about whether or not the story is realistic but the deeper truth is one that anyone who works with children i teach second grade can identify with there are children that you wish that you could take home with you there are children whose families do not seem to understand what a treasure they have there are children who you wish had better lifes or just different lifes there are children that you think that you should save but you can't so you try to give them the skills to save themselves you try to get them to see what a great resource they have within themselves you try to lead them to books as a way to not only escape but also to see that there is so much beyond what they know or can see you hope that you helped but you will probably never know i loved this book and i know that i'll think about it for a long time to come","780":"this was just ok in my opinion","781":"i really thought i'd enjoy this book but i didn't the plot was so far fetched that i just couldn't get into it i felt like all of the far fetched points we're explained away with one line i just couldn't get into it","782":"quirky wonderful first time novel by rebecca makkai as a mother i might not have expected to like a story about a young librarian who assists a 10 year old boy who runs away but i liked it a lot this is a story with many layers it has a definite message that makes sense as to why she might be driven to help him and is both funny and moving throughout just love both lucy the 26 year old and ian drake the boy and any parent will enjoy the clever interspersed bits that take a story related twist on early childhood books","783":"i finished this book almost two weeks ago but i've struggled in how to write this review this book was a personal treasure to me and writing my thoughts on it feel almost too intimate too vulnerable to bare to the world and that's strange to me because this is not high literature no one will be studying this in a classroom and it likely will never be a bestseller but it spoke to me or maybe echoed to me all the things i try to say about what drives me and what i want to do with my life we are all on this planet for a reason or it helps to think we are and my reason is to be the kidnapping librarian the narrator lucy is scatterbrained and self doubting uncertain of the values she's inherited and infuriated by the values she's confronted with that aim to block and submerge any sense of self awareness but she's certain that a reading life opens doors we didn't even know were blocking the view and if she can pass on anything at all it is that knowledge that there are worlds and beliefs and perceptions on the other side of the door this urgent belief is framed inside a charming plot charming not in action but in how lucy chews through her thoughts and shares or doesn't share with her 11 year old charge ian by the end of this narrative we understand that this is only the beginning of the journey for ian and a difficult one it will be but lucy provides in the best way she knows how by suggesting the titles that can see him through each year of young adulthood the books that will help him to see himself what an awesome gift and what a tribute to the work of all the best librarians booksellers and english teachers isn't this why we do it as inglorious as a kidnapping shelving stickering endlessly recommending reading aloud in the end it's nice to think we're busy mending souls","784":"the plot moves along which is good because it's mostly preposterous lucy who somehow finds herself on a road trip with a 10 year old runaway is meant to be flaky i think which is good except that her constant self doubt doesn't do much for her believability","785":"a very fun book the narrator is a young woman who while working in the children's section of a library kidnaps a young boy whose evangelical parents she fears would not love the boy as he is the book is suffused with loving tribute to the power and magic of children's literature the narrator is great smart kind self effacing a joy to read","786":"i liked the premise of this book a librarian rescuing a troubled child but either my idea of the premise was not the same as the author's or the author changed her idea while writing at times this book was entertaining and smart at times dull with the angst of the librarian repeated over and over again ms makkai created interesting supporting characters the father his friends the musician who wanted to be boyfriend the man who shadowed her it was just the librarian's character that grew tedious to me the book attempts to raise several themes russian oppressive life and the need for escape gay children and the religious attempts to convert them to heterosexual lifestyle the choices one makes and consequences and becoming who we are meant to be these are real issues but the story minimalized them in a way to make them a characterization of life so why three stars because of the good intent to save the child the basic storyline of the traveling and events and because of the ending","787":"what a fun little book i enjoyed the adventures of lucy and ian on the lamb and constantly wondered how this whole mess would turn out there were some laugh out loud moments we're ferret glo twins the ending was a little hard to swallow but it was satisfying nonetheless i encourage those who love libraries and the joy of reading to pick this one up","788":"the story had potential to be good but the main character pretty much ruined it for me i found her really annoying i did like all the children's book references and thought that the focus on the importance of reading books was the best part of the novel","789":" the borrower by emma donahue is a great tale for booklovers especially library lovers everywhere i was thoroughly engaged and amusd by the cleverness of the narrator lucy a 26 year old children's librarian is sarcastic witty and occasionally breaks up the narrative with inventive and highly amusing lists rhymes songs etc ten year old ian the other main character is her most dogged patron he spends all the time he can reading and quickly befriends lucy his partner in crime his parents are highly traditional protestant and sending him to a very sketchy sounding religious class in order to straighten his developing sexuality they are afraid he's gay lucy sneaks books not allowed by his conservative mother such as the hobbit magical satanist content a wrinkle in time same anything with a girl protagonist into ian's backpack without checking them out and leaving incriminating electronic evidence the two sort of kidnap each other for a short period which sounds awful and is if you stop to think about it you won't though because you'll be too caught up in the story it's funny a little heartbreaking makes you smile and is slightly horrifying if you ever do stop to contemplate that a librarian has indeed driven across state lines with her 10 year old friend yet i felt strangely on their side the whole time it's a wonderful book politically it was bit extreme into the liberal view point for me but i still really enjoyed it view this and other reviews on my book blog http loveonlit wordpress com","790":"is the author a librarian she wrote the library world quite well and i really enjoyed reading the passages where it's written like a children's book i e the very hungry caterpillar or a lift the flap book i quite enjoyed it","791":"very much enjoyed this book except couldn't get past the kidnapping part to empathize with the maine character","792":"good light read with improbable parts you just kind of overlook for what it is","793":"quick read with a cute story about a librarian who ends up taking one of her young patrons across the country","794":"i rarely read adult fiction books partly because my job just doesn't allow time for it but i'm so glad i read this one i loved that the main character was a librarian even if she did hate her job and that a huge part of the story was a road trip you can never go wrong with road trips lucy our librarian in the story somehow mistakenly or not kidnaps one of her frequent patrons a ten year old boy ian ian loves books and reading but has parents that really restrict what he can read no magic etc and they've started to send him to a special religious class to kick the gay out of him because they think he might be a homosexual lucy sees all of this from the sidelines and when she comes into the library on a monday morning and sees that ian has runaway to the library and spent the night there she quickly kidnaps him well it was ian's idea and the two of the them set out on adventure lucy believes she is saving ian from a horrible home life and ian just needs a break and wants an adventure like he reads about in all the books as the story unravels we see that lucy really has no idea what she's doing but now she's in too deep and can't just return ian without suffering major consequences a bunch of secondary characters shine in the novel including lucy's russian immigrant father that probably has russian mafia ties in chicago this is just a fun read anyone that loves children's books road trips and small precocious children as main characters will really enjoy reading this book this is makkai's first novel and i really look forward to what she produces next","795":"i feel like this book was made just for me how could i pass up a book about books libraries young readers librarians adventures and censorship if you love any of these fine things minus the censorship you'll simply love this story the narrator is lucy a twenty something who is slowly becoming the epitome of a librarian complete with cardigan sweater coincidentally the story is set in hannibal mo which is just a hop skip and a jump away from my parents' town so close in fact that i've been to hannibal on many occasions the area falls in bible belt territory so it's no surprise that 10 year old ian alistair drake's mother i only add his middle name because it's a favorite of mine further proving this book was written for me marches into the library one day and insists that he is not to read any inappropriate material lucy is livid and she's later faced with a dilemma when ian is enrolled in anti gay classes with his church and subsequently runs away to the library of course lucy continuously struggles with the choice she's made to embark on a cross country road trip with ian to help him escape what was she thinking luckily the reader is able to know lucy like a best friend and it all seems to make perfect sense to me","796":"fictional story of a children's librarian who inadvertantly becomes a kidnapper of a 10 year old boy i love all the characters especially lucy's father i really hope this author writes more novels","797":"this book is one of those books that is all about books and the influence that books can have in our lives it centers around a librarian and a boy who doesn't fit in who end up on a impromptu roadtrip together the book was fine but not great and i sometimes got annoyed by the adult character's assurance that she knew what was best for the boy and in a position to act as a savior to him","798":"loved that it was about a librarian and loved the writing style but was a little tired of the mentioning of anything gay it didn't seem to be needed but i loved the story and can't wait to read more","799":"charming","800":"one of the most unique books i've ever read a totally original story a must read for any book lover and anyone who has ever loved a child i was far more emotional at the end of this than i expected okay done rambling now","801":"i was very disappointed with this book i did not relate or even like the main character very much which made it very difficult to care what happens to her there were some very likeable characters and laugh out loud moments but overall i felt that the story was lacking i probably enjoyed the ending more than the rest of the book and it did give me some things to think about but not enough to redeem the rest of the book","802":"this book was beyond farfetched it was ridiculous a children's librarian and a loveable if somewhat annoying ten year old boy embark on an aimless week long road trip add to that a cuddly member of the russian mafia sprinkle with some cooky members of the local community theater and don't forget the villain an evangelist who wants to cure the world of homosexuality but it was mildly entertaining which explains my two star rating","803":"i enjoyed the witty characters and the connections to kid lit reminded me a little of a john green novel with the road trip adventure","804":"powerful novel about how we view ourselves and others unfortunately it felt much too political and preachy to really resonate with you but the moments when lucy must come to terms with the views of herself and how they differ from reality were striking and memorable","805":"rebecca makkai's debut novel starts very well the 'borrower' of the title is a small boy ian who borrows as many books from the local library as he can shove into his rucksack unfortunately for ian he has an overbearing religious mother who puts a ban on most of the books that he wants to read and insists that he read the 'boring' or religious books lucy is the young librarian who takes a shine to ian and encourages him to read what he wants to lucy even reserves books for ian using her own library card lucy is a bit of an enigma she seems bored with life often wondering what she is doing in this sleepy town lucy has a couple of strange friendships with the other librarians and with her 'almost' boyfriend the conductor lucy worries about ian she worries that he is being brainwashed by a religious sect and that he is unhappy one day lucy finds ian has run away from home and slept at the library this is where the novel starts to turn a little odd lucy and ian run away and there follows an adventure that encompasses all sorts of weird and wonderful people and animals it's all just a little bit too odd for me this is adult fiction and the magical adventures just don't work at all there is no doubt that rebecca makkai can write but maybe she should be aiming at a younger audience","806":"charming story even though a little unbelievable loved the characters and the writing style","807":"this is an unlikely story about a children's librarian who befriends a precocious 10 year old boy who is probably gay this poor kid has extremely religious parents who believe that their son's condition is sinful and can somehow be overcome by religious conditioning they place extreme restrictions on his activities and reading and send him off for regular religious training one day he runs away from home camps out in the library and winds up being taken on a cross country road trip with his favorite left leaning sympathetic anti censorship librarian lady the story is really about the librarian's realization that neither she or her young friend can really run away from home and she cannot change the way other people are one cannot choose one's parents and cannot deny that our personalities are heavily influenced by home and the people there that make home what it is","808":"this was really great laugh at loud funny throughout this has gotten very positive reviews and some negative reviews but i thoroughly enjoyed it main character is a young childrens librarian she becomes concerned about a 10 year old boy whose parents are restricting the kinds of books he is allowed to read i don't want to give anything away but it's funny and sprinkled throughout withnreferences to children's books amusing and believable characters and some very funny commentaries on politics and a hilarious state of the union party when george bush was president clever and entertaining","809":"the borrower by rebecca makkaifrom the inside flap lucy hall a young children's librarian in hannibal missouri finds herself both kidnapper and kidnapped when her favorite patron ten year old ian drake runs away from home the precocious ian is addiction to reading but needs lucy's help to smuggle books past his overbearing mother who has enrolled ian in weekly anti gay classes lucy a rebel at heart beneath her librarian's exterior stumbles into a moral dilemma when she finds ian camped out in the library after hours with a knapsack of provisions and an escape plan desperate to save him from the drakes lucy allows herself to be hijacked by ian the odd pair embarks on an improvised road trip from missouri to vermont with ferrets and an inconvenient boyfriend thrown in their path along the way lucy struggles to make peace with her russian immigrant father and his fugitive past and is forced to use his shady connections to escape discovery but is it just ian who's running away who is the strange man on their trail and should lucy be trying to save a boy from his own parents this is a book about a librarian so it was a given that i would read it this was an extremely frustrating book but that might be why i kept reading i was so engaged with character i'm surprised i didn't find myself arguing out loud with lucy for an adult albeit a young one she makes choices that cause a woman of certain age such as myself to just shake her head in disbelief what adult allows a ten year old boy to highjack them and call all the shots but truth be told since i work in a building full of kids around that age i must concede that i sometimes feel that the children my own as well my students have taken over but then i snap out of it realize i'm the adult and if i'm going to make a positive difference in the lives of children i have to act like one i don't think lucy ever really comes to that conclusion i believe she wants to help ian but she has no clue about realistic ways to do that what i liked about the book one of the main characters lucy is a children's librarian the other ian is a total bookworm there are several references to beloved children's books i had to stop myself from making a list of books i wanted to re read based on the titles mentioned in this story though lucy is a rather wayward young woman who still has quite a bit of maturing to do i couldn't help but like her what i didn't like about the book i didn't like the way librarians in general were presented i'm wondering if makkai had a bad experience with a librarian and has never gotten over it the book is a little preachy on some topics intellectual freedom and freedom to be yourself are just a couple of them also the idea that an adult would allow herself to be kidnapped by a ten year old child is just unbelievable bottom line this book is flawed and i feel guilty admitting that i enjoyed reading it and that i bought a copy for my personal library","810":"i wish there was a way to give 1 2 stars because i would have given 3 1 2 to this book it was interesting and very different but i thought it left too many things unresolved given the story line","811":"lucy hull is a 26 year old librarian in charge of the children's department of the hannibal library in missouri ian drake is a 10 year old christian boy who may or may not be gay what do they have in common they both love books and they both have been kidnapped so to speak the borrower tells a tale of a young woman with no real direction in life and how she ends up going on a completely unplanned road trip with a child facing identity issues lucy may not love her job as a children's librarian but she does love books and recommending them to curious children seeking her advice on what to read next she has a unique friendship with 10 year old ian who's always coming up to her desk to check out book after book when ian's mother janet confronts lucy at work one day to tell her not to allow ian to borrow books that don't have the breath of god in them lucy begins to take a not so usual interest in the child's well being she learns that ian's parents send him to a special type of class led by a pastor who swears he can turn gay kids straight -- pastor bob himself was a gay man but then became straight and married a former lesbian despite mrs drake's request that ian not be allowed to read certain types of books lucy continues to let ian borrow them but she checks them out under her own library account ian's home life is apparently anything but peachy one early morning when lucy arrives at the library for work she spots ian with a rucksack and stacks of books it seems he's intent on running away at least for a little while lucy and ian hop into her car and before she knows it they're heading across various state lines and developing one lie after another to make sure their location is unknown to those back home in hannibal while the relationship between lucy and ian is strictly platonic and more like teacher student she can't help but realize how sinister it would look to others -- staying in a different motel every night with a kid who's not yours separate rooms of course and lying about his mother's identity along the way lucy and ian interact with glenn lucy's sort of boyfriend from hannibal lucy's russian immigrant father who has some shady dealings possibly with the russian mafia and jewish american mother the labaznikovs a friendly couple who apparent owe lucy's father some favors to each person they come across lucy and ian make up stories about the reason for their road trip his mother attempted suicide and she drove to chicago to take care of him she's dropping him off at his grandmother's house in vermont it's hard to keep all the lies straight and lucy becomes more and more stressed about her situation ian on the other hand is having the time of his life away from home i couldn't really sympathize with any of the characters lucy is nice enough but she makes some pretty stupid decisions like hiding the boy from his parents in the first place there were so many times she could've turned around and set things right but she just kept digging herself deeper into a ditch it's fine to worry about a child with whom you interact every day but lucy tries to fix ian's life when it's impossible in the end she realizes that she can't save him but books can so she makes sure he gets to read any book he wants regardless of what his mother says i guess if there's a positive message in this story it's that books can save people the story is so far fetched and if this sort of thing happened in real life the librarian would end up in police custody and the boy would be seeing a psychiatrist but there were some funny moments in this book i especially liked all the references to children's literature madeline goodnight moon choose your own adventure while the plot is unrealistic and the characters not entirely sympathetic i think a lover of literature might enjoy this book if only for the numerous references to real books throughout the story","812":"cute fun read about a young librarian who is forced to kidnap a young boy she has come to know and worry about very light but intelligent","813":"i could relate to the main character since i substitute in a school library i enjoyed all of the book references having the little boy be gay was unnecessary but i guess that goes along with the liberal undertones","814":"recommended by andrea jo and ellen b you just gotta love ian check our catalog http encore cooklib org iii encore","815":"loved this story of a ten year old boy and a twenty six year old librarian who share a love of reading they run away together but who is kidnapping whom delightful","816":"loved it not so much because of the story but because of what the entire book represents that we should accept ourselves and expect people to accept us for who we are that reading provides solace and comfort and companionship that the stories in books may help people deal with situations feelings and their lives in general i wish all children would have access to books that will help them see the world and develop open minds totally recommend this book","817":"it was an interesting book you have to kind of suspend your belief of what is realistic at some parts some of the things just seemed so way over the top it was hard to get past it but you can tell the author has a love for books and believes they can save a person","818":"a colleague suggested this book odd certainly i enjoyed the plays on children's books premise a bit disturbing but all's well that ends well","819":"an engaging story about a runaway ten year old and his librarian made me nostalgic for my childhood days at the hales corners library the book was a quick read with lots of good plot but i couldn't get past the fact that the librarian drove across half the country and yet never once had a direct conversation with ian about why he was running away it seemed too unbelievable to me perhaps i need to spend some wistful time in a library reclaiming my childhood suspension of disbelief","820":"i enjoyed this one it is our june book for a novel bunch book group nominated by a children's librarian","821":"when i read the book's synopsis i couldn't wait to read it i love stories about children who find unlikely parental figures and vice versa stories with the message that sometimes we need to create a family rather than rely on our own blood relatives but that's not what this book is about at all which isn't a bad thing per se this book has its own strengths mostly related to makkai's wonderful writing but i had a hard time feeling an emotional connection to the characters or the action lucy hull is a children's librarian in small town missouri correction she's a college grad who magically landed a librarian position without an mls or an in person interview perhaps this book should be shelved in the fantasy section one of her favorite young patrons is ian a 10 year old boy who is probably gay which concerns his extremely religious patrons ian hatches a plan to run away and drags lucy with him inadvertently turning her into a kidnapper this story is less about ian and more about lucy the adventure causes her to reflect on her own family issues particularly her dad's history as a russian immigrant and possible criminal the book is also less light hearted than you might expect some of the chapters pay homage to popular children's literature but the overall tone is fairly ruminative and bleak i certainly enjoyed reading this but it didn't resonate with me","822":"although at first glance the story seems entirely untenable i have known people just like lucy and her russian immigrant family boys like ian fundamentalists like the drake's and pastor bob they are all out there and when their worlds' collide unrealistic things can become reality rebecca makkai's story telling pulled me in from the beginning and kept me involved through the final page i'm sure this book isn't for everyone but it certainly spoke to me","823":"i found it really hard to connect to the characters in this book which was very disappointing when i initially read the description for the book i was very moved by the idea of having a heartwarming story about a person trying to protect a young gay boy from his religious family and finding herself inadvertently kidnapping him however all the characters in the book were really 2 dimensional and quite frankly annoying and i found it impossible to to side with any of them ian the little boy was really never allowed to become a well rounded character who goes through his own journey in understanding the circumstances he was living in and finding who he wanted to be he really just became a tool through which the main protagonist came to understand how lost she really felt in her own life the journey they go through together was really all about her at no point did i really feel she was doing what she did out of some nurturing need to protect the boy all her decision were made for very selfish reasons not to mention that the plot really made it hard for me to escape into the world of the book and believe in the events that unfold i really can't believe that people would be so dense so that there are no bigger ramifications that came from her kidnapping ian i was really let down by this book i thought it could've been a very poignant story but the focus of the story was misplaced","824":"i love this book i couldn't put it down and desperately wanted to keep reading about these characters it's rare to find a book that leaves the reader with a true sense of loss upon finishing the story but this one did it for me fabulous","825":"adultthis is a really interesting book the voice of the narrator saying she was unclear whether she had committed a crime or not kind of grated at me at the beginning i thought the prose was a bit bumpy and took me out of the story some i was also not pleased with the stereotypes of the librarian particularly the children's librarian self described as wiping crayons off books all day however a colleague had suggested the book and i plunged onward as the plot thickened so to speak and the tension tightened move after move where you are thinking to yourself how in the world is the narrator going to get out of this the story was difficult to put down there are some just crazy hilarious parts too the flushing toilet and the day glo ferret scrub the arrival of the russian father into the plot was hysterical as well the author obviously loves books and though she leaves the librarian at a circulation desk at the end of the book her love for books shines through and what librarian hasn't wanted to shelter a child from abusive circumstances at home the conclusion of the book is realistic and ultimately hopeful quirky sensitive and laugh out loud funny sometimes","826":"i am so glad to have read this book to say that it was amazing is not sufficient praise for this book it was an adventure story that took its readers through a landscape of emotion and self discovery ian's lucy's and perhaps even your own one really perfect touch was finding that some of the story was written in the stye of popular children's books so appropriate since its narrator was a children's librarian","827":"spoiler alert i enjoyed this book but felt it didn't live up to the hype i read about this book everywhere and how amazing it was and i didn't feel that as i read it i also had a huge issue with the fact that the librarian pretty much kidnaps a 10 year old and nothing ever happens to her working with kids everyday i can understand wanting to whisk a child away from horrible circumstances but the fact she actually did it to me was unbelievable there were some cute homages to classic stories too","828":"this is a story for readers who love books libraries and finding joy in unexpected or peripheral places it instantly went to the top of my list to read there were many moments i enjoyed and where i found greater depth than the descriptions and words on the page the story provides many opportunities for literary allusions and wittiness makkai uses many of these but not all i so appreciate what she's established in terms of character plot and questions but overall and i say this with humility i don't think the novel lives up to its promise my biggest hold up with this story is that it is conscious of itself in the american genre of misadventure established by novels like huck finn catcher in the rye lolita etc the opening pages are full of direct literary references even verbatim re quotations all smart and funny it feels like through lucy and ian we're going to get a new glimpse into the genre through a character with 2012 values and aesthetics but it ends there those novels i mentioned all involved first person unreliable narrators confront the chaos of a journey that ends worse off than it began the meaning eludes the narrator and so leaves it up to the reader to do the thinking humbert might be the exception by being peripheral picaroons characters like huck and holden rebel agains the rules of the unfair world and learn about themselves in deep painful ways they're not completely conscious of it is clear the writer of the borrower knows this essential american genre because she has wittily included so many references and creates the terms of the runaway to acknowledge the tradition makkai's twist is a story about saving someone from being saved and then realizing one should not be a saver religious fundamentalism and a lack of tolerance are the evils but i don't feel the characters confront them authentically maybe it's the three chapters of epilogue that reveal too much wisdom or maybe it's the lack of moments during the journey when epiphanies don't feel earned or in the moment or maybe it's the fact that lucy is too aware of what she is rebelling against she's out of control but she says so and then there is the whole russian mafia thing i can't tell if the story is in earnest or laughing at itself i'd like more attention to the complexity of lucy the dimensions of her voice and how it can reflect the quality of knowing in the moment or more perhaps more excitingly not knowing let the reader try to figure that out","829":"not as good as i hoped it would be","830":"a headstrong children's librarian a bookish young man a quirky and aimless road trip across america the belief that books can save your life and references to classic kid's lit well yes i like all these things this little book made me smile 5 stars because of how perfectly it fit me ymmv","831":"when i heard about the book i was intrigued when i read it i was underwhelmed here's a book w so much potential and the plot just falls short ian is such a dynamic character but i feel like lil miss librarian can't even remember her name 2 mins after reading the book wasnt fleshed out enough it's not a bad book but it's not a great book which i was both expecting and hoping for","832":"although i loved the narrator i really didn't enjoy this book i've always thought that a charismatic narrator could get you through just about any text but i didn't find that to be true here i really didn't care what happened and i had to force myself to finish it","833":"i received this through bookcrossing as a surprise i hadn't heard of the book before it's all about lucy who is a children's librarian and one day her best customer kidnaps her or does she kidnap him the ending was a tiny bit disapointing all that they had been through and what had changed i also really wanted to know what happened to ian in later life","834":"unsolicited advice for reading this book approach it like a bedtime story it's a tall tale a story told with unrealistic u0026amp nigh unbelievable strokes every so often offset by glittery little gems of real world details and emotional insights that make it feel real even when we recognize just how unreal unbelievable and often unlikeable the story really is i liked the lead up to the departure of the two main characters lucy a small town children's librarian and ian a running away from home young patron but after that i found it pretty hard not to be stressed out by lucy basically kidnapping ian if like me you can't let go of the fact that a trusted adult takes off with a child and often blames ian for his manipulation even as she's charmed by him it might be an uphill battle to enjoy the bulk of the book lucy does struggle with her actions with her inability to understand her own motives which is at least appreciated but i still felt severely unimpressed by her actions and her thoughts the writing itself was lovely clever and full of love for classic and contemporary childhood favorite books i didn't find all the literary references annoying they were stylistically and practically slipped in throughout the story in a way that felt organic and just that super quick and unexplained mention of the world is quiet here filled me with glee and i think the reason why i stuck with this book and why i gave it three stars despite not always enjoying the book is because it's one of those books that's full of love for books for storytelling for reading and not in a pretentious way not in a these books are good but these books rot your brain and have no redeeming value way that i feel books about books too often stick to but in an all encompassing way that embraces how books and stories and reading are absolutely sublime warm fuzzy feelings content advisory the narrator kidnaps a child albeit a willing one and often blames that act on the child negative views on homosexuality depicted single and one dimensional portrayal of christianity's views on homosexuality narrative obsession i e multiple characters do it for no good reason with describing one character's thinness as a reason to gawk and as a character defect and anorexic used as a pejorative","835":"the borrower is a strange hybrid a melange of influences from all the kid on the road novels of american lit the adventures of huckleberry finn lolita the catcher in the rye and the wonderful wizard of oz are the most name dropped ones are mixed in with children's books chase novels unreliable narratives immigrant sagas and religious nutcase fiction who can resist that at the heart of this book is the notion of personal change all the main characters are in flux with their identity whether they know it or not these are a children's librarian who doesn't know what to do with herself and is treading water a 10 year old kid who puts everyone's gaydar on full klaxon a russian immigrant family turned into an american a theater troupe who always have a facade in their interactions with the world a paralyzed vietnam vet who has another story for how he is but the main point of the book is that while there is no place like home there is also no place like a book to be another home where you can find out that there are other voices and other rooms in this world where you can fit in p s if you happen to be evangelical and anti gay then this is the book for you to learn to lighten up","836":"this is the best book i've read in months the writing is so beautiful and well done and the author definitely knows how to keep a reader interested i read the entire book in one day although i do that a lot with good books","837":"i liked the story this book told but felt it got lost along the way and lasted a bit too long the story focuses on a small town librarian who befriends a 10 year old boy who is a frequent visitor to the library everyone including his evangilical parents think the boy will eventually realize he's gay when his parents enroll him in a gay cure or more accurately gay pre emptive religious class our librarian narrator is upset and concerned and assists the boy in running away from while while justifying her behavior to herself via flashbacks to a friend she had in high school i enjoyed the narrator's voice and she often made me laugh so even though there were uneven parts i did enjoy the book overall","838":"i tend not to like humorous books about serious topics the whole book was unrealistic and i didn't find it funny at all when kidnapping becomes funny maybe i will feel differently","839":"oh how i wanted to love this book it has so many things that i adore libraries quirkiness a book reference on almost every page a journey a possibly gay 10 year old boy various unrequited loves the book turned out to be grounded more in farce than in reality which would have been ok except that the protagonist was so dull you couldn't really root for her and in a farce you need to have some attachment to the main character in order to swallow all the unrealistic situations and coincidences also this is not a spoiler but the main idea of the book she kidnaps a child she kidnaps a child she kidnaps a child i don't care how bad she thinks his home life is she should not have kidnapped the child this book does a disservice to real librarians who work hard to get their mls degrees since lucy hull just plods her way into a job that actually requires some expertise i don't even want to get into the gay kid aspect of the novel it hits too close to home for me ian may or may not be gay the only reason he may be is because some adults think he is that wasn't reason enough for me to buy into it what he's a voracious reader has a soft voice and likes to sing most of the boys i know who fit that description are straight the fundamentalist christian aspect was i think handled more realistically and as long as i'm ripping this book a new one can i just say and i don't think this is petty the hush puppy dog is a bassett hound not a beagle she keeps calling it a beagle i kept waiting for someone to correct her glenn or ian but no one did and i can only assume that this point slipped past a bunch of people as the book was being readied for publication what the hell i hated the ending which really made me lose respect for the book i might have been able to deal with all of the other stuff because i did love the literary references the parodies and the basic idea of the story but the string of coincidences at the end were just silly i wanted some triumph for ian i put so much time into making sure he was ok two and a half stars i just can't round it up to three because i felt the pacing was off started out ok and then just dragged they spent so much time at their final destination time that didn't need to be spent that i almost started to hate what is actually one of my very favorite states","840":"this is a likeable book with a unique plot and characters but what keeps it from being a five star read is the second third of the book which lacks air and becomes tedious the urge to reach its unpredictable ending however compels the reader to continue on","841":"the perfect librarian's book read a book save a child","842":"well i kind if wanted to give this one 3 5 stars because in the end i was okay with it despite reading almost the whole thing with a bit of dread in the pit of my stomach while i agree with the librarian's opinions i feel her instincts were all wrong and i am a librarian and a parent so although the characters are relatable i couldn't quite enjoy this story i don't think i ever quite understood the story of her father like maybe i dozed off during a crucial point in the story and missed something but i suppose it fed into the savior redemption theme that kind of ties it together in the end i will say this for the story though i wondered the whole time how it would end because it seemed like there was no possible way it could end well but i think it did and with only a modicum of deus ex machina","843":"very unique book well written and exciting kept me engaged the entire time","844":"id give it 4 5 fun read","845":"i'd actually give this 3 1 2 stars if there was a way to do that as i children's librarian i really got a kick out of this book i'd definitely recommend","846":"good book club book the main character lucy has a lot going on the book was readable and i wanted to know what happened but the end was a bit of a let down as there were many many unanswered questions","847":"hilarious i couldn't put this down and laughed loudly in dozens of instances wonderful narration it is actually much less explicitly about the is this child gay question than all kinds of observations about how we relate to children to our own parents to other people's parents to the adults who try to feed us their truths when we're 10 to our own futures when we're in our 20s and to the books we read and the seeds they perhaps plant in us at all ages in the end nobody really knows the truth about anything but we come away with the joyful feeling that we must let everyone develop their own sexuality and as long as we help the really desperate ones around us to avoid giving up it'll probably all be ok if not filled with wonderment and amazingness","848":"thought provoking and well written i enjoyed this novel while i was displeased with the light in which the bible and christianity were portrayed the truths behind the portrayal were too real to ignore i loved lucy and totally identified with and understood her journey to intrapersonal knowledge i also loved ian with his innocent child like understanding of the world this book was a fun trip and left me hoping beyond hope for a happy ending i was often laughing at the tightly woven references to well known children's literature and simultaneously talking back to the book scolding lucy for the choices she and i made together it made the librarian in me cringe as i identified and the shining thesis roughly summarized i can't save anyone but i believe in the power of books to save left me cheering and nodding and crying and disagreeing all at once i will recommend this book cautiously knowing many of my christian friends who will be offended by the theology but whole heartedly to those who can read beyond the surface level and enjoy the challenge to their thinking","849":"i tired i really did but i just couldn't stomach the self righteous heroine she's just as holier than thou as the characters that the book is suppose to be parodying both are equally ridiculous only i fear that the author doesn't see it","850":"enjoyable read with an unrealistic plot the author does get a lot right about libraries and librarians however","851":"the idea that she could drive across half the country with a missing boy is ridiculous still i enjoyed reading it","852":"people have two problems with this book its left wing politics and its rather farfetched plot but for me this was pure reading pleasure the narrator's voice was unlike any i've seen in fiction before little touches like the theater troupe who live beneath the protagonist the wheelchair bound best friend who may or may not be infatuated with lucy the lists and allusions that spice the writing throughout a truly unusual love interest in snively composer glenn i enjoyed most every page of this book despite its farfetched sequence of events and yes the protagonist's politics are very left wing i got no problem with that whatsoever","853":"again more of a 3 5 i wasn't totally satisfied but i did really enjoy reading this it was a very quick read","854":"an absolutely fantastic book it's a must read the writer has a really fantastic way with words and kept me hooked","855":"absolutely loved it wish i'd written it myself what a good idea for a novel i'm still debating which actions she could be forgiven for and which were of more benefit than harm to ian now i'm keen to find all the books she recommends and relive my childhood more books about librarians please and i don't mean that as a euphuism","856":"should have been good but i found it stressful she basically kidnapped a boy","857":"surprisingly affecting bit of a slow start but the predicament the narrator puts herself in pulls you along","858":"this book was very hard to get stuck into although it was enjoyable at times it is not a book i would read again","859":"i loved this book i almost love libraries almost as much as i do the books themselves and this is the kind of rare novel i've read that in the end i literally want to step into the pages and hug the two main characters some of the road trip itself gets a little bogged down but the characters leap off the page and i was especially moved by the ending a great debut novel","860":"i'd actually give this about 4 4 stars a sad sweet and sweetly written book about lucy the librarian in hannibal mo who sort of kidnaps a 10 y o boy deemed gay by some at that age you can know and therefore put by his parents into an evangelical reprogramming class with pastor bob lucy lives over a theater and cannot wear shoes or flush the toilet between 6 and 11 pm because her kitchen is right over the stage the boy ian is at the library one morning when she shows up early he spent the night there hiding at closing time they head out from hannibal in her car and travel hither and yon chicago where her parents live vermont in the end of course everything turns out as it probably should along the way lucy learns some family secrets and things about herself the epilogue is five years later and although lucy knows she may never see ian again she imagines him with the lists of books she has given him to read the tale concludes imagine him already there under his covers with the flashlight for a blissful eternity such a world should suffice for now it should save him let's say that it does","861":"this was a silly and ridiculous jaunt around the us with a pretty blonde librarian and her favorite fledgeling gay boy whom she kidnaps i am really tempted to demote this book to only two stars because the plot was weak and unrealistic the characters underdeveloped and the whole thing tended towards boring i liked that it was funny and very positive about glbt people i also liked that this was a book about books it really emphasized the magical healing and life enhancing power of a good book in which i certainly believe i do agree good books helped me through my own little gay life but i don't think that the borrower was one of the better ones","862":"as a children's librarian i could identify with the characters in this book but that's as far as it went the road trip doesn't go anywhere and the anxiety seems to take over i kept waiting for something exciting to happen but this book had more angst than adventure","863":"interesting book especially loved the paraphrasing of children's books i want to haunt a children's library","864":"the middle of the book i just wanted to yell at the main character was sooooo annoyed but i ploughed thru not exactly like book candy more like a couple sourpatch kids that you don't finish","865":"i had to suspend a lot of disbelief here but i did like this first of all i was annoyed by the stereotypical single librarian girl who thinks about everything in terms of book characters blah blah blah and her handling of the whole situation that is the crux of the matter was over the top although it did get me thinking about what i would do in a similar situation and what the ala ethics would say too the road trip part was more fun very funny and lots of awesome book references","866":"enjoyed this road trip with a children's librarian and her favorite patron","867":"i started off really good children's librarian ready to save the world one marginalized child at a time great intentions but kidnapping a 10 year old boy for a week without national alerts was more than suspending my disbelief had the story kept building on her resolve to enlighten small minded people it might have gone from great premise to a knockout rollicking good time but alas it mainly just fizzled out by the end however makkai's writing is a fine specimen of thoughtful and profound epiphanies and her colourful russian family was great fun to acquaint oneself with","868":"i almost couldn't hang on as the book's plot became wilder and wilder but it was charming enough and i liked ian enough to remain engrossed i loved spotting all of the children's literature references though i wish lucy's recommendations to ian had been a little more current the depiction of her children's librarian job was similarly outdated though the core aspects and several of the situations were spot on in general it was really enjoyable to read about what i do for a living and why books are often promoted as life saving but rarely are children's books highlighted the way they are here hooray makkai does a really nice job creating a realistically precocious child and several of the smaller characters lucy's father tim rocky were also particularly well drawn","869":"i'd actually give this 3 5 stars but that's not an option","870":" second reading for book group 4 13first reading september 2 2011i went through different stages in my feelings about this book it is narrated by lucy a children's librarian in a small midwestern library and her words drew me in immediately lucy loves books and believes in the power of books to rescue people as narrator she frequently writes in the style of real authors nabokov eric carle roald dahl and many more the book including the title is loaded with references to books and has a storybook feel at times i mean come on lucy the librarian lucy becomes friends with ian a 10 year old whose religious mother strictly controls what he reads no wizards no sex no bad language etc and sends ian to a creepy evangelist who deprograms kids who may be gay when lucy discovers ian in the library having run away from home she decides to rescue him and they go on the road together the borrower lost me here for a while it was like watching a train wreck no pun intended as she makes increasingly bad decisions or leaves the decisions to ian that take them ever farther from home it had some of the claustrophobic this isn't right feeling of room an adult and a child in a small space with increasingly limited good options however by the end i really really liked what makkai had done with the book there are too many levels to describe them all her parents her journey the people she meets and knows ultimately is all about stories storytelling versions of reality she tells us at the beginning i might be the villain of this story even now it's hard to tell as i look back i see that she has turned herself into a character or makkai has created her both as a real character and a fictional one and how artfully she has done it note i think this would be a good book to read for book group","871":"i give the story a 3 and the author a 4 or 5 it was a little slow and ridiculous at times in a farce comical way but it is written in such a clever way she has this dry humor thing going on and analogies that i so appreciated i'll definitely look out for rebecca makkai and hope she writes more books note if you are homophobic or a focus on the family groupie you may not relate to this book well","872":"so implausible it got annoying after a while","873":"not a great book i was unsure where it was going for the longest time and the way she talked something very bad was or had happened i liked the book lists for ian at the end but overall i think this lady was a nut bag and i know some librarians they are not nut bags so there ya have it i dont recommend wasting quality read time on this one i even liked russians and ferrets but not enough to give this more than two dying dwarf stars of approval ian needed a good spanking a couple of times as well he was not endearing to me","874":"thank you to my gma friend mimi for this book lucy hull is a 26 yr old librarian she is conflicted about her job friends and relationships what i call an unreliable narrator she likes ian drake an 11 yr old who loves books but ian's family is christian and will not let ian read most books because their should be religion in them lucy becomes convinced ian is being stifled with a little abuse too she finds out from a guy librarian friend in a wheelchair that his parents make him attend these classes that should cast out any gay leanings which lucy doesn't see but everyone else does when she comes to work one day she finds ian has run away and spent the night in the library lucy decides to run away with him and they traverse many states and stop to meet her family in chicago you will have to read the book to find out what happens to lucy and ian but i can honestly say i really didn't get or like lucy until the very end of the book she is young immature and doesn't really let you know what she is like i loved all the references to many famous books and all the library lore","875":"not what i was looking for i felt the author was trying to push her agenda and thinly veiled it in a novel","876":"intriguing premise and heroine beginning and ending sections were best","877":"oh i loved it i totally identified with miss hull in so many ways i even fell a little in love with ian and i generally don't like kids there were parts that made me want to cry and parts that made me laugh out loud can't wait to see more from this author","878":"i only gave it one star for the references to children's librarianship that i live every day this book went nowhere which is funny because the entire story is made up of the characters going everywhere geographically speaking i will say that i liked the author's point of view on the religious right who cherry pick the bible to suit their own ignorance and prejudices my favorite line was about those who ignore the parts that say \"you can't ever eat pork or shellfish and women should cover their heads and you can't plant two crops in the same field yet will live and die by the next line that says two men can't love each other i had high hopes for this but i hated the main character the young boy who was supposedly homosexual and running from a wacko religious cult bent on making him straight was just annoying the russian mobster family was shallow and boring the more i write this review the more i realize how much i seriously disliked this book so there","879":"i was excited about the story at the beginning couldn't buy the premise by the early middle of book skipped to the end to finish it up","880":"i have to hand it to ms makkai this was a challenging concept but she managed to make it an engaging story lucy was relatable as a protagonist and i like ian's genuine sweet precocious ten year old ness it is not plausible as something a real reasonable person would do lucy and ian's parents actually are more alike than you'd think each wants to shield him from a seemingly perilous future don't obsess over who's right and who's wrong just enjoy a nicely crafted story and don't steal anyone's kid","881":"i chose to read this book after coming across some glowing reviews i found the premise to be unique and interesting and i was excited to see where the author took it i absolutely loved ian and thought he was a really interesting well developed character he's a kid i would have loved to hang out with but then promptly returned to his parents because though they are horrible taking off across state lines with a kid who isn't yours just isn't a good idea in between being caught up in the lovely fun adventures ian and lucy are having i found myself frustrated with her because you kidnapped someone you took a child away from his family and regardless of how close minded and terrible they are this is crazy to me i get that she got caught up and in over her head and had ian's best interests at heart but it still made me mad i'll give makkai credit though because despite this i actually really liked lucy as well does that even make any sense maybe not","882":"library geeks this is for you if you like libraries and who doesn't and kidnapping but the very gentle kind or kids lit or just simply a new story line check out the borrowers it kept me entertained from the beginning to the very last sentence intriguing","883":"a great summer read about the unlikely adventures of a children's librarian and an interesting young reader i loved all of the references to children's lit a sweet story that is dry and witty","884":"librarian lucy is an unreliable narrator and that's actually a major theme in the book the stories we think we know are not always true i work with kids and every now and then i find myself wishing i could just take a certain kid home for a week or two to straighten them out or give them a loving environment or whatever lucy actually makes off with a kid without permission because although he's only 10 she's pretty sure that ian is gay and his parents are conservative christians who are already taking him to classes to make sure he grows up straight and they won't let him read hardly anything good lucy's also coming to terms with her own past and family history which she finds out is not quite what she thought there are references to children's literature throughout the book and bits of the story that are written in the style of well known children's books there's even a choose your own adventure chapter lucy sounds like an authentic 26 year old still trying to separate herself from her family and still unsure of what she's doing with her life although she does end up staying in the library business ian's a great character he's simultaneously a wonderful kid who loves to read but also a boy who doesn't like his parents controlling him and isn't above throwing a fit to get his way i'd be very interested in reading a novel told from ian's point of view too one thing that niggled at me the adult characters were all sure that ian was gay and i get that but they really never say why loves books doesn't really do it i know sometimes you just know but still i thoroughly enjoyed reading this and actually took it along to a movie theater in order to finish it before the movie started because i couldn't wait until we got back","885":"i liked the premise of this book twenty six year old lucy is a children's librarian in the small town of hannibal missouri she becomes acquainted with a precocious ten year old boy who is a regular of her reading group lucy discovers that ian may be gay and that his parents have enrolled him in an anti gay camp ian unhappy at home runs away to the library lucy finds and attempts to save him they both run away on the road to who knows where the road trip turns into a trip into the land of fantasy for the two of them the journey with chance encounters along the way becomes a journey of self awareness for lucy she was living a life she didn't like and in a sense used ian as an excuse to leave ian at first is a child like many children just wanted to run away from home the author made many references to mostly children's books whose characters run away ian enjoyed the freedom in the beginning but later on as with most children he wanted to go home ian's character is very well written as a teacher of 10 year olds smart boys can be quite imaginative manipulative and impulsive as was ian during the journey i realized as lucy did when she learned the truth about her father's secret about the chocolate factory that sometimes what we remember as reality is fictionalized to fit one's own agenda learning the truth for her i think helped her in a sense find a way to move ahead with her life i liked the ending because i as a teacher found that a way to connect and help children learn to help themselves is through the wisdom they receive while reading a good book","886":"this book was good i think it just wasn't my style it was a good story and dealt with modern issues i guess there wasn't enough depth in it for me","887":"i have tell you up front that i have worked in a library for ten years i was curious to read this book and find out where the writer wanted to take readers on this quite literal journey the opening chapters held no surprises i find most who work in libraries treasure our constitutional rights where they apply to not limiting anyones access to literature in any form what they are not always so good at is seeing different points of view that aren't liberal in nature i thought the writing was good but the story was rather ordinary it really read more like non fiction is was so mundane at times i think i expected more since it is fiction and the writer could do anything she wanted","888":"i never did decide whether i liked the narrator lucy this was an interesting read and i certainly wanted to find out what happened at the end a quick entertaining read","889":"as an industry book the borrower hits the nail on head as it describes the humorous events that occur to children's librarians crazy bosses strange coworkers and adult patrons who want the librarian to act as the parent to their children by monitoring reading choices and book selection as a story though it only partially succeeds the plot starts out convincingly enough but it seems to unravel as lucy and ian's adventures begin although it's really up to the reader to decide who kidnaps whom the plot holes surrounding a ten year old's disappearance and the lack of national and local attention are too large to be ignored","890":"the borrower is a valentine to lovers of books especially children's books and i loved that aspect of it however the plot line dealt with a pseudo kidnapping as a mother i found that so disturbing that i did something i never do i read the end to make sure it came out all right reassured i continued reading and i did enjoy it uncomfortable and implausible as it was","891":"while this book was short on editing it was long on laughs makkai tells us the story of a well intentioned children's librarian who inadvertently kidnaps a library patron attempting to run away from his religious zealot family any library lover looking for a fun fast read will enjoy","892":"i liked the premise but at times it was to didactic for me","893":"cute very quirky i really did lol a few times","894":"while it has an improbable premise i enjoyed the writing","895":"a small town librarian's favorite patron is a precocious 10 year old boy whose parents presuming that he's gay send him to an anti gay youth group ian miserable manipulates lucy into accidentally kidnapping him the results are hilarious and sadthis is a great book for anyone who was a voracious reader as a kid several chapters are written like popular kids books a choose your own adventure chapter one written like goodnight moon one written like the monster at the end of the book it is definitely a fun read","896":"i enjoyed this book immensely an original story line that had some twists and turns this is the kind of book that many people will dislike and many will love a story like this will stay with me a long time fermenting in my subconscious reminding me often to love one another and be open minded i loved the writing style of the author with her many references to beloved books and of course i loved the library librarian references","897":"i loved this one quirky main character children's librarian many references to old book friends just a delight to read one of those that carves out a place in your heart i'll be looking for the next book from this author","898":"liked it even if a bit unrealistic","899":"a children's librarian drives off with a runaway boy seeking refuge in the children's section and uses the stress of a kidnapping road trip to reevaluate her relationship with her father and her current life filled with plot relevant parodies of \"the very hungry caterpillar \" \"goodnight moon\" and other children's classics along with possible russian mobsters and their stories of defection from the ussr this should have been a fun book the problem is that parts of the book are too serious for a basic fun read and other parts are too light for a serious issue novel it felt like it should have all been light and tongue in cheek who can seriously believe that a sensible woman would risk her career and freedom by driving a runaway child around the block let alone across the country it's like the premise of a stoner movie the characterization is exaggerated enough to be a humor book too although lucy and ian's characters are developed past their initial points of \"i'm bored with my job and life\" and \"i'm miserable that my evangelical parents are trying to force me to be a heterotypical boy \" side characters like lucy's boss or her father's childhood friend are absolutely meant for laughs the head librarian is an alcoholic russians are all part of the mob and they drink beer for breakfast oh drunks even ian's mother is a caricature if we didn't think she was a bad enough mother for taking her child to sexual preference correction lessons we know she must be bad because she's anorexic hahaha a conservative christian woman doesn't worry about anything but her weight and perhaps this is where the humor starts to break down anorexia and alcoholism and even mob involvement are problems of the same magnitude as a child struggling with his identity so although ian's problem is viewed in the narration as a serious one lucy and her librarian friends make light of anorexia and alcoholism regularly and the illnesses keep the head librarian and ian's mother from being taken seriously in their scenes the head librarian doesn't think it's a problem that lucy disappears for a week oops must have forgotten about a conversation in the middle of all that vodka i would like to clarify that i can enjoy black humor i could not stop laughing while reading the hottest dishes of the tartar cuisine which had even more egregious wrongs presented humorously this type of humor is very hard to pull off however and if there were any way to ignore the double standard of problems suitable for laughing at what makes it impossible for the borrower to nail the black humor is the tremendous earnestness of the lessons of the road trip e g \"lucy you think that this is hero stuff this running around like crazy with the potatoes and this ridiculous book the problem with you is you read and you read but you don't listen to anything someone says with the mouth and you don't understand what i'm saying it was stupid this fighting what did it accomplish \" view spoiler in the end it accomplished nothing particularly pleasant on the one hand it was the ultimate satirical ending lucy who was unsure of her career as a librarian is now the spinster librarian stereotype on the other hand who really wants to finish the book with the main character \"practically a ghost\" and \"no longer central to the main plot\" hide spoiler","900":"i can kind of relate then i can't relate at all","901":"a fun and adventurous ride of a book all librarians should read this","902":"whew way way too much made of the 'themes' here reading libraries sexuality i e gay christian proselytizing yeah its all there but the story no actually the people are not interesting it is of course me but the whole escapade was just silly also must be too jaded and have lost my sense of 'adventure' according to the book's journalist reviews hmm why did i read it i love to download books from my elibrary but the pickings are sort of scarce i i download from dc nyc and brighton mi after you scroll through the bodice rippers i keep trying but ultimately when i'm not traveling and need my ereader i go back to the wait for it libraryu0026gt","903":"i stayed up half the night reading this book devouring it in only a few hours it's a madcap adventure about a librarian who ends up going with a runaway library patron i especially loved the plethora of fun children's literature references courtesy of the lucy the narrator for example a chapter called choose your own fiasco in which she lays out all possible scenarios in a choose your own adventure format ian the voracious reader and witty 10 year old son of evangelical christian parents who only want him to read hardy boys and bobbsey is one of the most delightful characters i've ever encountered in print add it some unique and hysterical peripheral characters and you have a book people will want to borrow from you this book raced along for me and the characters were incredibly memorable i was sorry to see the story end epilogue or the mortal of the story as ian might say read this book now","904":"a librarian becomes tangled in the life of a 10 year old avid reader and find herself no longer in control of a road trip very interesting hard to put down","905":"in many ways i really liked this book i liked the allusions to kids' books i loved the humor that mocked librarians being one myself i liked the unusual epilogue at the end i liked the travel sequence that being said the kidnapping scenario freaked me out a bit because it would never be acceptable in real life i cannot believe there were no repercussions i also hoped more time would be spent on lucy trying to help ian with his problem i would recommend this book but not as energetically as i wanted to","906":"wow this book took me back i fell in love with the bfg all over again and in love with the nerdy kid that used to hide under the covers at night and wish that i was anywhere but where i was it made me remember some old friends like dan and little anne and how even the saddest book in my 10 year old brain would stay with me all the way through my adulthood i would spend my whole life looking for a red fern the sign of true love i'm still looking like ian i was always different not gay but different a little nerdy i too have always looked at the back of old library books and wondered about the person who read the book long before me wondered how their lives turned out if they had their happy ending i love the idea that books can save us even in dark times we can find peace in our busy and restless souls we can get away i hope ian makes it i hope he gets his happy ending but i guess we will never know","907":"a head children's librarian without an mlis is more absurd than a head children's librarian kidnapping a ten year old patron and driving across america","908":"there was a lot in this book that didn't make sense but that didn't really take away the pleasure of it i usually have a hard time with books that feature kids but ian drake was utterly charming and i found myself like the protagonist just wanting to save him from anything that might squash his character it would have been kind of fun to have been in his head for part of the book rather than just the librarian narrator lucy in the end its a book about life's journey and how we can't change where we've come from and must learn to accept it at least that's the message i got i love rebecca makkai's writing style and the chracters she creates the book is liberally sprinkled with literary references especially from kids books which is fun my only complaint might be that i wish it had maybe been a tad shorter lucy and ian's journey starts to drag a bit and feel like the same ground is being revisited over and over but that is a small complaint the audio version of the book was well done","909":"very different and funny classic books are interwoven in the plot","910":"this book had a lot of potential but fizzled out in the end the references to children's books were fun but the tired librarian stereotype was too cliched","911":"i really enjoyed this book ian and lucy make a dynamic traveling duo both with problems of their own that they don't realize they are running away from lucy's character changes the stereotype of the librarian by being young friendly and having ties to the russian mob through her family i found homages to if you give a mouse a cookie with if you give a librarian a closet and what i believe was an homage to one monday morning on pages 218 and 219 it was nice to read a book that really gets across the importance of reading and how the right books can really change a persons life this book also shares the importance of family and real friends and how much we take them for granted until we really need them","912":"an original story with some clever lines if only the narrator hadn't been so self absorbed and short sighted it would have been a much more enjoyable read","913":"i wasn't shure i liked it much at first but it got more interesting as a mother of two small chilren who love kids books some of the side sections were amusing i was chucling at the if you give a librarian a closet bit and its nod to if you give a mouse a cookie the story was somewhat contrived but amusing","914":"i really enjoyed this book partly because it's about a librarian although she is rather listless about her profession she is passionate about the power books can have in our lives keep in mind if you decide to read this that the library profession is very liberal so this book would not be for everyone of couse what book is though some stereotyping but manageable","915":"a small town children's librarian sort of accidentally kidnaps one of her young patrons from an oppressive family situation even though i got a little frustrated with her attitude towards her job and her go with the flow reactions i was sympathetic to her situation i literally snorted when i read ms hull's description of how easy it was for the odd pair to check out books from a library in another state without a library card because it was all too true sprinkled throughout the book there are creative riffs from various classics children's books the source material from some are easy to figure out others are a little more challenging but they all made me smile a reflex for me when reading many books about books like 2010's newbery award winner when you reach me i end up getting angry at the endings of many books life of pi ender's game bel canto i'm looking at you because they frequently turn everything you've just read on its head for the sake of a dramatic ending and closure this one ends quietly and speculatively in a very soul satisfying way","916":"when i read a pre pub review for this book and saw the the main character was a children's librarian i knew that i had to read it and thankfully it lived up to my admittedly high expectations lucy seems to have a lot of common with me not just in her choice of profession but also in her love of books and her smart and sarcastic sense of humor as an extra bonus for those of us who love children's lit there are tons of picture book and chapter book references spread throughout overall i was impressed by ms makkai's first novel","917":"i loved this book probably not bc it was a truly amazing book but maybe bc it was the right book at the right time children's librarian 'borrowing' or 'being borrowed' by a child who needed saving from his family little window into ussr russia big window into the importance of books to provide escape and salvation","918":"a thoroughly charming tribute to the power of reading especially in the formative years","919":"i kept waiting for this book to get better never did not sure why there was so much hype about it","920":"wonderful book though the ending was such a cop out that i had to give it only three stars an epilogue would have put it to four stars for me one of the borrowers in the book ian was so totally adorable and unique in his description that you fall in love with him i found him to be a child character that was not simply made a stereotype or a stock character but had a real relatable personality ditto the protagonist who amusingly spent time fighting and inadvertently living up to her russian heritage i think this book is very much a story of figuring out exactly who you are and how you struggle to become your own person with the influence of family weighing on you also i would point out that i thought this might be a silly book because of the cover but don't be fooled it's a very lovely read","921":"there many things i liked about this book an extra star for the many little references and homages to great children's lit and i found it very entertaining and that mark of a good book it gave me a lot to think about and i wanted to find someone else who had read it right away in order to discuss this is always a good sign","922":"best book i've read in a long long time","923":"this book has some great moments and great lines a small town children's librarian nevermind that she doesn't have a degree gets kidnapped by kidnaps a 10 year old boy whose uber religious mother has enrolled her son in a sexuality reprogramming program their week or so on the road gets a little tedious but i enjoyed the story overall there was a nostalgia element for me too wishing for those borrower cards quite a few of my older books still had them left behind when we went to computer in 1991 they chronicled all the children who read a book in the months or years or even decades before that time but then they just stopped as if civilization had come to an abrupt end i always read the names as i reshelved and i'd discovered that certain ones popped up on hundreds of the lists allie royston for example who must have been ten years old in 1989 seemed to have read every horse book ever written another child checked out ellen tebbits six times in two years these lists catalogued the best minds of each generation the self motivated the literate the curious the insatiable pg 27 8","924":"thought this was great really witty loved all the literary references good plot","925":"i love libraries i adore children who like reading although i was a haphazard reader myself when i was young i think it is great when kids have someone to believe in them i enjoyed all those elements the beginning was oh so compelling however a few of the plot turns involved me shouting what are you doing at the book i was anxious and stressed for the main character i couldn't forgive her and it impacted my decisions it's quirky","926":"i really liked these characters but after the first 50 pages or so i became really bored and the story started to seem unrealistic i really had to struggle to finish this one","927":"all you children's library worker bees should read this one","928":"read it in one day that's how much i liked it however i could have done without those short italicized sections i didn't think they really brought anything to the story but that's probably my only criticism","929":"4 5 stars definitely a hidden gem about a young librarian with issues and her younger library patron with still more issues on an unusual road trip the heart and soul of this book belongs to 10 year old ian drake who leaps off the page and steals every scene he is in whether he is brushing his teeth ask the nearest adult if you look like a rabid dog composing a song such as states you can say without closing your mouth my favourite or washing his hair with ferret shampoo he charges through life with an enthusiasm we could all emulate i really liked the sections written as parodies of children's books but adapted to the plot whether it's madeline if you give a mouse a cookie or goodnight moon thus you get in a library in missouri that was covered was vines lived thousands of books in a hundred straight lines i would have rated it 5 stars except there was something about the basic premise that just didn't quite sit right with me i couldn't put my finger on it but somehow my disbelief was never adequately suspended ps it has a great ending","930":"one of the most compelling heart breaking hilarious insightful witty touching child like fun fantastic novels i have ever read this book is the epitome of wonderful this woman is a genius at least to me","931":"the librarian geek in me loved this book each chapter begins with a fun twist on a classic children's story related to the situation that this young librarian is going through and every librarian knows a child like ian the boy who spends way too much time in the library and has read everything more than once i highly recommend this book which does have some unexpected twists and turns and also taught me some russian history","932":"the cover gorgeous the story sounds fantastic only on pg 67 there was so much to like about the storyline but some of it didn't flesh out very well thank god the story wrapped up fairly well i really felt like the author got her groove going once they left the library i still enjoyed the story it made me think about my own religion and how natural is is to want to protect your children from outside influences i love books i can't imagine what my childhood would have been like had i been kept from certain books let alone feeling like i must reprogram my whole being to be accepted by my parents","933":"well written summer read engaging characters it's the kind of book that i had to go to the end to find out how things turned out then the author started writing about having to read the end first funny","934":"i enjoyed this book although the plot is a litte unusual a troubled ten year old boy kidnaps a helpful mild mannered librarian and they go on a cross country adventure is search of themselves the book is full of unusual characters the russian mafia father the theater loving landlord and the constantly drunk head librarian the best parts of this book are the references to children's literature though i am sure i missed many of them at times i found myself rolling with laughter at some of the creative references i also liked the theme of how we borrow from books sometimes to the point of stretching the truth to make it through our lives stay sane and that some people borrow more heavily than others made me question the first person narrator however how much did she borrow in telling her fantastic unusual story what should we believe","935":"coming from a town the size of a wheat penny books and the library were my own out my escape my salvation from what i perceived as the smallness of where i lived books grew my imagination with ideas until i felt i might burst through the town limit signs so i am a little biased toward a book in which an intelligent maybe too sharp for his own good little boy is kidnapped by the children's librarian from the public library the kid ian is saddled with parents who enroll him in de gaying classes and forbid books that don't have the breath of god in them harry potter and anything by lois lowry are particular no nos the librarian slips ian books and booklists and eventual borrows him for an extended road trip to rescue him from his situation and misery the kidnapper and the kidnapped both learn something about themselves and the world along the way i believe that books might save ian because i knew they had so far and because i knew the people books had saved they were college professors and actors and scientists and poets their names were enshrined on the pink cards in the pockets of all the forgotten hardbacks in every library basement in america the writing in the final chapters is wonderfully poetic and heart warming","936":" the is the second quirky book i have read in a row some of this book i liked a lot all the references to children's books and the wonder they provide to a child and the comfort of the library setting for this young boy felt very real but as a parent their whole travel escapade was just too disconcerting for me to read without squirming how could this so called responsible adult make such a decision no matter what she percieved to be the child's situation too unreal for me to appreciate the story from then on and then no real consequences in the end i was disappointed","937":"this story was about a librarian that 'kidnaps' one of the library's young readers is she a kidnapper because she helps out the boy who is running away anyway or is she just looking out for him while he does this temporary runaway thing it was different and though it got a little slow in some parts it held my attention for the most part","938":"parts of this book are really laugh out loud funny and both main characters are endearing it has been quite a while since i have read adult lit and i know why at times it was somewhat heavy on the intellectualism but all in all it was a good read but i think i will return to reading ya soon","939":" i loved this book it was well written funny and entertaining very pleasurable to read it wasn't perfect there are clearly some tricky ethical questions raised by lucy's passive and active choices which got in the way of her being a fully sympathetic character maybe the point but if so it didn't work for me the ethical choice that i found most hard to swallow was not just the trip itself though that was certainly a big one but the fact that lucy put a 10 year old in the position where he would have to lie to everyone around him in order to protect her i would have preferred an ending in which she came clean and faced the consequences however i made the decision to ignore those tricky ethical questions so i could just enjoy the book and it wasn't until the end that i understood what this novel was really about the profound ability of books to change and save lives as someone who survived childhood through reading i found lucy's final gift to ian to be immensely beautiful and it left me in tears","940":"can anybody really be as clueless as the librarian in this book she claims that she was kidnapped by her 10 year old patron really sure his family was kind of kooky but to take off in a car with a kid and cross so many state lines because one feels sorry for someone is nuts i don't care how anyone spins it in real life what lucy did is a crime and she would be convicted and have to register as a preditor in her community despite my dislike for the characters in this book i did find all the allusions to books funny i giggled when i read if you give a librarian a closet the goodnight moon reference was cute it wasn't as blatant with the hungry caterpillar at first but it was clever she also referenced the monster at the end of the book","941":"my mom says her proudest moment when i was young was also mine it was when i got my adult library card i had to write a letter to the library director asking special permission because i was nine and had read all the books in the children's department and i was dying to check out books from upstairs but you needed to be 12 so permission was granted and on that day i showed my shiny new library card to everyone i saw strangers heard about how i had to ask permission but now i could check out whatever books i wanted and i did my mom never really monitored my reading probably because my grandfather monitored hers so closely so when eleven year old shana wanted to read every book ever written about rasputin she just shrugged she was just happy i loved to read so much i tell you this so you understand i am biased when i say i loved the borrowers by rebecca makkai anyone who grew up in libraries or with their nose in a book would lucy the book's narrator works in the childrens' department of the library in hannibal missouri she loves books and she clearly loves kids who love books her favorite kid is ian who she ends up accidentally kidnapping there is a lot more to the story and so many lovely bits of writing the book felt a bit like a love letter to libraries there was a paragraph about old school borrower cards that almost made me weep seriously i loved this book toward the end of the book lucy said i do still believe that books can save you me too","942":"i had a few credibility issues in the middle but overall enjoyed this very much detailed comments with possible spoilers on my blog at a just recompense","943":"genre literary fictionpublication date 2011geographical setting hannibal missouri road trip across u s time period contemporarythree words or phrases best describing this book introspective flawed characters children's literature referencesplot summary for children's librarian lucy hull one of the few joys in her humdrum life in hannibal missouri is selecting books for her favorite patron 10 year old ian drake ian's mother only wants him to read books with \"the breath of god\" in them hoping they'll supplement his weekly anti gay classes to keep him on a \"good \" christian path but he wants to know more of the world and the books lucy sneaks him are only good for so much so when lucy finds him camped out in the library early one morning preparing to run away she becomes not quite a kidnapper not quite kidnapped and the two set off on a road trip of self discovery turns out that even though she sees it as a way to try to save ian lucy might have more to come to terms with regarding her own family and where she comes from than she knew appeal characteristics character centered conversational family centered issue oriented poignant quirky some resolution but open ended thoughtful unhurriedpersonal notes there were many elements of this book i enjoyed but it was hard to get over the fact that i didn't find lucy particularly likeable whether choosing her career carrying on relationships with her coworkers and boyfriend or navigating her adventure with ian she seems to simply let life happen around her without making any sort of choice or personal investment this might have been more forgivable if i didn't feel like she thought she was superior to everyone and everything around her at the same time it was hard to feel sorry for her for getting into a difficult situation and not knowing how to get out since i couldn't get over how stupid and selfish she was at times that said i loved all of the literary references and allusions to children's books throughout you could see makkai's love of those books and of libraries shining through - which is something i always appreciate and once i got over lucy's choices the story unfolded in ways that ranged from entertaining to poignant i'm glad i read it i just don't think i'll be picking it up again","944":"a book for book lovers i'm a big fan of children's literature so this book turned out to be right up my alley funny since it wasn't recommended to me or anything it was just sitting on my library's new books shelf and i happened to pick it up this book is about a 26 year old childrens' librarian lucy working in a small missouri library she forms a relationship with a 10 year old boy named ian who devours books like candy unfortunately ian has an overbearing evangelical mother who does not want ian to read anything with questionable content wizards roald dahl adult content lois lowry etc which as we all know includes pretty much all of the best childrens' books lucy is slightly horrified and contrives ways to sneak the good books to ian so that he can read them without his mother finding out to make matters more complicated lucy and other librarians suspect that ian is very likely to be gay even though he's only ten which is confirmed when lucy finds out that ian's mother has been sending him to classes with ex gay pastor bob these evangelical christian classes are aimed to steer young boys into more straight paths when they show signs of being otherwise lucy is disturbed by this since these ex gay super christian groups tend to only confuse young adults even more and make them feel terrible about themselves then one day lucy opens up the childrens' room to find that ian has run away from home and spent the night in the library she insists on driving him home but he keeps giving her wrong directions and she feels less and less eager to return him to a home where he will grow up intellectually stifled and morally shamed so when he suggests they go visit his grandmother lucy relents and they leave town so a runaway bookworm and a conflicted librarian head off on a whirlwind roadtrip lucy knows that she has probably ruined her life since she will be viewed as a kidnapper when they are ultimately caught but she no longer cares i thoroughly enjoyed this book i charged right through this book anxious that the two runaways were going to get caught at any moment it's been a while since i've devoured a book so fast it included several topics that i have great interest in childrens' books the the rights of children to read everything lgbt rights and nutcase right wing christians the childrens' book part was probably the most fun i love books that reference other books that i know and love sometimes the references were indirect like mentioning a character or a line where's papa going with that axe instead of the actual title itself reading this book was a little bit like a treasure hunt finding all the little tidbits of favorite books the characters were also great lucy had good voice as the narrator and ian was believable as well sometimes kids in books don't act like real kids it would have been easy to paint ian as a perfect cool kid who happens to be gay and a bookworm but he's not although he is very smart and imaginative he's also a brat sometimes he's a bit self centered as kids often are which is obvious when he essentially tricks an adult woman into driving him whereever he wants for his own enjoyment without thought of ruining her life so yes read this book","945":"i think its best to start by saying this book will not be for everyone it often deals with very polarizing subjects the biggest sticking point for me was the main character i felt towards the end of the book she often fell flat i realize that she is a librarian but it almost seemed the way she was portrayed was too stereotypical the secondary characters were very strong and create a nice balance the book is peppered with smart humor and jokes i really felt the book resolved too easily and quickly with very little conflict even with all of its minor faults i still thoroughly enjoyed the book and would recommend it to others","946":"i loved this book i read the first half slowly then sped through the second half so i could figure out how it ended i then went back and reread the book to savor every page the characters of lucy and ian were a delight i loved the style of the writing and the incorporation of my favorite children's books into the narrative this is sure to be one of my favorite books this year","947":"2 5 stars it didn't change my life but it was cute i enjoyed the reading experience the place where i thought it faltered was that it should have been a story about both the librarian and the boy and in the end it was really about the woman it was too much about her own life and an escape type thriller when it could have been an amazing buddy story or a great coming of age story it did play on my heartstrings in that i would have died to have someone close who cared about me when i was younger connect with me on the thing that i loved most in the world reading","948":"someone on fiction_l raved about this book it was fine but doesn't get a rave from me young woman works in children's department of a small library and befriends a very bright ten year old boy his parents have specific things they don't want him to read and she and the boy conspire together to circumvent the parents' wishes then she and the boy take off on an unsanctioned cross country trip okay it's not badly written but the more i think about it the more annoyed i am with the concept that this young woman is able to ignore the wishes of the parents i totally disagree with the parents' beliefs religious ideas etc but she wasin the wrong","949":"a charming story of a children's librarian and a young gay boy who run away in a sort of mutual kidnapping the reader must without question be able to suspend disbelief because this is not the sort of thing that could happen in reality the way it does here if the reader can do that however and if the reader can get into the spirit of children's literature where anything might really happen and enjoy the tale for its pure entertainment value then this becomes a humorous and thought provoking modern fairy tale which will keep you reading all the way through i found myself laughing out loud more than once certainly something i did not expect from a book where the librarian seemingly steals a child in fact the premise almost stopped me from reading it at all there are moral and ethical questions to ponder but they are almost secondary to the characters of lucy and ian and the story itself the little references and takes on beloved children's books alone are worth the price of admission so to speak i thoroughly enjoyed this one","950":"it was not a good read for me i invested time u0026amp read far enough into the book that i hated to stop but could have easily since i really didn't care how the book ended i was entertained by the sections of the book that were spoofs on childrens books the hungry caterpillar goodnight moon laura numeroff's if you give a ____ a _____ books etc","951":"i thought this book was a charming story although i will admit the second half of the book gets really slow the book is about lucy and ian a librarian and her young borrower lucy likes ian and she worries he is being brainwashed because his homophobic parents have put him in a class to try to stop his tendencies they also try to control his reading when ian runs away from home lucy becomes his unwitting accomplice and the book becomes a question of who is kidnapping whom worth reading the borrower is a great debut novel","952":"this was a fun book the childrens' librarian kidnaps a favorite young patron of her library i loved the way the story unravels the background on both characters especially the problems the boy is having at home the author constantly references famous childrens books so anyone who is was an avid reader as a child will get a lot of the humor in this story this is a great book for anyone who loved to read as a child","953":"very engaging book librarians what do you think","954":"i really wanted to like this book more the premise for some reason made me more anxious than engaged","955":"a great book memorable perhaps not quite five stars but more than four the point of view character is interesting quirky insightful even when her insight is that she has failed to understand important things i felt both good and bad for her simultaneously","956":"oh i love this book already angela mark it to read girl well she definitely was way too self blaming in the middle it got tedious but overall a quick and delightful read particularly for people who loved books and libraries as children","957":"just couldn't get past the fact that she was a librarian without an mls and asked her neighbor for advice on books for questioning kids","958":"lately i seem to be having a horrible time picking books in reading other reviews i was starting to feel like i was the only one that found the adult librarian acting more as a clueless teenager than an adult i am not finished yet but there is something that is not sitting well so far","959":"in the borrower lucy a 26 year old children's librarian and ian her favorite 10 year old library patron set off on an ill conceived cross country drive--is it running away or kidnapping --to escape ian's restrictive parents at times funny and at others reflective rebecca makkai's first novel is always a story about loving books makkai injects allusions to kids' books throughout with funny interruptions in the style of margaret wise brown a choose your own adventure story and others i loved its wit and off kilter characters the only aspects of the book that i disliked were the tangential rants about the dangers of evangelical parenting and pastoring granted ian's parents didn't sound like parents i'd want for my own but no evidence was offered in the story to indicate that they were horrible parents either and secondly pastor bob to whom ian is sent to have the gay taught out of him sounded more like a corny snake oil salesman and not really the sort of man worthy of the soap boxy attention he received in the book to end on a positive note however i must say that this book used an allusion to charlotte's web to such brilliant effect a paraphrase where's pa going with that axe in the opening chapter that i knew it would be a book i could adore","960":"i had to pick up this book as any good lover of the mixed up files of mrs basil e frankweiler it's a twist on the plot with the librarian running away with the kid or the kid kidnapping the librarian as they runaway from their small town the plot is great and short pieces related to kids books were a nice touch but i think the book was about 100 pages too long also the protagonist has far too many things around her that serve as get out of jail cards throughout the story","961":"anyone who loves books especially books from his her childhood will love this book i just adore the line i do still believe that books can save you p 320 if you feel the same way i feel sure you'll love this book","962":"i'm giving the book two stars because i felt like it had potential i liked the characters i liked the idea but the book sort of gave out about 100 150 pages in and never really recovered","963":"i really liked this book the borrower is laugh out loud funny although it deals with some serious topics the characters are instantly engaging and relatable the plot a reverse kidnapping is a little bizarre but it works and i liked it a lot the one fault i think is the ending which was unsatisfying to me because it didn't provide enough change for the characters","964":"the main character was hard to like","965":"this is the story of lucy a children's librarian from hannibal missouri who befriends a quirky young boy named ian whose overly religious mother tries to limit what he can read lucy helps ian read forbidden books and worries when she thinks his mother might be sending him to anti gay classes ian eventually runs away from home and lucy and he wind up on an unlikely cross country adventure that makes it look as if she has kidnapped him i really like the characters in this book but i did have a hard time swallowing how lucy accidentally takes off with ian instead of just taking him home if you can get past that though it's kind of a fun sweet story","966":"an absolute delight this new author weaves childrens book themes into her rich story line with such delicate ease and humor i'll remember this book as one that left me thinking","967":"children's library clerk as main character she connects with a young patron and tries to save him from his conservative parents after he runs away the journey they take seemed ultimately hokey and unrealistic to me and bogged down the plot a little the russian immigrant father is one of the best characters the questioning of the stories we tell ourselves and often accept as truth was an interesting theme i just wish i had actually felt something for the librarian and the kid","968":"i really liked the idea of this book a missouri children's librarian and her adventure i enjoyed parts of the book but as a whole it is not one that i would recommend","969":"i would have to hands down say that this was probably one of the most delightful books i've read in a long time part fantasy fairy tale reality mystery all rolled into one easy reading quite enjoyed it","970":"i actually think this book is probably worthy of four stars to some people but for some reason i could not connect to the author's voice and sense of humor it is well written and has a good story particularly to people who love libraries and books","971":"the borrower is about an accidental children's librarian who accidentally kidnaps her favorite patron at 10 year old boy with a mother who censors his reading and who sends him to a christian camp to try to keep him for being gay she takes him on a long drive across the country starting in hannibal missouri there are things i liked about this book and things i did not i like ian the boy he is a delightful child one i would enjoy meeting in real life there is a plot twist toward the end involving a man who has been tailing them that amused me the conversations between lucy the librarian and ian are often interesting and creative i enjoyed the many literary references that are scattered throughout the book however the book also contains many negative librarian stereotypes aside from lucy the accidental librarian the other real librarians are happy to help censor reading material and have no problem violating patron confidentiality lucy notes that the two other women in the children's department seemed to see the library as some kind of volunteer work like a soup kitchen the library director is a drunk lucy refers to herself as a simple maiden lady librarian i have to assume either the author has never met a real librarian or has met just one whom she did not like i recommend the later chapters set outside the library i do not recommend the early chapters set inside the library i had considered choosing this book for my book club but i won't be","972":"i'm torn and perhaps would give this three and a half stars if i could sometimes i enjoyed this book a lot it had its moments i was comfortable with the writer's style and entertained by her sense of sarcasm but there were many times where i was almost literally shaking my head at the ridiculousness and absurdity of what was going on feeling things were far too exaggerated and extreme to have had any reasonable chance of actually happening i just can't believe the main character could have gotten away with what she's able to walk away from and the ending was too neat and tidy and too much of a fairy tale type ending to suit me but it's a compelling read and one really does want to know what happens even if much of it is totally unbelievable a few lines i liked you think you can't go home again it's the only place you can ever go one reason you can't change who you are is that you can't change where you're from when we have false assumptions about the world we make the wrong decisions","973":"there are lots of things to love about this book though i didn't always connect with the narrator as a library worker i completely understood the feeling of seeing a bright young reader stifled by bad parenting and i enjoyed the fantasy of getting to take the child away from it all for a little while i will definitely be on the look out for makkai's next work","974":"lucy hull is a 26 year old children's librarian in a public library in hannibal missouri one of her favorite patrons is 10 year old ian drake ian loves the library and uses it and reading as his happy escape place from a domineering mother lucy becomes concerned because not only does ian's mother severely restrict his allowed reading she forces him to attend pastor bob's anitgay bible camp one day lucy opens the library to find that ian had run away and spent the night thus starts a multiple state journey full of lies as lucy tries to save ian being a retired children's librarian i enjoyed references to from many children's books i also enjoyed the parallel story of lucy's father and his journey and lies leaving russia","975":"i loved this book and i really hadn't intended to waterstones dropped the '3 for 2' deal last year which was unsettling for someone who likes routine as much as i do in its place they have the 'buy one get one half price' deal instead and an even odder thing called their monthly book club which describes a group of books that they think you'll love or you can get your money back that's right you apparently get paid to not like a book and this one looked a bit like the life of charlie st cloud which may not be what that book is actually called the cover even seemed similar and i thought that the latter was pretty dull it remains one of the few books i have ever given away after reading back to the borrower i will not be able to successfully claim a refund on this because i will be keeping it and probably rereading it before too long the story is narrated by lucy who is quick to point out that she is not the true hero of her own story that role belongs to ian still the details are shady since lucy knows she has to cover her tracks because of what happened in hannibal although hannibal is not the real name of the town where it all started lucy is a recent ish graduate who has floated into a job as a children's librarian because she studied english and couldn't think of anything else to do as a recent ish graduate who studied english i was ready to identify with her but lucy does not immediately invite sympathy her favourite patron is young ian a ten year old who comes into the library every day and reads whatever he can get his hands on every adult who ever meets ian always remarks that kid is going to be gay when he grows up unfortunately ian's parents are fundamentalist christians for my full review http www girlwithherheadinabook blo","976":"really enjoyed this lots of books libraries and reading","977":"couldn't really stand the narrator main character but still wanted to see how the story turned out","978":"cute quirky book written specifically for it seems young female library staff hey i'm not going to argue with that","979":"i chose this book as the subject matter for a school assignment on librarians in popular culture truth be told i was tickled pink at the prospect of reading a fiction book again after several months of textbooks i loved the plot description a young idealistic librarian named lucy attempts to assist a precocious 10 year old patron ian in checking out books mostly classic children's literature that his mother disapproves of i might have been less excited by this storyline if i actually had children of my own and worried about people in positions of authority corrupting their young minds maybe not with judy blume though... however the whole premise of the novel certainly opens up a can of ethical worms hee hee ethical worms what surprised me about this book is that despite my initial support of the main character's decision to rescue the child from the oppressive influence of his parents and the insidious pastor bob i ended up feeling strongly against both the librarian and her actions i can understand the motivations behind them but i also feel that she was using the situation to escape from her own feelings of guilt and dissatisfaction with her own life and who's the adult in the situation anyway if some child tried to manipulate me into whisking them away on an impromptu cross country road trip that dream would be squashed faster than a hapless bystander in a godzilla film i'd rather pick up a possibly rabid wounded raccoon in my car than play taxi cab to a child who may or may not attempt to blackmail me with false accusations in the future granted ian was pretty endearing as far as wayward children go but that's not a gamble i'm game for of minor irritation in the story were the number of situations that would or should not occur in a real library i know i know this is like watching a crime drama on tv with a police officer who feels the need to point out every discrepancy but really when you're passionate about what you do how can you help yourself the references to various children's books throughout the novel were fun and i can't say that i didn't enjoy listening to the story i also felt that the ending was thoroughly satisfying if a little contrived","980":"a very nice read a must read for librarians i think i like it because of the storyline because of the way it is told because it contains a sense of humour and because it is neatly wrapped up in the end i would not mind reading a sequel it is about a librarian lucy working and living in the little town of hannibal missouri don't look it up it doesn't exist she is overqualified for her work with her english degree but this was the first job opportunity that came along and i presume she had no clue what to do no goal no dream so hey why not this job it is not a job she particularly likes her manager she dislikes she lives in a tiny apartment for a little rent but is not allowed to flush the toilet in the evenings because of the theatre she lives above but there is ian a 10 year old boy witty and eager to read whatever he can get his hands on if it weren't for his strict religious parents lucy receives strict instructions about what ian is and isn't allowed to read and ian's nanny comes along to the library to supervise then one day ian runs away from home lucy and ian take off on a road trip both being kidnapped and kidnapper the road trip is a wonderful story on it's own though at one point it looks a bit like a slapstick comedy too many coincidences well not too many in my taste i really liked it lucy is the one who tells the story kind of looking back on it in between are some pages that relate about the librarian and the boy just some tiny intermezzo's the borrower is the perfect title for this book","981":"a novel for anyone who grew up as an eager reader passionate about roald dahl and a wrinkle in time and the wizard of oz series and also for those who just want a smart witty humane adventure that ingeniously knits together a librarian a ten year old boy fleeing parents who have enrolled him in anti homosexuality classes they suspect he may have tendencies russian criminals and emigres and a wild cross country road trip with delicious echoes of nabokov's lolita makkai writes in a number of registers and styles in the borrower always to best effect i marveled at her virtuosity i gobbled this up scowling at interrupters","982":"it was alright","983":"this was a quick and easy read but it did have its shortcomings the premise was pretty implausible and if you go into the story with some suspension of disbelief you will be better off twenty six year old children's librarian lucy kidnaps 10 year old ian after he runs away from home what initially is going to be her driving ian home ends up as a cross country road trip what bumps this to 3 stars is the fact that it did make me laugh out loud at one point so that calls for bonus points and i did enjoy the little literary references strewn throughout the book","984":"loved it i know it's a sin but i couldn't help picturing the inevitable film that will be made based on this book i just hope it's an indie film because i know a big studio will fu0026amp k it up reading this book i kept thinking how in the world is the author going to wrap this up or more importantly how in the world is the author going to wrap this up to my satisfaction after the ending of the last book i read my name is memory my unsatisfying endings wound is a bit fresh loved the book loved the message loved the characters i wanted to stay in that world a little longer but the story was wrapped up neatly and to my satisfaction so i don't expect a sequel","985":"this is a wonderful story told from the viewpoint of lucy a children's librarian whose favorite young patron ten year old ian has run away from home to the library ian is a precocious boy who is an avid reader but his mother keeps a tight rein on what he can check out of the library going so far as to give lucy a list of topics and authors \"she'd like him to avoid \" ian shows up with the occasional bruise and his mom has him enrolled in an anti gay class led by controversial pastor bob all of which have lucy worried about him when she discovers ian early one morning hiding in the library she plans to take him home but as they near his home ian convinces her to continue past to his grandmother's house that is the beginning of a cross country road trip that stretches from hannibal mo to chicago to pittsburgh to vermont and nearly into canada it's not clear who is kidnapped and who is the kidnapper it is an adventure and you're never sure what will happen next or how it will end but what makes it \"wonderful\" is the engaging writing style of the author i can't even explain what she does but it is just fun to read","986":"a light clever read i was in turns delighted and irritated by her depiction of librarians","987":"sdmb recco ulf the unwashed","988":"my friend suggested i read the borrower because i love books and he was spot on this book drops dozens of references to other books especially children's literature in an endless stream of inside joke humor and i loved it because i get the references yes i've read from the mixed up files of mrs basil e frankweiler got that reference and of course i've read goodnight moon loved the chapter based on that book not to mention middlesex if you give a mouse a cookie and the wizard of oz i got many or most of the esoteric references and felt like i was in the in crowd of nerds of course how can you not love a book that makes you feel so cool the demographics plot small town librarian escapes confused and dreary life as she embarks on cross country journey with 10 year old library patron characters lucy the librarian actually she's a librarian by trade but not by education and ian precocious kid who is infatuated with books i've read many reviews of the book and there are a lot of librarians and just regular folk out there who are really offended by some aspects of the book 1 our twenty six year old hero lucy works in a library but does not have a degree or certificate in library science she makes many bad decisions as she embarks on her adventure and this gives librarians a bad name boo 2 there are a few negative references to anorexic people 3 view spoiler an apparent kidnapping is apparently upsetting to some people but really if this upsets you is it any worse than lord voldemort's numerous attempts to kill harry potter how about the treatment of children in the hunger games this librarian's intentions were well wrought and i really mean wrought with sweat and worry treat this story as a mild fantasy hide spoiler to these complaints i say don't be so literal our hero lucy is clearly confused she's young idealistic inexperienced and carries a lot of baggage the good thing about lucy is that she shares all of her twisted logic and misgivings with us really are any of us that perfect that every decision we make is the exactly right decision so what if she decides to take little ian for a ride across state lines she wasn't sure if he was being abused at home or if he was just weird or both most of us would just contact the dept of children's services but hey lucy is immature and impulsive instead she decides to take him to chicago people haven't you ever felt like you just want to run away surely you were in your twenties at some point in your life even though many aspects of this story seem fantastic the reflective musings of lucy ring true to life she agonizes over her decisions is paranoid when she thinks she's being followed worried about what's going to happen confused about her purpose in life haven't we all done that anyway she's a lot nicer than you know who i enjoyed her voice and her thoughts i loved the people in this story this book was chock full of fun and interesting characters my favorites being all the russians and tim the theater guy we went to many small towns and even hit the big city of chicago i had so many big smile moments as i read this book that i had to stop and read excerpts to my 13 year old son also a book lover entertaining and nerdy if that's what you're looking for you'll love the borrower","989":"okay fellow librarians this one is for you not only does this author do us justice she makes us laugh and cry and brings to life kids that we have all known and cared for a must read","990":"utterly delightful and whimsical not in the least bit plausible but that's okay love the trip down memory lane of children's books and it means a whole lot more now that i'm a teacher we need more kids like ian","991":"a bit strange but i did finish it maybe because it was quirky and i was interested in the library setting","992":"i loved this book enchanting tale of a librarian a child who loves to read and their amazing road trip don't pass this one up","993":"i really waffled back and forth on this book my experience might have been a bit different i think if i had read it instead of listening to the audio version i think the reader who sounded just like lea michelle from glee annoyed me enough that i tied her too closely to the main character lucy to remain objective still i found lucy to be obnoxious and i'm thinking i would've been annoyed by the things she says and does regardless of a narrator's voice essentially i think there are a couple of different stories going on here the story about lucy herself and her background and where she comes from and how she comes to know herself is one and it's the one i found most interesting the story of lucy's friendship with ian and their subsequent adventure is okay it's a lot more telling than showing and it requires that you ignore some pretty big plot holes and implausible choices there's also some really clever story parodies going on and a lot about books and how books can save you as well as the day to day type stuff that takes place in a library and all of those things were good it's just that those three parts didn't really come together evenly for me and that's ultimately what impacted my opinion of this book","994":"this sounded like it could have been a great book could have been but was not in a nutshell lucy hull is the 26 year old head children's librarian at hannibal mo's public library she's got a favorite patron ian drake whose parents are quite restrictive when it comes to his borrowing choices predictably lucy sneaks the contraband books to ian then one day ian becomes more than a patron he runs away to the library and with lucy embarks on a 10 day road trip this sounded promising when i read the blurb on the dust jacket in truth this novel is not so great i'm not sure that the author actually knows any librarians no librarian would ever do what lucy does as i said this could have been good but it was not","995":"interesting story dragged at times","996":"after the long week of scoring ap essays i can usually barely get my eyes to focus on the page let alone read for pleasure but i had started rebecca makkai's the borrower while my students were testing on the last day of finals and i couldn't wait to get back to it it is a literary kidnapping novel lucy hull a 26 year old librarian takes ian drake 10 year old book craving library patron on a spontaneous road trip when he runs away from home and she finds him hiding in the library the writing is clever the references to beloved children's literature are plentiful the story is sweet and it can't be the best book i read this summer already but i have a feeling it might be","997":"well i read it all that's a start and sometimes i try to read a book before i read the reviews just to give it a chance and based on one person's recommendation and my book club's reading list i downloaded the book dang you e reader for making me neglect actual physical books and i read it what i liked all the references and connections to children's literature books i know as a second grade teacher heck i know the title and the author something i'm not even good at with my favorite books i also liked how lucy the antagonist cared about the boy in the story but you know it got weird i was warned the history and twists were good well i wish that the actual plot was a little more complicated like lucy's history i mean if you can fabricate all of that background bring some to the foreground too i found myself wanting to learn more about lucy's dad and less about lucy librarians should not kidnap little boys whether she gets away with it or not i guess that is something i shouldn't reveal here and that's the end of my review kinda leaves you hanging right","998":"i loved this book","999":"liked the humor i was disturbed by the slow action on the part of the librarian to resolve the kidnapping","1000":"a delightful story about a children's libraian who kidnaps and is kidnapped by a 10 year old boy that she's been sneaking books to against his parents wishes along their adventure she learns about herself and her family i like how it referenced books and the ten year old is quirky and fun i also like the story because it really wouldn't happen in real life","1001":"from boston book bums http bostonbookbums com s rebecca fun read with some entertaining vermont scenes in the later half of the book","1002":"i believed that books might save him because i knew they had so far and because i knew the people books had saved they were college professors and actors and scientists and poets they got to college and sat on dorm floors drinking coffee amazed they'd finally found their soul mates they always dressed a little out of season ~ the borrower by rebecca makkaii had a humble beginning with this book a calm day in a library where i picked up this book another book that looked chicken soup esque but fiction and a book about things giants' fans had to do or learn before they died the other two lost their luster quick and i kept this one it held constant references to classic children's and young adult literature the narrator was in purely professional terms freakin' hilarious and the prose held a simple premise i finished it with a gasp the gasp didn't come from suspense but rather optimism not a happy ending either pay attention but optimism for the better nature of all of us oh and yeah the story did that without preaching to me one of my favorites","1003":"lucy hull a 26 year old children's librarian working in hannibal mo is mild mannered efficient and cares about her patrons especially 10 year old ian drake he loves reading loves the library and checks out books every day ian's mother is domineering critical and places restrictions on ian's reading material sensing her son may have gay tendencies she enrolls him in pastor bob's anti gay classes at church lucy is outraged yet feels she can't do too much except be a friend to ian but one early morning lucy finds ian camped out in the library obviously having run away from home and found refuge in the children's stacks lucy knowing that ian's parents will be worried sick encourages ian to contact them but he has other ideas in mind he blackmails lucy into taking on a cross country trip to find his 'grandmother' lucy and ian set out from hannibal and make their way to vermont with lots of crazy characters comical mishaps and creative stories encountered along the way just to name a few a former kgb agent following them a sacred finger a lonely boyfriend and a growing list of suspicious relatives and friends that think lucy may have lost her mind there are lots and lots of literary references in the pages of this book and numerous library terms which apply to the description of child librarian the borrower is both humorous and melancholy and holds within its pages lots of food for thought","1004":"what a great book this was such a treat to read it kept me engaged the entire way through you may find some of the actions of the main character to be over the top but i really liked her and thought she was very well developed read this book","1005":"for the majority of this book i was annoyed for one thing it's pretty much impossible to accept the premise which is that the narrator a children's librarian allows herself to be kidnapped by a ten year old boy and then goes on an improvised road trip with him all in the name of saving him from his fundamentalist mother and the anti gay classes the mother is forcing him to take in the real world anyone who did that and thought it would be a good idea would clearly be insane so the suspension of disbelief we're asked to have is of a pretty high level and wow does lucy the librarian narrator protagonist make some poor choices on the road with the boy including in one particularly excruciating scene for me allowing him to panhandle in order to get them more money since she can't use her credit card and leave a trail yet i kept reading the book is very well written and the plot though completely unrealistic is quite compelling we learn in the very first chapter that the protagonist isn't going to end up in jail that somehow she's going to get away with all of this and that alone made me keep reading wondering how in the world she was going to pull it off to say that the ending packed an emotional wallop is an understatement lucy does pull it off and so therefore does author rebecca makkai despite my annoyance during so much of it the ending was completely wonderfully almost magically worth the trip just make sure you have kleenex handy when you're getting there","1006":"i just didn't like it how on earth a woman can be manipulated by a 10 yr old whatever his problems into driving aimlessly across the country is beyond me but then nothing happens lucy is spineless ian is annoying and the only sparkle in the story once it gets going although the impression of plot movement here is misleading is when the author inserts her literary rewrites of her predicament the uproar about its negative take on christianity is ridiculous and if you don't care for it close the book honestly all that whingeing","1007":"i really loved this book and would highly recommend it to anyone who loves reading and believes that books can save people","1008":"kate you will love this book","1009":"a really good book although i think a bit of it went over my head and i was a little too eager to find out how the author was going to get out of the whole situation to slow down and figure it out paradoxically i can't decide if this is supposed to be an adult or a ya title i enjoyed reading it but i'm not really sure what to think of it it got me thinking but i'm still not sure how it all ties together her russian history the road trip pastor bob the friendship with rocky and the actors at the theater where she lives i think it was an excellent title though the borrower would recommmend","1010":"i loved this subversive novel about a children's librarian who kind of sort of accidentally runs away with a 10 year old patron who she admires and she strongly suspects is being abused at home after she discovers him hiding out in the youth department one late evening the precocious boy pretty much kidnaps librarian lucy and they take off on a weird funny sad road trip - and you keep thinking as does lucy how is she not going to prison and she is such a wonderful librarian edgy but also sweet and moving dealing with issues of religion parenting and gender identity","1011":"i really loved this book in the early stages ian is a thoroughly amusing kid and lucy is a typical jaded librarian the entire concept of the boy kidnapping the librarian is fun and the mechanics of the kidnapping work well but to me it's all downhill from there lucy morphs into this ridiculous irresponsible completely unlikeable person ian morphs into the most demanding annoying no longer precocious child in the history of fiction i just wanted to bash their heads together the only bright spot in the remainder of their irritating journey was their visit to lucy's father a russian immigrant who may or may not be involved in the russian mafia and who is absolutely hilarious i was really disappointed that a book with such a strong start and great concept would ultimately be a hard to finish book but unlikeable characters just do that for me if only they stayed as likeable as they started","1012":"there are things i liked about this book and things that i really didn't namely i hated the fact that lucy hates her job as a children's librarian who loves her job it was kind of hard to read about someone who didn't like it but whatever the eithics discussion was interesting and i really liked the occasional style references to children's books like the very hungry caterpillar and goodnight moon","1013":"i will ditto with another reviewer said ian a little boy from a fundamentalist christian family loves the library but has a mother who censors his reading the librarian suspects the boy is gay and abused so decides to kidnap him at the boy's request improbable sure but i can fall into the story well if it had been better written i could have fallen into the story lucy the librarian is a horrible combination of self righteous judgmental and kinda stupid she abdicates all her responsibility to this little kid - everything is his decision and therefore his fault pastor bob runs a program to teach gay little boys to be straight we don't really learn much about pastor bob except that he and president bush are evil people we also learn very little about ian's parents and there is no empathy for them the characters are all stereotypes with little depth i did enjoy some of the stories about lucy's russian family and i liked the bit at the end about the importance of books other than that this book was a bust for me sure there were lessons learned in the end but not done well enough to make it worth slogging through the story the whole thing felt very preachy to me and i don't enjoy that no matter what side of the issues the preacher supports","1014":"a librarian is kidnapped by one of her young charges or is it the other way around and forced into going on an enlightening road trip","1015":"if you would like to read the book about a librarian you need to read the giant's house by elizabeth mccracken it is a moving funny sarcastic glorious novel about a 1950's small town new england librarian who falls in love with an eleven year old boy who keeps growing and growing and growing theirs is a singular relationship to say the least i am crazy about this novel it is a wondrous story skillfully told by a talented writer a gem now there is a new librarian novel in town called the borrower by rebecca makkai but like all pretenders to the throne it makes promises it cannot keep makkai brings on the quirk with a powerful book loving bond between a children's librarian lucy who dreams of making a difference and a ten year old boy ian the boy's evangelical parents remember the rules say evangelical always equals bad have enrolled him in an anti gay program lucy takes that as a sign he is from an abusive home and needs saving the result lucy kidnaps ian really the one saving grace for me in the borrower were all the fun literary references they do reward the well read ultimately though the quirky turns to creepy makkai isn't able to whip up the prerequisite amount of charm needed to make the jump from the friendship of two lonely book lovers to a pg rated thelma and louise road trip believable enough to work i can't help feeling that if lucy had been a high school aged babysitter instead of an adult librarian the borrower might have turned out a whole more rewarding not to mention convincing","1016":"this one was more of a 3 1 2 stars something is holding me back from giving it 4 i thought it was really well written and i enjoyed the story line for the first half of the book it got to a point in my reading where i was enjoying it but i was also ready for it to end i'm usually someone who hates for a good book to end it is definitely a book i want others to read to hear other opinions","1017":"review to come","1018":"loved this first novel full of allusions to some of my favorite lit and also a good story wrapped up nicely","1019":"different and interesting","1020":"fun read of a librarian and a 10 year old boy road trip meek librarian is horrified by her favorite patron a young gay boy whose evangelical parents forbid him to read what he wants and be who he is after she finds him hiding in the library one morning they hit the road this was a fun tale with chapter openings told in classic children book formats however i expected to love this book after all the great reviews and i was merely pleased i thought the writing would be more sophisticated and the characters more interesting still was fun","1021":"didn't love this book although the ending did redeem it a bit for me i felt like i spent the whole book dreading what i thought i knew the ending would be and cursing the main character for being incredibly stupid naive and very callous towards the boy's parents with whom she obviously did not agree but still minimizes the anguish any parent would suffer if their child disappeared","1022":"easy breezy to read wishing for a half star rating system not quite a three star book but not bad","1023":"ok so the premise of this was a little contrived but it was fun anyway maybe because i'm a children's librarian maybe because i studied russian in college and spent a winter in the soviet union or maybe for none of the above reasons i found this book delightful and thoroughly enjoyable and well worth the read","1024":"here's the first thing that people should understand about the borrower it's not realistic here's the second that doesn't matter allow yourself to go with it for a moment before condemning lucy for driving away from hannibal missouri with ian drake or doubting that she would do it in the first place i just don't feel that author rebecca makkai was expecting us to believe that any 26 year old librarian would go on a week long secret road trip with a 10 year old child even one whose parents were trying to de gay him through a weird christian boys camp sponsored by ex gay pastor bob if this is about real life then the kidnaping strains credulity as do a number of elements of the plot i'm not saying that the novel is fantasy or science fiction for it is set in our world but it is part of a genre of novels whose characters aren't quite believable as truly walking among us and yet that's just not a problem if you can get over whether or not the book is realistic or possible then you get to experience the wonders of lucy and ian together two confirmed bibliophiles who are saved by books and revel in what fiction can do for them and that it seems to me is the real message of this really touching novel books are transformative especially for those of us who don't fit in aren't popular and had a harder time of it as kids and beyond fiction is powerful wonderful stuff and it need not be realistic in order to be good","1025":"i couldn't put the book down but i ultimately felt kind of ambivalent about it it's a story of a children's librarian who goes off on a road trip with her favorite library patron a ten year old boy who ran away after his evangelical parents sent him to their pastor to cure his homosexual tendencies i found it a novel and fascinating premise an adventures on the road were quirky and compelling plus i certainly related to the theme of reading as personal salvation but the characters didn't feel believable to me andi was disappointed not to see any growth in them all in all it was a good read but i hoped for more","1026":"lucy a children's librarian in the small town of hannibal missouri goes to work one day and finds ian drake her favorite voracious 10 year old reader hiding out in the library he has run away from his fundamentalist christian home and run to the safest place he can think of the library lucy an unintentional rebel and runaway takes ian on a 10 day trip which goes from missouri to vermont they run into cops overly attentive boyfriends and ferrets they must also evade the man in the matching car who is following them both characters are obsessed with reading and lucy just knows as a fellow library worker i know the feeling that reading will save him and tries her best to give him what he needs to survive the next few years ian is precocious and funny lucy is trying to work out her father's immigrant and possibly criminal past as well as her responsibility for the predicament she's in i loved it highly recommended particularly for those working with children and or teens in the library","1027":"this is a book of people stumbling through life suddenly finding themselves in places they never thought possible a liberal arts grad finds herself a librarian in a small town befriending a boy whose religious parents forbid most literature and then she sort of kidnaps him this was an odd book i felt set up for disaster but instead the ending was mild and non confrontational maybe i missed something but i'm not quite sure what others saw in this book","1028":"a quirky book with a hard to grasp plot especially as one who is a librarian and a mother of an eleven year old therefore about to give up on book however i am glad i pushed through for i enjoyed the ending even if it was a bit out there i liked the references to the children's books and the different way chapters were written allows a good discussion about people's sexual preference so although the overall plot of the story i just could not believe the writing the underlining social stances and the unusual characters made it enjoyable","1029":"chicago based writer rebecca makkai has written various short fiction stories for which she has been awarded with the best american short stories for 4 consecutive years since 2008 the borrower is her first novel http rebeccamakkai com the borrower tells the story of ian drake and lucy hull lucy is a young children's librarian in the library of the town of hannibal 10 year old ian is a regular visitor and addicted to books but is not allowed to read all the books he wants or likes by his parents one day his mom even drops by to give a list with books subjects ian is allowed to read one day lucy arrives at work to find ian there it is obvious he spend the night while she is still planning on bringing him home even though she does not agree and wants to save ian from his parents ian makes up a story which sends them on a road trip together this book is funny and a real page turner though i could not pull it off as i read the book during christmas as soon as i had a minute i grabbed the book to continue on the adventure of ian and lucy the book holds a lot of references to other books which is very entertaining the story itself makes perfect sense and as an adult i was wondering throughout the book if i would have fallen for the charming adventurous ideas if ian or not i really saw the boy jumping around having all these wild thoughts and telling them as a story while a young woman was observing him and wondering what she had to do all characters important to the story are well played out like ian's parents for example view spoiler you do not get that much information but that what you get is placed to dislike them therefore putting you on the side to take him from them but are you really sure they are that bad hide spoiler if you liked adventurous stories like the five as a child this is sure a good adult version replacement for it","1030":"i am a librarian i love books i believe books can change lives the main character of the borrower is a librarian she loves books she believes books can change lives why then did i dislike this book so much i don't like my stories to preach to me i don't like characters in books to be stereotypes this book preached to me the characters in this book were stereotypes so this is a strange situation for me i agree with everything this librarian character in the book stands for but i did not like this book yes it is funny but is mean funny no i didn't like the way the boy's family treated the boy but i also didn't like the librarian's actions either and i didn't like the preachy way this book came across to me i'd love to see what others thought of this book maybe it's just me","1031":"this is a quirky story with many references to children's literature and contemporary politics the word play is clever and funny i thought the road trip unrealistic as well as slightly tedious toward the end of the book however the author's point about the perilous path for a young boy who is a homosexual is touching and well made the novel is yet another comment on the power of story and books","1032":"most of this book i considered a 3 5 i wasn't disinterested just thought it a bit mezzo mezzo however the last chapter and the epilogue were total 5s and worth the price of admission bravo to an excellent ending ps i did laugh out loud on more than one occasion all in all a good read","1033":"the best first novel i've read this year a book that anyone who loves books and libraries will truly enjoy and appreciate","1034":"a serendipitous find on the new books shelf while visiting my family back east they have this amazing endowment for their library i knew by page two i was going to really like this book who can resist a wry librarian with a wisecracking friend who can't flush her toilet during play performances in her apartment this is a very special book a first novel i believe from someone with lots of talent the dad deserves his own book and the boy he is a great character and while this book made me laugh it also broke my heart a little because that kind of parenting really exists","1035":"this is a truly unique story of a children's librarian turned vigilante heroine at least in some peoples' eyes ian drake age 10 is a flamboyantly precocious boy who loves to read he also loves to spend his time in the library with the one person in his life who really understands him the children's librarian miss hull they develop a deep bond and it isn't long before lucy miss hull notices that ian's family has actually enrolled ian in the notorious pastor bob's classes to help steer gay kids toward a \"straight\" life ian's family is evangelical and also doesn't allow ian to read \"evil\" books like harry potter which is how lucy and ian's relationship starts when ian runs away from home lucy decides to save him from his family and pastor bob and they start out on a cross country road trip uncertain of where it will end what could simply be a sad story of a misunderstood and potentially abused child evolves into a hilarious car ride the reader will not want to see end","1036":"my reaction to this book was a bit complicated on many levels it was good lucy the librarian first person narrator thinks about the world in literary analogies something i do as well and she wants to be a hero of some kind to do something meaningful which i also recognize in myself there are short chapters in which lucy thinks about her life that are references to children's books if you give a librarian a closet there are charming moments when ian the ten year old boy is very obviously a ten year old boy makkai got that very right example lucy's dad offers both of them a beer no thanks ian says i'm cool which lucy recognizes this as the resisting peer pressure response kids all learn and then he looks over at her to check if he's doing the right thing ian is very precocious but also very much a kid but on another level this book bothered me i'm not sure if i like lucy or not there's something both charming and irritating in the voice in which the book is written and i'm not sure how much of it is the character's voice and how much is the author's furthermore a lot of what i found trying about lucy was difficult despite or maybe because of how close it hits to home i am so sick of books in which the main character's main achievement is to realize their life is not really moving forward it's like a coming of age story in which the major crisis is realizing that you're not as much of an adult as you'd like to be and then that is magically supposed to make you become an adult or it doesn't and so you learn to live with your perpetual mental adolescence i'm not phrasing this well but it's the trend to think that there's something profound about disillusionment whereas i think the major growth of a person occurs as they decide what to do about their disillusionment i don't know to what extent this is a new thing but it seems to be more common in newer books i ran into it freshman year in contemporary american fiction chronic city and this is where i leave you especially and again in the graphic novels i read a year later ice haven some of the stories in cecil and jordan in new york practically anything by r crumb and yet again in chris ware's work chris ware is an excellent comic artist i'm not criticizing that i'm just saying ouch it's come up in other things too but i can't think of them at the moment one thing they have in common a feeling of lost ness of wanting to be something an artist a good partner a productive adult an activist but not knowing how to get there and or how to recognize it when you are there's a deep skepticism of anything that looks or feels too good too much like what you've been trying to find in these books either the character wholeheartedly dives into it and gets ripped off somehow or they hover on the edges unable to entirely avoid it and miss out on their life's ambition or they are deeply aware of their own ambivalence and are unsure if it's protecting them or crippling them and that's the point of the story that's not enough for me i'm sure this is something that critics are putting down as part of the post 9 11 generation people whose writing careers began in an era of uncertainty and anxiety this may well be true but i think that anxiety only intensified social trends that were already there the prolonged feeling of not quite adulthood the desire to make a difference but not being sure what's meaningful and what's dramatic posturing the unwillingness to commit or the over willingness to casually commit to anything basically it's something associated with hipsters a life in irony and drift seeming to be deep but actually uncertain if it is or not i enjoyed this book but it had a little too much of all that for me to really like it","1037":"really touching","1038":"quirky book love the kiddie lit references stretches reality literary license but fun anyway","1039":"interesting the protagonist a little too clueless and the child a little too with it but all in all a good read","1040":"debut novelist and elementary schoolteacher rebecca makkai combines a wily madcap road trip with socially poignant conundrums and multiple themes in this coming of age story about a twenty six year old children's librarian lucy hull and a ten year old precocious book lover ian drake in fictional hanibal missouri guess who is coming of age answer not so evident lucy isn't entirely sure that she's a reliable narrator part of our reading pleasure is to figure that out she tells us in the enigmatic prologue i'm not the hero of this story is she the villain and if she is not the hero who is the answers turn out to be thoughtfully complex and yet exquisitely simple for those of us and only for those of us whose love of reading is almost religious upside down pun there lucy has been sneaking laudable books to ian whose evangelical anorexic mother janet will only allow him to read books with the breath of god in them no books with content matter related to magic witchcraft wizardry the occult weaponry adult content matter evolution or halloween no authors books that question authority and explore complicated issues or that have morally ambiguous themes oh or contain a sensitive male character janet has enrolled her son in the glad heart ministries youth group with pastor bob in order to de gayify her son for his proto gay behaviors pastor bob is a former homosexual married to a cured once upon a time lesbian who believes that sexuality is a choice not an identity his goal is to speak to our children before the secular media has reached them with its political agenda it makes your hair stand up and splits your ends one morning when lucy opens the library she discovers that ian has been camped out there all night this sets the stage for the fugitive scene adult and child on the lam playing spontaneous road trip games and mimicking passages of children's books ok the reader needs to suspend a little judgment here on how ian maneuvers this but this is fiction so waive a little realism for a little magic capisce lucy as it turns out has some ahem issues a chicago raised mount holyoke graduate with a russian emigre father and jewish american mother she has a predilection for flight and self flagellation her dad was a revolutionary and his shady business dealings and questionable money sources have been a cause of discomfort all of lucy's life it seems she also has a knack for prevaricating and indolence her adult decisions have up to this time been aimed at not taking action in her life other than putting distance between her and her parents she's a would be revolutionary stuck at a desk as lucy and ian cross state line after state line she has moments of doubt and dread about her hapless journey with a juvenile although she tries to remind herself that ian maneuvered this odyssey she acknowledges her complicity lucy wants to save ian from the clutches of religiosity she impugns janet drake for wanting to censor a highly intelligent boy's mettle but is she trying to censor the censor she has doubts but the voice of her insurrectionist father vexes her there are flaws admittedly yet they are easy to ignore when trumped by the nimble narrative and crack characterizations librarians beware lucy doesn't have her masters of library science and as mentioned above the inadvertent kidnapping scene raises a few eyebrows of believability but this beguiling story captivates nonetheless ian and lucy have a tart biting relationship rather than a sentimental precious one additionally makkai deftly weaves in children's literary lore including the wizard of oz madeline charlotte's web and many others bolstering the narrative moreover lucy's subversive deeds in the name of social liberty are ripe and riveting makkai pushes the envelope and the reader may wonder if the story will wax pedantic but the author doesn't disappoint with easy answers she doesn't manipulate lucy's rant into her personal crusade the borrower appeals inevitably to the ardent reader whose love of books starts with the mind but voyages to the soul it is a journey of self discovery and sanctuary finding home wherever you are and having the courage to face your future","1041":"i did really like this book which is what a 4 star rating means but with some reservations i did plunge into this book not only because i work for a library but also with the intention of finding out how successfully an accidental kidnapping could be pulled off since it has a kind of icky aura about it anyway whether or not there's a somewhat plausible good intention behind it but i forgot all about that when i got swept up with the low key quirkiness of the characters and the fun literary riffs that echo throughout the story the premise might not be 100% believable but the humor of the book places this story in a kind of screwball comedy suspension of disbelief twilight zone what i liked lucy and her family are fun to watch and listen to she and therefore the book as a whole has an offbeat sense of humor informed by her russian heritage job as a children's librarian and a love of books what i didn't like the non ending ending aka the \"you decide\" or \"you don't get always get closure in real life\" ending sure lucy's story \"ends\" but considering the reader is just as involved with ian's fate it's a kick in the ribs not to know how that situation turns out also the kind of cliched characters that make up the world lucy as an npr listening organic food eating idealistic younger adult tim as the flamboyantly gay theater person lucy's gay friend from high school who has killed himself the strict religious disciplinarian mother it would have been nice if more had been done with these familiar character types what gave me pause the narrator reminding us about unreliable narrators and this may or may not be happening soliloquies was it just more literary riffing or a nudge nudge wink wink to the reader about how to gauge the \"truthfulness\" of the story being told the best parts of the book were the interactions between characters even if some of them were superfluous glenn the piano player just kind of gets in the way rocky's story cries out for more development but goes nowhere less successful as the book went along were the self evaluation and pondering that lisa does about herself the situation her family it keeps the book grounded but towards the end it slows the momentum of the story a little too much it may seem like i disliked the book more than i liked it but i can only point out the not so great stuff because they stick out like a sore thumb from the rest of the fun stuff the small pieces of what can be seen as liberal stabs at conservative foibles are tiresome since they're overly familiar a lot of the points made about society are made with a hammer when it could've been done with a lot more finesse considering much of the humor in the book is made subtly and lightly read it for the fun stuff debate it for the serious points it unsubtly makes","1042":"really enjoyed this book great weekend read","1043":"even though the story isn't that realistic it doesn't really matter because it was still enjoyable this is a novel for readers who love books it's full of great references to famous children's literature if you let yourself get taken away it can be quite interesting and the characters will grow on you","1044":"i often think i may have gone to library school because of my idealism i believe that the world would be a better place if people read more and got involved in their communities people should have free access to any information they seek this book appealed to that idealism a small town librarian's favorite patron is a precocious 10 year old boy whose parents presuming that he's gay send him to an anti gay youth group to pray out the gay ian miserable manipulates lucy into accidentally kidnapping him the results are hilarious and sad another nice surprise was that much of the book took place in vermont some of my favorite old haunts made it into the book this is a great book for anyone who was a voracious reader as a kid several chapters are written like popular kids books a choose your own adventure chapter one written like goodnight moon one written like the monster at the end of the book it is definitely a fun read","1045":"what a surprise a quiet unassuming librarian gone rogue lots of issues to think about in this book one big one is how involved an outside person should get with other people's children","1046":"there were parts of this book that were very creative and enjoyable specificlaly the italicized parts however i never full bought the premise","1047":"a librarian kidnaps a patron in this very different book lucy is a public librarian who doesn't have her masters she works in a small town in a public library she has a regular ian who she suspects will turn out to be gay and finds out that his mother takes him to a religious group designed to make gay men straight one night he stays in the library overnight and she discovers him and then eventually takes him on a roadtrip effectively kidnapping him this was a sad book with a memorable narrator and memorable characters as well as a librarian i felt that i enjoyed this book perhaps more so than a non librarian would but that may not be true was is the best book i ever read no but it was well written and definitely something i enjoyed reading","1048":"really quirky and different i liked it alot even the ending which some had found disappointing","1049":"while i'm grateful that i received this book throught the goodreads first reads giveaway program i don't know that i would have bought it myself i did enjoy reading it and the characters were very engaging i hard a hard time making myself read it the book just did not grab me and force me into reading it quickly but it was enjoyable i read this one by the pool and it was a good pool read","1050":"i just finished this book and i am very satisfied i love that feeling after reading a book in fact i went back and read the last two chapters again because i wanted that feeling to linger a little longer this book can be about a lot of things but truly i think it is really about the saving power of books","1051":"i received the book for free through the goodreads first reads program and it was awesome it is the story of a young children's librarian and the special relationship she develops with a ten year old misfit who loves to read they share a crazy adventure which begins with his running away to spend the night in the library and intensifies when she attempts to drive him home ending up halfway across the country the author sprinkles references and quotes from popular children's books liberally throughout and just when you think that there is no way this story can have a satisfactory ending it does loved this book and highly recommend it","1052":"yes the premise is perposterous but i so totally related to the main character in this book that even inadvertant kidnapping seemed plausible","1053":"i believed that books might save him because i knew they had so far and because i knew the people books had saved they were college professors and actors and scientists and poets they got to college and sat on dorm floors drinking coffee amazed they'd finally found their soul mates they always dressed a little out of season their names were enshrined on the pink cards in the pockets of all the forgotten hardbacks in every library basement in america ian drake is a boy who loves to read and the lucy hull the librarian who is either his rescuer or kidnapper loves him this books tells the story of how they save each other","1054":"the story of a librarian who winds up taking a young patron of the library for a few weeks on a drive around the country because she believes he is being stifled by his parents because they fear he is gay and they are christian obviously riding the current wave of sentiment on this dilemma makkai goes along with the idea that of course the parents are in the wrong and shouldn't have any right to impose their own morality on their son i tried hard to read this with an open mind but have to confess i had a problem with a few things one that the parents would be so over the top about things with such a young boy he is 9 10 such as not allowing him to read any fiction or non masculine topics two that it was somehow okay for this person a librarian who sees this boy a couple of times a week at best to kidnap this young boy with no consequences there's absolutely no empathy for the hell the parents would have gone through while she and the boy are joy riding around the country i kept reading hoping for some redemption but was disappointed in that hope","1055":"the plot sounded like it might be a fun kind of road trip book but two things went from irksome to unbearable degrading librarians and calling herself a villain at first it was funny and ironic for her to say she's a villain but after reading it over and over it became really creepy","1056":"enjoyable but not as good as expected from the first half the general idea of a librarian borrowing a sensitive boy whom she thinks may be suffering at the hands of bigoted parents is nice however i found it hard to believe that she could do this with so little thought as to the consequences or effect on other people","1057":"there are clever book and reading references in this novel and that's why i gave it three stars otherwise the book has an impossible premise and a very annoying main character","1058":"library employee lucy \"kidnaps\" a ten year old patron and takes him on a road trip from missouri to new hampshire she's supposedly saving him from his fundamentalist christian parents they restrict which books he can read and have enrolled him in a camp to prevent him from becoming gay but lucy's got some issues of her own there's lots to like in this slightly bizarre adventure there's a cast of entertaining cast of goofy characters including the incompetent alcoholic manager of the library lucy's russian immigrant parents and their friends who are most definitely probably part of the chicago russian mafia and the acting troupe at the community theater under lucy's apartment plus there's lots of clever references to classic children's books which is always fun and there's a few things i didn't like as much like the consistently appalling approach to patron privacy by library employees in both missouri and new hampshire","1059":"though some of the plot twists strained credulity i found the idea of librarian as hero very intriguing makkai had me laughing out loud at many points in the novel and the ending was perfect bittersweet and hopeful","1060":"i enjoyed this book so overflowing with children's book reference and library cliches i agree with my friends robin and tracy whose reviews are quite eloquent don't pick this one apart or think too much about it because it won't stand up just enjoy it for what it is and be prepared for some things that you won't like at all pastor bob and ian's parents efforts to turn the 10 year old straight one part that resonated with me was lucy's feeling that as the children's librarian she had a huge responsibility to get the right books into children's hands she took that part very seriously","1061":"a children's librarian finds herself kidnapping sort of a 10 year old patron i loved this book and not just because there is a dearth of good books with children's librarian protagonists it was funny went in a direction that i wasn't expecting but that made sense and the children's literature allusions which could easily have been extraneous or distracting were perfect","1062":"so far funny librarian jokes it is a little slow not sure if anyone but a librarian will maybe those who love them will like it i haven't gotten that far yet though finished this today i liked the literary references the idea of the story was good but just couldn't buy it ian is a 10 year old boy with strict parents who are trying to 'reprogram' him with pator bob because they fear he is gay lucy the librarian sees this and thinks she can save rescue him and she gets the opportunity when ian runs away to the library","1063":"it has been a long time since i finished a book in one day but mc was taking a three hour nap and i was feeling lazy and just completely engrossed in the borrower i just wanted a happier ending but truly i think things worked out the only way they could side note lucy's head librarian who keeps vodka in a sprite bottle in the staff break fridge had me cracking up","1064":"a book about books narrated by a librarian read by an english teacher who always wanted to be a librarian when she grew up and is still thinking about going back to school to get a masters in library science this book teams with allusions to books of all size and shapes and for all readers from the children's books that the children's librarian narrator knows so well to references from the literary canon of old dead straight white british and the occasional american guy i loved it as i was reading it i kept thinking back to the library i went to as i grew up i spent so much time there until the end of the elementary school and now this past fall as i lived with my parents for the first semester of teaching i returned i wish i had a librarian like lucy my librarian from when i was small was so great she had a kind of funny sounding voice but it didn't matter because she was so nice but now the librarian is different short and terse i miss the old librarian i miss riding my bike to the library even though one time i got stopped by a police officer because i wasn't wearing a helmet i miss those childhood afternoons lounging in a sunny spot on the carpet in my bedroom going through the whole stack of books from the library just to hop off my bike and exchange one backpack full of books for another","1065":"i finished this book a couple of days ago and still am unsure of what i really think of it and how i should review rate this one the main premise of a young librarian kidnapping a 10 year old supposedly gay boy to save him from his fundamentalist parents who are trying to reprogram him intrigued me that being said i thought that would be the focal point and this book would make more of a political moral statement wrong the characters in the book are really delightful the book is narrated by lucy the librarian she has many layers is not always in touch with reality and what she tells you at one point is often proven not to be true later on or some major detail has been left out ian drake the young boy is smart creative witty and a huge pain in the butt the dialogue between these two is really clever and well written the longer this book stays with me the more i think it will make me smile i originally thought the book was too wandering and unfocused i mean where did the russian mafia come from but really this is a book where you just enjoy the journey and get rid of all preconceptions right from the start","1066":"lucy hull is a children's librarian more or less by accident she is the daughter of a russian immigrant whom she suspects is a member of the russian mafia in chicago the family has always had plenty of money but her dad is kind of vague about where it comes from as lucy recalls how she got the job she remembers that she was soon to graduate magna cum laude but had given no thought to what she would do afterwards perplexed the career counselor gives her a printout of the english department alumni and suggests that lucy use those connections to land a job she doesn't want to accept her father's offers of assistance so she begins at the first of the alphabet emailing each of the listed alumni as it happens loraine best class of '65 needs a children's librarian replacement fast and isn't quibbling over the master of library science degree lucy warmed quickly to the job and might have stayed on forever but for one of her favorite patrons ian drake a 10 year old almost daily visitor to the library he stood out because of his unique behavior and his precocious reading habits even loraine the head librarian refers to him as that little homosexual boy lucy becomes concerned when she meets ian's mother who comes into the children's department with a list of forbidden topics and titles for ian ms drake acknowledges that ian loves the library but what he really needs right now are books with the breath of god in them when ian gives ms hull an origami baby jesus at christmas she displays it on her desk for a week and then unfolds it to place in the shredder at this point she realizes it is a printout of an email ian's mom has written to a ministry dedicated to salvaging sexually confused children lucy is appalled though she realizes this was never meant for her eyes she becomes very concerned about what damage could be done to this child in the name of religion when ian runs away the following march it is to the library and lucy discovers him when she opens up the next morning she is sympathetic but knows she must return him to his parents at first he balks but once in the car ian's detailed directions take them to a lovely home in a nice neighborhood but just as ian is preparing to get out the homeowner steps out to get the paper and lucy knows that is not ian's dad she drives on still torn about where to go or what to do before she knows it they have driven out of town following ian's imaginative directions she is not sure who is kidnapping whom but she does know who is driving and how it will read in the police report this is the story of their road trip which ian seems to thoroughly enjoy while lucy experiences increasing angst knowing this cannot possibly end well for her yet wanting to protect ian even more than she wants to save herself in spite of the serious ethical issues that rise in this story the book contains lots of humor and tons of allusions to children's literature in every chapter if not on every page lucy learns a lot about herself her dad and her roots ms makkai is a clever story teller and peoples this tale with interesting and creatively drawn characters that are a pleasure to come to know i expect you'll enjoy the entire book but the ending is creative and unexpected by me at least and will have you thinking about this story for quite awhile after you put the book down i'm thinking","1067":"interesting reviewhttp shenandoahliterary org snopes i liked the book i loved the concept and the prologue","1068":"a great book for librarians and book lovers of all kinds","1069":"an entertaining read although the plot is somewhat unlikely to say the least liked the narrator's dodgy russian dad","1070":"it started out really good but started to drag so i skipped a couple of chapters so i could get to the end","1071":"rebecca makkai's novel was told from the point of view of an librarian someone who loves books loves her job and her patrons and there are book references on every page sounds like a book lover's dream right unfortunately no ian drake is a ten year old patron of the library whose parents have enrolled him in anti gay classes lucy hull is a librarian at said library after discovering ian early one morning camped out at the library takes it upon herself to go for a drive with ian after passing judgement on the drake's parenting skills once lucy drove out of hannibal's city limits the book began to fall apart lucy criss crosses all over the u s letting ian be the entertainment director after making a get away to chicago to visit her parents pulling ian off as a child of a former high school friend who attempted suicide her parents seem to buy this lukewarm lie and her father sends her off to the pennsylvania to deliver a package to an old friend this is when it really gets weird after a successful drop off and the use of ferret shampoo they continue on with the pointless exponentiation because now lucy realizes after an amber alert that she is a wanted woman for kidnapping after what seems like hundreds of pages exclusively dedicated to fast food joints ian's inhaler and the license plate game we wind up in vermont just outside the canada border in vermont they visit the grave of ian's made up relative and some kind of boney finger relic at a church this could be compared to the bagel mother teresa it is after this and becoming paranoid of a car following them which is very lolita humbert humbert with out the pedophilia that it is decided that ian should go home via the greyhound unfortunately lucy is now a suspect in a kidnapping and can never return to hannibal missouri the borrower had so much potential but just didn't live up to the book jacket i almost felt that the author was seeing just how obscure she could make it and fell into a black hole that she couldn't come out of rebecca makkai kind of ties it up well with a i'll never let go jack i'll never let go ending but just not enough to make up for past mistakes","1072":"very enjoyable read loved the literary references most characters and style in general","1073":"i wanted to like this more than i did i think i needed to be able to suspend disbelief just a bit more than i was able to","1074":"it started off well then it lost me i'm sorry to say i think i understand what the author was trying to say but i found myself quite bored","1075":"i loved loved loved this book lucy hull is a librarian in the children's section of a library in a town she calls hannibal missouri although she insists it's not the hannibal mo just a convenient town name she is particularly close to a boy named ian drake who is a voracious reader even at the age of ten ian is precocious and funny and has read almost everything in the children's section one day his mother shows up and tells lucy that ian is not to read any books that lack the breath of god ian begins to sneak books home with lucy's help when his babysitter takes him to the library ian's parents very religious begin sending ian to a christian program designed to pray away the gay because they and everyone else believe ian is homosexual lucy is appalled and wants to help ian but ian forces her hand one cold march night when she comes into the library and finds that he has camped out there with his knapsack after leaving a note and running away from home she wants to call his parents but he refuses and somehow they end up on a road trip where ian threatens to make it look like she kidnapped him and she feels weirdly that he has kidnapped her along the way they become closer while visiting lucy's family and traveling to out of the way places not knowing if they were trying to get farther away or if they were working their way home i did not want this book to end it was entertaining and heartbreaking and hilarious and i could not put it down i loved it","1076":"great characters even the minor ones loved all the kid book references and homages loved ian but still couldn't do what lucy did i did like that the consequences for her action was never the focus their journey both the actual road trip and lucy's personal journey was what was important it's hard to argue the morality in her favor yet i still can't convict her either","1077":"not your typical plot line and the ending certainly leaves you imagining and wonder what if story got a bit tedious in the middle and there were parts which i felt were a little too self reflective this is a good book about a sensitive subject and it provokes a lot of thought when reading great for a book club or anyone looking for something a little different","1078":"i'd secretly love this to be my future","1079":"i loved this first effort of rebecca makkai and look forward to her future works the unlikely librarian is a creation that pays homage to the library as a safe place for some and a dangerous place for others ian drake the ten year old son of fundamentalist parents who send him to a pray away the gay youth group is liberated by his librarian after he runs away to the library and they embark on a cross country adventure that yes is fantastical but also fantastic now as a parent who loves the library and books and my child there would be serious ramifications both legally and perhaps violently if a librarian lucy did a thelma and louise with my precious and precocious baby but this is fiction not billed as realism and makkai makes this an often unexpected read with her parodies of popular children's books and lists of how to run and brush your teeth like s ten year old boy cross bridget jones with jasper fforde and you have the borrower if that doesn't sound appealing or you support sexual intolerance you should walk on by","1080":"references to children's literature throughout made me enjoy this book more than the unrealistic plot but a good reminder that patrons can rely on our expertise to suggest just the right book at the right time","1081":"too much foreshadowing for so little return","1082":"so really this is more like a 2 1 2 stars i just didn't like the librarian enough for this book to make sense to me i know it's fiction so you have to give up some reality but i just couldn't get past the fact that she keeps driving i liked some of the spoofs in the book but i guess i just didn't get it","1083":"this is a funny premise a children's librarian kidnaps a child and embarks on a road trip to save him from his fundamentalist parents who are trying to ungay him anyway it all comes together pretty well and it was fun to recognize the books that were referenced throughout the text","1084":"everyone must read this book especially children's librarians and or those who love them even carl read it and loved it","1085":"it was just okay i was curious how it was going to end but found it to be very unrealistic","1086":"hmmm not sure what to make of this book was it ok or did i like it it kept me turning the pages so i'll put is as 'i liked it' i work in a children's library and there are kids i've wanted to rescue never imagined anything like this though some of the characters are great the shady russian father the actor landlord the mean alcoholic of a librarian in charge yeah it was not too bad just a bit too american","1087":"had trouble buying into the

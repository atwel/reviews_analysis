love reading really good writing","2":" no synopsis provided for this book is adequate or correct there is no way to know what to expect this book is like paying for dinner and being fed only chocolate dissatisfaction is not the word your belly distended and your blood sugar spiking and making you hallucinate as you slide into sleep this book is a blind date who turned out to be beautiful but also frighteningly insane this book is that dry mouthed moment when you read something you shouldn't have and there was no going back this book is faulkner queer and unfraid unfucked and unwhite looking boldly backward as he circles the family history with his secrets held to his chest facing out it is flawed the dialogue is blatantly invented by the mind that writes rather than the one that heard it in childhood it changes pace in a way that will leave you breathless decide whether or not that is something you want it is as brilliant as they say it is as maddening as you've heard i took a class with justin torres last year and i had not yet read this book i was so angry while reading it that he had been this brilliant sitting calmly cross legged in the critic's chair i was ashamed beyond belief that i had shown him my own work this kind of genius should be announced we should have been warned this is so ridiculously brilliant and humbling that i feel as though i sat unknowing in the presence of genius and missed lighting myself off his spark damn","3":"a short disturbing book told from the perspective of a 7 year old boy with two older brothers his oldest brother was born when his mother was 14 and his father 16 and they are all just a mess the boys are like feral animals and the parents are mentally stuck as teenagers i did enjoy the writing but the end of the book jumped ahead almost 10 years and seemed tacked on and unrelated i will watch for his next book as i think the author has a lot of potential","4":" so this book has apparently been tongue kissing a lot of pr types as of late because it's been getting hype from here to the other side of the solar system... and back again... and then back out there to pluto or neptune or whichever rock is the last planet out there before you start bumping up against the next solar system... and back again we the animals is a lyrical prose y account of three young boys and their parents a young white woman and a young puerto rican man respective mam and paps who live below the poverty line the youngest son narrates and as the story anecdotally progresses the narrator comes into clear focus about halfway through the book he stops being just one of the puppy pile of brothers and starts becoming an individual with a shadowy secret that is increasingly impossible to keep the book is good the prose borders on modern poetry the anecdotes are sharply drawn and vividly realized and the feeling of being young out of control young boys in a hopelessly f'd up family is physically palpable but i'm with the book lady's blog on this one it's good but it's not life changingly good it deserves hype...like... to the satellites that transmit our cell phone signals... and maybe back not more than that","5":" wow what an uncommon book very fierce and written in a language you hardly ever find in a novel it is beautiful but it's not 'fun' to read it's mostly disturbing and unsettling and if you read closely you will feel great sadness for the main figures in the book anyone looking for a story line or a purpose should probably not read this book it isn't going anywhere it seems which is exactly what makes it so powerful the ending threw me off a little and i thought it was a little disappointing changing from 1st person to 3rd person narrator is one thing but the time shift and the abrupt ending just seemed awkward like the author had enough of writing and wanted to finally come to an end","6":"greatly enjoyed the writing style and narrative but the last chapter did it for me not really necessary and seemed to get lazy at the end","7":"there are scenes in this book that you will never forget the prose is that beautiful told from the youngest's point of view this is a story of three brothers half white half puerto rican growing up in new york with their hard working yet poor and sometimes desperate and rageful parents","8":" a brilliant heart breaking debut but it's full of healing too and writing that makes most other texts on either sexuality or family life look slack and sloppy read the first chapter and see if you can stop i can't summarize the rest better than this reviewer matilda sycamore \"narrated by the youngest of the three boys six years old at the beginning of the book _we the animals_ conveys the raw honesty of a child trying to figure everything out hunger love loneliness injustice sex the weather desire poverty vulnerability brutality abandonment loyalty brokenness yearning fear and maybe hope each chapter is a tiny carefully crafted vignette a story both elegant and raw vibrant and incomplete rarely has a writer developed the child's eye view with such intimate vulnerability and emphatic restraint \" my prediction at first you will be startled by the ending the last 2 chapters and probably won't think they work re read the book and you see they do everything's in hidden ways has been leading to the narrator's final set to with his family and the last chapter the short epilogue is perfect in its mysterious suggestiveness about his life after","9":" we hit and we kept on hitting we were allowed to be what we were frightened and vengeful little animals clawing at what we needed justin torres's we the animals will claw its way into your heart then it will rip your emotions to shreds and you'll love every second of it don't be fooled by this novel's petite nature it is strong for something so small the story is told in a series of short episodes following an unnamed narrator and his two brothers as they grow up their house is one filled with wonder terror and the reflection of beauty in each other's eyes the thing about we the animals is that it is filled to the brim with wonderful innocence painted in the first person by torres this innocence is so vivid that its loss along the way becomes truly heartbreaking there aren't twists in the story so much as the entire novel is a twist on what i couldn't tell you on life i guess so many things happen and torres's sharp eloquent writing makes it all tangible by the conclusion you feel that you've really touched the characters felt the imperfections of their skins swept the wind blowing their hair and it is a draining experience this touching but you'll feel better for it","10":" five stars for sheer poery of language in a novella extremely hard to do without endless connective tissue some have criticized the book for its abrupt ending and some gaps and justin torres in reviews has some reasons why he did it although i suspect it fell into place organically and with the limit of a deadline nonetheless it deserves five stars for what it acheived a novella in short chapters that recalls the exhuberant tribal brutality of childhood and the totemic quality of childhood memory this is supposed to be a coming of age book and falls in a certain category but there are few coming of age hints the beauty is in the language the scenes the shifts between heartbreak abuse and love","11":"strange little book perhaps loved only by book critics and other writers who deal in obscure prose apparently trying to say something deep and meaningful with broken sentences and fragmented thoughts leaving the reader to say huh the title shouldn't be we the animals it should be we are a mess saved from one star because it was only 125 pages and i was able to finish it","12":"succinct paperback picked up at the airport and finished during the 5 5 hour flight the writing is focused and the words selected carefully with none wasted the wild pack of brothers the pull and tug of love and the fight to survive is painstakingly drawn watching the boys grow up and apart torres spells out his own blend of magic and monsters he furthers the spell of giving too little of oneself to others and the penalties of giving too much the portait of his mother is the sharpest at one moment a surprised u0026amp dangerous racoon at another a brittle woman who could hold tears on her eyelids longer than anyone some days she walked around like that for hours holding them there not letting them drop it's when torres tries to study himself he seems to avoid that same clarity skittering around not giving too much away and then to agree with another reviewer in the last 15 pages suddenly lurching in a forward backward looking direction and breaking the spell not in a failing way but in a brutal too bright way that cheats the book a bit more than necessary","13":"how to rate this book the truth is in my estimation it was more than ok for the first 2 3 or so i really liked the poetic way in which the writer unfolded a series of images and then something happened that made this book a pretty big bummer to read so that's why the dearth of stars","14":"another novella book club selection and man this is seriously evocative very unusual in the way it's told but so beautiful in a simple way","15":"enjoyable book from a new author with a memorable style a semi autobiographical novella length story of three boys growing up semi wild family dysfunction yes but not as simple as just that i think the scenes from this book will be lingering around the back of my mind for some time","16":"read it in two days follows the broken home life of three boys depressed mom and abusive dad short and just missed the mark somehow felt like it needed to be more character and story developed not captured here in approximately 140 pages","17":"an intimate look into growing up in a dysfunctional family showing how the family could be so close knit and loving amidst abuse","18":"incredibly well written and compelling a quick read wish there was more at times it felt like a workshop piece a worthwhile read nevertheless","19":"great voice gripping authentic dark i thought it was a novel however i'm not very into memoirs","20":" we the animals which was just published this past summer of 2011 is the debut book from author justin torres and has garnered a fair amount of positive attention from critics it is a vignette of a racially mixed white and puerto rican family in upstate new york told in the first person by the youngest of three closely aged brothers having grown up in western new york myself also with two brothers although i am the middle child and being {read more full review on my blog http www bionic reef com blog p 351","21":"a very poignant and gritty tale i liked his honest look at growing up in a poor mixed race family with two other brothers and the love that shines through here and there despite all the dysfunction","22":"don't get the point of this short book","23":"a potent fiery novella about three brothers clawing their way through childhood in upstate new york bound together by their hardscrabble circumstances told in the first person plural the voice eventually whittles down to a single narrator drawing attention to the way the author is imprinted and influenced by his family of origin even as he carves out an autonomous identity each chapter tells a self contained story but the cumulative effect is powerful and enveloping","24":" blindingly dazzling this magnificent debut novel will draw you in from the first paragraph so close you'll feel your nose pressed against the table where three brothers are eating breakfast and hear their heartbeats the love in this family is powerful a beautiful thing and a terrible thing all at once we witness joy and trauma through the carefully convincingly wrought eyes of a little boy with the added keen perceptions of an adult this book is only 125 pages long but justin torres packs more punch into one word than most writers do in three pulling you in and tearing you apart in a powerful mesmerizing series of vignettes that arc to form a story of togetherness separation and brokenness if you have book people on your holiday gift list for whom you have not yet purchased a gift you should run out right now and buy this for them alternatively if you like me tend to get a lot of bookstore gift cards at holiday time you should buy this for yourself i have never made this declaration before and don't really have the qualifications to make it but i truly believe this author is going places get his debut novel at a time when many people haven't heard of him yet","25":"this is a beautiful novel hands down one of the best things i've read recently the writing is tight and poetic what's more the relationship between the brothers seems to capture childhood perfectly it's complex messy and funny but it's the ending that makes the novel i was in tears finishing it","26":"as an overarching book i didn't love it the writing was really good at times lyrical and poetic but i guess i'd prefer to think of it as a collection of good short stories rather than a whole book or novel which i think is how its touted the themes and relationships between the characters seemed a little too easy a little too stereo typed i resent the mom in it and the rest of the family wavers back and forth between having a string of something decent to being awful all around good writing but left me with a meh","27":"this is a short and very powerful book what a family story of the parents and 3 young boys","28":"i'm giving this one 4 stars with caution three brothers little kids really subsist in a home where their mother who had the first one at age 14 and father who was only 16 at first birth fight scream throw punches and take their rage out on the boys the boys find a world of their own to live in and explain their life through their parallel universe i got that part the cold hunger the lack of rules the protectiveness of the boys for their mother and yearning for parental guidance acceptance and love i got that they were brought up like animals i could feel their pain the powerlessness of the father to provide the desire for normalcy yet the inability to achieve it what i didn't get was the abruptness of the last couple of chapters the about face of the parents when faced with a harsh reality in that sense the characters became 2 dimensional having said that well worth the two or three hours it took to read 'but now i know ' he said 'god's scattered all the clean among the dirty you and me and joel we're nothing more than a fistful of seed that god tossed into the mud and horseshit we're on our own ' that silence was absolution that quiet was as close to happiness as we would ever get 'everybody's got rights a man tied to a bed got rights a man down in a dungeon got rights a little screaming baby got rights yeah you got rights what you don't got is power ''i used to believe we could escape ' he whispered 'i had it all figured out--like when we were in the field today i was sure that god would grab hold of those kites and lift us up protect us 'we hit and we kept on hitting we were allowed to be what we were frightened and vengeful--little animals clawing at what we needed","29":"beautiful writing and sharp characters but the story got really weird at the end the sudden shift in tone and storyline was jarring and i can't really say that i understood it still i liked most of the rest of it","30":"good but the ending was a little confusing","31":"read this for book club did not care for this book","32":"a quick read but one that i'll be thinking about for awhile","33":"powerful read every short chapter a powerhouse","34":"wow this short story collection blew me away so real disturbing heartbreaking and honest it will be hard to put down reminded me alot of james baldwins go tell it on the mountain i could hardly breathe at times and their were times m jaw dropped open i am sure i am amazed at how complete and riveting this collection was done by torres in only 128 pages on kindle impressive will there be a book 2 about the zookeepers i think so","35":"wow i don't even know when i last read a book this bad for it being such a short book it took me so long to get through seriously this book is horrible the writing is just awful and the plot is so pointless i can't even figure out why this book was written three boys and you never find out the narrator's name play around like brothers but they live in an abusive household and watch their parents have sex sometimes in the last couple pages something else happens but even that's not exciting really that's it the entire plot i don't understand either how this book got published or why it was written because it's just that bad and pointless i really don't like giving books 1 star because i try to find something positive in a book seeing as the author took the time to write it and try to entertain us but there was just no redeeming quality in this very short book at all i started to read it to help with my book count for the year since i was behind and i thought i could read this quickly but it took me several days because i didn't want to pick it back up ugh what a damn waste","36":" i could not put this book down as though it was a case of binge watching netflix truly captivating and enticing although much praise claims it a coming of age spectacle it seems more like a discovery of age the first shocker being within the chapter seven this novel scoops you into a whirlwind of an urban family life even if the subject matter may be unfamiliar torres made the the world of this distorted mixed brooklyn family come to life for me this is definitely a novel i would love to relive again","37":"i loved what i felt where the quiet times like in the first chapter when the mom was sleeping that was beautifully written does kind of moments took my breath away but the ending came out of nowhere and felt rushed there wasn't any organic transition it's like some chapters went missing i did like it a lot though i'm not sure if i'll want to read it again because it made me sad","38":"i know i'm in the minority but i found this book depressing and repellent while the protagonist's situation warrants compassion and understanding the writer's words did not invoke these feelings in me as they should rather the prose seemed distant and jarring designed to shock the reader rather than tell a story or provide food for thought at least the title is apt","39":"a fast and fiercely paced debut novel about three equally fast and fierce young brothers pretty much blew my little cotton socks off the amount of energy pumped into each sentence at times left me feeling a little shocked kind of out of breath but not so severe that it made reading quite a bit more exciting than it has for a long time quality","40":"short and easy read fabulous descriptions and great rhythm didn't see that ending coming wish he didn't end up so fucked up","41":" wow i started this book yesterday without knowing where it was going not that the ending wasn't expertly foreshadowed it's just that i didn't expect it to be so powerful and probably painful and cathartic for torres to write briefly this is a first person tale of a young boy with two older brothers a white mother and a puetro rican father life was the opposite of easy for them but they had so much love between them that the story is heart breakingly bittersweet justin torres calls this a novel but it reads like a marvelous blend of novel short story collection memoir i have not heard enough or read enough to know how true the story is but true or completely fictional i thought this was a fabulous book it's very short and reads very quickly so i highly recommennd squeezing it into your list as your next book not only was the story gripping but torres is an excellent writer i am already eager for his next book i hope it is just as strong five stars","42":"fragmented impressions of a fragmented life","43":" three brothers grow up in a privileged white society while being both spanish and white on the inside and dark skinned on the outside i don't know if the author is saying that their family troubles happen because of their skin color but he is definitely saying that it makes getting and having a job more difficult plus there is all the family drama how they each deal with is their own the very worst of it happens in the last 20% i read this on the kindle i should warn readers that this last part of the book is hard to read as it deals with a mentally and physically violent emotion it's short but still gives you enough to have a full picture inside your head i would have rather not read it but i didn't know it was going to be this way when i began reading","44":"for whatever reason it took me ages to get through this the reason probably had to do with how little i rode the subway but really it was lovely the writing was lovely i mean and the story was vivid and a little bit brutal i was skeptical of the jacket quotes that used words like fierce to describe it but in the end i can agree","45":"a powerful little book that reminds one of how little removed we are from our evolutionary roots","46":"a series of short stories about 3 brothers growing up with an abusive father","47":"gorgeous writing simple and yet so vivid and packed with emotion each chapter is like a fragment of a childhood memory but they all build on each other to form distinct characters and a storyline i loved how this family was so full of life ugly drunk poor and yet playful caring joyful and loving i recommend reading this in one go two at most to really experience the boys growing and the family evolving before your eyes","48":"i haven't read a book this bad in a long time the book started off interesting but kept getting worse the characters developed but in a way that made me not care about them at all the twists at the end of the book are wacky and make no sense much like the changing first and third tense this is a poor coming of age story somehow passed of as literature because of a ambiguous racial identity despite the short length this book was a long and painful read","49":"wow great little book best thing i've read since the hours or as meat loves salt i want more","50":"this book is the equivalent of the bruises you get playing outside as a kid the ones that hit purple and bloom into gray green flowers as the days pass terrible and lovely all at once","51":"this felt like a creative writing workshop assignment the author gets an a for his writing ability but as a novel this fell flat for me it felt like a disjointed series of very short stories i guess i just prefer more character development and plot in novels rather than stream of conscious snippets","52":"there are many better coming of age books this was a quick read but mostly superficial even if there was a good rhythm in the writing","53":"perspective and voice language and lyricism gorgeous heartbreaking and then at the end the book slides into a completely different place the child's voice becomes the teenager's voice the end of childhood and the beginning of self discovery the ending though seems abrupt and disjointed and yet it's understood there is purpose and intention in the writing and in revealing a family as close as this one flying apart","54":"enjoyable with a wonderful twist","55":"you need to read this all of you holy shit","56":"this is a starkly written story of three brothers who half the time are fiercely competitive and the other half are fiercely loyal their parents are both absent and selfish and then loving and adoring the boys are hungry for love food and their place in the world i was completely drawn into this book and the child's perspective of his life his parents and his place in the pack of brothers the writing style is one of the best i've read and his ability to show vulnerability tenderness and anger is compelling","57":"a beautiful slip of a novel gorgeously written and totally down to earth despite its ethereal tone","58":"this book might look slender but it packs quite a literary punch it's super intense and violent but also tender and loving it's obviously autobiographical and feels very personal i really dug how he used the first person plural tense which i almost never see and it created a really powerful moment when it switched this book is a great debut and i would recommend it","59":" this novella is about 3 boys and their journey through childhood and into adulthood the title refers to their wild tendencies as young children to be like animals essentially the boys grew up in a poor home with an abusive father and depressive mother basically they lived a rough life their father left them for some time and comes back only to abuse their mother and take advantage of a home it's a quite simple premise really this is all told by the youngest boy it's his version of events near the end of the book they've grown up and are moving on with their life the youngest is the only one whose future is promising his older brothers have not accomplished anything with their life the end takes a very interesting turn view spoiler the youngest hangs around bus stops waiting for men to pick him up and sleep with him he fantasizes about sexual abuse and being taken by an older man needless to say he's written about this in a diary and when his family finds out well it's all downhill for him as well hide spoiler i had problems with the end of the story and based purely on that i wouldn't recommend it to anyone else it's just absolutely absurd it's like in a cartoon where the character is strolling along to suddenly find that they're not walking on any ground anymore it comes out of nowhere there are hints that this story is going to take this weird turn suddenly it's just bizarre and unexpected but not in a good way now i did enjoy reading this book because it was well written the boys' have an interesting story they came from a puerto rican father and white mother and it so happens that they're different from everyone else in their trailer trash neighborhood the author also makes their f'ed up life seem heartwarming and love filled mostly he makes it seems real up until the end anyway","60":" i've noticed there's a genre of fiction where the book provides a series of slices of life without thought as to whether these slices of life actually coalesce into an actual story that is the case in we the animals the book focuses on three brothers manny joel and the first person protagonist whose name is never given and their parents we find out through these slices of life that the mother became pregnant when she was fourteen leading to the dysfunctional family life they currently have the dysfunction has led to children who behave wildly hence the title each chapter provides glimpses of their life from moments of joy parents are happy and having fun with the kids to moments of sadness dad leaves the mom for a period to moments of pity kids are fending for themselves in a neighbor's garden each of these chapters is well written from a prose perspective - lively and full of pathos but my problem again is that this doesn't really tell a story that goes anywhere we simply get these childhood flashbacks of a terrible life before half spoiler the ending goes off the rails sure the author might be making the point that the dysfunction leads to the craziness of the ending i won't argue that but given the lack of flow of the rest of the slices of life it feels abrupt in addition to the lack of a traditional plotline that goes somewhere and the abruptness of the ending i had an issue that the book tried to pack as many sorrowful tropes as possible into one little package teenage pregnancy domestic violence poverty neglected children alcoholism and child abuse and yes i get that these are often distinctly interrelated but still good writing but for me it doesn't quite all come together should really be a 2 1 2 stars out of 5 but goodreads is making me give it a 3","61":"i wish it had been longer and more fleshed out that would have bumped it from amazing to super amazing","62":"i didn't particularly like the style of writing for this book but it was a fast read so i stuck with it","63":"i've never read anything like these very short very powerful and disturbing stories torres's writing is exceptional","64":" this book was sitting in the pile of galleys up to my knees it was among the books i handed over to my best friend to borrow and hopefully never return when she saw it she told me i think you better keep this one it looks like something you might like oh boythis is a beautiful dark funny shocking book it's like a peurto rican catcher in the rye if you will written like a series of connected yet stand alone short stories it's one of those literary reads that is a pleasure to go through no matter what your tolerance for pace and style my only complaint about it is that the last few chapters contain a time jump just to create some kind of page turning conclusion or so it feels i liked the end but i would have preferred it if there was foreshadowing of its twist in the beginning and middle of the book so that the conclusion didn't feel rushed and forced","65":"compelling but painful story of three brothers in a family that both holds and destroys them","66":"\"we the animals\" is a very lyrical novel that reminds me a lot of \"the house on mango street\" it is composed of short poetical at times chapters that form a loose narrative that seems to begin in the narrator's early childhood and ends in his early teenage years the story such as it is is about three brothers growing up in a mixed heritage white u0026amp puerto rican home with parents who are sometimes physically and emotionally abusive and often times neglectful but there are no villains in this novel the boys love their parents and vice versa the parents in this story are not good parents but usually they try and the narrator seems to give them some credit for that the text is a very short and quick 125 pages which is the right length for a book written in this style had it been longer it would have dragged on and been too much for most readers there are many parts of the text that warrant rereading as they are dense with meaning and beauty the chapter called \"trash kites\" is an example of stunning writing the last 20 pages or so of the novel take a rather unexpected turn that you will not see coming as a result i think the novel has some hints of autobiography in it more than one would assume from a work of fiction i am still thinking of the ending especially the last page and i still am not sure i get it i don't see that as a flaw by the way just something i am putting out there \"we the animals\" is clearly a well written book and i liked it quite a bit i am not sure i enjoyed it though i have to keep thinking about that one","67":" this book is still with me today i can't explain the simplicity of the story arc yet the complexity of it all also the protagonist begins his story at age 7 he is growing up in upstate new york with two older brothers and parents that are in their mid twenties the oldest son is conceived when his mother is only 14 but that's not the focus of the story the focus is how this youngest son is a part of a pack while also being apart from this pack also it's about finding your identity within your family how to deal with abuse and neglect in its many forms the prose here is powerful there are lines that are simply profound the writing reminds me at times of tim o'brien the story is about the abusive parents of the three boys the volatile relationship between the mother and father the long physical and emotional absences of the father and the mother respectively it's a sorrowful story but not one that elicits pity the ending is a surprising turn but one that makes sense within the context of the story i will seek out more from this author as he goes on to publish more novels i read this book all in one night","68":"this is writing funny sad alive in the truest sense of the word one of those great books where you have to force yourself to slow down because it's so slim you could easily take it all in at once mark my words torres is a major talent i can't wait to see what he does next","69":"the three brothers start life in the book out as almost one organism everything in the collective and as they grow they stay in the collective until they don't until everything changes small heartbreaking moments big heartbreaking moments beauty in unexpected places poetry throughout","70":"loved this book savoured every moment of torres' voice incredible writing cannot give this book enough stars","71":"a very fast read the ending took me a bit by surprise","72":" beautiful writing otherwise i'd give it a one star somehow this writer brings poetry to a one paragraph scene of a tired mother coming home taking off her work boots and massaging her own feet three little brothers run feral because their parents are so young and working so hard even in the cute snuggly scenes the kids are hungry or they've just been playing on the shoulder of a highway or their parents have been acting wildly inappropriate around them when the boys grow up the one i least expected to flip out flips out in a way that makes so little sense that's so disconnected it seems like it's just for shock value strange depressing mostly puzzling leaves me with the same rattled feel i had after some scenes in the movie trainspotting","73":" this book about three brothers' coming of age in a chaotic fiercely dysfunctional loving hating hitting family comes to a surprising i didn't read any promo material and disturbing but authentic close it's well written the protagonist narrator is unflinchingly descriptive and in the midst of the craziness of the boys' animal behavior their seemingly unbreakable bond like prisoners locked up in the same hell is complex and also endearing until well until it isn't anymore but even then it kind of is yep complex i have to admit that i picked this up because it's short and i'm still a couple of books behind on my goal on this last day of the year but i'm glad i read it i'll be mulling it over for a while i think","74":" why i liked it the prose at times is deeply beautiful even poetic the story at times packs an emotional wallop the chapters are short in fact they're almost like a series of vignettes why i disliked it important information is intentionally withheld from the reader the narrator's name we know his two brothers' names and they never call the narrator by name the time they have vcrs so i'm guessing 80s or 90s and a big plot twist that really has no foreshadowing whatsoever an important chunk of time is left out of the novel and it didn't work for me too much was left to my imagination with only a couple chapters the author could have filled in a major gap the final chapter is far too metaphorical for my tastes","75":"the rest of the book doesn't quite match the amazing opening chapter but well worth a read","76":"beautiful prose perfect not a word misplaced i wanted it to go on and on","77":"another reviewer wrote this is an intermittently interesting but overwrought series of writing exercises in that unpleasant twee self fellating 'mfa style' we know and hate i couldn't agree more","78":"this book comes in at a little over 100 pages and it is a beautiful read it is the story of three brothers growing up tough with a white mom and a puerto rican dad the narrator is the youngest brother and life isn't easy for him or for anyone in his family the main thing i loved about this book was the writing style it's told in these moments of their lives not necessarily pivotal moments but moments that change each of them the novel is almost like sifting through someone's memories and piecing them together into a life and a family i love books that employ this method of storytelling as it really feels like you're in someone's thoughts and feeling these moments with them it works like our own memories work not necessarily accurate but laden with meaning i'll be looking for more work from torres","79":"haunting and lyrical small but powerful justin torres is a young writer to look out for we the animals will be high on my list of recommendations this year","80":"i don't like leaving a book halfway and hence i read till the end thankfully it was a short read dark cryptic disturbing and thought provoking the plot is very plausible and had all the elements to paint a good picture but maybe because of my mood at that time it left me feeling heavy and not satisfied at the end the writing style is different and does a sort of cleansing of your reading palate now time to move on","81":"this book has just changed somethnig in me i feel as if my cells had rearranged and i know know things remember things i didn't before if you are a writer you must read this book it's short and a great read but you cannot read it in one sitting it forces you to think after every scene and feel and recover some of the necessary numbness of life before you can continue armor in place i can't say enough about it easily the best book i've read this year","82":"a gorgeous lyrical set of stories woven as a novella i look forward to what this debut author offers next","83":"the writing is really great but i think that this book almost gets by too easily on just the writing alone i know it's good for a writer to leave a reader wanting more but i just felt that although this book novel was really touching and had so much to admire about it it was incomplete in terms of a real story a progression of the characters and their relationships or of a purposes for all these vignettes being presented other than the narrator's quick unraveling at the end still i look forward to seeing what this writer writes next","84":"i liked this book up until the end i thought that the characters were interesting and i wanted to know what happened in their lives but the end just kind of felt like a cop out i have no problems with the direction it went story wise but the execution could have been better and more fleshed out","85":" this book is spare the way a field of snow in an ansel adams photograph is spare its music is in the spaces between the notes justin torres reaches the beating heart of childhood with his prose lovingly exposing the raw newness of being and the way growth twists around pain three young brothers are one for most of the book and the pov first person plural reflects this each vignette of a chapter has a single point the way a poem has a single point it's reached via the craft of the words as much as their content this is about a screwed up family full of love with beauty and brutality in equal measure serving to highlight one another torres gets at the meaty morsels of childhood change and shines a single beam of light right on their naked essence toward the end of the book when the narration changes from \"we\" to \"they\" to \"i\" and finally to a detached third person echo the emotional resonance is strong and swift the narrator's final note a tender tendril of intent struggling to push through frozen soil is as much saving grace as it is his apogee this book is art","86":"i really did not enjoy this book at all and perhaps it was a book that one isn't supposed to enjoy but even books that have difficult subject matter can feel rewarding and thus enjoyable overall this just felt like i was slogging through pages i don't feel better having finished it i don't feel like i gained any insight on well anything","87":"if enough people agree that something is great it becomes great i read the reviews as always after finishing the book i'm guessing that every book most people choose to read is going to be good because they chose it or someone said it was good this book is way over hyped while the author obviously can write in my mind this does not qualify as a magnificent debut novel in any way seriously children living in an abusive family ok youngest child is homosexual ok some overblown writing ok now we have a great book c'mon","88":"this is a coming of age story unlike most torres uses broad strokes interspaced with minute detail to give an affectionate family memoir designed as a novella this family has more challenges than most but also more love and support for each other that permits its survival the climax will be surprising to many and is worth the journey","89":"torres is a beautiful and poignant writer just so we're clear this novella takes a turn prepare yourself well worth the time","90":"beautiful heartbreaking brilliant i gave it four stars because i wanted more and because i would have liked to experienced more of the boy's discovery exploration into his sexuality i love how detailed while simultaneously ambiguous this book is","91":" a series of events from growing up which read more like memoir than fiction what we have here is more like scenes than a novel the redeeming feature is the language torres uses poetic and evocative language to create an almost mystical space a mystical gritty space if such a thing can occur however these scenes never really develop into anything when the narrator's journal entries are exposed he ends up in a mental institution a development which seemed abrupt and bizarre apparently this did happen to torres which is indeed bizarre this development feels like it is from a previous era say pre wwii i wanted to see more and learn more","92":"i couldn't stop reading","93":"i started this book and then switched to another but after reading an article in the guardian about justin torres i went back to it and realized it is a least partly autobiographical link to the guardian article http www guardian co uk lifeandstyl","94":" we the animals is a captivating fast paced read written in a beautiful style that evokes some lasting images in the reader's mind i found myself wondering why the author chose not to write a good 600 pages instead of this short stunted work a novella really there are many story elements that are just left hanging that i would have loved to read more about one example is what happens if anything between mom and her shift manager whose appearance in the book is brief but certainly interesting the relationship between the three brothers when they are young is very well developed then something seems to end abruptly and we're left wondering whatever happened what we find in the end is well described but how we got there could be developed to a much more impressive narrative in the end i am glad i read we the animals but i hope torres is writing a fully developed novel next time","95":"tried finishing this book but just could not do it finally gave up did not like the subject matter it was slow and disturbing","96":"i listened to this one on audio book it's a series of vignettes telling the story of three brothers and their adventures growing up in a tumultuous family and the challenges they face day to day the love they feel for each other is evident as they deal with a sometimes absent father and confused mother the ending is surprising as a secret about one of the brothers is revealed which shifts the dynamics of the whole family very entertaining and often heartbreaking","97":"this is a powerful beautifully written book almost a poem told in third we and first person it is about little boys three little boys to be exact who are the children of a young latino mother and an african american father living in brooklyn it is about them as a wild group full of appetites and innocence it is about family love and growing apart and differences i feel privileged to have read it","98":"a beautiful haunting and poetic novel about adolescence the writing is so tight it's surprising to me that torres doesn't come from a poetry background and i recommend this to people often","99":" torres is a young talent to be reckoned with and his first novella is admirable in many ways the chapters are short and each structured like flash fiction pieces that is they are anchored in single scenes that resonates beyond the specifics of the situation smartly torres gives that resonance the space it deserves letting the chronological chapters make big leaps in time in the lives of the three brothers he's chronicling it's a love story to growing up biracial and hard scrabbled to masculinity and its dangers and finally to how difficult it is to rise above from where we come the shift in the final chapter is interesting though a bit abrupt and the ending opens up again more like poetry than the novel form but it's a memorable debut","100":"i've been wanting to read this for awhile and kept hearing good things about it seemingly from everywhere so obviously i was prepared to be let down but it's good really good maybe a tad precious but still good really good","101":"the ending wasn't that 'traumatic' at all and it came out of nowhere had no purpose either nowhere in the whole novel was any hint to that but it was beautifully written and a fantastic study of a family and it's dynamics would have been five stars had the last twenty pages been ripped out","102":"pure poetry gwendolyn brooks meets tobias wolff meets william golding what a beautiful voice what sad boys","103":"it was enjoyable and cute right up until the last couple chapters when it took a turn for the unexpected and disturbing i'm really confused at how that tied in at all with team rest of the story maybe it would have made more sense if there had been any clues as to the kids' age progression still goo though","104":"two stars feels generous i so disliked the behavior of the parents in this book that it clouded everything for me there may have been some bits of beautiful writing but to me they just couldn't penetrate the ugly bad parenting fog that settled over the book","105":" i started this novel one night before bed and was already hooked by page 7 i also finished it by noon the next day i wanted to follow this family and see where they went this is one of those books that i carefully read each word that reads like poetry not so much in that i wanted to copy down passages but in the rhythms and the images in each tightly packed paragraph the first chapter would be a great example to use in a creative writing or english class torres begins with the repetition of we wanted with the narrator describing himself and his two brothers growing up this builds across two more pages until it ends with the description of one fleetingly perfect childhood morning we wanted nothing just this just this","106":"beautiful coming of age story i only hope that we have progressed as a country to be more accepting of people","107":"perfect writing each story holds its own or works as part of a whole torres uses great skill to tell stories from a child's point of view and we feel the narrator growing uncomfortably older and more aware of who he is despite the pressures of his home life","108":"torres has a knack for rhythm and a powerful hold over language it's not an i can't put it down book there are great lines some sound like pure poetry however the stories only skim what torres could explore even deeper family sex abuse childhood and the animalistic and animistic nature beneath our skin he gives us dramatic explosions of these things but like fireworks they fade too fast torres is a young author so i'm expecting better things from him in the future the stories at the end of the collection are the most satisfying in terms of story and character development i recommend we the animals if only to get a taste of torres' sensual and gripping use of language","109":"unusual sad story of three brothers growing up u0026amp how their family makes them the way they are very short easy to read book","110":"the first 2 3 gorgeous the third part kind of wrecks it like finding a bad potato after you've already made the mashed potatoes bad analogy but really kind of shocking how incredible the first part of the book was and how quickly it went awry","111":"mmm too much interesting the language freely and joyful i can feel the author's excitement i wanna to read more ^^","112":"the writing is wonderful the story is disturbing torres is especially gifted when it comes to describing the bond between brothers in a volatile frightening household","113":"well written not sure how i feel about this book","114":"this is a book about a rough and tumble childhood - lots of hard playing lots of hard fighting what i liked most about we the animals is that each chapter is a memory from the mind of the narrator and reads just like memories do - some things are vividly recalled others are not when the three brothers of the narrator's family are young they live up to their \"animals\" name playing and acting out with the type of untamed abandon you only have in childhood most chapters even if they don't include literal running which most do either in play escape fear or euphoria leave you with the breathless feeling of it torres's writing has a physical chasing quality to it the whole book reminded me of sprinting barefoot sometimes on grass others on gravel and glass","115":"i very rarely find books to be disturbing but this one made me feel very uncomfortable mostly because i don't think the author has the talent to really deliver on the subject matter he tried to present in the second half it turned out awkward and i finished the audiobook with relief","116":"this book was amazing i loved almost everything about this book it is a series of vignettes snapshots in the lives of three young boys in new york state this book can go from gut wrenching to humorous or vice versa in a blink it reminded me quite a bit of sandra cisneros's house on mango street there are parts of this book that i read multiple times i cried when i got to the end then read it again and still cried","117":"whoa where the hell did that ending come from another sad one sad one","118":"great coming of age story written in beautiful prose","119":"read this for book club it's beautifully written but i just didn't like it there's no real driving plot as it just seems we're peeking in on random days in these boys' lives it was an extremely short read a novella really i just found that i wasn't really invested in it and then it was over","120":"this is definitely outside my usual reading choices but it was an interesting read i was just going along not caring much about any of these people until the very end the last few chapters or whatever you want to call them those got me this is a case of i can 100% see why this is highly rated and won an award maybe more than one can't remember it just wasn't my style counts for my summer reading challenge","121":"there is so much in so few words this book is just flat out impressive the last couple of chapters were not satisfying to me but i still give this 5 stars because the first 3 4 created images that linger with sentences that were so satisfying and spell binding there were times i just had to read it aloud because it was so good","122":"well written story about three peurto rican american boys growing up wild curious conflicted with amusing sad and shocking coming of age experiences to contend with a very quick but interesting read","123":"i will describe a scenario and you will think about the scenario and how it can effect you for ever","124":"i'm not usually the biggest fan of short stories but i heard great things about this one so i wanted to check it out it was okay it was well written but i think it could have been a little longer to flesh it out a little more there was a lot of guesswork involved in the goings on behind the scenes to fill the gaps i guess that could have been the author's intention but it didn't really work for me","125":"not for the weakhearted this is the story of a wolf pack of a family a childhood savage and cruel though often loving","126":"incredible writing as the nyt describes dusk seems to be descending forever a good description for the dark violent tone but also really bright sparks of humanity","127":"a gorgeous wrenching brief novel framed as a series of vignettes we the animals follows three brothers growing up in a family that alternates between tenderness and abuse poverty and stability madness and connection it was a powerful read that i devoured it in one sitting","128":"loved loved loved the beginning torres' creative skills are fantastic but the plot lost my devotion as the book got about halfway through the end was particularly upsetting because it was so abrupt i needed it to continue however i would read it again i loved the story about the mixed race brothers but the second half felt too rushed where as the beginning was beautifully paced and poetical","129":"it is said that poetry must choose every word wisely to make it count and have punch but we the animals does just that despite being a novel with every word you feel the grit the sorrow the highs and lows of life in lower class new york city all the way down to the oh my god where the hell did the last chapters come from knock knock who's there unexpected homoerotic pedophilia interrupting your reading pleasureunexpected hom oh good christ go back to the three brothers playing in the yard minus one point","130":"this book is absolutely beautifully written lyrical vivid and flows incredibly from one sentence to another the subject matter is also incredibly difficult and was very hard for me to get through at some points still a rewarding read with an absolutely haunting ending","131":"the first two thirds are engaging and well written but the last third is sudden and distracting","132":"this review has been hidden because it contains spoilers to view it click here i love the narrative such vivid characters i can't begin to tell how touched i was by the story and the raw fragile emotion realizing that he was queer and had a talent for writing full disclosure an estranged friend from university","133":"3 brothers share a violent' heartbreaking family life spare and brilliant prose","134":"a book that is felt more than read we are seduced by these boys and by the author's writing but just like the boys the author doesn't want our sympathy or pity or doesn't want us to know how desperate he wants it","135":"nicely written and picturesque but lacking a bit in depth","136":" heading out of we came mei wasn't quite sure what to expect from the slim volume of we the animals by justin torres how was it going to live up to the high praise how forceful and convincing can a story be that ends when other similar books are just getting started on their storytelling journey but as the saying goes - good things come in small packages and i was enthralled by this amazing debut novel torres wastes no time getting the reader engaged and committed to his tale we the animals tells the story through a series of vignettes of three brothers growing up in upstate new york the story is narrated by the youngest brother as an adult looking back on his childhood it is through his eyes we experience the brothers' adventures the turbulent marriage of his parents - a white mother and puerto rican father and the eventual coming of age of the narrator as an \"i\" instead of a \"we \"torres provides an intimate portrait of a family in crisis set against the restraints imposed by themselves and society while reading i felt like i was looking through a family album with the narrator and at each picture he stopped and told me the story behind the snapshot each story portrays the pain and love in their lives as they struggled to make sense of who they were in the world how to they take what is dished out to them and what does survival look like the most painful stories were those where a situation started out as a joyous event but an ugly twist soon ends the happiness the narrator patiently in an aching yet lovely voice takes you from how he was a full \"we\" with his brothers - all for one and one for all to his budding realization that he just might not be the same as his brothers and informs us \"they smell my difference - my sharp pansy scent \" this keeps building until a single event at the end is in many ways the culmination of the trauma hurt and love the family feels for each other yet they each know their world will never be the same again we the animals is a forceful debut that will invade your thoughts long after you have read the last word as the author's storytelling is spellbinding the portrayal of the household that is intense chaotic and loud is set by the controlled tone of narrative and this provides grace to the dark lyrical prose i recommend this book to readers who enjoy the structure of language to tell a story this book was provided by the publisher for review purposes reviewed by beverlyapooo literary book review","137":"raw just raw the painful slow build up leads to an unexpected heartbreaking conclusion with few words torres makes you feel everything from his childhood","138":" a fine first novel of a close but deeply disfunctional family the main character's part in it and his painful separation from it it reads like a linked group of short stories and is quite short itself only 125 small pages i usually dislike books about screwed up families but this one pulled me along the parents are impressively messed up and the boys are basically feral but there is love and beauty there as well the writing is terrific although it does occasionally seem to be trying too hard my main caveat is the ending the last couple of chapters come out of nowhere and the family's extreme reaction doesn't fit with what we know of them i felt like i wasn't getting the full story as if there were a few chapters left out that would have let me make sense of it perhaps they were too painful or personal for torres to write this book definitely read like it was mined from his own childhood","139":"this was a beautifully written book about a very wild family it was difficult at times to read i felt the ending was abrupt and wish that the transition before the ending had been handled better the author is talented and has quite a powerful story to tell","140":" we the animals tells the story of a family's tumultuous home where emotions blend swirl crash and mix up and swarm around a family as they struggle to find their way three brothers sons of a puerto rican dad and white mother grow up in upstate new york their family is poor their home life unstable they suffer at the hands of their brutal and abusive father from whom their weary mother who works the night shift at a local brewery suffers hard to protect them more than anything she wants to prevent her boys from growing into the same man as their father whom she loves deeply through this filial journey through the mystery confusion and innocence of youth the brothers at least have each other three animals three musketeers a pack of wild wolves a band of true brothers with prose that is sparse clear rhythmic powerful staccato and visceral we the animals casts readers headlong into this coming of age story when the narrator writes of the time his paps paddled him the youngest brother out into the middle of a deep lake to teach him to swim you feel the boy's fear and dread \"i watched the moon brake shards of light across the lake i watched dark birds circle and caw the wind lift the tree branches the pine trees tip i felt the lake get colder and smelled the dead leaves \" as time marches on the brothers become aware of their differences years wedge gaps between the band of three the reader can only watch painfully as this family realizes how different and at the same time how inseparable they truly are","141":"my husband was blown away by this book i was less so but it was definitely well done","142":"check out my review at http www shannonsbookbag blogspot c","143":" my final impression of this book was that it was a modernized version of the house on mango street told from a male protagonist but while mango street was more poetry than prose this one delightfully so was the opposite there was a discernible beat and rhythm to this novel it felt alive with youth and boyishness for these boys were rough and tumble and adventurous and each chapter felt filled with the promise of the same the style of each chapter was almost like a standalone short story with there being just enough tenuous connective fibers between each respective chapter to make the plot happenings matter while i would typically find this annoying i actually found the vignette style of this one to be massively appealing it swept me away without causing me to lose my balance and i was able to be spirited away in a world of beautiful language without losing interest in the rudiments of the story i will love this story forever for the images that it has emblazoned in my mind such as the image of the tyrannical fear inspiring father who is soft enough to take a break from his lordship to dance to tito puente in the kitchen and to jump in the bath with his sons even the final image of how the father tenderly treated his son at the novel's end after the son provides reason for absolute shame will forever make me secretly jealous and question my own father's love in true jerry maguire fashion the first lines of this one had me immediately hooked with we wanted more certain to be a writing passage that will never leave me in the same way that i have never forgotten the things the soldiers carried in tim o'brien's work of the same name the final chapters offered a nice resolution putting a definable period on this tale of the escapades of youth the writing here was beautiful which i am finding to be a rare compliment given these days i would recommend this one to anyone who has ambitions to write for in its pages i am certain that you will see how writing is supposed to be done","144":"my first read feelings while the lyricism occasionally comes off a bit too stridently there are indeed a couple of heartwrenchingly lovely chapters here i wish i could call this three and a half stars view spoiler the major life change that happens to the narrator right at the end is worth more pages i think hide spoiler the boldness of the writing makes me want to buy justin torres a drink","145":"3 3 5this contains some beautiful and powerful writing i agree with many comments that the ending seems to fizzle out and cannot maintain the genius that impresses me so much with the first 75 pages he will be an author from whom to expect greater wonders in the future","146":"a pretentious little piece of pure twaddle the acknowledgments are longer than the book but at least they're better written","147":"this book is powerful in the simple no unnecessary frills way that the narrator recalls memories of his family growing up they are a wild fiercely loving and often volatile group when taken all together the narrator and his two older brothers his sometimes absent paps and his ma not surprisingly he emphasizes their primal nature to make the book title meaningful literally and figuratively i found myself watching this family from the outside just like the narrator seems to be observing and remembering his family from somewhere outside himself the three young boys in the family love their parents deeply even while they sometimes fear and misunderstand them they all want to escape to something better to a better life but these animals are trapped in a struggle against poverty complicated by paps and ma's complicated relationship i look forward to reading more from this author justin torres he has a clear sense of when telling less is so much more throughout this collection of vignettes these characters have a pulse that is tangible in these pages","148":"i read this so quickly and hated the minute it was over great read amazing style and stories","149":"i thought i'd find this precious hearing the first chapter read aloud made me think it was going to read like a creative writing class exercise stretched out to fill a book but no i ended up quite liking this the element that seemed like a gimmick the plural first person voice feels natural in that way that some of the best created things feel like they just happened some of the best things also show off their craft relentlessly but this thing is not that kind of thing it seems to me that for a book to be worth reading seriously something in it has to evolve or has to make us change and this has to happen organically as a part of the whole work of art not because the author realized halfway through that they needed to make something happen it can change in a conventional novelistic way or in an experimental way but some transformation has to engage us of the characters the narrative voice the structure torres' book does this quietly but surely i was feeling pretty bleak about the new novels so cheers to you justin torres","150":" a series of interconnected prose poem like chapters each of which could well stand on its own a boy youngest of three brothers grows up in upstate new york with his dysfunctional working class parents together and finally separately they deal with their mixed race identity and sexualities i really liked the first 2 3 chapters then i felt like it was all downhill the writing was precise and evocative and yet overly so slipping into excessive sentimentality the other two brothers started to feel flat like scenery or a greek chorus and i really didn't feel like the ending matched the beginning and middle it felt like it came out of left field view spoiler did his family have him institutionalized for having promiscuous gay sex is that legally possible his family is completely unrecognizable in the last few chapters am i to gather that the narrator's institutionalization has wiped away their personal characteristics and foibles what on earth is the deal with the very last chapter zookeeping i hated it it was suddenly and incongruously dream like in a way that might have been explained away earlier in the book by the fantasies of childhood but that later in adulthood seemed to be a signifier of insanity hide spoiler","151":" we the animals by justin torres consists of only 125 pages while the novel is short on length it is definitely long on style we the animals is torres' debut novel that takes readers deep into the hearts of a mixed and mixed up family torres is no stranger to the literary world he received a rolon fellowship in literature from united states artists and is a wallace stegner fellow at stanford university his writing has previously appeared in granta tin house and glimmer train he is from upstate new york tthe novel is narrated by the youngest son of paps and ma who are both from new york paps is puerto rican and ma is white their relationship is a volatile one that sometimes turns violent torres chooses to tell the story in the increasingly popular first person plural the storyteller's name is unknown to the reader but the reader does learn the identities of his older brothers manny and joel the brothers are as thick as thieves growing up which torres does a superb job of illustrating they are rough and tough and ready for anything when we fought we fought with boots and garage tools snapping pliers--we grabbed at whatever was nearest and we hurled it through the air we wanted more broken dishes more shattered glass we wanted more crashes yet these three brothers have a strong seemingly unbreakable bond we were six snatching hands six stomping feet we were brothers boys three little kings locked in a feud for more sometimes torres portrays them like little monsters little feral kittens but always lovingly tthe parenting skills of paps and ma disturbed this reviewer they were yet another example of kids begetting kids she was fourteen when she became pregnant with manny the oldest son often the boys and their needs take a backseat to those of paps and ma in one memorable instance the boys are playing with tomatoes pulpy juice covers their faces ma looks at them and it reminds her of the way they looked when she gave birth to them ma wants to join in on their game make me born she says ma also wakes up confused over the day and time during one scene and is convinced the boys should be in school when it is a sunday night paps is also guilty of neglect at times he gets drunk and disappears for days on end ma and the boys are scared of him one day while the boys are hiding behind a shower curtain a fact both parents know paps and ma have sex yet torres does this to underscore the brothers as a unit when we were brothers he writes we were musketeers when the boys are together they speak in unison one voice for all tthe chapters are short but torres lends a certain rhythm to them when paps danced in front of the boys they drank him in in the dance they knew all about him about the flavor and grit of tenement buildings in spanish harlem and projects in red hook and dance halls and city parks and about his own paps how he beat him how he taught him to dance as if we could hear spanish in his movements... like torres wrote about paps' dancing i could hear the music of we the animals i too wanted to dance ttorres continues with a good pace until almost the very end of the book when he unveils a major revelation the unnamed speaker has a homosexual encounter with a bus driver his family soon discovers a journal in which he wrote about his sexual fantasies with other men i had no problem with the homosexuality aspect however the real issue lies with torres and his storytelling skills i felt as if my car had come to the end of a long road there was a large gap where the road had been washed away a chasm prevented me from getting to the other side there was no bridge likewise torres needed to connect the brothers as little boys to the brothers as adults he does not do this in my view and this leads to a disconnect time has passed but the reader has no idea just how much this reviewer needed more convincing tit is at this point that the brothers drift apart they are less we the animals and more the narrator as animal the family even commits the youngest son it is there where he truly feels like an animal i sleep with other animals in cages and in dens down rabbit holes on tufts of hay they adorn me these animals-lay me down paw me own me-crown me prince of their rank jungles he is adrift alone alien to his family and to himself what is he without them i've lost my pack he fears toverall torres gives readers a brilliant concentrated debut he entices readers with vivid prose and shows how family is a precious thing indeed","152":"great book a short read but one of the most visceral authors i have experienced in quite a while torres packs a punch with every sentence and the dialogue is almost hemingway esqe at points short but to the point thoroughly enjoyed","153":"a coming of age tale that's labeled fiction but smells like autobiography it's short about 150 pages and the ending sort of sneaked up on me i must have meant the hints along the way the writing is sparse and raw does the author have more books in him","154":"i was interested in reading this book because it was about 3 brothers growing up together i like the authors writing style but was disappointed in the language and graphic sexuality of the parents from the boys point of view i stopped reading it for these reasons","155":"i loved the language of this book i bonded with the narrator i found the family both tragic and beautiful my only disappointment is that the ending is too rushed i felt so much emotion built up but the last 25 pages pushed through time too quickly still an excellent read","156":"i've rarely seen raw humanness captured more beautifully","157":"i really loved this and only wish it hadn't ended so quickly i wanted more of the author's voice and look forward to reading whatever he writes next","158":" self regardingly box ticking like a preening popinjay of american literary workshops oh how i loathe that word we the animals bounds into our readerly arena like a snow leopard but it turns out to be your neighbour's moggy with an off white rug draped over it i thought it wasn't anywhere near the five star foams nor yet the one star fleshtearing burn the witch gnashes neither it was a damned 3 star not bad what else have you got kind of god damned normally novelised autobiography shortstorycollection bookmeld which has been going on since at least dandelion wine by ray now there was a writer bradbury in 1957 and prolly way back b4 that too i could wiki that but i dint the thing is we is totally spoiled with great current american writers of heisenbergian crystal blue prose you have heard me radiate on this subject many times so i will just mention in passing matthewklamrustybarnesjunotdiazdonaldraypollockharperjordangeorgesaundersalissanuttingthat's enough but i could go on and justin torres is all right but not there yet boxes ticked in this novel voice of an ethnic minority - checkgay - checkextreme poverty - checkworking class - checkarse end of america - checkelliptical style beloved by little magazines and award ceremonies - checkwe will see about mr torres when he produces his difficult second album","159":" this was good though i never felt fully invested it races along with a lot of power and a lot of stylistic panache though i never really got a solid idea of who any of the characters were the three brothers never felt particularized nor did they seem to be on any sort of trajectory plotwise the book is pretty anecdotal with most of the 2-3 page chapterettes beginning essentially if not literally with one time we so that nothing really builds event wise this changes just before the end of the novella it's billed as a novel i'm assuming for marketing purposes where the narrator experiences a sort of profound revelation and while this is both powerful and moving it's almost too powerful in that it's not prefaced with any gradual development or character revelation that i could discern in short it almost comes out of nowhere again the writing is powerful and the author never really falters i e he does what he sets out to do i just wish we were given a little more time with these characters or were allowed to see them grow before instantaneously changing becoming men etc i understand that speed and momentum and even chaos are important thematic concerns but the structure of a book doesn't always necessarily have to mirror its thematic thrust in this case while it adds something to the narrative there's definitely a cost associated this is a very quick read and i think it could have been a little less quick","160":"sorry but i'm going to have to buck the trend and not go on and on about how wonderful this book was to read i'm rating it on how much i liked it although i understand that the author is very talented many comment on the wonderful lyrical prose but it wasn't enough to get me past good i'm glad that it was very short","161":"running just under 150 pages told in a spare staccato style this book packs a real emotional wallop this is the story of three brothers frenetically racing through life playing and fighting with each other and at times tiptoing around their parents' tumultuous marriage sometimes humorous sometimes depressing and sometimes disturbing the book is a series of relatively short chapters which examine a particular incident or crisis at its heart this is a story about how family dynamics can leave you vulnerable and how that vulnerability can affect you throughout your life this book gripped me from the start and as fast as i read i was done with it relatively quickly the book is narrated by the youngest brother so everything was viewed through his eyes which was effective although at times somewhat irritating i thought the book was at its best when the narrator recounted his parents' relationship as well as the relationship he and his brothers had with their parents torres threw in a big surprise at the end which although tremendously powerful frustrated me a bit because i never saw it coming and it didn't feel true to the story however since the book is apparently semi autobiographical i guess it's the way it really happened in torres' life all in all this book definitely moved me and i look forward to seeing torres' career proceed","162":"incredible unusual fresh spare rich","163":"sad and spare this auto biographical novella focuses on three boys raised in uproarious conditions in new york their father is puerto rican their mother is white and they are mixed there are few notes of happiness and light in this short often heartbreaking book","164":"gripping story about three brothers growing up with an abusive father and complacent mother the author uses the brother's relationships to show how they depended on each other for support and for dealing with their dad kind of slips back when the author becomes an adolescent and searches for love in all the wrong places all told i would read another book from this author","165":" this short novel was fantastic what kept it from being a 5 star was what probably what kept it from being a full fledged novel there were some parts i would have loved seen more fleshed out and the climax seemed rushed and i'm still struggling with the climax a little spoiler i am very for gay rights and the family's immediate reponse of sending the boy to an institution to 'get him fixed' pissed me off granted we are talking a different time here and it did pull this broken family together but ugh","166":"beautifully crafted and written but i'm not sure this was a complete thought","167":"more a novella than a true novel it is quite a quick read honest coming of age family dysfunction burgeoning self realization story i rather enjoyed it but it left me sort of unsatisfied i'd be interested to read more from this author to see if his writing style voice continues to develop and improve","168":"well written super squeamish making for me which is not a bad thing but not my favorite feeling either there isn't a payoff for the squirm here also not so cohesively linked linked stories interesting but","169":"torres writes from a place somehow connected to both the heart and the gut of this fucked up thing we call life pieced into perfectly encapsulated chapters that writhe as we read torres has here as everyone has been saying a pitch perfect debut that carries the weight of the world on its slim shoulders enormously excited to see what he does next","170":"good short easy just like this review zoing","171":"each chapter was a small vignette almost a poem put it all together and you get multiple snap shots of a boy's childhood since it is in the boy's pov each memory is faint short and a bit cryptic it lost my attention a few times i will admit and i never really got invested in any of the family members i will say the ending took a left turn for me and i was very confused i may have missed the lead up because i don't know why that all happened so fast","172":"this is a very short novel i took me about 2 hours to read i'd say read it if you like junot diaz the book is more a series of vignettes of 3 brothers of puerto rican descent growing up in upstate new york it doesn't really follow a coherent plot","173":"the kind of book you find yourself reading out loud because the writing is so beautiful i only wish it was longer like the main characters in the first chapter i wanted more","174":"this is about three puerto rican boys coming of age or more aptly about poverty sex and violence which felt very stereotypical i felt that the story was weak with overly melodramatic moments and it was a struggle to get through this book it is more like a 2 5","175":" not having previously heard of justin torres or of we the animals i borrowed the audiobook from my local public library because the story sounded interesting and it was or at least parts of it were i enjoyed the colorful tales of the narrator's youthful exploits and his musings on his parents' volatile love for each other himself and his siblings i was only mildly surprised to find that the lives of impoverished children of an intermarried couple growing up in a northeastern american urban wasteland are quite similar to the lives of impoverished children growing up in the rural american south where i make my home at first i was tempted to pity the narrator's suffering at the hands of his brothers and childhood peers but it quickly became apparent that his self pity was sufficient to preclude the need of anyone else's the brevity of the book works in service to the anecdotal parts of the story and adds to the enjoyability of the audiobook for most of the book oral transmission is the ideal medium however the final section of the novel demands fuller explanation when the narrator finally begins detailing his coming of age is exactly the point at which he needs to slow down to offer fuller description of his actions and certainly of his perception of events too much of what he does that his family finds so objectionable is left so vague as to be almost unknowable to the reader what exactly did he do with whom and did he really do it or did he just write journal entries based on his daydreams and desires and whence came those desires there is no clear development of the narrator's character along those lines in the earlier narration no clue that he might be headed that direction it's as if torres is throwing in an entirely gratuitous surprise twist the closing scenes of the novel suggest that the narrator has lost his grip on sanity clearly his family thinks so rendering him an unreliable narrator but that doesn't excuse torres from telling or as is so often instructed in writing programs and workshops showing the reader exactly what happens i do commend torres for trying to open a dialogue on sexuality and gender identification among certain ethnic and cultural groups in 21st century america but i think he waited 'til too late in the story to try to make that point and worse failed to clearly and effectively make a specific point about the issue","176":"like 2013 i started off the year reading a very short book that was extremely well written","177":" i think it was either a review or dust jacket blurb that likened the experience of reading justin torres' prose to sipping whiskey i couldn't agree more not that there's a flask of whiskey on my desk right now or anything i would say we the animals is a very nice whiskey a sipping whiskey one you want to savor and one you don't quite realize the quality of until it's all gone down and you wake up with no hangover the next day no but really after i read this slender novel i went back to dissect it a bit and was quite stunned at how tightly woven it really is treat yourself to this one and get excited for what torres will put out next","178":"3 and a half","179":"there are some sections of this novel that almost read like prose poems just packed full of striking often strange imagery for such a short book there's a lot going on and a lot to get out of it each vignette does a lot of work it's hard to believe that this is a debut novel and after reading it i'm definitely a fan of justin torres and am excited to see where his career goes from here","180":" 3 5 5this book reminded me of the opening line of anna karenina \"happy families are all alike every unhappy family is unhappy in its own way \" unhappy families all have their own special brands of dirty laundry and dark secrets but it's rare that you get to see what makes an unhappy family so unhappy unless of course you have the misfortune of coming from one people often keep their unhappiness behind closed doors we the animals opens those doors wide a little family background a fourteen year old white girl gets pregnant by her sixteen year old puerto rican boyfriend they drive to texas to get married they are from new york and she's too young to get married there over the course of three years they pop out three kids they move to upstate new york in search of a better life she works the graveyard shift at a brewery when he works he works odd jobs he's better at drinking than working the three kids all boys are wild and thick as thieves at the start of the book the unnamed narrator who speaks in first person plural referring to himself and his two brothers is seven his older brothers joel and manny are nine and ten respectively paps calls the boys \"mutts\" \"you ain't white and you ain't puerto rican \" ma and paps are reckless abusive desperate young and immature they are still growing up despite having the responsibility of three mouths to feed and minds to shape their parenting choices are questionable at times and atrocious at others-they smother the three boys with love and need in one moment and treat them like absolute shit the next the book at a scant 128 pages it's more of a novella really is told in vignettes that span about a decade there's the time ma comes home on the narrator's birthday after having been beaten until she's purple there's the time paps shows the boys how to dance the mambo like a \"purebred\" in the kitchen there's the time ma and the boys act like gallagher in the kitchen smashing tomatoes and tubes of lotion and bottles of ketchup until they're covered in slime and goo and look like newborn babies there's the time paps tries to teach ma and the narrator how to swim by taking them to the middle of a lake and leaving them there to fend for themselves each chapter is like the telling of a distinct vivid memory some separated by days others separated by years they are snapshots that range from the joyful to the excruciating as soon as i finished reading the book i went online to find out if it is autobiographical it seemed like torres was drawing from personal and painful experience it is frighteningly and heartbreakingly real not surprisingly there is a lot of truth in his novel the author has said that the hard facts are true but the incidents are fictionalized we the animals takes you on an emotional roller coaster ride that's a played out description i realize but here it is apt there were times when i laughed out loud and times when i felt sick to my stomach there's a lot of love in this book but there's also betrayal and abuse and devastation reading this book feels vaguely voyeuristic you're reading someone's family secrets and it feels a little wrong but you want to do it anyway who should read it fans of short fiction this is more like a collection of related short stories than a traditional novel people who like emotionally wrought memoirs","181":"this is a short beautifully written story of three boys in a puerto rican american family searching for identity and meaning it deals with many powerful subjects including sexual orientation gender roles relationships among brothers rage fatherhood identity development and all in a slim volume it made me weep","182":"this was a very disappointing book if your definition of lyricism is extremely choppy writing then sure this is an extremely lyrical book","183":"reading about a childhood impoverished in every possible way is not easy but it sure is memorable thank heavens it is a short book because i don't think i could have taken much more so great was my distress over it but the writing is just beautiful spare totally evocative","184":"a book with no point couple of boring stories i felt like i was reading a null children book though children books is way intresting","185":"now that i've read this i'm going to have to downgrade all my others short poetic subtle dark brilliant","186":"this novella made an excellent companion read to the sense of an ending since it is presented as memory flashes of a childhood rather than any kind of cohesive narrative in a way this presentation makes the story all the more powerful and compelling the ending is a bit much but i think there needed to be a dramatic closure to the story told here for it to have any lasting impact","187":" justin torres was on bookworm with michael silverblatt and i heard him read the first chapter of we the animals i was so blown away by the power of his writing i immediately went out and bought the book in the beginning i had to read each chapter twice before moving to the next chapter the writing is that beautiful torres manages to use the smallest amount of space on the page to go great depths in this coming of age novel each chapter is just a glimpse into his childhood but everything between the lines fills in the story the narrator the youngest of three neglected boys in an abusive home tells about his wild childhood from his perspective the chaos is normalized as that is all he knows flawed love is better than no love and so his young mind justifies the brutality the truth beneath the narrator's raw story is heartbreaking and yet there remains a faint sense of hope the power and complexity of this little book make it a breathtaking read","188":"justin torres' debut novella we the animals is raw and visceral in its telling of the coming of age of three mixed race brooklyn boys through the innocent eyes of the youngest it pulls no punches in describing the dysfunction and violence of the parents both two young when they began their family and the sheer hopelessness of ever finding a better life for their children whom you are never sure they don't despise or themselves in whom the self loathing is prevalant but the strongest vein of emotion is in the loss of innocence that is experianced by the youngest brother both emotionally and physically as he grows from seven years old into young adulthood and the stunning impact it has on the family as a whole it has a sense of truth to it much like winter's bone and recognizing my saints before it this is a very short novel but will stay with you long after the reading","189":"a gorgeous taut impeccably written novel about the unique bonds that hold family members together even as they're being pulled apart in 125 pages justin torres manages to construct a vivid and intricate emotional world earning him a place in the pantheon of great contemporary authors this is a truly original coming of age story that felt more tangible and visceral than any book in recent recollection to say that torres writes honestly does him a great disservice justin torres writes the truth","190":"the young boy's experience is visceral and troubling and there were moments of sheer heartache as a reader knowing that it is a too common experience at times i had to put the book down to simply pause and absorb what was happening it was a quick read and one that will likely remain with me for quite some time","191":"powerful vignettes that add up to a living breathing and quite moving portrait of a tense childhood the book's first chapter demands that you pay attention to justin torres and what he has to say but the ending comes out of nowhere and leaves you or maybe just me wondering what just happened overall a great quick read looking forward to justin torres next one","192":"this review has been hidden because it contains spoilers to view it click here first off i should tell you now that i am super analytical in my reading i feel that every word chapter scene carries much more weight than the words on the page because writing is a torturous endeavor ask any author with that said this book is a very quick read that has a lot packed into it my biggest problem one that i seem to have with too many latino male authors is the portrayal of their mothers this particular book reminded me too much of piri thomas' mother in down these first off i should tell you now that i am super analytical in my reading i feel that every word chapter scene carries much more weight than the words on the page because writing is a torturous endeavor ask any author with that said this book is a very quick read that has a lot packed into it my biggest problem one that i seem to have with too many latino male authors is the portrayal of their mothers this particular book reminded me too much of piri thomas' mother in down these mean streets and the mothers in junot diaz' short story drown in his collection of short stories by the same name these mothers are written as these needy women who will always need a man be it there husbands boyfriends or son to prevent them from shattering into a million pieces in we the animals there's a scene where the whole family goes for a swim and the mother and her youngest are the only ones who can't swim the mom needs the father around to have something to hold on to when the dad leaves them both to fend for themselves the mother starts to drown and claws at her son to get to the surface this idea that the mother needs her children or husband to keep her head above has become redundant in these books all the faults of the mother are amplified while the dad's transgressions are minimized but yet his actions are the ones that should be the most scaring the mother does the best she can out of a shitty situation she's always there for her kids even when she's at her lowest the father however constantly abandons them is always sabotaging his family's chance at a better life and yet those instances in the book are written just to give context to the mother's neediness her shortcomings and failures don't get me wrong i'm fully aware that there are situations where a mother can fail her children i'm not saying it's not possible what i am saying is that in stories where you have both parents present the authors will voice their grievances with their mothers aggressively while the father's faults are chalked up to a boys will be boys mentality its come to the point where i'm growing tired of reading books particularly fictional auto biographies that are written by male latino authors i hope to be pleasantly surprised one day more","193":"beautifully written extremely heartfelt and engaging i only wish there was more to the ending left feeling very wanting","194":"superb so much story in so few words","195":"this book contains some of the most beautiful language i've read in some time it is as poetic as it is relatable the writing is not overly flashy and it is not obscure each sentence captures a general but capital t true feeling and crystallizes it into a fresh perspective the author's ability to compact so much feeling such realized characters into so small a space without lapsing from his lyrical phrases well that's truly enviable","196":"so i read this today and now i am sitting here trying not to cry i can't tell you what it's about i mean i can tell you the short version about these boys who live in new york and their parents are so angry and so fierce and these boys the book escalates as it goes along it's not a very long book either which means that the increasing anxiety of the reader me goes uphill quickly and then suddenly the book is almost over and the narrative hovers on the precipice another author would have stopped there or turned the car around justin torres just pushes the story off the edge and the reader with it it's incredibly beautiful and incredibly sad and sometimes there is great seething joy","197":"i'm torn between four and five stars i hope that this author continues to write stories that bring you right into the moment the family i could hear it and see it wonder why and how could they continue just read it","198":"maybe one of the most disturbing books i've ever read but amazing amazing writing i feel like i've been there through out the story with the family","199":"raw and real beautifully written loved every second","200":"the chapters all seemed random i also found this book on a list of books that will make you cry i never even came close the prominent feeling was wtf","201":" lyrically written entirely evocative and full of real flawed and vivid characters but i wish it had been longer the first two thirds of the novella deals with the narrator at seven the youngest of three brothers and was very realistic and poetic at once but the last third as the narrator is 17 and struggling to deal with his own homosexuality was such a quick and sharp jump from the first part of the book i wish there had been more of a bridge but the entire thing was written amazingly well i just wanted more to get me from here to there","202":"some beautiful writingan honest and raw coming of age","203":"fast sparse writing with the tension of alluded to violence and the naive perspective of a young boy can't say it has stuck with me","204":" there is something about we the animals that pushes the reader forward perhaps it is in how it begins we wanted more that speaks as much about the characters in this novel as it does the movement of the reader through its pages i wanted to learn more about these brothers and their family and their life it is a tough life that begins when the youngest of the brothers is six but it is more than a story about growing up these boys mixed race children born to teenage parents who obviously don't have enough to get by exist in a tension that you know has to break and you don't know how it will there are these moments throughout the novel's time span when you think it will break that you think something will change you're not sure if it's for the better or for the worse you're not sure if it's an end or a beginning and all this tension you feel is what these boys are feeling what the youngest of these boys tell ultimately it is this narrator's story told through a simple voice that captures at times moments of awe striking insight and detail justin torres wraps the complex in layers of innocence but also complicates innocence as it juts against the complex i leave this book thinking about about how innocence can be an almost false impression about truths and lies and how you might not be able to pull them apart somewhere in the madness i leave this book not wanting more because more might be too much at the same time the book reaches a point that is too much because it has to be because maybe too much is what is needed for everything to be okay","205":"at only 125 pages i read this book in about an hour and was very disappointed due to its poetic prose it received very high reviews on various websites and was even on the book review in people magazine unfortunately it paints a very bad portrait of puerto ricans and feeds in to horrible stereotypes","206":"read for unapologetic perspective and temporal shift we i you the bones of novel in a novella withholding information some chapters read like micro nonfiction others like short stories and others still like prose poems","207":"as i was reading this i couldn't quite put my finger on what was not jiving with me then i read the bio and saw the author is a graduate of the iowa writers' workshop of course this book is trying too hard to look like it wasn't trying too hard the melodramtic themes of domestic violence poverty and sexual awakening did not manipulate me the story is a little over 120 pages but i was bored i've never been a fan of the vignette style of novel i did not like house on mango street and so it really keep me from getting into it and it didn't feel conhesive at all the writing was striking in points but overall it read like a first draft a lot of my critiques are of personal preference so please keep that in mind and pick it up if the things i don't like are what you like","208":"there is a profound sadness at the heart of this book a sadness which is counterpointed by the frenzy of emotion and language inherent in the youthful pov of the three brothers at the start the language sweeps you up and carries you along in its storm as you parse its ferocity to read the struggles of the impoverished multicultural family that said i thought that the direction it turned in the final chapters felt tacked on and inorganic with the rest of the piece kind of a insert deviant sexual awakening bildungsroman here","209":"a series of vignettes told in spare lyrical prose about three brothers growing up with a caucasian mother and an often abusive puerto rican father beautifully written","210":" a small novel with enormous power we the animals is a bit of a whirlwind but in a way that i absolutely loved torres's voice is one you want to listen to as we are taken through the narrator's childhood memories crazy ones involving tomato fights and more emotional ones dealing with the painful reality of suffering by the hand of his abusive father from love and loss to solitude and unity to comfort and fear no emotion is left untouched in this chaos of a youth the hauntingly beautiful writing and storytelling qualities of this book are what make it so phenomenal if this is what the next generation of coming of age novels will be i'm sold","211":"this is a tiny but powerful novel so much emotion packed into it that it leaves you a little breathless at the end","212":"wow what a debut i can say with confidence that this book does what few can do anymore it enveloped me and put me somewhere else there were moments that were so spot on when it comes to just being a kid i was sent deep into my own memories anyway i never talk about the stories in my reviews just my reaction this is a fast read that punches you in the gut and leaves scars and maybe also good things too","213":"beautiful and disturbing impossible not to get enveloped and terrified but also impossible not to keep reading despite this","214":"i'd actually give this a 3 5","215":" the majority of the book is a series of condensed memories furious and effective i thought for sure this would be 125 pages of 5 star material while not the second coming of hemingway there was a poignancy in his brevity that seemed to give all the sentences more weight a simple description of a simple act paired with a comment from a character spoke more than the endless bloviating from some authors why 3 stars the book ended horribly it's completely out of tune with the rest of the book none of the last 3 chapters makes sense or is alluded to by the previous 100 or so pages we suddenly jump years beyond where the book takes place all the characters have aged and become different people including the narrator a horrible thing happens the end some folks are clearly angry at it but i simply scratched my head and thought okay","216":"a gorgeous heartbreak of a book most of which is told in first person plural until the shift when the narrator brings himself into focus when he is made then he separates himself from his brothers and becomes his own fractured person bursting brutally out of childhood and birthed into adulthood","217":"it was okay i enjoyed the prose and style but the substance was lacking the story unfurls pretty well but in hindsight is nothing too original or interesting but the narrator's voice was sort of comforting and relatable weirdly","218":"we the animals is short each chapter is a short vignette but i savored every word of it even re reading sections because the writing is so poetic the first paragraph of the first chapter we wanted more is like a prose poem throughout we the animals torres captures both the magic and terror of childhood and brings it to life so lyrically you'll be mesmerized until the very end","219":"the writing is extremely poetic but i didn't much like the way it was chapters and chapters of their childhood and then they're all grown up and this drastic thing happens and then it ends what year is this that they chose that solution how could they do that","220":"short sucker punched do yourselves a favor and read it immediately","221":"did not like the ending became very difficult to understand","222":"this book is poetry crushing heartbreaking poetry reading this book was honestly like experiencing first hand the narrator's sometimes joyous often frightening troubled childhood all of those mixed feelings were there buried in the prose i'm going to have to go back through this book and look at it piece by piece as a lesson because it's beautifully constructed and deeply moving","223":"3 5 stars i loved the writing the interrupted dreaminess of it and there are a few scenes that are going to be with me for a while but in the end there was just something missing from the story itself","224":"good so good right up to the end the book has this great tone to it and it captures boyhood in a way that reminded me of being a kid more than just about any other thing i can remember there's a very strange thing that happens between brothers you sort of love each other but also sort of hate each other and at times you really can act like as the book suggests animals as one of the early chapters says there's never enough food or affection or daylight or anything there isn't enough of anything ever what the book really got at in a way you don't see a lot is what i've always thought of as the true nature of sibling relationships i think the cliche thing people say about family is something along the lines of i beat the hell out of my brother but if anyone else messed with him i'd knock his block off or his lights out or him into next week honestly though that feels like revisionist history to me and a lazy attempt to capture how strange it is to be with these kids who you are told to love yet represent your main competition in a lot of ways each brother is his own country competing for resources each brother is his own army alternately making alliances and being the victim of them each brother is his own boy but he's also tied inexorably to these other boys without choice in the matter the writing is crisp short and does a great job of straddling the line between being a child narrator and an adult reminiscing which makes it all feel so so real the objection i have to the book is about the last 20 pages when the narrator does a flash forward of maybe ten years is forced out of the closet after his family finds his journal and describes his being put in some sort of psychiatric treatment it's not that this was any sort of problem for me and there's actually a poignant feeling of the bond between the three brothers dissolving and this chain of events is definitely what makes this possible but the rest of the book felt so slow so small so moment to moment that to leap forward and change the characters so much after we've been watching them grow up in pieces was less satisfying i don't want to say the ending ruined the book or anything like that i really don't think that's possible and honestly it probably had less to do with the ending and more to do with the fact that it ended it's a gorgeously written book and just when i thought each of the short sections might be falling flat the wind would change direction and blow the dust off a beautiful sometimes savage revelation it worked for me in a big way i wonder if perhaps it was that i wasn't ready to leave that world just yet growing up you're always ready to leave whatever age you are when you're 15 you'd take a pill that made you 16 in a heartbeat it's only later when you think how sometimes you'd like to be back there how it felt safe how punches and being it were a lot less scary than the stuff that happens when you're older so i wonder i wonder if there are times when i want to go back there and i wonder if maybe reading this book i wanted to walk away thinking the characters would never have to leave that place","225":"3 5 stars short haunting tale of brothers growing up in dysfunction didn't like the ending but great writing","226":"such an incredible book i am in envy of the author's talent","227":" an easy entertaining read justin torres' talent lies in the ability to not only give the reader a true feel for life as one of three boys in a puerto rican family in'70s brooklyn but doing it through tight succinct stories funny raw and sometimes devastating he pulls you in through the day to day of this dysfunctional family given the straightforward style of torres' storytelling some of the intermittent symbolism comes across as overwritten and out of place but overall some truly amazing writing and a good book","228":"as i read this short powerful story i could just see the crazy energetic household where these raucous brothers lived boy energy maximized sweet funny and packs punch in a few pages great coming of age story","229":"a quick but gripping read from first time novelist torres looking forward to reading more of his work in the future","230":" i'm giving this book three stars because i'm not sure how i feel about it three feels neutral the writing was amazing the story is told in short vignettes mostly through action and dialogue with little description and no scenes to link the vignettes together all the deeper meaning of the book is in the subtext and the details but the reader still gets a complete understanding how the family that trick is amazing and impressive to read i admire the writing in this book especially the switch in pov at the end but the story is hard to read it's not comfortable and the ending isn't a resolution it's an ending it was unnerving and unsatisfying i want to know what happens next and the ending just drops off i suppose that was the point but i just wasn't crazy about the point","231":"beautiful sad couldn't stop reading it","232":"so i read this in a day which with my add is quite a feat i'd read a lot of reviews that praised it as a masterpiece i'm not sure it's that but it was good all the same the last few chapters contain a revelation that i'm not sure fits too well but the general theme of family and upbringing both defining and restraining you is a point that's made quite powerfully here","233":"this tale pretty short novel at 125 pgs to be intriguing in sections and told from a different point of view the youngest brother of three it was a quick read but the story never fully gripped me unfortunately i found the chapters to be choppy and a bit disorienting with no real focus but perhaps that was the author's intent","234":" terrific book about the nature of intense passion about finding out the truth of our nature whether animal like and untamed or human all too human this book resonates with me for a number of reasons one being the honest story telling of the book the ending was sad but necessary for a book like this the book is brilliant with how it captures mental illness and delusion and what it feels like to be gay and have passion and heart in a cruel and limited world the book hits a powerful chord of pain and heart ache the book is heartbreaking because the close brothers drift apart in the end when the tragedy strikes as if to say nothing good can last forever the book makes you rethink what love means and is be the animal","235":"i'm really feeling like i missed something with these people putting all these red stars","236":"this book really was amazing the writing is perfection each chapter was breathtaking and could stand on its own as an exquisite example of how to write a brief grab you by the throat and never let you go story the interweaving of the first person singular and first person plural was masterful the subject matter is tough at times so this is not for everyone for me though we the animals is up there among the best books i've ever read","237":"a beautifully written coming of age novel that reads much like an extended prose poem i also keep thinking of the whole work as a piece of visual art the language is so sparse and deliberate each chapter feels like a carefully drawn pencil sketch the rhythm of the language also builds and propels you through the narrative in a very deliberate way i am not sure this narrative is for everyone i think if you were expecting a standard novel with rich character development and rigid plotting you would be dissapointed i get a sense that the subject matter isdifficult for the writer and he had to come to it from a distant and obscured voice to tell the story i appreciate this book for what it is accomplishing and i think it is worth reading","238":" i read this book a while ago i guess novella is the right term actually and while i don't remember the tiny details anymore i will never forget the stark raw heart wrenching language in which it was written maybe it's because i'm raising boys maybe it's because of the subject matter but the portrayal of the relationship between the brothers just ripped me open this book struck me as honest and unafraid dark and beautiful i guess it falls into the realm of literary fiction so if you're looking for a pat ending you won't find it here read it for the way the story's told the perfect cadence the stark luxury of the words","239":"nice short novella the world of puerto rican males is something i really have no witness to so i'll generalize and say i liked it but the stuff junot diaz writes moves me more","240":"not my usual kind of writing at all but i am always on the lookout for adult novels that teens might find right for them and this short novel of mixed race hispanic brothers growing up poor felt to me a cousin of the house on mango street with chapters often having a self contained feel to them and writing that glows with a young child's sense of the world also this would be a strong title for queer teens though it is not immediately apparent","241":"jt leroy voiced by a real real boi junot diaz stripped of his douchebag apologia and passive prescriptiveness chabon bret easton ellis eugenides et al disabused of their fey mysticisms","242":"downloaded this because my book club chose it it's a quick read and a good story","243":"i wish there were 1 2 stars 2 5 for this one coming of age story about three brothers primarily the youngest ending is fast like pages are missing","244":"i'm speechless is this fiction a memoir short story poetry there is poetry prose in every paragraph it's raw loving abusive forgiving unfinished like any member of a family we each have our own versions of the events that shaped us makes me wonder about the author how fictionalized it is like augusten burroughs novels i feel the author wanted to express his ugly truth but perhaps needed to soften the blow a little by making us think it's all fiction i want to take him in my arms and tell him he's worthy loved remarkable","245":"\"now a boy of all wild beasts the most difficult to manage \" platosmall books can pack quite a punch and this debut novel is a prime example it follows three young brothers of mixed heritage as they blast through childhood in upstate new york with a volatile father and a hard working mostly absent mother at turns funny sad violent and touching the edgy prose blossoms like a dark flower \"we made kites trash bags on strings we ran slipped the knees of our dungarees all grass stained we got up ran choked ourselves half to death with laughter but we found speed and our trash kites soared \"","246":"we the animals is 125 pages and a very quick read although you really want to savor the language in the book so it is worth really taking your time with it the book is a piece of art and there is no other book that i have read that uses american english like justin did in this book it also doesn't hurt that justin is an amazing speaker and if you have a chance to see him on a book tour take advantage of it he is funny charming witty and full of fun","247":" \"quiet was as close to happiness as we would ever get\"when i was younger i had the very naive idea that most families were pretty much like mine i'm older now and i no longer think that told from the perspective of the youngest son of three sons we the animals is the story of a profoundly dysfunctional family it's not without joy and not without love but these people are very messed up the interracial parents exhibit the kind of passion that is frequently explosive the sons are rowdy affectionate neglected and perhaps caught in the same cycle of poverty as their parents debut novelist justin torres writes beautifully and with affection for his characters the tale is told episodically almost as a collection of linked stories at the beginning the unnamed narrator is just turning seven and at the very powerful and moving conclusion he is in his mid teens except it isn't really a conclusion it's just where the story happens to end it would certainly be interesting to revisit these characters later in life the book comes in a brief 144 pages but they're an intense 144 pages and the book didn't need to be any longer were i to summarize the book in a single sentence it would be the following quote \"ma stood up from her chair lifted the receiver and placed it back down again in one quick movement--and for a moment nothing maybe even a full minute long enough for our ears and clenched muscles to relax long enough to remember and realize fully something we had long suspected that silence was absolution that quiet was as close to happiness as we would ever get \" this is a family drama worth reading","248":"wonderful lyrical storytelling incredibly brief but wanting for little this book is beautiful and spare the story it tells is at times difficult but because of its brevity not overwhelming the trade off to this quick pacing and spare style is that it struggles to develop its characters at times","249":"reading the opening chapter of justin torres' debut novel really a novella i had the feeling i was in for something really special and while this coming of age story of three bi racial brothers and largely autobiographical was powerful moving disturbing and even funny throughout for me it just fizzled out as it went along while i agree with other reviewers that the ending was quite abrupt out of left field it provide enough of a jolt in a good way to bump my rating up by a half star 3 5 stars but rounding down to 3 for goodreads borrowing a page from reality singing shows i'd say torres didn't blow me away and is a bit rough but he has obvious talent an interesting quality and shows great potential so i'd advance him to the next round i e would look forward to his next work","250":" this is a beautifully written short novel the language is poetic and precise and the relationships between the three brothers and their parents is well developed it's a great read i do wish that the book's conclusion was a bit more developed the narrator a young gay man is perfectly drawn in terms of his own sense of being different in the world but near the end when he actually reveals his sexual orientation the book starts to feel rushed and the conclusion with the narrator being carted off to a mental hospital smacks of the stinging conclusions of many pre stonewall books and films the queer are killed sent away somehow banished this was a disappointment","251":"this book was reminiscent of sandra cisneros's house on mango street if you like short stories specifically conflicted poetic dramas this is a great read","252":"beautifully written sweet and sad these are moments snapshots really of the lives of three young brothers told by the youngest their father is a hot headed under employed puerto rican their mother is a delicate white factory worker their lives together are marked with intense emotion whether it be love or rage or sadness and the bonus is that this all comes packaged in just 126 pages","253":"4 5 5 starsthese short vignettes construct an intense portrait of three boys growing up they do not have an easy life it is continuous ups and downs i'm actually finding i love this style of book you can tell the author spends a great amount of detail in the words he is putting down like poetry every word counts of course this style lends itself to you wanting more but in the end you still come away satisfied","254":"the writing was pretty but i couldn't really feel the characters kind of like watching a really pretty screen saver with thought provoking images but not getting to actually see the movie","255":"more a series of interconnected vignettes than a traditional novelistic narrative the book provides a wonderful glimpse into the life of this puerto rican family the relationships are complex and poignant but the writer doesn't fall into the trap of cliche or melodrama the moments are both sincere and revealing and i became immediately invested in this story of a boy growing up in a household that was far from perfect but filled with warmth and affection the language is lean but beautiful i look forward to reading more from this author","256":" this is a fast read that examines the relationships we have with our siblings in a detail that is surprisingly intricate for a novella so short it's told over a series of short vignettes and told from the point of view of the youngest of three brothers like a lot of what i've been reading lately it's character driven and exploratory examining relationships more than events it's hard to say anything about this book without feeling like you're giving too much away i've written and deleted several paragraphs in an attempt to review it and honestly in the time you spend reading reviews you could probably have read the novel itself so here's a good way to sum up my experience with this book i missed my train stop by not one but two stations because i was too busy crying to get off and go to work that should help","257":"i don't usually care for coming of age stories generally there are too many cliched tropes and canned characters but this story of a chaotic family narrated by the youngest son connected w me the book is full of well crafted sentences fine details and a sense of anxious foreboding while the timeline of the book is undefined the ending feels rushed the majority of the story is spent on the complex family dynamics while very little time is spent on the break up of the whole","258":"although this book is only 125 pages there is nothing little about it what a ride going from little boy giddiness and pop guns then plummeting way too quickly to drunken fathers and beaten mothers this novel is open honest real and painful it makes me extremely grateful for my parents","259":"interesting short story about three brothers growing up","260":"this is an excellent well written book it's humorous sad poignant and at times depressing yet i highly recommend it","261":"i found some of the brutality and the wreckage to be somewhat difficult the writing was good and some of the family love and loyalty were interesting to see in light of the other family problems","262":" an absolutely stunning debut coming of age novel from justin torres about the pains and pleasures of family and discovering one's identity both of and apart from the family unit three young boys hungry for life and threatening to consume everything attempt to plumb the mysteries of their parents's relationship their relation to and with each other and their nigh inscrutiable futures as they play wrestle hurt plead and help each other through long days and longer nights with wild unpredictable parents who are barely in control of their own passions and tempers raging against the walls of their small house their economic situation and the constraints of being puerto rican immigrants in new york each character is drawn in sharp relief painted with the loves and sorrows that come from the struggle to define one's self and find one's freedom each word in this short novel is so carefully chosen so perfectly wrought despite the heart shattering ending the reader is left desperately wanting more this is the first book in a long while that i want to begin again immediately after finishing read this now","263":"sparse beautifully written somewhat brutal novel i liked it but i didn't love it it is short but feels well developed","264":"the best book i've read in a long time masterful heartrending","265":"short little book well written heart breaking memoir","266":"this book is lyrical sublime and inspirational read now","267":" my brothers and me flailing our arms rising the world telescoping away falling up past the stars through space and blackness floating upward until we were safe as seed wrapped up in the fist of god painful to read every word like a scab still raw from scratching fingernails each sentence a punch but so so beautiful narrated by the youngest brother the story is about childhood and never realizing how dysfunctional your household is it's about family and how they hurt you and save you at the same time it's about brothers and growing up and change there is also subtle social commentary about race and its real impact on people's daily lives","268":"more like 3 1 2 stars written almost as a collection of short stories tells of 3 brothers growing up in brooklyn with an abusive father and enabling mother painful at times and very real","269":"this is one of the most fantastic coming of age novels you'll ever read each chapter is episodic yet when read whole it provides a shocking portrayal of one boy's childhood in upstate new york the details in the writing which starts out first person plural help to bring the story of a poor mixed race family to life the unnamed narrator has always been 'one of the boys ' but as he grows up and finds himself and his own identity he starts to find himself drifting from his two brothers and his parents torres writes with such poignancy and depth and his words are fresh and innovative in a way that many novels nowadays aren't a must read","270":"his stories are so lyrical they're almost prose poems but this wonderful writing is always in service to his stories as a novel it reads almost like a masculine counterpoint to house on mango street the last two sections completely lost me but until that point it's wonderful","271":" we the animals is a novel that was written to make the reader emote it did not work on me i did not feel this novel at all it was simplistic it was full of cliche and stereotype it was in a word boring yes there was flowery language and imagery that put me into upstate new york with this mixed race family but it was for naught i did not find that narrator's tale interesting instead i wondered why the author chose the youngest of the three boys as his narrator the reason for that too turned out to be cliche i was very disappointed in this book especially since it was written by a person of color some of the descriptions of the puerto rican father and biracial boys were disturbing especially compared to those of the white mother they fed into the stereotypes the author used throughout the novel that undermined the struggle and search for identity this novel was supposed i believe to showcase man what a disappointment","272":" this book is an uncomfortable read and i mean that in the best possible way the language is nothing short of poetic it is striking lyrical and unforgiving the subject matter is the exact opposite it is brutal in its nature animalistic mean and all too real together the two elements weave a gripping and devastating narrative about a young boy as he navigates a life of poverty an abusive family and his developing sexuality the short chapters allow the reader to take it all in in manageable gulps but the boy's sense of desperation and longing still penetrate a must read for anyone looking for an example of gorgeous writing unique narrative style and or a beautiful look at a merciless brutal reality","273":" torres writes three quarters of a great book then falls short at the end the book is the story of three brothers living in upstate ny the boys are at the lower end of the financial scale and are self described half breeds mom is white dad is puerto rican for most of the book narrated by the youngest of the three brothers the writing is lyrical and really gives you an idea of what it is like to be a brother but the end while plausible seems written by someone else and is almost too terse as compared with the rest of the book the ending snuffs out the magic of the majority of the book","274":"clearly at least semi autobiographical lyrical swift harsh","275":"i heard the first two pages of this read by the author on npr now that i am reading it i am thrilled i heard about it that day the prose is raw and vivid and heart wrenching and lovely","276":"i was torn between giving this book three and four stars the writing is strong the relationships are tension filled and passionate it is the choppiness of the book that bothers me i found it easy to put down and come back to later because there was no continuity of story good writing and strong characters","277":"loved the book was very interested in reading because my youngest daughter went to high school with his brother and the fact that he was writing about an area in ny that we had lived in for 30 years was originally recommended to me from another b'ville transplant","278":" start of the book i think this is a book that needs to be read a few times to fully understand it to have it resonate undoubtedly it was a startling read to read about the troubled boys and to see how the cycle of poverty effects even the brightest this book hurt it hurt because it was so true and you yearned for someone to escape the life that the boys were living and they didn't in fact as everything spiraled more and more out of control it became harder to read each bite sized chapter beautifully written weighed me down it's not a book i would normally pick up and maybe that's why i've given it an average rating i liked it but i wasn't prepared to read about the frustrating circumstances the shocking content was confronting and that was definitely the point you should read this if you're mentally prepared to be troubled by a book if you want a deeper understanding of the noxious cycle of poverty and if you're prepared to give a slice of your heart away to three boys who need it most end of the book","279":"this review has been hidden because it contains spoilers to view it click here this book left me wanting more i like how the writer pulled you into this dysfunctional family but it left me hanging in the end this was a good read but would have liked more closure he had so much potential and then nothing a little disappointed i guess that's how short stories are","280":"written in the style of a memoir strongly instinctual and sparely poetic we the animals examines the confines of belonging to a family in this case part of which means belonging to a pack of brothers a coming of age story that is tragically beautiful","281":" i found this book difficult to rate more than once i was going to stop reading it but the power of torres writing wouldn't allow it it was difficult to read a coming of age story for three brothers a story of a violent dysfunctional family with glimpses of love and hope each vignette of a chapter had a single point i felt that near the end of the book the last two to three chapters something had been left out the ending seemed disjointed and left me wondering what i felt no connection to any of the five characters a debut","282":"soooo disappointing especially after all the accolades i don't know what all the fuss was about","283":"this book just speak to me like it seems to for some other people who have rated it","284":"call it a novel novelette memoir epic poem or whatever you will remember specifics of your own childhood happy and sad while you read this i long for the day no child experiences this i wanted to hug every character in this book i felt the heaviness of their lives this guy can write i'm gonna read it again right now","285":" originally reviewed for the skinny magazine an autobiographical account of a childhood in upstate new york we the animals tells the story of three mixed race brothers born to very young parents growing up in a volatile household with little money and less stability torres' words sear through the pages bringing to life the crunch of boots through snow the tension that envelopes every member of the family when a parent is stressed the narrator's private fears about his own difference and the giddiness to be found in moments when the boys hit back at their unfair surroundings the most significant moments of the young storyteller's life are anchored by a switch from first to third person and from past to present tense as if they continue to be replayed on film somewhere having happened to someone else the reader like the narrator can never tell when somebody will snap when an account of carefree playing will turn into violence and yet the boys come back up for air time and time again fighting each other and fighting to survive this is a devastating heartbreaking beautifully written debut one that somehow through its painful vignettes still manages to shine with love","286":"torres does a wonderful job of illustrating family scenes the book works off of the experiences of the youngest character in the family showing the world that makes him the ending was disappointing as it takes a twist that comes from nowhere i would have preferred if he built to it","287":"wow this is a powerful little book 128 pages the relationship between three brothers a mother and father is extremely intense and violent i was intimidated by the violence and the animal behavior but think the writing was very good","288":"i never really felt fulling invested in this this story i loved the language the descriptions the scenery it made me sad in the end i wasn't expecting a sad ending even though all the characters were i felt detached","289":"a coming of age story of three brothers who are raised without any supervision it is a story of a horribly dysfunctional family there is violence and abuse but still there is a bond between the brothers this book is well written but is very dark without any redeeming moments it is mercifully short 125 pages","290":"with a prose style as lyrical as james baldwin's and an eye for the plight of the rural poor as sharp as russell banks's and raymond carver's torres carefully leads the way to the night i am made the penultimate chapter guaranteed to turn readers inside out the night i am made hit like a flurry of hard punches and thus to this reader elevated we the animals into the realm of great american fiction i can't wait for more from this amazing writer","291":"the book is almost like a long prose poem each sections stands on its on","292":"i enjoyed this book immensely i could relate to the family my mother is german irish and my father was latino in terms of how there's this sense of dual identity and not quite fitting in while my childhood was not as intense as the author's there was much with which i could identify and it was great to see their sense of family and how they supported each other almost unconditionally","293":"tender rendering of childhood told in an evocative plural voice short accessible sensitive decidedly lyrical and the author young ambitious has interesting things to say about fictionalizing memory and autobiography","294":" from the first few sentences this book casts a magical spell that transports readers into a struggling bi racial family's home to witness its reality brokenness frailty fleeting joys and yes even innocence what struck me immediately was torres' vivid descriptions conjured out a sparse economy of words adding just the right nuances to give the book a sweeping emotional appeal in this coming of age novel the vignettes of boyhood are spot on ripe with age appropriate balances of wild abandon awkwardness confusion and tenderness torres changes course however in the last 15 20 pages completely taking the book into unexpected terrain the effect while dissatisfying is more than accurate in the final unraveling and ultimate freefall of a family worn all to thin by its challenges","295":" saw this book on the library shelf and it caught my eye i checked it out to add to the stack of books i was taking on a long trip i read it and was really impressed it's a short insightful look at one family what i found most impressive was the author's writing style justin torres is an excellent writer story aside it is some of the best writing i have come across in a while two thumbs up it's quick read and very interesting it's even worth reading just to check out his beautiful writing style","296":"ok i'm glad this was short although i finished it i didn't really get it and would not recommend it it made me sad","297":"hauntingly beautiful so many vignettes bubbled up from an unmapped depth and made me think 'this is a gifted writer '","298":"a quick captivating read torres' style is exactly what i appreciate rhythmic prose surprising imagery and elegant story weaving go read it","299":" i remember my delight at hearing torres on the diane riehm show and his palpable discomfort at some of the questions she was asking him ones that would for sure leave me tongue tied but which her usual writerly guests dispatched with ease i was like holy shit here's a real writer and the experience of reading this book a series of fragments and short episodes bears out that initial impression though not all the short sections are equally impressive torres can do a killer languagey tone poem and a lot less impressively a straight narrative but rarely both in the same section the ones that work like the first section are really great charged up and hallucinatory pieces that capture the overheated feeling of growing up i think the ending is a little abrupt and i'm not sure i feel as warmly towards paps as torres means for me to but reservations aside this is a really satisfying and very short read i'm interested to see what's next","300":"they were quite a dysfunctional family but it gave me insight into what it might be to live in a dysfunctional family the animal metaphor was carried well throughout the book however at the end it was a bit obvious i liked the fact that it wasn't a day by day account but a sporadic peep into key moments of their lives i think the writing really fit this type of story i wouldn't say i enjoyed it because it is about a very dysfunctional family but i liked how the book was written and portrayed it was a very gritty and real book and for that i applaud it quote of the bookjust to set it up it's his birthday and his mother is telling him she'd like him to stay 6 so that he doesn't start pushing her away and she doesn't have to harden her heart and love him like a big boy and at the end of this plea he grabbed her bruised swollen cheeks and kisses her the pain traveled sharp and fast to her eyes pain opened up her pupils into big black disks she ripped her face from mine and shoved me away from her to the floor she cussed me and jesus and the tears dropped and i was seven","301":"a gorgeous painful poetic book","302":" i think this book was well written some of the scenes are beautifully expressed and it is incredibly evocative but i really didn't like it this book was brutal on almost every level there is i read it for book club not knowing what it was and i was not in the mood for that kind of darkness which might be influencing my opinion right now the constant abuse hunger instability and then major twist at the end were unpleasant i really didn't see the vendication for the characters and family that i have heard others did i don't care that there was one scene in the bathroom where the mom and dad seemed in love it didn't change all the horror they inflicted in other scenes etc i do think it is a fascinating view into an abusive household and it was interesting to watch the ebb and flow of the relationships within the family as they were abused protected forgotten etc i did think the ending was disjointed and extreme it would have been smoother with a bit of a lead up to where the protagonist ended up but oh well i think it will be interesting to discuss at book club since some absolutely loved it and others not so much","303":"it kept my attention reads very quickly and you will be amazed","304":"good quick read surprising sad ending","305":"overall i'd say i'm pretty apathetic about this book it wasn't bad but the only reason i completed it is probably because it is such a short read the style of prose he used was not typically something i enjoy and would have preferred a more fluid timeline and more character development on a positive note i enjoyed the closing of the book and felt that it picked up quite a bit in the final 15 20 pages","306":"a slam dunk first novel from this iowa writers' workshop alum in 125ish concentrated pages torres introduces a short story collection meets highly personal memoir i reread the last few chapters hoping for more pages to magically appear and keep me up even later","307":"i loved the start of this book but it got so dark and was uncomfortable to read just not my cup of tea","308":"loved this book it was heartbreaking but very well written","309":"read this it's short and intense lovely thanks carlos","310":"this was an interesting and powerful set of vignettes about a puerto rican american family i can't really say that i relate to them in any sort of experiential way but the writing is energetic and meaningful","311":"fierce vivid indelible moments abound in this lean volume that often reads more like poetry than fiction not surprised to read that author justin torres is a writer obsessed with the order and cadence of his words which have been laid on the page like music \"we wanted more \" the narrative begins hungry and wild in the voice of the youngest of three brothers growing like weeds yet thriving by some miracle on their parents' reckless yet absolute love for those looking for plot and a more conventional narrative the shift of mood and conclusion of the novel may confuse or disappoint but all told for readers wanting more torres is a writer to watch","312":"this is a real though flawed masterpiece though the author and publisher market it as a novel except in a loose sense this classification does not fully fit the book in fact is remarkable for how it is genre bending maybe an epic string of prose poems the care used in choice of words and choice of incidents recounted is masterfully poetic the book is also masterful in its depth of humanity and in its right on exploration of human experience not usually explored in serious literature this book is full of human warmth even in the context of social brutality there are chapters of this book which are as perfect so perfectly as perfectest can be toward the end however the book does present the reader with a most jarring and abrupt leap in some ways this leap is also the point at which it jumps the shark though the later chapters individually do in many ways rise to the same high level as the earlier chapters they prove inadequate by themselves they fragment the finale too much also after the leap the book's main character is seen in less and less of the warm light of his humanity till the ending does most effectively maybe even a little over much chill the reader to the bone and heart a journal kept by the young narrator is mentioned in these later chapters its appearance and discovery by the narrator's family is crucial to the finale perhaps the problem of the book's conclusion could be creatively solved if the entries of this journal were also presented to the book's readers this could be done in the body of the book maybe inserting them just before the abrupt leap or perhaps the journal in toto could be appended to the book much as phillips adds the full text of a purported shakespeare play to his recent novel the tragedy of arthur or as pasternak put the book of poems at the end of his novel dr zhivago","313":" 4 5 through a series of snapshots this book tells the story of a dysfunctional and abusive family and three brothers the pace of this book is very slow it offers no explanations and the story is so fragmented and each happening doesn't really relate to what happened in the previous snapshot this should be confusing but somehow it really isn't this book deals with the troubles of a mixed race poor family and this is some heavy heavy stuff i think even from the start the built up to the ultimate end this was very subtly done and really nicely pulled off too this story was surprisingly touching read very touching especially since this book was very short and it didn't leave it much time to build a connection between the reader and the characters the only thing stopping me from giving this a five star rating is that it took a while for me to fully get into it which is weird because i liked this book from the very start","314":"i liked this in general but found the constant jumping around a bit distracting it read more like a series of short stories vignettes than a novel and felt the ending sort of came out of the blue however torres's prose is beautiful and ultimately made me want to keep reading","315":"i found it a little perplexing","316":"beautifully written but too short and episodic for me to ever feel invested in any of the characters there were moments i couldn't put it down but overall i felt disappointed","317":" a visceral vision of three boys told from the perspective of the youngest growing up in near poverty with their white mother and proudly puerto rican father the household is charged with hormones the boys are constantly fighting scrapping running eating their parents frequently display their obvious sexual attraction but the family is also charged with the desperateness of their situation and they blame and hate each other just as fiercely as they love torres uses spare vibrant language to place the reader right beside the narrator as he discovers his true nature in this intense family","318":"literary fiction of colored people book read of the month of december 2011","319":"surprising ultra realistic story told by a child but somehow from a mature pov looking at his own dysfunctional but loving family by the end his family is much less loving towards him and isolates him while banding the rest of them together against him the book emphasizes throughout the different way people behave like animals instead of automatons","320":"finished this in a day beautiful raw and over too soon","321":"the prose has an oddly frenetic pace but is engaging a quick read but i'm not entirely sure what happened there are many gaps left for the reader to fill in for himself and much to wonder about what transpired after the close of the book","322":"a tiny book with a whole lot of impact this is the story of three brothers that i really wanted to like but couldn't because they were just not good the book explained why and how they were raised and it all made sense that they turned out the way they did but i just wanted a happier ending","323":"this one was a hard book to rate it is sure to stir up a great deal of emotion i felt like the boys in these stories need a good neck wringing the father needed a swift kick in the butt and the mother needed a heavy dose of sanity but the last story regarding the gay boy was so hard for me to take i suppose their could be some truth to it especially when being gay was considered a mental disorder but extremely hard for me to stomach","324":"this review has been hidden because it contains spoilers to view it click here you've read all the other reviews i am assuming so i'll get right to the point 1 undeniably it has a tight staccato workshopped feel to it to the point that i was dizzy and left feeling somewhat hollow by the technique and jerkiness there is too much self awareness in the writing as if it is constantly stating i never use adverbs i trim the fat i keep things on the beat and i'm not about to overwrite sure there are quite a few gems strewn throughout but nothing adding up to c you've read all the other reviews i am assuming so i'll get right to the point 1 undeniably it has a tight staccato workshopped feel to it to the point that i was dizzy and left feeling somewhat hollow by the technique and jerkiness there is too much self awareness in the writing as if it is constantly stating i never use adverbs i trim the fat i keep things on the beat and i'm not about to overwrite sure there are quite a few gems strewn throughout but nothing adding up to catharsis and the only thing that sticks for me is the retelling of the vibrant sexual curiosity and violent outburst we all experienced as children not the pseudo shock sexploitation that closed the book 2 i'm not getting into the puerto rican thing a lot of people have outed it as a cheap exploit i don't think that's the case 3 after page 100 the story sucker punches you with a shift not only in tone but in its authenticity as well i feel the author prematurely exploits a topic that needed much more exposition and development you literally get blind sided and not in a good way 4 the dialogue spoken by a seven year old or even a ten year old brother for the matter does not possess verisimilitude i can't believe it too wise and socially complex 5 i just hope the narrator is an adult looking back in time and not the seven year old reciting a tale in his childhood because if the latter is the case see critique point #4 more","325":"this book definitely exceeded my expectations i just finished it today and i can tell that it'll stick with me for awhile it's a coming of age type of story that is peppered with humor but overall it's pretty dark stuff this would be a good supplement to catcher in the rye for progressive high school readers there would be a lot of pissed off conservative moms though","326":"can't join the bandwagon on this one awkward and uncomfortable the ending did not work for me no coherence or grounded emotion but it does stay in my mind","327":" we the animals was decent for most of the book the story is nothing original or thought provoking but the writing was good i was planning on rating this higher until i started the last twenty pages or so the story abruptly shifts from one about three young brothers growing up with their not so great responsible parents to something else that takes place several years in the future though the reader is never given a clue how much time has passed the part of the story after this shift does not fit with what came before and feels forced and like an afterthought even though it was briefly foreshadowed by an earlier event","328":" this novel really a novella at 128 pages is constructed of a series of vignettes each tells a story of the lives of three young brothers between the ages of 10 and 7 the episodes are strung together like a spider's web each tenuously tied to the others by virtue of the characters and locale taken together they tell of three lives lived in poverty mitigated by the camaraderie of the siblings though their parents tried mightily to raise the three boys they often failed to be the support and example that youngsters so badly need consequently there are many illustrations of our young heroes behaving like puppies - mischievous full of play insensitive to their surroundings lacking thought as to the consequences of their actions the reader is left to wonder what kind of men the three become the fate of only one the youngest is somewhat sketchily drawn near the end of the book this \"novel\" like several others i've read recently \"say her name\" e g seems to be based more on the author's life and experiences than those of a fictional character it is difficult to discern where the fiction ends and the truth begins and the realism generated by the stories leaves one to believe that this is in fact mostly autobiographical justin torres is a bright star on the literary horizon his short story \"reverting to a wild state\" appeared in the new yorker magazine aug 1 2011 i would recommend reading this story in addition to the novel as it helps to paint a clearer picture of this young man's talent as a writer below is a link to a quick 90 second interview with torres about his book http www youtube com watch v ey2hfa grade b","329":"kind of wish there was half stars again because this is a solid 4 5 5 and future reads might even make me bump it a little higher they did compact vividly lyrical and incredibly powerful this is an astonishing debut just thinking about it for this review makes me want to read it again","330":"this is a story that is sad but speaks to me of resilience justin torres is talented very poetic i look forward to reading his next book","331":"i heard about this attending a panel discussion of new books at the tennessee book association meeting fall of last year the author's presentation at the time made me curious and when i picked up the book was struck by how skillfully he renders childhood perceptions the plot unfolds as the protagonist matures and his voice changes and deepens accordingly i recommend this one","332":"excellent book i am eager to read more books by this author","333":"reading we the animals is like sticking your finger in a light socket coming away all sparkly and jangled it's raw tenderness brought me to me knees its lyric prose lit the pages i was sorry when it ended","334":"devastating and beautiful","335":"not quite sure what to think of this one poetic writing but the characters were underdeveloped each chapter was like a miniature incomplete memoir it took an unexpected twist then abruptly ended","336":"this novel was alright but i appreciated it more as a writer than as a reader the story line was alright but it wasn't anything that i hadn't read before parents who ignore their children brothers who look after each other but one different from the rest it is all something i had read before what made the story interesting was the second person perspective that was employed it was beautifully written with great rhythm and vivid imagery but not a story i could become invested in i have to admit that i didn't see the ending coming at all but other than that the plot held no interest for me however everyone else in my class seemed to really enjoy it so i seem to be in the majority about it","337":"this is a short but powerful book an interesting look at a dysfunctional family particularly the three brothers i found the writing compelling and the ending both disturbing and moving","338":"one of the best opening chapters ever thought the book fizzled in the last couple chapters overall it was worth the read just wish he could wrapped it up with the same intensity that he had at the beginning","339":"this review has been hidden because it contains spoilers to view it click here wild wonderful book about 3 brothers 2 who are on the wild side and the narrator the parents are very young the family seems to be living just from hand to mouth and often the brothers are left to their own devices some chapters like the first one almost read like poetry and give a sense of the life these boys led the ending was surprising to me also there were hints in the book of things to come i just didn't want to think it wouldn't end all tied up in a pretty bow","340":"loved it justin torres paints a picture that is so familiar to me i loved his use of language","341":"great writing difficult and disturbing story subject","342":" i enjoyed quite a few things about this book what stood out to me most was the way that each word seemed to be have chosen meticulously to me it felt like a poem written in paragraphs and sometimes the descriptions were amusing because they were so unique but still so accurate i e calling the moon a toenail clipping i think the pacing of the story was all right it's someone's experience so it's hard to say it doesn't have direction but one thing i didn't like as much was the abruptness of the ending though i could follow along still at this point in the story the descriptions became more opaque and rushed it's the main complaint that i had the events didn't bother me as far as subject material other than the constant annoyance of a trio of boys causing havoc regardless of background this is always annoying there were some complaints about stereotypes but if it happened then i won't hold it against the author for telling us about it i thought what stood out most to me was the word choice and that's why i gave it the four primarily i didn't necessarily like or approve of everything that took place in the book but it definitely gave insight to a family that had its ups and downs it's hard to say who exactly to recommend this to perhaps someone who likes reading memoirs in general otherwise it's more or less a toss up","343":"loved it would have given it 5 stars but something was missing at the end wonderfully written though often times a tough read not for sensitive souls","344":"brilliant writing very visual i appreciate the storytelling ability demonstrated in this short novella by torres","345":"not a single word wasted in this brilliant novel engaging and heart wrenching with a twisty ending you won't see coming","346":"this novel is beatifully written in a spare and authentic voice told through the eyes of a young child a heartbreaking story is presented with a simple honesty and without bitterness a pleasure to read","347":" this is undoubtedly an amazing book with beautiful writing that compels you to tear through it in one sitting however the reason i didn't rate it higher is that something about it's length made me feel that the author wasn't quite mature enough to sustain something like this it seems like a book that went through a writing workshop where every word was pored over and perhaps over labored i look forward to seeing more from this writer to see what he is capable of but this is just a tantalizing debut and nothing more","348":"i thought this book was terrible i really wouldn't recommend it at all i don't get what all the hype is about","349":"fabulous incredible writing searing","350":"torres makes every word count and doesn't waste a sentence the language is beautiful and illuminating","351":"in this short novel the reader is thrown into a running jumping fighting laughing loving failing family of five three brothers -the narrator being the youngest - a white mother and puerto rican father while brief the novel deals with almost the entirety of the narrator's childhood and development into adulthood full review here","352":"this was one of the most intriguing works of literary fiction i have read in awhile i didn't know the hype around the book before i began reading it and i am glad i didn't because i think it would have forced me to find the book amazing in reality i could discover this on my own this is a very unique scenario for a published work a novel almost a novella these don't just get published easily and it's obvious he is an incredibly gifted writer very visceral writing style with poignantly beautiful yet tragic moments i love his vivid imagery and perception of his family and their upbringing it was an ethnic piece without being cliche and one dimensional while it was a powerful read it was also a short read i won't say easy but it was a short read definitely worth picking up","353":"how it was written from the youngest brother's perspective was what made the book beautiful his transition from being a seven year old curious boy to his teenage years when reality has already taken over the games they would play and dreams they used to have is just so poignant","354":"4 5 mr torres gets half a star for being so handsome a great little book i'm terribly excited to see what mr torres does next","355":"this little book packs a wallop","356":"thoughtful quick read","357":"i got this for 79p at a charity shop it was a quick read but not massively my cup of tea unfortunately","358":"an auspicious if slight debut torres is extremely talented he writes with vigor and passion but the novel feels a bit premature the material not sufficiently processed the plot not fully developed a professional literary community so eager to tout a new talent that it overpraises an underdone work does that talent a disservice i hope he gets the chance to do great work down the line and look forward to reading him again","359":"ann kingman one of her best of 2011","360":"while i loved the use of language that's why i gave it three stars in we the animals i felt a bit lost at the end of the novel once the narrator is hospitalized i found myself going back several pages to see if i missed something the hospitalization just seem to come out of nowhere and had no connection to the rest of the story a hundred pages in between might have made a world of difference and prevented the ending from feeling tacked on","361":" the only redeeming thing i can say about this book is the writing torres' writing style is very interesting and leaves you wondering and asking questions and since i read this for an university class that's literally all we did the first person plural is pretty rare form of writing now and sometimes it isn't done well or it's abandoned with no real reason just a oh i guess he got sick of it kind of thought torres actually took the time to figure out what he was doing with his perspective but ignoring that stylistic literary quirk we the animals does absolutely nothing for me once you turn the front cover over and hit the first page you are greeted with praise and acclaim from critics from basically every reputable literary news source and this goes on for seven full pages all this hype and acclaim for something that falls flat and leaves you confused and definitely not in a good way if this wasn't assigned for my class and the basis for one of our homework assignments i would've never picked this up and i would be $10 richer","362":"i don't know what to make of this story the language enchanted me at first but toward the end it got really strange i lost track of what was going on","363":"short story but mightily profound i was left feeling walloped emotionally and i love when a book can really knock me on my arse","364":"not sure what all the hype is regarding this short novel it was just ok it was raw in a sort of 'catcher in the rye' fashion but to me not done as well","365":"rob spillman editor tin house magazine for debut novel i'm going with justin torres's we the animals i love when the underdogs win torres a scholarship student at the tin house summer workshop was an unlikely brake out publishing sensation with his raw hallucinatory and fractured look at a mixed race family under crisis meg storey editor tin house books one of the books i picked up at awp was justin torres's debut we the animals which i devoured on the plane ride home composed of sections that don't so much tell stories as provide glimpses into the home life of a pack of mixed race brothers this short novel nonetheless comes together as an overall narrative and packs a heartbreaking wallop torres's prose is stunning and his characters and the events of their adolescent lives will haunt you for quite a while i very much look forward to his next work","366":" if you are looking for a dysfunctional you have found it in this novella mixed race marriage poverty possible mental illness alcoholism what else could you possibly throw in don't worry the author found one or two more things to add to the tawdry mix of a novella the three boys give no reason to the old man to consider them nothing more than a bunch of animals who tear up his garden many things are not spelled out so the reader is left wondering if even more debauchery is being perpetrated by the parents i found myself rereading passages to see if i was missing something or if i was just given enough to make me wonder what was occurring maybe this is the novella's brilliance you are given enough awful events to see no reason why every bad thing that could be imagined does happen in the readers imagination","367":" 'this is your heritage ' he said as if from this dance we could know about his own childhood about the flavor and grit of tenement buildings in spanish harlem and projects in red hook and dance halls and city parks and about his own paps how he beat him how he taught him to dance as if we could hear spanish in his movements as if puerto rico was a man in a bathrobe we the animals 2011 a short largely autobiographical novella about childhood and youth in an ethnically mixed family is the literary debut by justin torres we meet the narrator when he is about to turn seven and through a brief series of separately titled vignettes we follow him until he is on the brink of adulthood the narrator's father paps is puerto rican while his ma is white the boy has two slightly older brothers you ain't white and you ain't puerto rican paps tells the boys watch how a purebred dances watch how we dance he says showing how proud he is of his heritage we witness the family's struggles with ma working night shifts paps trying to keep a job and the marriage going through a rough period the first part of the novella is absolutely outstanding the evocatively magical and powerful writing conveys the colors sounds and feelings of childhood and some of its essential aspects such as when the boys interpret events they have no way of understanding and how these interpretations rather than the events themselves shape them the bittersweet vignettes charming and often painfully honest have made me recollect some vague memories and long forgotten impressions from my own childhood and there is much more this very short book will open the eyes of people who like this reviewer were raised in a monoethnic family in a monoethnic environment but then almost from the very beginning the novella offers intimations of something different about the narrator hints that he is not quite like his brothers ma is of course the first to know it a very brief scene on the day of the narrator's seventh birthday is stunning the brothers feel it and yet firmly stand by the junior at least until much later and paps eventually understands the difference too at about two thirds of the story we witness a rather dramatic change of focus with the boys reaching adolescence the narrator defies the macho ethos of paps and his brothers when he begins shaping his identity and defining his own self while so far he has struggled with his mixed ethnicity and with understanding of the adult world now the matter of his sexual orientation becomes more important the main strength of the novella is the masterly portrayal of the gradual shift from the we voice the collective voice of the three brothers to the individual voice of the narrator the coming of age is represented by the us morphing into the i alas i also perceive a weakness the brief narrative structure of the novella is not strong enough to support the weight of all these diverse major themes coming of age multi ethnicity and sexual orientation to sum up while until about the midpoint of the novella i had felt that i was reading a literary masterpiece i ended up reading just a good book moving and honest yet not particularly remarkable close to four stars but not quite there three and three quarter stars","368":" at a spare 125 pages this novella tells the story of three boys growing up in rural new york their is father a puerto rican who is hard and sometimes cruel to both the boys and their mother their mother who was only a child herself when she gave birth to each of the is desperately lonely and can only barely get through each day in this environment the boys are left to run wild and essentially raise themselves they keep apart from the locals keenly sensing that they are different a pack of animals unto themselves and though they fight and tear each other down at will they also sense that the youngest is himself within their pack also has a separate identity and so they protect him the story is told in the voice of this youngest brother and as it nears the end you think you know where it's going but you're probably wrong it didn't end at all as i expected going a completely different direction prior to this shift i liked the book and while i don't have a problem with how it ended the change of direction felt very abrupt and as a result affected my final feelings regarding the story the author is clearly gifted i felt that he captured the wildness of boys quite well and though his words were sparse and blunt almost like the boys themselves he drew a very clear picture of who they were and their environment i often find shorter books like this one hard to hold onto and lacking a certain something but this one felt very complete and will definitely stick with me","369":"a beautifully written portrayal of brotherhood growing up within the confines of poverty a difficult beginning and a mixed race heritage it's a short read but well worth it","370":"couldn't really get into it","371":"saw dorothy alison put her name on this one raw and lovely but stopped too soon i'll look for more from mr torres","372":"this one didn't do anything for me","373":" this book is definitely trying to be a work of art and it is some reviewers on this site see this as a fault of the author ike he is trying too hard i applaud torres for trying really hard to create something so beautiful with so few words although the novella is only about 125 pages you get to know this family as well as in a 400 page book each of the brothers have clearly defined sibling roles and are realistic for their placement in the family the father was the most interesting character to me at times horribly abusive while at others shockingly tender he wasn't a dream daddy by any means but i wanted to know more about him my one complaint with this book is the last chapter zookeeping the prose was so clear throughout the whole book and this last part confused me i don't want to spoil it for those who haven't read it but if anyone has and wants to talk about it message me","374":" while i wasn't ecstatic about the first half of this short novel or novel in stories about three wild and crazy puerto rican brothers their unorthodox upbringing and their dysfunctional parents the second half of the book which is very short pulled me in somewhere around the book's shift from boys to young men when the book also began to focus on the youngest brother who turns out to be gay and intelligent though little in his younger years would have suggested either this reads like a memoir but torres claims it is fiction though the book is episodic reminding me of a harsher house on mango street the stories do eventually add up and i left the book feeling far more impressed with it than when i started definitely a different approach to the coming of age story","375":"loved the evocative sparse prose ending felt like a bit of a shock but the rest of the text made up for it","376":"lots of exploration of masculinity in this coming of age story","377":"amazing this guy can write i love that he presents the story of his growing up in sequential non related short essays each with their own arc and heartbreakingly beautiful recollections of key moments growing up i've read this twice now and will read it again","378":"i enjoyed this book i didn't think it was 'great art' but hey it only took a couple of hours to read the characters came to life for me his family is so far from mine that it could have been a different planet but it was fun and dangerous peeking through those bars","379":" just can't say enough about this incredible book could not put it down this is the book you recommend to your friend when they are looking for a read that keeps them glued to the pages this novel deserves a literary award author uses eye catching staccato type language that evolves along with the boys humorous depressing thought provoking it takes you in like reading someone's journal he relates ugly situations without being graphic and allows the reader to read between the lines i wanted to reach inside the book and take these little boys by the hand reality is tough to read about sometimes great insight into how the family shapes the child children and why we are who we are looking forward to reading another one of his books","380":"lyric and enticing this book makes a leap at the end but doesn't land it still an excellent read and one which pushes importantly on the boundaries of latino queerness","381":"justin torres' we the animals is filled with captivating poetic substance portraying the difficulties of a young boy coming of age in a tumultuous environment torres's story is heartbreakingly honest with its dark aspects of the human condition such as feeling like an outsider or fending for survival throughout the text the main character and his brothers are depicted as animals as they scavenger for food and play together as a pack their family life is chaotic at best with an abusive father who often leaves without warning and a mother who must work the night shift to support her family often leaving her disoriented although these scenes lead us to be empathetic toward these young boys torres also provides images of love as both of the parents spend time with their children the genius behind this short novel is its complicated depiction of the relationship between love and violence this story does not only portray the dysfunction of a family it also honestly depicts the love that may even propel these violent actions by the end of the novel we see a whole other aspect of the main character's story as he comes to terms with his sexuality he begins to feel more alienated from his family who have always been his pack the story is told with a we pronoun at the beginning yet ends with the perspective of i this sort of alienation is an interesting spin on the coming of age novel in which a happy ending is not necessarily reached torres's writing is beautiful exhilarating and captivating i found myself immersed in the novel from the beginning each chapter is a snapshot view of the life of this character and can be viewed as a series of short stories that loosely connect leading to the end scene what torres has portrayed in this novel is just that how a collection of life experiences can lead us to who we are today beautifully written with a captivating complexity this novel is one you must read","382":"an interesting mix of gritty and granta i think most people will either love it or hate it but i fell squarely in the middle","383":"this book really resounded with me the book is very short yet i felt connected to the characters","384":" it's a good thing this book is so short or i'm not sure i could have stayed with it it is so beautifully and compactly written but so sad the prose is so vivid i felt like i was experiencing the love and horror of this family's life frankly i'm glad these boys don't live in my neighborhood but it's hard to blame them for their behavior because they basically ran wild and it's hard to blame their parents either their mother got pregnant with the first boy at 14 and the father was chronically unemployed i had heard the author on npr a couple times and probably wouldn't have read the book if we hadn't chosen it for book group i could tell it would just be too painful","385":"while parts of this book deserves a five star mark other parts failed to impress the story wanders aimlessly across many disjointed ideas and images and so never really achieves the suspense emotion of a really great story","386":"told in first person plural this book will knock you down","387":"i'd read a torres short story in the new yorker and absolutely loved it so on recommendation from my girlfriend i gave we the animals a read it did not disappoint the story follows three half puerto rican brothers the animals as they endure a rough and tumble upbringing in upstate new york it is told through the eyes of the youngest brother in prose that captures the beauty and sorrow of childhood we see that though there is a lot of pain in their lives their is a lot of love and joy as well their young parents are trying to make things work but sometimes they drink too much sometimes they beat the kids and sometimes they get beaten the above however makes it sound like there is a narrative instead all this is revealed through vignettes instances in their lives since our point of view is that of the youngest brother's there is no explicating no commentary on what this poverty means it just happens we see it how the boy sees it as simply the way things are and through these anecdotes of a childhood we start to piece together the larger picture the ending however seemed to belong to a different story one with a narrative which is why i am giving we the animals four stars and not five i didn't dislike the ending i was just so thoroughly enjoying the coming of age story and the powerful relationships between the family members that i didn't need the book to be about anything else the ending shifted the meaning of the story in a way superimposing an if a then b logic on the book a however was more than enough for me","388":"beautifully written yet haunting story","389":"i wish i hadn't read this torres has some interesting and sometimes funny stories if you can get past the utter sadness of it but then it takes a disturbing turn and ends where reviewers called it a book of hope i saw none of it in the book","390":"brilliant and unbounded by the confines of safety","391":"a fantastic lyrical book short and beatiful traumaitc childhood genre not sentimental","392":" torres's writing is brutally honest--focus on the brutal as i began reading i was enjoying his style luscious use of words and the anecdotal nature of the novel's structure it's really a book of linked short stories similar to the things they carried olive kitteridge and a visit from the goon squad but just as i began to enjoy reading about the three brothers being brothers the action would turn odd--a bit too violent too sexual too animal the scene depicting parents having sex on the sink while their kids were in the bathtub gave me the creeps and the ending was completely bizarre i enjoy honest writing that is not this disturbing i'm sure the author's intent was to come off as \"edgy\"--but it was 'over the edge' for me","393":"this book surprised me highly recommended","394":"i loved the writing here but wished the author had spent a little more time fleshing out the ending overall it was very unique and powerful","395":"oh my god reading this book is like riding an endless rollercoaster for one second you will be smiling and squinting your eyes and say what and then the next thing you gonna drop your mouth and say whattt the hell only 128 pages it was a fast paced read but a lot to process for me this is about a boy with 2 older brother living in a broken family i like this book it tackles with your emotions and such","396":"this book is such a heartbreaker it's elegantly written and slight in size but it packs quite a lot of punch i couldn't tell if it was true or not not that it really matters but it certainly left a lot to think about i'd only recommend this for those with a strong constitution and a stiff drink in hand but it's worth it if you can get through it","397":"a beautifully written coming of age excellent","398":"we the animals is a deeply affecting story of coming of age and coming out torres' masterful use of spare prose which often read like prose poems revealed so much about his 2 brothers parents and torres as the unnamed narrator the joy and pain the brothers' mischief and destructiveness the parents' love and despair when the family unraveled it felt like they did so in slow motion the intensity of the storytelling filled the pages of this slim book to the brim if there had been any more detail it just wouldn't have resonated in such a visceral way the ending was too abrupt but this is a special first novel the style is not for everyone but it worked for me","399":"beautifully written the end is a little shaky needed a little more prep to get us there but still well done","400":"this 2011 novel is a slender volume but it is very powerful short chapterstell a scene from a family of three brothers puerto rican and white they stick together closely loyal and fierce the unnamed narrator is the youngestbrother who is the one that finally tears apart the family a poignant andsensitive family drama and coming of age story is a joy to read","401":"beautiful writing but the story couldn't hold my attention i felt really sorry for this family","402":"my biggest critique is that the ending was such a departure of both form and style as to have been written for an altogether different novel for a narrative whose language was as much the focus as the boy narrator and his brothers the last chapter was a disservice seems the intention was a tidying up of purpose and voice which for whatever reason the author felt needed clarity the book's authorial style was refreshing and damn great my confusion over the last chapter would not hold me back from recommending e book and strongly at that but i can't help calling into question other formal moves","403":"this is a very slight novel but with sparse sometimes a little too much so and effective prose pretty into it","404":"here's is a link to my review of we the animals http jchariscarlson blogspot com 20","405":"after a while joel mumbled it's ### % cold because someone had to say the obvious so that the other two could ignore him and in this way we knew that no one wanted to go home at first they defended themselves cursed me slapped my face but the wilder i became the more they retreated into their love for me each of them i chased them down into that love and challenged it","406":" language character nuances and the sting of poignancy in his imagery and phrasing the top reasons i kept turning each page not anxious for the end which i felt came too soon but desiring more tokens of emotional poignance in mundane moments and subtle reveals of character the opening excerpt plato's i believe really was an effective way to set a foundation of philosophy to interpret the development of his life especially because as the youngest sibling the youngest of three boys to very young parents most of his development takes place in relation to every one else in response to every one else and in particular as a member of this unit of brothers something i can relate to being the youngest of three girls a great title is given life meaning image and is fused with energy in the introduction we wanted more the action in his language the aggression in his image of these three boys wanting more of everything as mundane as food as complex as life again effective torres made of these boys a unit and set them up the energy and emotional complexity that will define them throughout the book within the first several lines character nuances that resonated with me the mom's pink toes under her hard dirty work boots the boys' observation of her anticipation of seeing their pinkness at the end of her work day simultaneously the boys learning about femininity and the reveal of the mother's own stance in holding on to it in the midst of a labor intensive and unglamorous job the boys learning what it means to be puerto rican watching their father cook dance sing in that one scene torres highlights each siblings role within the hierarchy the oldest the middle the youngest as the father zones out evidence of alcohol in his system and the older brother takes the lead continuing the dancing while the younger ones follow suit the father's emotional moment in the presence of his sons thumping his fist against the dashboard while driving home from his night job his sons having slept in a sleeping bag the boys notice this moment a man coming face to face with his life and not liking what he sees and join him by keeping the beat themselves eventually each taking their turn to join in poignant reveals images the response of the youngest to his mother pressing himself against a cold window a response to the weight of her fragile need such a contrasting image that creates as one reads an actual sensation of her vulnerability the weight of which she lays on her youngest son taking advantage of his seeming purity and unconditional giving because he seeks the glass the cold to offset it the scene with the father dancing cooking it is a moment set up pure and substantial as these boys learn what it is to be a man by watching the one who made them little by little though torres takes the lens and shifts it back small step by small step almost as a child would assess the impact of reality by going into it innocently enough soaking up the purity and then swallowing bit by bit the bitterness of the truth within it he pans out a bit to the volume of his dad's music of his singing and then the describes the dad zoning out witnessing him fade deeper into himself when the older brother takes over and then reveals the row of beer bottles collecting by his father the entire scene is an effective example of show don't tell the day their mother runs away with them in one moment of many the mom has pretzels i think in her purse after an entire day of nothing to eat the boys are all too happy to devour it is the observation he makes and its subsequent character reveal when she makes a statement that resonated with me she says your mother and the boy observes how the use of your made him think fondly of some other mother unknown to them that was guiding their actual mother to take care of them the one who thought to put the pretzels in the purse great touch many many more of these tokens can be appreciated in this short read my ebook was only 88 pages long a short book and worthwhile read given that each page holds tokens worth enjoying the end left me a bit unsettled because of its stark reality but it was real without losing hope love or credibility in what had been explored throughout the book must read the end","407":"justin torres's book is the closest i have felt to a toni morrison for puerto ricans in new york it is a hauntingly beautiful story written with language that is precise and melodious and conveys the truth of life i wish for everyone to read it there is so much truth in this book it is almost unbearable to read i highly recommend it","408":"disturbing and beautiful all at the same time i feel completely heartbroken","409":"wow sometimes when you close a book at the end and they only thing you can think to say is wow you know it is a book that has touched you this book was potent real honest sad just wow","410":" in the debut novel of justin torres three little wild seeds are growing on the palm of god or lets say five as the help to grow puerto rican father and white mother are almost children themselves they are wild creatures lead by their basic instincts almost like animals reading this book was like watching a brutal but breathtaking nature film where we cannot interfere only observe sometimes it was shocking ang baffling but i could not close my eyes what makes a family biology or the moments they share this book is a rich range of dreadful cruel yet admirable and beautiful moments the style and voice is immersive it is a fragmented family portrait made of tiny little life blackened splintered beads that hurt our hands yet we are unable to let them fall i don't quite like the ending with the jump and twist but that's all negative i can say the mood of the novel will stay with me for long ____________________justin torres elso regenyeben harom kis vad magocska cseperedik isten tenyereben jobban mondva ot hisz maguk a cseperedest

thought i would love it ticks all the boxes for creating a publishing superstar in the 21st century author attended prestigious writing programs workshops check see book's acknowledgements author has previously published a great short story in the new yorker check see here and finally author is cute check he's gorgeous i'm shallow okay i get it we the animals is a bildungsroman focussed on a young boy in a puerto rican american family apparently the fact that the family is mixed race is important to a lot of reviewers and commentators the narrator hints that he occupies an in between space in between cultures and races but it's certainly not the driving force behind the book as someone who grew up in a large loud rough working class family of irish immigrants in the united kingdom i found myself nodding along to a lot of torres' descriptions of family life so maybe the focus on race is something i'm missing culturally because i'm not american here's the major flaw despite or because of the prestigious writing workshops this book just feels too self aware like torres is aware that this is what good writing is i could almost feel the author peeking out from behind the sentences sometimes saying nudge nudge see what i did there torres' prose is pared and enviously well written but the book sacrifices its emotional core for icy detachment i get that torres wants to avoid sentimentality he doesn't want simply to demonize his complex characters his abusive father for instance but instead show their roundedness how situation influences actions but that we rarely choose our situation and he succeeds in this at least i'll definitely keep track of torres this was a good book but i think his next one or two or three will be great once he's stopped sticking to the rules of the writers' workshop so rigidly","413":"a beautiful quick read on brotherly bonds in a vivid family but the ending was a bit of a letdown an abrupt turn not well worked out or fitted to the rest","414":"i talk about this book in my june reading wrap up video i was incredibly impressed by the way that justin torres managed to sink his story into my feels so quickly each chapter is a little short story that can pretty much stand on its own after the first one i was already invested and there seemed to be a knot in my stomach blooming as i read on i was sure that things wouldn't end well and that these characters were kind of doomed from the start the end was shocking and kind of hovered the line of being too unforeshadowed it worked in one way and that was that the little bit of hope i had i placed in the narrator and that was kind of dashed by the end it didn't work because we spent so much time with the narrator and there were no clues i really admired torres's writing style it's so clean slick and cutting it gets the job done without too many frills this is a really short novel which is something i sometimes struggle with i always want more but it tells a very full story while this story of three half breed brothers puerto ricans growing up in brooklyn is significantly different than my own there were still things here for me to relate to i have 2 sisters and we always played games by assigning roles to each other lots of characters and cartoons come in threes just like we did and just like these brothers did the scene with the father dancing in the kitchen and the boys trying and failing to be both white and puerto rican just small moments that seemed within my grasp so much of it wasn't but that just made it all the more emotionally griping while there is an overlying theme of neglect and abuse here there were small moments that torres left up in the air or cut off that just served to gut punch this was really impressive story telling i'll be thinking about it for a while","415":"no idea why this book was written it was depressing made no sense and had no clear line of where it was going which was obvious near the end when the writer just took a turn to completely unexpected roads do not read you can spend your time reading better books","416":"some of the descriptions of the brothers' dysfunctional and chaotic family were well written but the end of this book was really strange and didn't seem to gel with what had come before it","417":"short fast sad","418":"such a beautiful book that captures you from the very first sentence","419":"very good writing almost like poetry the brothers are close and loving one minute and animalistic the next","420":" i finished this book yesterday and it's taken me some time to let it sink in we the animals is on its surface about three brothers and their lives they were born of an african american mother and a puerto rican father and live a live full poverty violence and struggle the story is about their everyday lives where they play what their home is like the food they eat underneath those descriptions though lies a much darker and more intricate story about what life is like for a child who lives among violence but doesn't belong and how that violence impacts who and what he eventually becomes we the animals took me on an amazing journey with the brothers and left me at times grieving and at times rejoicing with them the ending deserves a second read which i will get to soon because its power is difficult to unleash in one sitting i'm earnestly looking forward to reading more of justin torres' work","421":"way over rated","422":"fierce sizzling poetry utterly re readable","423":"we the animals is one of the most gripping pieces of fiction i've read in a long time at just 128 pages it packs quite a punch when it ended i was sure i must have been missing pages there had to be more this is the story of three brothers raised in a household where dysfunction reigned supreme with a white mother and a puerto rican father the boys maintain their identity as darker than their mother but not as dark as their father this describes their skin color and demeanor each chapter stands out as a story story and a continuation of the plot that is this family's struggle each page brings more depth to the character of each member of the family they share the same desperate need to escape whether it's in a truck a bus station or a grave dug in the backyard the escape never lasts as they find themselves drawn back in the author justin torres has a beautiful command of language you'll often times feel like you're reading poetry instead of prose every word is perfect and needed there are no extras in this story my only criticism of this novel is the ending i wanted more the end comes suddenly like a bullet it flies out of the barrel of the gun and then all goes black","424":"wow powerful poignant poetic one is thrown into that underside of this land of wealth and opportunity to the nerve centers wrought by poverty race and circumstance with a chaotic mix of love passion despair rage abuse humor pain humanity and ending with an explosion of feeling that just hangs it is a short book and i couldn't put it down and can't let it go","425":"slim enough to read in an hour and yet the unnamed narrator stayed with me for days","426":" innovative and captivating throughout torres starts his novella with a wonderful short chapter on the innocence of children scrapping and in a poor rural southern us town things get progressively worse poverty drugs and alcohol physical abuse all play a part in the family's descent exactly what happens though is a twist to the tale and leaves the reader with many questions the book is therefore concerned chiefly with loss of innocence the boys are left to themselves many times and comparisons to lord of the flies can be drawn more than any book in have read for a while though i find myself really keen to know what other readers thought other reviews on goodreads indicate this is the sort of book you love or hate lots of 5 and 1 stars little in the middle in some ways i can see why people don't like it it is uncomfortable it suggests much without any depth especially with the most controversial issues chiefly the abuse many books do that though it is left to the reader to decide why the situation got out of control","427":"i had a hard time with this little book yes the prose is excellent but the life of these three boys is tough if not disgusting i kept reminding myself of the movie beasts of the southern wild in which the characters were drunken and not often lovable but the best of their humanity and struggle shown through i would not recommend this book for the plot just sample the writing","428":"we lived in dreamtime says the narrator of the book early on in this hypnotic book perfectly describing the tone of the book itself sparse tactile very much like a dream in short chapters the narrator charts his journey from part of a we he and his two brothers to an i the use of third person plural is unusual and beautiful perfectly capturing the way young family members come to define themselves as extensions of each other the young protagonists grow up with a charismatic yet abusive father and a loving yet depressive mother yet the narrator never defines the problems lurking inside his parents instead describing experiences in short vignettes that are powerful haunting and sometimes symbolic like a ditch his father built which the narrator took to be his coffin the abuse of the family is alluded to more than seen and the narrator's sexual awakening is complicated and subtle in one scene the three boys watch their parents make love in a bathroom from inside the tub in another they are exposed to pornography for the first time by a neighbor boy a father son spanking scene no less given the dreamlike tone of the majority of the book the end comes as a big surprise as a more traditional gay coming of age narrative reveals itself the final chapter really more of a paragraph is stunning these days i sleep with peacocks lions on a bed of leaves i've lost my pack i dream of standing upright of uncurled knuckles of a simpler life perhaps the narration is speaking of his journey from one tribe his family to another the gay community aka the peacocks and the lions or perhaps he is just describing his journey of learning how to be human after years of being an animal ultimately my only complaint about this compact effective book is that its stylistic decisions while smart and effective often took me out of the emotion of the novel still this is highly recommended","429":"this book is almost a novella length poem and there's no doubt that justin torres is a talented wordsmith but there isn't much plot or character development it's a word portrait of his hardscrabble upbringing with two brothers and very young poor parents although it is called a novel it is close to being his own family story","430":"i bought this book on a whim had no idea what i was getting into i was truly amazing","431":"this is about 3 brothers who often act like as animals in their home as they are growing up it deals with relationships between boys and parents between mom and dad and between boys and neighbors the story was ok until i neared the end i really disliked the ending a lot","432":"the writing style in this book was different which made it nice to read but it book was confusing it was an easy quick read but overall i was bored and didn't want to finish reading i only did because it was what we were reading for book club i wouldn't recommend this book to anyone","433":"intense sibling and family drama interesting read","434":"i loved how the book started out very poetic and descriptive but as it went on i found myself skimming partly because of subject matter domestic and child abuse and partly because the writing itself felt hard and disjointed","435":"not perfect but i think it conveys truth i found the book slightly overwrought from time to time and some of the devices just a little obvious but not to the point of exasperation the disjointedness that annoys some readers evokes for me the disjointed magical memories of children i think however that it's less a coming of age story than it is a memorial to childhood it's a book i'm glad i read though i'm not sure it's one i'd return to again and again","436":"would have been 5 stars but ending was weak in comparison to all that led to it","437":"so so wonderful until the last couple of chapters when it kind of for me at least takes a horrific turn i was kind of destroyed by the ending but the book was excellent and written as such","438":" you know how writers are always told to find your voice well this guy has found his voice he writes with such self assurance that even on the rare occasions when his writing didn't really work for me it felt like my problem as opposed to his which is a pretty darned rare experience for me as a reader this book was pretty raw and though i thought the ending was a bit abrupt and didn't quite live up to the rest of the vignettes i'd recommend it to most anyone not least because it's only 120 pages if you don't like it you've wasted like 2 hours of your life i put this on my memoir shelf even though it's one of those a novel books because when i heard him interviewed on the radio the answer to was this book autobiographical was something like well i'm mixed with two older brothers from an abusive family in upstate ny and i'm gay but not fully so memoir","439":" i feel like people look at small books especially in hardcover and pass as they think it will be nothing more than a silly little trifle something too quick too insubstantial and too expensive to invest in we the animals might be the antidote to that sort of silly limited thinking and as a person who doesn't always love poetic not terribly linear prose torres also served as a kind of antidote to my own silly limited thinking i'm not sure just how i feel yet having finished the book moments ago on the train to work but i have the sneaking sense i'd like to re read it which i rarely do shamefully that it is smarter than i am and that it broke my heart a little i'm also pretty sure i'll read anything that justin torres writes in the future i can say that despite the hype from friends and booksellers the book still snuck up on me with all its wonder sadness and not least the incredible technical skill of the author","440":"i devoured this book in one sitting savage enlightening thrilling","441":"great sentence level writing but i didn't enjoy it","442":" i've noticed this book has gotten a mixed response and i can see why i'll give it 3 1 2 stars i enjoyed we the animals but it's definitely not a book for everybody it sacrifices a linear story or true plot for a more literary artistic approach it's the size of a novella at under 130 pages and while it doesn't take long to get through it i wouldn't categorize it as a breezy read either it reads almost like a group of short stories none of the chapters all individually titled essentially operate on their own as short snippets of the life of three brothers told from the first person viewpoint of the youngest brother growing up in new york to impoverished parents of mixed race the father is puerto rican the mother is white the stories certainly inform one another but don't necessarily have a plot that threads them together they mostly just help to further understand the family and the characters what this book does well is present the duality of life the life of this family shows how love and hate beauty and ugliness safety and danger and violence and peacefulness all live side by side this is far from an ideal family life but it certainly felt very true i'm sure there are many kids who grow up in similar environments and have to try to make sense of it all much as these three brothers do this is not a happy story but there are moments of beauty i wouldn't call torres a totally unique voice but his prose serves the story well there are times where he creates beautiful moments that really stuck with me there isn't tons of celebrated fiction from the latin perspective and i think torres represents that well in the end i don't know if we the animals will stick with me but it was a piercing read while i had the book open it was emotionally gripping and an interesting study of a family not something i would recommend for just anyone but for the right reader i would say it's worth the time especially at such a short length","443":"with all the rave reviews i was still hesitant to buy and read this book and boy were my instincts right the only thing to recommend this novel is its brevity for me a work of entertainment requires at least one character who is likable appealing positive and here there are none an abusive irresponsible father and weak dreamy mother produce two thugs and a psychotic filthy homosexual what kind of critic loves that quagmire for his reading pleasure","444":"beautifully written but perhaps a little too lyrical for its length and raw subject matter","445":"three sons raise themselves badly in a dysfunctional family here joy is as terrifying as violence narrated by the youngest different one the brief chapters sketch vignettes of fierce love despair and occasional triumph in america's underclass searing lyrical prose","446":"this book would have made 4 or even 5 stars if not for the weird abrupt unsuitable ending the writing is good the narrator is believable and even compelling the book is brief and vivid and to the point unfortunately the ending takes such a sharp unbelievable left turn that the novel is essentially ruined if you are a reader who reads the last pages first don't even bother touching this novel if you are a reader who can put a book down 10 pages before the end then this is the book for you","447":" the reason i read this book could have been better i was one book away from completing my reading challenge it was the last day of the year so i wanted a short book i didn't want to totally cop out and read goodnight moon or something so i looked at some of the years best books list from publishers weekly net washinton post etc and found the shortest one that made almost very list it was a short fast 125 page read but for all that it wasn't fluff a memoir of family life as one of three brothers with parents who were barely able to take care of themselves told as a series of non linear short chapters it sometimes read like a short story collection i haven't read about the book to know if it is pure fiction or a real memoir lots of food for thought i completed my challenge of reading 113 books this year by the skin of my teeth but i made it","448":"beautiful lyrical and though provoking","449":" i watch the interview with justin torres on youtube http youtu be ey2hfawalum and i compare that to the book and you wonder if some of this is right from the author's life but this is a work of fiction even though it feels real when you read about the three brothers how they grow up in a semi dysfunctional family there's love in the family but everything seems magnified passion anger love everything the boys deal with a father who is abusive to their mother a mother who when the dad leaves them for a time works a night shift and is barely there for the three hooligans the story is a sort of coming of age story it's thought provoking it's eye opening it's heartfelt i think people who wonder about such a lifestyle will have an opportunity to feel really feel what that's like and to those who totally understand perhaps a bit too well what this kind of life is like you can take heart in the beauty of some of the moments and in the fact that even dysfunctional families can love each other through the chaos i don't know if the authors has a website but i did find this http www houghtonmifflinbooks com c","450":" here's a review in keeping with the half baked animal theme supposedly running through this novel this book is horseshit as both a homosexual and a publishing professional i am ashamed that this is what is considered laudable queer literature these days this is an intermittently interesting but preciously overwrought series of writing exercises in that unpleasant twee self fellating mfa style we know and hate haphazardly strung together so it eventually gags on its own crap like in the human centipede at the end there is of course a convoluted manhandled and cliched moment of sexual awakening of a never before alluded to sexuality that was so pointless and inept it made me want to go back in the closet i'm not ashamed i bought this glorified bit of firewood trivia faggot is an olde english term for a bundle of kindling because i am always happy to give $18 to the wonderful spoonbill u0026amp sugartown books but i'm telling you now you're an idiot if you drop the cost of a round of beers for 3 friends on this if i see you out in the world even eyeing this book i will first take $5 from your pocket as a moron tax and then make you spend the balance on the new dennis cooper novel ps i know two does not a trend make but with this book by justin torres and tango by justin vivian bond both battling it out for the crown of queen of the overhyped gay short story masquerading as an actual novel it's clear one should give a wide berth to anything by queers named justin","451":"i'd call this a glorified short story dressed up as a novel it's value is that it is raw and blunt but that also works against it because it's unpolished and works along a very thin plot line really 2 5 stars","452":"excellent writing i haven't been that impressed in a while the plot the details the characters the transformations amazing work","453":"simply an amazing debut novel that i could not put down disturbing wrenching heart breaking yet healing","454":"a quick paced book with writing that brings the reader into its grime heart and reality it's told in a voice that sounds and feels true and unforgiving","455":" torres's debut novel reminded me very much of julie otsuka's the buddha in the attic both are achingly sad tales told largely through the collective perspective of the first person plural which thanks to the novella length mostly stays fresh and effective our narrator is the youngest of three boys half puerto rican and half white who have to 'tumble up' like dickens's jellyby children due to the hapless pseudo neglect of their working class parents in upstate new york their violent mercurial father 'paps ' has trouble holding down a job and their mother works the overnight shift at the local brewery there are some fun times with their parents but mostly the boys cling to each other for support and identity for most of the book they are simply 'we' we never learn the narrator's name though his brothers are revealed as joel and manny they are somewhere between savages and babes in the wood as an old man they meet characterizes them \"he had all kinds of names for us castaways stowaways hideaways fugitives punks city slickers bastards he also called us sweets babies innocents poor pitiful creatures god's own \" manny puts it this way \"you and me and joel we're nothing more than a fistful of seed that god tossed into the mud and horseshit we're on our own \"the sadness of the book lies in the fact that there seems to be no way out of their situation no american dream will free them from poverty give their parents meaningful work or deliver prospects beyond the deadbeat life they seem to be headed for \"we're never gonna escape this \" paps despairs even as the boys grow up and the narrator starts to distinguish himself at school his personal life sexuality and mental health i'll limit the spoilers holds him back what's even more harrowing is that these or very similar events happened to torres himself this is powerful stuff although the limitation of a book like this or the buddha in the attic is that each chapter feels like a stand alone short story rather than a contribution to a whole narrative i didn't feel connected to the story until the last two chapters when the first person singular starts to dominate then it becomes a more traditional coming of age novel it might be the case that i only really warm to stories that are told in the first person i can admire third person omniscient tales but not immerse myself in them torres's novel is certainly impressive particularly in how he skillfully maneuvers between perspectives even including a short section of second person imperative and strikes a careful balance between innocence and hopelessness i hope his next novel will be more straightforward even if not another bildungsroman he has a distinctive voice and a deep well of bittersweet experience to draw from part of this review appeared in an article on the first person plural at bookkaholic","456":" i didn't rate the book because i didn't understand it i researched it and all i could find were a bunch of summeries it is a really unusual book and kind of reminds me of a child called it there seems to be no moral or lesson taught in the novel and is structure and composition aren't the informative novel type because torres wrote this book taking experiances frok his actual life i think the novel purposly doesn't have a moral lesson but leaves the reader with a bunch of ideas and thoughts to process and come up with something relevent to each reader am going to reserve judgement untill i rereadvthe book and read some interpretations","457":"this book novella broke my heart maybe it's because i have 3 nephews maybe it's because i live in ny or maybe it's just that type of book this is a poetically written story about 3 boys growing up in a tough home in ny many paragraphs moved me but ultimately the ending left me pretty battered so i was not totally in love with the book","458":"stunning and visceral and lovely the last third isn't quite as strong but i'll not soon forget the rest","459":"i thought this book was terrible the best thing i can say about it is that it was mercifully short","460":"sinewy marvelous prose wholly original gobbled it up in one sitting eager for more from jt","461":"it was good depressing but it's not all that","462":"as anyone who's done grunt work in a kitchen will tell you sharpening a knife is a delicate task too much either way and the knife remains or becomes again dull the key is to find the perfect number of swipes across the stone to leave the point razor sharp so it is with we the animals the prose in this short autobiographical novel in vignettes is universally good polished and studied and lyrical the images are fresh and original and the characters interesting and mostly unique in reading it you become a bit more understanding of the complex and often beautiful relationships one can have in a dysfunctional family however much like an oversharpened knife we the animals is the least effective when it works the hardest sentences and scenes that seem to push their conceit metaphor too far are the places where the reader is jerked from the story and the way certain passages wrap back around themselves in an almost manufactured way makes the reading see at times as if it's reaching too far that's not necessarily a bad thing in a writer's first at least torres is pushing towards the magnificent rather than fattening his pocket with some cynically easy work we'll hopefully see more from torres in the not too distant future as it is we the animals does have some amazing passages with tender stories illuminating passages and inventive language i was not sorry to have read it","463":"i dont know how i feel about this book i liked the language and the writing but at the same time i felt like it was over done it was okay overall","464":"it's an intense novella length story that's somehow able to describe a family in 120 pages and make me feel like i understand the psyche of the narrator two brothers mother and father torres is able to write critically brutally about these characters without seeming bitter and expressing love for them without being overly sentimental at all highly recommended","465":"meh it's short at least it has that going for it","466":"ugh there is no type of writing and story that i dislike more than this one i'm seriously not going to waste any more of my time giving this an in depth review","467":" this is a beautiful book it contains language like this ma could hold tears on her eyelids longer than anyone some days she walked around like that for hours holding them there not letting them drop on those days she would trace her finger over the shapes of things or hold the telephone in her lap silent and you had to call her name three times before she'd give you her eyes 15 or this three steel posts held up the floor of the house above the ceiling was striped with rolls of insulation nailed to the underside of the floor with a nail gun and one long strip had unpeeled itself or been torn down and now kissed the basement's dirt floor the tuft of fiberglass was thick and pink and exposed 94 or they felt proud to be the kind of boys they were boys who spat in public boys who kept their gaze on the floor or fixed on a space above your head boys who looked you in the eye only to size you up or scare you off when they bit teh chapped skin from their lower lips when they chewed up the web between thumb and pointer when they scratched inside their ears with house keys they were looking at memories proud memories blood memories or else they were dreaming about their wild futures 104","468":"a stunning tale of three boys growing up as a cohesive unit in an abusive household then growing apart as one is singled out as exceptional as different torres presents a coming of age story that emphasizes the pain that can come with growing up and coming into your own the issues surrounding masculinity sexuality and family that are issues of intimate social importance that torres manages with care and subtlety at times and with a shocking vibrancy at others i look forward to his future efforts","469":" conflicted about this book as the writing was so fresh i could smell that baked in heat and sweat smell of wild childhood summers spent largely unsupervised and fully reckless but the ending was a whole other entity that wasn't given the time it needed to grow to maturity so much of it reminded me of working in the child welfare system in brooklyn and really nailed those families that straddled the blurry line between neglect and the family culture i wish i had read this book instead of listening to the audio version the writing was creative and explosive and may have had more of an impact on the page","470":"it was a frightening glimpse inside the heads of people who think and act so differently from what i am used to","471":"loved this book very different from anything i've ever read","472":"such a unique coming of age novel each chapter is a sort of vignette or snapshot not a conventional plot structure that allows you to piece together a story about a family without actually being overtly told the story the writing is beautiful as well highly recommended","473":" pros beautiful writing just gorgeous each chapter is its own story each can stand alone it's a very quick readcons the standalone nature of the chapters precludes a cohesive linear narrative we're given snapshots only leading to a somewhat disjointed story with an unclear timeline the ending differs in tone style and content compared with the earlier chapters it's harsh and comes out of nowhere the lyrical language doesn't really reflect the early story well in my opinion there's a bit of a cognitive disconnect between the beauty of the language and the harshness of the boys' environment it's only at the end with its left turn into betrayal and violence where the language matches up with the action this felt more realistic to me than the earlier stories of note i have a real problem with stories that romanticize poverty racism dysfunctional families abuse etc and i think the earlier stories are guilty of this at times i can't really recommend this book despite the beautiful language except for the ending it doesn't sound like an honest account of a difficult childhood it works better as the story of an adult contemplating the lessons learned from his early life but then the ending doesn't work i can't reconcile the two scenarios","474":"so much power in this concise short book i was amazed after a few pages my heart was breaking for these brothers the narrator especially throughout the entire story","475":" we the animals is more novella than novel and what a ride the three brothers at the centre of the story the 'animals' are mixed race raised hard pitied feared and reviled in their neighbourhood the impact of an unpredictable sometimes violent childhood is revealed via the seven year old narrator together with snippets of stories that reveal their family history the book is punchy well written and confronting it raises more questions than it answers but most importantly it makes you think and i love a book that makes me think","476":"temporal shifts difficult to follow unconvincing final sequence torres doesn't really capture the puerto rican aspect","477":"this is the writer's first book and it's very impressive can be read in one or two sitting it gives snapshots into the authors childhood that are funny heartbreaking and scary all at the same time","478":"this book is full of surprises from the tiny slices of joy within the darkness to the revelation at the end a quick read but by no means a comfortable book because it forces you to see not only the worst but the best of family dysfunction and relationships built on violence","479":"i'd rather build a kite from trash","480":"this review has been hidden because it contains spoilers to view it click here this story shows that it doesn't have to be a happy story or to have a happy ending to be great","481":"beautiful and devastating this book made me want to write","482":" torres has a gripping style with kind of pulse that calls the reader to keep reading since it's a novel in stories it can be read as a series of vignettes or as complete work as the former it is an incredible raw experience with each story popping out as the latter it is weak totally lacking a real plot and cutting corners with quite a few character developments the book has a unifying theme of identity which in terms of racial and ethnic identities it is very strong with but for the sexuality themes it sadly falls short so much sexual tension is built up and yet the ending is both unbelievable and rather boring in its melodrama still torres is just getting started and i intend to keep an eye on his incredible command of voice and character","483":"there was a lot to like about this book novella the writing was spare tight and effective i really actually felt like i was watching some dreamscape movie rather than reading the imagery even in such short language was tense and powerful i literally saw each boy pictured the grime the shabbiness and the ignorance i was touched by the deep and effective picture of ma's depression for all that the ending earned an automatic loss of one star what a depressing and sad way to end","484":"this book is both heartbreaking and captivating at the same time i wanted more i wanted less of the misery i'd love to read more from justin torres","485":"11 27 11 started 11 28 11 finished i did not like it and i'm having a hard time finding the appropriate words to put into description of how it left me feeling i really didn't like it i only finished it because it was a short book and because i don't like leaving things unfinished i so hoped that as i continued to read that there would be more purpose to it than to just say look at us it lacked on so many levels and left so many half painted images hanging in space this book seemed to be designed purely to shock its readers perhaps even ride the train to success on the trussels of a way ward society something to give praise or recognition to degradation this book did not entertain me inspire me or informe me it merely made me glad it was over i'm old fashioned was raised in old fashion ness i strongly believe in active parenting i did not like the language use here either but like i said i'm old fashioned it was excessive in needlessness perhaps a picture the author wanted to paint well let's hope it hangs on a wall in the back of the museum where the lights stopped working","486":"i knew within the first paragraph i was going to love this book the use of language is moving and torres' voice is truly original the imagery is vivid and sometimes brutal this book will take you by storm it is easily the most wonderful soul moving thunderous piece of writing i've read in years i look forward to re reading this book for years to come and i anxiously await torres's next novel","487":"i'm not sure i can adequately write a review of this book today it's the kind of book that sits with you for a while and you find deeper meaning over time it's not an easy book to read raw is the word that comes to mind first it is very well written and i can see why it received the critical acclaim it has for now i'll say this one of the things that i kept thinking about while reading it was that there are so many people out there who we just don't see we don't see the lives behind the closed doors of their homes we don't see who they are inside or take the time to look for it we don't see the struggles they face to 'get out' or deal with their inner demons","488":" this is actually a novella and a very short read i've read similar tales before mostly in memoir form but the story of an abusive tough childhood is told here through the youngest brother's voice he is one of three brothers the animals in the title and they are being raised by a white mother and puerto rican father who were both 14 and 16 years old respectively when they had the first brother things are tough with children raising children and the solidarity and closeness of the brothers shield them from the abuse and poverty at least for a while i'm not sure about the ending but some of the writing is quite evocative and beautiful at times","489":"a story of three brothers their relationship with each other and with their mother and father beautifully written devastating unforgettable","490":"a coming of age and coming out story focused on the time when the three were brothers a day gone now","491":"very poetic writing not satisfied with ending but loved it just the same","492":"pretty damn tremendous a lyrical evocation of a strange violent impoverished childhood with the rough edges sanded off by language so that the whole book has the feel of a fever dream the chapters are each self contained short stories more or less each like a stiff shot of whiskey each a glimpse of some event in the lives of a poor family growing up in northern new york a few decades past some readers complain about the language being over workshopped but i think that's a bunk bit of whining the language here is strong and powerful and sure consistently keeps the reader off balance but so what a more straightforward transparent style would have made this story unbearable and like a crappy wally lamb book instead the relentless intensity of the writing creates a quality of distant events recalled and transformed by memory given a mythic sheen by the brain to make the events safer and less toxic a few other readers complain that the book indulges in stereotypes--poor puerto rican family domestic violence etc etc --but that's a bit of an empty accusation stereotypes are the shorthand lazy writers use to manipulate readers and nowhere does this book feel lazy or manipulative it's not a social expose no but it's not trucking in easy stereotypes either the troubling things in this story just are they're not deployed to curry reader sympathy or explain character actions or any such thing they are just part of the world this narrator survives the one weakness may be the ending which does feel a bit unforeshadowed so a flawed masterpiece","493":"three brothers the unnamed 7 year old narrator joel and manny both slightly older the three sons to a white mom and a puerto rican father who can barely take care of themselves let alone three sons as the boys watched their parents through love and war lacking basic care such as food and shelter the brothers go about their days wearing hand me down clothes tied with cords entertaining themselves through make believe war games exploring their environment and trying to understand this thing called life as the story continues and the boys grow the narrator finds he is drifting from them and the we becomes they and eventually i rough raw we the animals has left me in a bit of awe its hard to describe and as i try to write a synopsis of the book i know i am not doing it justice on audio as i experienced it it is a jumble of life stories from the one sons perspective each chapter tells a story piecing together a life story the boys mimic what they see they use the language of anger their parents use towards each other and the words of forgiveness they also have witnessed they mimic and they share and they learn at first the audio feels chaotic story to story rushing to and from one thing to the next i find myself piecing it together it felt crashing and rolling and then it changes a change i did not see coming and as i listen to it on the audio i pull in my breath tensing against what i believe is being told what i know is being told is it a love story yes is it a story of adolescence yesand it's also about family about poverty about hardships and family and strength and about growing into who you are no matter what that may mean overall i am surprised i was unaware of what this book was coming too but in a way i am also impressed with the author's choice to take an already good book to another level i am sitting here after the audio has ended processing what i had not seen","494":"very powerful message","495":"reminded me of dargamitta kathalu by khadeer babu and knockemstiff by donald pollock especially the last stories","496":"good review in nyt but i wasn't thrilled some good writing but","497":"for once in our lives marilynne robinson and i agree we the animals a good book i understand the frustration some readers may have with the plotlessness of this book it isn't so much a novel as a series of memoir y vignettes i wish it had been marketed in such a way that we weren't expecting a climactic story once i took the book on its own terms i had no problem with its drifting storytelling i do think torres' tumbling ecstatic terrifying language is really appealing it's the poet in me and i was propelled straight through to the book's end","498":"i stumbled upon this book on oyster i knew nothing about it going in and i was surprised by how much i liked it to me it was very reminiscent if catcher in the rye it was a strange coming of age book about three brothers of mixed race this was like nothing i have read before bravo justin torres","499":" this was one of the books where the writing was phenomenal the characters and storyline were unique and enthralling and everything seemed just about as perfect as it could be until the last 20 or so pages the ending of the book was completely unexpected but in a way that didn't at all mesh with the first 100 pages of novel huge leap with little to no transition left me thinking 'wait what ' so fabulous writing beautiful imagery right from the very first line but needed some major reworking for the ending to match the rest of the novel","500":"interesting though the ending felt a bit rushed it tooke a bit to get into the style of writing but once i settled into it i enjoyed it","501":" this compilation of vignettes creates a poignant piece of literary writing giving this coming of age story a unique and very violent spin this is a work about growing up in a struggling family and struggling with your own identity within a unit a warning this is not a happy story though there are happy moments this is an example of how life can not be so great sometimes but it is written beautifully http a librarians library blogspot we the animals serves as a collection of vignettes aimed to tell the story of a boy growing up as a half breed that is white mother puerto rican father as the youngest of three brothers these brothers are three years apart and in their heads they are a collective a we told in a reflective voice the narrator remembers key moments in his childhood that have led him to his present the very last vignette in this short novel readers will get the beauties and horrors of growing up in his unstable dysfunctional family the style of this novel is very similar to that of house on mango street though i do like homs much better than this the vignettes are written in a way that does not come right out and state exactly what happens a lot of the time you have to infer what is going on because that is the nature of literary writing like this most of the time i understood everything though there were times when i didn't quite understand what the narrator was trying to tell me as the reader but honestly that didn't take away from the story the stories themselves are in one word heart breaking this is a child growing up in a dysfunctional family full of some love and a lot of hate and violence and our narrator does not really feel a part of this family at all he keeps many things hidden from them even from his brothers who as they grow up become more violence focused did i really see where this was going until i got there no for me the last and longest vignette came mostly out of nowhere i would have liked to see the internal struggle view spoiler of homosexuality hide spoiler appear more in the stories leading up to the end i feel like for such a big part of the narrator it is just not addressed enough overall i really enjoyed the writing style and appreciated what justin torres was trying to accomplish in this short debut if you are a fan of literary stories told with the use of vignettes then it is worth checking out","502":"a coming of age novel autobiography of 3 mixed race boys who live with loving but dysfunctional and erratic parents there is poetry in the way love is expressed and an unexpected ending short and you can't put it down","503":"i was tempted to give this book a four instead of five star rating based purely on my frustration with the ending i wanted so much a happy ending i did but no matter my sadness torres's story is beautiful he lovingly guides us through an impoverished materially not personally boyhood and brotherhood through the eyes of a boy and it's beautiful","504":"i loved the raw and yet poetic prose of torres intense and deep i wish it was a 100 pages longer though","505":"an excerpt from my review in the nervous breakdown we the animals is a tiny gem miniature in length but supersize in emotional effect hardly over a hundred pages with chapters averaging about four pages each the book resists easy categorization the cover calls it a novel and it has the arc and scope of a classic bildingsroman a boy's life from around the age of seven to seventeen as he encounters monstrous obstacles on his way to manhood and finally separates himself from his family and launches into the world on his own one reason readers will be attracted to this book is the mythic quality of its story three brothers who live almost like wild animals because of their parents' outsize neglect abuse and ferocious self destructive love because it is based on the author' life we can gasp at the knowledge that torres lived through such an ordeal with his compassion and empathy intact for the full review see http www thenervousbreakdown com sh","506":"three brothers three musketeers mixed race they talk of their experiences and coming of age their embarrassments their fears their joys and pain life in it's truest forms no fake facades fairy tale stories souls that try to survive and be happy against the odds against prejudices and the concrete jungle the family ups and downs father drinking father hitting on ma mum and dad just plain in love the joys of brotherhood makes you want to be young again surrounded by siblings this story was a heart warming treat brutal and a true portrayal of many families one that would touch your heart and stay with you for a time this is one story i will be revisiting again some time also here on my webpage","507":"taut punchy writing moving coming of age story about 3 boys u0026amp a family finding its identity","508":"lol what man i was totally grooving on this highly stylized iowa writers' workshopped pluralistic bildungsroman for what it was ephemeral transient it was like tree of life but without the dinosaurs and not about white people and then in the final quarter it just goes flying off the rails","509":"very sharp poignant stories about three young brothers raising themselves and each others amidst an exasperated depressed and neglectful mother and an absent self important neglectful father i enjoyed each story and look forward to following justin torres' career and later works as i think he will prove to be a promising writer i'd recommend this novel to anyone who liked 'the house on mango street' by sandra cisneros and or 'letters to wendy's' by joe wenderoth","510":"the joys and struggles of brotherhood are spun beautifully in the main chapters however there is a large disconnect in the last two chapters where the revelation could've been a complete different story they are choppy jump from the rest of the book and ruined the seamlessness of the storyline there needed to be a few more chapters in between to flow into the ending","511":"this book was a complete disappointment just because someone writes of a racial experience or a gay experience doesn't mean that what they have written is a great piece of literature this book doesn't speak to the human experience and the narrator comes across as self absorbed i have no idea why this book is so highly praised","512":"starts as a series of short vague vignettes as we move through the stories the dysfunction in the family takes a more substantial shape until finally what we have suspected is confirmed the end is so nebulous that instead of leaving things unsaid it says nothing there is some beautiful imagery though ma could hold tears on her eyelids longer than anyone some days she walked around like that for hours holding them there not letting them drop","513":" an interesting story of three brothers mixed race but you have a feeling they are fully puertorriquenos growing up in brooklyn and talking about life in the language without euphemisms in it's raw form i thought it will be fast read but it wasn't partly because of book not related things but also because something was lacking in the story there is a race issue as well as gay issue that is lurking throughout the novel until it shows up poverty issue struggle of low class growing up in hostile surrounding and persisting but all of that has been told as if he's enumerating not allowing me to form any opinion of my own i wasn't sympathize with them at all precisely because that was obviously what was expected the story was a little bit too monotone chapters were exactly the same nothing new happened until it finally did but i waited too long sometimes i wasn't sure whether my eyes are sliding the lines solely while my brain was somewhere else they style was being a debut quite pretentious utterly reduced without any reason i could sense and as a consequence atmosphere disappeared along with and that's probably the worst emotional impact now many people praised this incredibly so maybe it's me shrug","514":" i honestly think the publishers should include whether on the inside or preface of the book a warning for potential readers that there is strong possibility that this novel could be triggering for some it was an unsettling and disturbing read well written and melancholic although there is an indication on the book that family dysfunction is one of the books central tennets and that psychosocial issues are pervase themes throughout it is not so much the presence of family dysfunction but the extent and degree of it which inevitably leads to abuse which is disturbing i would definitely reccomend reading it however it isn't a book i would re read hurriedly or of my own volition","515":"there has been so much hype around this book that i have been wanting to get my hands on it unfortunately it didn't make nearly the impact on me as it appears to have made on so many others was it impactful yes was it edgy yes was it a great book ehh not so much i'd say it was good but certainly not great it had so much potential but it just didn't get there i think justin torres has a really interesting edgy kind of way about his writing which i think is fantastic i think there is a lot of potential for him and his voice that was the strength of this book the voice the first 2 3 of the novel had me mesmerized i was so there so interested in this family and then suddenly out of nowhere the author goes another direction it was abrupt it was unsettling and frankly it took a really good novel down a few pegs to a good almost ehh book if only torres had invested more time and story 50 100 pages perhaps to set up the last 3rd of the book instead of just dropping it into the readers lap with no set up or context if only torres had given the story those extra 50 to 100 pages it could have been amazing the flow of the story arc is ultimately what i disliked about this novel and why in the end i struggle with rating it this is one of those books that really had potential but it just didn't live up to it i can see why there are folks who loved it who felt something as a result of the story the first 2 3 really are wonderful and impactful those initial pages get under your skin and make you feel something which for me was one of the reasons that i ultimately disliked the novel so much to make me feel so much and then end the novel so badly i just couldn't get past it it cheapened the entire novel for me i'm not sure that i can even recommend it that is how disappointing the last 3rd of the novel was to me it is a very short novel so it's not a huge investment of time so if you want to see what all the fuss is about you might want to check it out but ultimately i'd suggest you skip it and seek out something else","516":"very good read excellent writing i feel like there is a big piece missing between being a child and adult at the end i think a few more chapters could have made sense i read the last few chapters a couple times and i feel like there should be something transitional there excellent writer i found his name amd book through a superb op ed about how important the gay bar can be","517":"surprised by the light and smoothness of this novella was expecting gritty raw writing like jt leroy however discredited he she was it had a real mfa polish to it which i don't necessarily like slight","518":"this review has been hidden because it contains spoilers to view it click here it was great until about 3 4s through and i felt like i skipped a whole chunk of the book the story took a sharp turn very suddenly it could have worked but it just felt like something was missing otherwise i really liked the writing and the narrator character","519":"while beautifully written the ending is disturbing and seemed disjointed to me it would be interested to hear what others think about this book","520":" we the animals is not only an exquisite debut novel it's an exquisite novel period justin torres tells an honest emotionally wrenching story of three young brothers half white half puerto rican growing up in a dysfunctional and poverty stricken family in upstate new york but it is about so much more than that--love heartbreak hope disappointment brotherhood family--i could go on and on torres's stark prose is so striking every word so deliberate and poetic... it reminds me in some ways of cormac mccarthy's the road i picked it up on a sunday afternoon and read the entire novel a brief 125 pages in a few short hours but it has had a lasting effect on me--one that i don't expect to fade anytime soon we the animals is undoubtedly one of my favorite books of 2011 and i very much look forward to seeing what this brilliant writer does next","521":"i kept hoping for an exciting turn of events and was extremely disappointed when the book ended i didn't even understand the last few chapters odd ending and didn't seem relevant","522":"i liked this book justin torres was ungracious at a qu0026amp a reading i went to which was disappointing","523":"this is another book you love or hate i wouldn't say i hate this but i would not recommend it i read one other review and agreed with it that book is not good this book has received many accolades not sure why perhaps many authors have the same agents or book publishers and they are contractually obligated to give praise to a new authors this is a short story not a book the characters are underdeveloped and frankly you do not care for any of them since the characters are not developed i did not connect with them does the author think he is being clever since we never find out the narrators name this book could have been better if each chapter was written from the ma's paps' or a brother's point of view in the second to last chapter i am not sure has much time has elasped but i am assuming the boys are pre teens or teenagers like many authors the ending of the book seems rushed and very anti climatic the book ends abruptly and i was pleased the book was finished","524":"why did i bother oh i know i read a good review and it was only 128 pages don't bother","525":" in some ways this short novel is quite strong and perhaps a kind of male equivalent to house on mango street short chapters full of childhood memories whether real or fictional a kind of poetic language but for most of the book torres's language is arguably almost too charged a kind of hyperspeech that owes as much to performance as text striking and evocative but at the verge of over the top ness but the world he creates is indeed sharply rendered and so clearly focused on the child narrator's perception as to be almost a journey into a foreign world though the book is set in the us these chapters when the 3 brothers are still three together are the heart of the book and full of insight and not at all dissimilar to recent first rate children's books in many ways except for the some of the language and sexual frankness but the long penultimate chapter the intended climax in which the narrator discovers or reveals that he is gay feels almost contrived the coming of age narrator's inevitable recognition that he is different in some fashion from those around him as though the novel had to have an emotional trauma in order to be complete torres's sharp language and an eye attuned to tiny details of family life are the real heroes here not the machinery of plot","526":" this short 128 pages novel with its first person plural we not i narrator proceeds through short snapshot chapters to tell the story of three brothers the we growing up in a quasi dysfuntional family in upstate ny state the father paps is puerto rican and the mother is white no more details available both are from brooklyn and moved upstate after their very early marriage he 16 she 14 both parents work at what jobs they can get and the three boys bring themselves up in those long stretches where no one's watching them even though the narrator is plural it's clear that the youngest of the brothers is the main narrator we see everything through his eyes while the story of this family fascinates it's the language of the writer that sets the book apart torres writes an electric and poetic prose which is sometimes excessive but mostly in the sweet spot by the end as the brothers grow from the pack of animals in the title to separated characters at least the youngest has clearly taken his separate path his difference acknowledged if not always appreciated by his family strong story is a short space","527":" i really enjoyed this book super quick read it's not a totally happy tale but it is very well written told by the youngest brother of 3 he is 7 years old their parents were very young when they got together their mother 14 when she got pregnant with the oldest boy 10 at the start of the book and the father 16 the family is dysfunctional and there is some tough stuff in here but there is also the joy and mischief of three young brothers growing up kind of poor and left largely to their own devices","528":"ugh over wrought","529":" i have to acknowledge that there is some very good writing in this book the language is succinct and powerful unfortunately i didn't really become interested in the story until the last 20 pages i think it's a stretch to call this book a novel it's more like a very short collection of short stories the stories are all about the same family but there's not much connection between them and most of the stories are quite short as well they felt more like snapshots that stories and for that focuses on one family and has no plot there was surprisingly little character development the two brothers seemed more or less the same and neither was very interesting the mother also felt somewhat flat to me the only characters that really interested me were the narrator and the father although other reviewers have criticized the author for what felt to them like a jarring shift near the end i didn't feel like there had been enough connection between the earlier stories to take issue with the shift at the end in fact the last chapter was the one i found most compelling perhaps because it was the only one long enough to develop much plot i'll be interested to see what justin torres does next because there was some great writing in this book i just hope he adds a bit of story and some more interesting characters next time","530":"read march 2013 3 5 ending kinda fizzled","531":"torres gives us a unique perspective on coming of age","532":"three young boys growing up neglected abused and loved it is a beautiful sad little book","533":"i liked parts of this book i really wanted to like the whole book but it was extremely poorly written one minute they're kids and then they're teenagers or are they young adults it just skips around and makes no sense sometimes then there's the ending wtf the entire thing seems more like a draft than a finished novel","534":"there is nothing redeeming about this horrible book","535":" this was a somewhat unusual very short memoir about a seven year old boy presumably the author torres growing up with his two older brothers and his white ma and puerto rican paps their family is definitely not beaver cleaver's the parents were married as very young teens and the three brothers are feral like in their rough co existence within a family filled with love and brutality the writing is heatfelt and gritty in describing how the boys relate to one another one moment beating on one another and the next defending eachother the same goes for their parents who take turns making love and fighting with eachother nevertheless there seems to be a deep love between all of them in the end the author reveals a secret which sets him apart but still bound to his loving brutish family","536":"i finished reading the novel this afternoon on my back porch among an extended family of potted plants looking out on their wild cousins it's a short book and i read it slow i read a chapter before a meal a chapter on the bus going into the city i read a chapter in the morning drinking my cup of coffee i read it quietly and slowly and during the day i didn't read it at night i quickly understood that reading this book was the opposite of going to sleep i knew i would want to do more with its energy newly inside me we the animals made me want to stop and appreciate the complexity of living to remember and savor the small details of a life and to write it made me remember what writing can do and how reading an exceptional book can at least temporarily play with my habits and expectations the book is taut and concentrated it's clever and simple and it brought back the dull ache of growing up when i only had a vague notion that life was larger than i could imagine in the small town of my childhood we the animals is about the brothers i never had and therefore about the sisters i did it's an avalanche and a meditation it's about going on an adventure and how any adventure contains a constant fear and a constant amazement i admire the way torres writes and found myself stopping to appreciate the subtle power of his images but i never lost the flow it's a novel that reads like poetry paying attention to sound and rhythm but it reads quick like a feast you don't want to end full review here http behindheavydrapes blogspot com","537":"killer i found myself re reading passages aloud to my partner because they were so sharp and poetic i loved the smallness of the physical book it could easily be read in one sitting but i felt a strong desire to protect and extend my reading of the book the way ma wants the narrator to stay six and a little boy and not to turn seven and toughen up","538":" written from the point of view of the youngest of three brothers this book is mostly sparse and oddly unemotional even as it describes a violently dysfunctional family the boys imagine themselves all kinds of things and accept beatings as normal and develop a weird hatred of their mother for taking beatings and for not being able to cope when their father leaves the language is clinical and yet naive at the same time somehow it makes the bad stuff worse and they really do seem like animals or forces of nature at times even when they grow up and aren't together anymore pretty strong for a debut novel","539":"what a rough aching glittering little book the truth told slant sad u0026amp exultant all at once","540":"taut concise story novella of a family of boys growing up in upstate ny the sense of pack life growing up loosely and learning by rote and or instinct all come through","541":"short sweet and powerful can't wait to discuss this one with book club","542":"i thought this book could be better read as a book of poems beautiful images and profound one liners the novel reads like a collection of images rather than one whole story there's nothing wrong with that however i think it made reading the novel a little bit tiring sometimes he added too much to the stories because he determined it as a novel my favorite sections were trash kites talk to me and trench very honest weird and touching","543":"i rated this high for the emotion it brought out in me it tells the story of how too many children grow up then we expect them to be normal functioning adults just like their parents before them they're not prepared for adulthood yet they'll have a family of their own and be just as lost as their parents were oh so sad","544":"not what i expected at all super fast read and could've been longer seemed rushed at the end mostly 3 1 2 stars from me very dark and realistic i wish he had developed the characters a bit longer it ends up just being a glimpse into the life of this family and ends abrubtly","545":"extraordinary shocking yet beautiful yet simple yet profound and honest yet painful what a unique voice this author has","546":" reviews for we the animals are either in favor of its brilliance or condemn torres for overworking his prose my critique lies somewhere in the middle i found torres' writing to be a study of choices of words and combinations of descriptors that to me were quite original and interesting however i can see how some especially those who follow writers and writing right out of workshops might think it a bit overworked like room i found the innocence of the protagonist's descriptions of life growing up in a low income half white half puerto rican household with two young somewhat hopeless parents to be intriguing acts between parents and children or between brothers that would raise my eyebrows were presented honestly without knowing judgment it is honestly crazy to come to realize that some people grow up believing that certain behaviors are okay that they're normal the book is broken up in to short chapters that read like little stories separate from each other yet all coming together to provide an overall understanding of a life there is a twist within the last few chapters the voice changes slightly i didn't even realize it until reading some reviews and then thinking back and torres pushes you as a reader to readily accept new revelations with the ease with which you read about the first 3 4 of the book however the story becomes a little disjointed hard to follow and the writing leaves you feeling uneasy i wouldn't give the title of this book out as a blanket must read those who read it will either appreciate certain things about it or they will be completely turned off by the content racism homosexuality morality etc it is however a quick read and i did not regret the reading of it although i think it is unlikely that i will ever re read it in an attempt to gain a better understanding i'll just take my impressions for what they are","547":"a review from keep calm and read on if ever there was a group of books that perfectly captured childhood experience and sibling comradery we the animals by justin torres would be among the few the story follows a boy and his three brothers growing up in a multiracial house in upstate new york before i go on with this review here is a spoiler warning i came to this book after listening to a podcast in which it was discussed it in great detail fortunately most of that detail was forgotten by the time i picked the book up but what i did remember was talk of eloquent language which i can't get enough of upon opening to the first page i was hit with this beautiful language like a rushing waterfall in a lush and humid jungle i almost didn't care if the story sucked the language was so gorgeous that i was willing to read it all without question a story can be amazing but it may still lack the basic necessity that is good narration read the rest of my review at my blog keep calm and read on www keepcalmandreadon net","548":" a promising debut from a young writer but not quite the blistering exceptional work that i was led to expect from npr and fellow goodreads com reviewers the subject matter and premise is captivating the protagonist is a young mixed race adolescent boy growing up in extreme poverty with two brothers and an abusive sometimes there sometimes not father called paps ma is young she had her first child at 14 and ill equipped to give these three boys the attention and direction they need so the unsupervised boys run wild like animals hence the title of the book the book is slight though just 122 pages broken up into short little chapters that read like little adventures or even short stories that could be read one at a time which is one of my biggest criticisms with this book i wish torres had taken more time to fill in the gaps to this overarching coming of age story and developed these characters or at least the main protagonist more fully after two hours all it takes to read the novella i was left with some great moments but also left wanting more","549":"beautiful crystalline prose that shimmers in this story of boyhood never tedious or sentimental this novel made of vignettes run roughshod as we might hope it would through the moments that carry a boy from the quivering frailty of infancy to the defiantly glorious age of rebellion","550":"i can't give this a four but it's not a flat three aside from the bleak and disturbing nature of the novel i think the first person plural narration was a miss it make for a confusing thread also the leaning of semicolons to string two sometimes three sentences together quickly turned into a bad habit the ending came out of no where probably needs a bit more set up earlier on so a 3 5 as there's potential with time someone to watch","551":"the writing in here is astonishing fluid well done i read this nearly in one sitting and almost missed my train stop on the amtrak a whirlwind read curious to know how you read the ending at first i hated it but i think i may have judged it too rashly","552":"brilliant beautiful debut novel about three brothers growing up in poverty told from the point of view of the youngest brother the novel has a kind of dreamlike quality to it but it brims full of spare poetic vitality there's not really a central plot unless it's the struggle of the brothers to understand their parents' sometimes dysfunctional but always passionate relationship i'm excited to see what torres does next equally powerful on a second reading","553":" i enjoyed reading we the animals but i can't quite recommend it it contains some beautifully sparse language and interesting images but it simply doesn't add up to very much certainly nothing that will stick with me the only vague semblance of a story is this the writer was once a child in a poor and colorfully dysfunctional family and then he grew up and found an identity outside the family unit as a writer an adult and a gay man the end the chapters are isolated vignettes and the narration remains too matter of fact to allow the reader to fully connect with the characters this strikes me as a book that torres needed to write serving the writer more than the reader it's supposedly semi autobiographical and there is a confessional and purgative element to much of it based on the quality of the prose i would definitely read more by torres if he were to write more but we the animals feels more like a writer's workshop project than a true novel","554":"beautiful writing but so stylistic i didn't feel there was any real story there i didn't feel that interested","555":"not my kind of book","556":"i'd read several raving reviews about this novel so i decided to pick it up it was interesting enough it is not so much as novel as a collection of vignettes memories about a fairly dysfunctional family as told by the youngest of three sons since i have two sons of my own i could related to the way the boys were described and related to one another particularly in childhood the writing was also quite descriptive and beautiful all together though i'm not raving it was good i'm glad i read it but i can't see myself reading it again","557":"the first several short stories or chapters which ever you prefer are sweet and sentimental the ending is sad torres is great at capturing the wisdom in young children and struggles of being an adult","558":" i thought the book was extremely well written very lyrical and the imagery was fantastic there were points during the book that it sounded like a poem i did 'audio book' this novel and enjoyed it right up until the end when i was shocked i did not 'get' or understand the ending at all i even relistened to the last cd of the book but did not see the ending coming in terms of character development thus i was perplexed as to what the author was trying to convey except maybe that even the brightest and the best of us can be debased to becoming an 'animal' i guess but that's a bit too depressing for me","559":"wow well i read this so fast i didn't even have time to put it on my currently reading shelf i really really liked this book it was a beautifully told ugly story i think you will understand exactly what that means once you've read it yourself the writing was literature poetic interesting i must read this book again the story line was ugly as i read it i couldn't help but wonder fair or not how much of this was autobiographical i can't imagine writing a similar book for example what would my parents think what would my parents' friends think it sounds ridiculous i know but i still can't help wondering i have not read a book quite like this and i loved that about it too i must read this book again","560":"ugh this is why i don't read books written for adults","561":"i loved the language and the images it created i guess evocative is the right word this is not a plot centric book it's really about this family and the mini events that created them it was too short i wanted more and the ending seemed a little random which is why it doesn't quite get 5 stars more like 4 2 3","562":"wow what a little power packed punch of a book i loved so many things about its 100 or so pages","563":" this book and its author are everywhere lately i swear i've seen three separate facebook posts from npr about it him in the last month and there is something really thrilling about the fact that a book like this is getting so much attention while i wouldn't call it a novel it is a powerhouse of a collection vignettes that read more like extended prose poems having listened to justin torres yes on npr it was clear that the book is heavily influenced by his life and i will be curious to see where he goes with book #2 my only complaint is that it never reaches the crescendo i had hoped for and i felt like the book was so heavily weighted with childhood vignettes i never got a good grasp as the narrator's struggles and triumphs as a grown man that said it's a wonderful little book with beautiful visceral imagery and a relentless cadence to the language","564":"hearing someone describe a life that tends to be a bit strained when discovering your true nature is one thing but reading how a person develops through those first years is quite another excellent book","565":"this is coming of age stories of three boys growing up in an dysfunctional home with very young violent parents it made my stomach hurt but i couldn't stop reading it","566":"a novel this is a bunch of flash fiction pieces not one of which is particularly memorable","567":"i'm riveted i'm ripped i'm tickled i'm savaged i'm warmed all in the book","568":"i typically do not like coming of age stories too often they feel forced and sentimental we the animals is an amazing exception this narrative of three wild boys and their emotionally unstable parents is both one of the most beautiful books i have read in a long time torres uses his brilliant prose to resurrect all the joyful and terrifying experiences of childhood the boys in we the animals are constantly being forced into situations that are beyond their comprehension but we cannot read them as victims they respond to the traumas of the adult world with destructive glee raising a son myself i cannot help but recognize this the reader both loves these boys and worries for them my only minor complaint with this book is the ending the standard conclusion of the coming of age genre is the childishness of the protagonist being destroyed by an encounter with something that forces them to act as an adult typically death or sex force their way into the child's world like most more recent authors torres chooses sex this is fine but the conclusion felt incomplete fast forward 5 years the narrator discovers his sexuality his family reacts to this the end this felt rushed to this reader torres created a family of vibrant tragic characters and seems to leave them unfinished of course the only reason this felt unsatisfying was because torres created characters so real and compelling that i needed to know more it is a problem that any book should have overall we the animals is the best writing i have read all year","569":"loved this book very short lively stories of a childhood memories that seem to come from a child himself but written in delightfully descriptive narrative that is very reflective of a child's view of things that go wrong things that go right and things out of control net to see the author speak and appreciate the angst of getting out each chapter that gives the reader a great ride","570":"i was drawn to this one because of the good reviews and because the story involves puerto rican half breeds well this mini novel is poetic at times but it is missing way too much to be considered good i did want to know more about this family so i'm very disappointed save your money and spend it something else","571":"fast paced well written coming of age biographical short book excellent","572":"poor david copperfield i keep reading things alongside it found this at the library and figured i should give it a go since it's short really lovely writing oddly i found the coming out part to feel tacked on somehow it sort of belonged to a different book however it was a joy to read such an emotionally specific novel by a gay latino that rang true for me i think it's a solid debut and i hope to read more from torres in the future","573":"raw and harsh a quick read worth the time god's scattered all the clean among the dirty we're nothing more than a fistful of seed that god tossed into the mud and horseshit we're on our own","574":"powerful book with a unique perspective i thought the firt part of the book when the brothers are young is the most poignant and wrenching","575":"there were some vivid and well written visuals in this short debut by justin torres but this wasn't an instant classic","576":"i wish i could give 1 2 stars because i think it's worth more than 3 but i struggle giving it a 4 i think torres is incredibly eloquent and i appreciate his writing style but the story is so very dark from the beginning to the end there is an ominous sense of doom","577":" this book is beautifully descriptive but the balance of the story felt off it read as a memoir of one of the three main characters with no real purpose of plot towards the end a scene was described and while i can sadly see it happening it was heartbreaking to read and the ending was horrible it didn't fit with the rest of the book at all and really ruined the story for me i don't agree with the characters choices however it seemed like the author was more interested in making a statement rather than wrapping the story in a way that makes it keep living after the book ends","578":"very different even for my taste it was interesting","579":" i picked this book up because in fact i thought it was another one that had been recommended to me in fact it was not the author tried hard to be very lyrical with is writing tried to make everything sound flawless and perfect perhaps he tried a little bit too hard i was enjoying it in the beginning but then it became a little flowery for a book about three rough and tumble boys i felt that a lot more could have been included in this book it felt like a series of snapshots interesting but not quite enough information a glimpse into the lives of these three boys and their parents but no real involvement it felt much like looking through a photo album of strangers you find at a garage sale the pictures were attractive enough but without the background knowledge it couldn't hold my interest","580":"these characters really got under my skin i didn't understand them yet was fascinated by them i'm glad that i kept reading and didn't throw in the towel when it first made me uncomfortable the last story really has me thinking and evoked some interesting conversation with my husband just like a good book should","581":"the writing style was not my preference but i will admit that it gave a certain amount of life to this story of a puerto rican boy growing up in a disfunctional family in new york the darkness at the end was gripping","582":" i offer you the book's opening paragraph we wanted more we knocked the butt ends of our forks against the table tapped our spoons against our empty bowls we were hungry we wanted more volume more riots we turned up the knob on the tv until our ears ached with the shouts of angry men we wanted more music on the radio we wanted beats we wanted rock we wanted muscles on our skinny arms we had bird bones hollow and light and we wanted more density more weight we were six snatching hands six stomping feet we were brothers boys three little kings locked in a feud for more though it can be read in a few hours there is nothing meager about this book if you read nothing else in 2013 read this","583":"great concise writing where evry sentence packs a punch not an uplifting summer beach read but a pretty good look at being an outsider in a dysfunctional family","584":"whereas justin torres is a solid writer i did not like the story itself it was brutal and ugly and not something i generally like reading","585":"3 brothers growing up poor without adult guidance short little parts of there life together and how they spent thier days so well written you can feel the constant tension that is thier lives the last of the book comes out of no where it floats away from the rest of the book","586":"a beautiful little book full of the wonder and pain of childhood didn't love the ending though","587":"eh it was ok a quick read","588":"this book was so raw and so beautiful each 2 3 page chapter reads like a fully formed short story taken together the portrait of this family is rich and each character is complicated i also liked the way he uses we point of view but there is a definite i character so it doesn't feel gimmicky","589":"a beautiful and sad debut novel reminiscent of 'jesus son' in it's prose a personal favorite the growing up and apart of three brothers as they fight their way towards adulthood is heartbreaking looking forward to more by this author","590":"loved it all the way to the ending which seemed really abrupt and like it came out of nowhere","591":"sad short mediocre book a 5 on my 10 scale","592":"interesting well written coming of age story kind of a big jump though","593":"it was a quick read because it is short still trying to sort out what i think about the book the positive reviews were never ending so i question that i am questioning my response to this book when i finished it i thought that was some really well written poetry if you r looking for well threaded story telling this is probably not your book each chapter is a vignette rather than following from the last","594":"\"ma could hold tears on her eyelids longer than anyone some days she walked around like that for hours holding them there not letting them drop \"three brothers kicking it up enjoying each other causing chaos until something upsets the pot and the balance is broken but only for a moment making slingshots out of forks chasing bullfrogs building human pyramids and marble games their antics were humorous and childlike every day is an adventure with some good and some bad days you just had to learn to go with the flow mother works the graveyard shift and she gets confused waking up in the middle of the night she'd think it was morning and she'd wake up the children dragging them to the store only to find the store closed or having the children brush their teeth and slip them into pj's for bed in the middle of the afternoon you just never knew what to expect the story of the tomatoes the lotion and ketchup was terrific not many children and their moms can share that type of experience it was definitely a kodak moment paps was a different story he was proud of his heritage and he didn't cut loose that often unless there was alcohol involved sliding across the linoleum floor dancing with his children he showed that he could have a good time but his belt came out if discipline was needed in the household it's heartbreaking to see the childish ways disappearing and the boys becoming young men but its life and the challenges they faced were no different than others in their shoes a real short read but i enjoyed reading about this family and the life that they led so many times i laughed at the adventures the boys had and just took the book for what it was it's a book of fiction it drew me in and kept my attention it made me aware of others around me and i enjoyed it the father was proud of his heritage and he voiced that many times as he wanted others to know it i believe he wanted his children to be aware of it sometimes you can try to do everything but people mold themselves the ending of the book was not what i expected but people deal with life differently","595":"seemed more of a collection of short stories than a novel three brothers growing up in a dysfunctional family father vascillates between caring and absent mother between depressed and caring seemed like a huge jump in time in the last few chapters","596":"wonderfully written left me in tears highly recommended","597":"we the animals is a quick read it was not the most interesting book i've ever read but it contains some intriguing parts i think the book would have been better had the revelation at the end been expanded upon some more in the story","598":"awesome writing very different from my normal books the first two paragraphs had me hooked on the authors voice","599":"really well written book as a mom of three boys it struck a chord with me the story was dark and haunting as the three boys are growing up in a very difficult environment but i thought the author did a good job seeing it through the eyes of a child i felt it was a tad bit short but i think it's supposed to be that way i just would have liked to have a little more of the story at the end a little more closure with what happened to the boys as they grew up","600":"a touch too poetic for me but a nice story","601":"unfortunately i don't remember this book well enough to write much about it but i was reminded of it today and doug reminded me how much of an impression it had made on me i didn't find it an easy book to pick up but i was very moved by it at the end","602":" this was a beautifully written novella that reads more like poetry than prose it is unsettling from the beginning though it appears to be nothing more that a few brief short stories about a boy's childhood he and his brother's are at once just like any child living any childhood and then they are loud vulgar disruptive and the eponymous animals of the title the stories build until the final chapters when things get very tragic and very sad yet it is an end that you can see coming from the beginning","603":"it's less a novel and more a collection of interchangeable vignettes thrown together to resemble a story there is no clear plot development and no character development until the last five pages and honestly even those pages just come off as unnecessary drama it really adds nothing to the story the ending makes no sense and more than anything i found myself scratching my head when i was done skip it i kind of wish i had","604":"this book was a big surprise to me although the book is short it is packed with emotion and the way it is written makes each word important the book takes place within a family that had 3 boys at a very young age it chronicles their struggles laughter pain happiness and other emotions in an almost poetic prose it had many emotional turns along the way just like any normal family but that is what made it real and gritty","605":"phenomenal one of the best debuts i've read in ages","606":" i picked up this book because of its gay main character but i got so much more than i expected justin torres tackles issues of mixed heritage poverty and homosexuality by not really engaging them at all but rather introducing them as the normal unconquerable everyday life you truly will not see anything beyond the eyes of the main character and although it may confuse you when trying to see the whole picture it provides an intimate relationship with the character that is needed for the ending effect the writing style is simple and the book is physically small but don't think of it as a quick read there is so much content inside and you'll be thinking for hours afterwards torres managed to open my eyes to just how privileged i am and it was frightening","607":"i stupidly thought that this was non fiction the entire time i was reading it but that tells you how vividly torres put together a childhood","608":"this is about a family 3 boys very close in age and wild by any measure their very tired mother who adores them all and their alternately loving and abusing father from what i've read about torres this novel is heavily autobiographical it is in turns painful joyous heartbreaking and enlightening it isn't an easy read despite it's slim stature but is beautifully fierce and will grab at your heart","609":"a wonderful short read i was intrigued that the author could make such a strong emotional impression using such simple language my only fault with this book was that it introduced the main character's sexuality far too late i thought it should have been a bigger factor earlier on especially because it comes to define him through his parent's reactions otherwise a really great book","610":"oh i was with this book i read the comments about it being over workshopped i still enjoyed the prose i read the complaints about it falling into the trend to call loosely strung together short stories a novel i still enjoyed the vignettes and then i got to page 103 which is a full 82% through the book mind you and holy hell how did we get here did the printer drop a few chapters where were the years in between 7 and what now must be a teen and now we have a plot again i was fine with the vignettes when 82% of the book was vignettes where were any hints of his internal struggle view spoiler the struggle that he poured into a journal for what must have been years based on the scene when everyone in his family has read the journal hide spoiler i liked torres's writing i really did but the haste with which we the animals was wrapped up leaves me frustrated i'm torn on stars 3 1 2 for writing 2 for execution","611":"quick read interesting story i enjoyed this","612":"3 1 2 stars very atmospheric thought the non plot slice of life mosaic style suited the memoir esque tone only thing that held me back from 4 was the ending with the squirm inducing middle aged bus driver scene and also the scene where the parents have sex in the bathroom while the three boys are in the tub which the nyt called a striking scene and i call creepy but beautiful writing style nicely narrated in the audio version","613":"i read this short intense book in about an hour it felt more like a collection of story poems about three brothers growing up in an erratic and dangerous way","614":"a beautifully written story about a very difficult childhood but the love and closeness in the family was there too","615":" i finished this over the weekend too long bus commute short book getting through lots of books i was also lucky to hear him read at the national book festival yesterday as well i know it seems like i five star everything but i think i just hit a good streak of books this is an excellent short novel about a puerto rican american weird to split that up as pr is part of the us family in upstate new york most of the novel consists of vignettes about the violent and yet somehow still loving relationship between all the members of the family at times it is more like poetry with long rambling paragraphs with the actual action kind of implied which makes it more disturbing all the same an excellent debut novel","616":"powerful coming of age story the writing crackles off the page and speeds you through its short length the ending jars a bit in an unexpected direction but the underlying idea that we are at our core animals driven by testosterone and desire love and fear pride and instinct as basic as nature itself remains constant","617":"another short book this is an extremely short book novella of three half breed boys growing up in upstate new york certainly not a feel good read written through the viewpoint of the youngest boy it combines the angry energetic voice of a male hoodlum with the language of a poet more pages wouldn't have hurt","618":"i really enjoyed this book it was a quick and easy read the only thing i had the problem with is the end it was very sudden with no build up to it at all and i felt like it was unbelievable because it was so out of the blue i couldn't find a basis for it still a good read","619":"this is a different type of book for me although it was very short in those brief 120 pages it still managed to get under my skin and in my head","620":"this is a shorter story 125 pages a reviewer or two has said i read it in a few hours 2 3 the story told from the perspective of what we learn is a 7 year old boy he has a birthday and his mother wants him to stay six six plus one year six plus two whatever a strange family strange in that the father either one dry humps the mother in the bathroom her ass on the white porcelain sink her back pressed into the faucet and mirror or he focks her dearly while the boys take a bath i guess three boys close this that the other and so on the father is there then he is not the father beats the mother then he does not they have a car and then they do not they have a truck the story takes a bender late at night when the boys break a window on this old camper and the boy from there comes out finds them brings them back to the place shows them a porno tape on the vcr i take it so then the narrator the youngest too ahhhh he is made at the bus stop homosexual kite flying i guess he keeps a journal or he has been doing so the family finds it reads it late in the story the narrative takes this somewhat anti personal tone see the father see the son see the mother there's things to like about the story the telling itself plain simple to the point while also there were times when the narrative seemed to be skirting the issue like the sex scene between the parents in the bathroom is there in narrative detail whereas the scene w the bus driver is somewhat vague and abstract cold thumbs whereas prior the mothers back was pressed into the faucet into the mirror although too there was occasion when it seemed like all 3 boys had sex with the mother seemed because the narrative was abstract enough you wondered although scenes before and aft left little to doubt the what i call anti personal narrative toward the end see the father see the mother see the son dunno what to make of that in a sense that does add to the sense of the feeling of distance even though there in much of that finale the father washing the son we are in the bathroom again there in the bathroom the mother bringing in clothes so yeah that is nice when it is paralleled with what had come earlier the parents putting on a show for the boys the father banging the mother as her ass sat in the sink i think it was a dry hump as the father's pants are described not bunched on the floor don't recall the detail so onward and upward like the man said in 1987 i think i'll write a story with a lot of butt focking and cock sucking in it apparently that is what our itching ears want to hear","621":"short novel but really good bittersweet story","622":"after my recent forays in to sentimentality and romance i was overdue for a return to the kind of writing that puts me in awe of someone's talent with words words words words it's not always about how many of them there but how few can the writer use to invoke the the emotions that he's after justin torres is a man of few words the book comes in at a bit over 100 pages but in that tight space he takes creates vivid heartbreaking infuriating characters that feel completely believable he captures the strange tension between family members brothers parents and children lovers in so few words that the book feels like an acid portrait the brothers love each other but fight like animals the parents are in love but fight like animals the children love their parents but fight like animals not at all typical but still torres manages to illuminate the way people who love each other can still not know each other looking as we do across the gulf of years or failure does any child truly understand his parents' relationship but as interesting as that is it's when torres has his narrator the youngest brother turn his lens on himself that the book really nailed me again in few words i felt the struggle of the character's realizations about himself we the animals cut through the richness of sentiment and left me feeling exposed conflicted and clear headed it is highly acidic","623":"torres in his first novel finds a collective voice a we that he uses to take in himself and his two brothers the three of them the wild thing offspring of a poor biracial couple who are simultaneously tempestuous and deeply depressed the story subtly tells itself through a shift in voice from the we with which it begins to the me and them with which it ends just as the narrator has to define himself has to explore his sexuality gay and face the paradise busting ogre of his own potential vast the book brings off small miracles of temporality torres looks back on who he was at the same time he inhabits that boy in a very hard to do eternal present to the extent that he becomes both who he was and who he is he is the boy the animal the brother he is the man who needed to be himself and to tell of who he was i thought of carson mccullers' member of the wedding about frankie in that book grabbing on to the idea of her brother's coming wedding because to be a member in it gives her her first sense of adult identity they she famously said are the we of me for the boy in the book the brothers were the we to be one of them was to know who you were where you fit whom you could count on the inevitable loss of that knowing is the subject of this brief haunting beautiful work a book that is so concentrated and compressed it almost has a scent","624":"this book was incredibly beautiful the author's unique style of just giving brief glimpses of these brothers' lives was strangely poetic every character in this book is so beautifully broken and their lives together were wildly entertaining i fell hard for this 128 page book","625":"interesting style of writing very quick read","626":"really powerful honest and beautiful writing at turns both violent and sweet angry and loving i only wish it were longer","627":"holy friggin cow this book was a quick read not because it's a fairly short novel but because it's very captivating from the moment i started it i couldn't put it down the only thing that was truly disappointing about this book was the abrupt yet powerful ending i however would definitely recommend this to a friend","628":"did not see that ending coming very well written but i found the subject to be extremely limiting based on all the blurbs one might think this is a coming of age story it isn't that's universal it isn't","629":"quick read loved the writing coming of age story of 3 brothers and their dysfunctional parents","630":"very well written more of a long short story the story of three mixed race brothers ends with a twist","631":"highly personal and fierce fictional account of three brothers growing up with a slightly lost white mother and a macho puerto rican father justin torres creates some powerful imagery as the boys range play fight and grow up trying to figure out their place in the world","632":"it's a triumph of a book a coming of age novel that lands an unforgettable punch towards the end recommended","633":"i got this at the library and read it in one evening it's only 128 pages short powerful the ending was a little strange but i liked the book overall it's by a local author too and was signed when i got it from the library cool on the cover it says it's a novel but it must be rooted in the author's life pretty heavily","634":"i chased them down into that love and challenged it you morons you sick fucks i bet you liked reading it i bet it excited you this book surprised me torres' writing slams you in the gut and makes your heart sink i was blown away by it i'm looking forward to re reading this in the future still letting it sink in","635":"i hated this book thought it was one of the worst books i have ever read the only good thing was that it was short 124 pages if it wasn't a book for my bookclub i would have quit reading it it is the story of 3 boys growing up in ny with a white mom and a puerto rican dad i guess it was a coming of age story but i just kept thinking of running with scissors which i also disliked each chapter was like it's own short story didn't really connect to the other chapters the story is told from the youngest brother's point of view think he is 7 thought the writing was poor and the story choppy","636":"fiery dark and haunting a book i need to read again to truly make sure i know what i think of it","637":"i read this in one sitting it is an amazingly well written book not for the faint hearted it is a disturbing tale of coming of age in a tortured household living under the abusive fist of their father it tells the story of three brothers who live for each other a truly heartwrenching story","638":" i get it i get why three people total have recommended this to me it is the shortest type of experience the most meaningful for its inherent scarcity the novella it can be read during one dull hour perhaps two this way the author is assured at least one true reading of his work which is powerful to say the least but isn't there very much like the wave of latin music in the late 90's a new wave of puerto rican authors given a voice junot won the pulitzer during the last decade there is definitely a niche in the industry for new voices which give to the masses the p r flavor most contemporary readers seem to crave therefore we have we the animals a novel which does not erase from the public mindset the image of the all macho ultra libidinous latin man just as all the irish novels about impovirished families contain one or multiple boozing dads when will we get the heartwrenching portrayal of a mexican american kid with professionals as parents and a liberal education we can even attach the coming out tableau another one of these and i may have to start reading straight romance at the end of it","639":"raw and poetic i loved it the last few chapters took a sharp turn and felt disconnected from the rest of the book but it was a deeply satisfying read nonetheless","640":"this book is not a novel as it is characterized it is a series of short stories it might be a memoir the writing is succinct and precise i like that writing style but it isn't an excuse to keep characters and themes undeveloped there is no plot it's almost an outline for the novel it might become the story of abuse is banal when told without depth the final fifteen pages took a sharp turn and could have been powerful had they been better developed","641":"at first i was worried that the book wouldn't have any dynamism or reflection but then it did u0026amp it sold me","642":"liked this a lot","643":"a fast past novel with profound short chapters that could be savored as separate stories this book is poetic honest and horrifying in a way that anyone with a crazy family understands","644":"first 2 3 is a good read the end is lost and out of place","645":"a feather weight boxer of a book compact quick and packed with muscle which is to say that this novella whacks you about the head that its punches catch you unawares that it sweats on the page that it will leave you dizzy and shaken and that you better put your mouth guard in","646":"one of the best books i've ever read i reviewed it here http www huffingtonpost com ru free and then i taught it this past semester","647":"a book i'm glad i read although didn't enjoy i think that was the point mirroring how the main character was feeling i was between 3 and 4 stars but the way the language shifts because of what the main character goes through pushed it to 4","648":"i hate to give less than three stars to anything but this book was just okay it is a short novel and can be read in one or two sittings i was on the fence with this book the vignettes were interesting enough albeit disjointed but i kept wondering where it was going what was the point shock value the real problem with this novel is the ending there was no hint of the depth of the internal struggles the main character was going through until the last fifteen pages or so i would like to have seen more character development for instance view spoiler in the last ten percent of the book we find that the narrator has matured and no longer relishes the activity he's been a part of throughout the novel he now despises his brothers is gay and he keeps a journal in which he's kept all of this internal conflict secret from his family and apparently from the reader as well hide spoiler we saw the brothers early lives in such detail that the smattering of clues dropped near the end and the hurried conclusion felt unbelievable sadly the ending left me with a negative impression overall","649":"not my thing","650":"powerful and poetic the ending really took me by surprise my only complaint is that the body of the work didn't seem to lead logically to the end which seemed somewhat abrupt overall beautiful and moving this book will be taught in high schools in the near future","651":"vignettes of an all too human childhood woven together by a magically dense and beautiful narration make this a very quick and moving read","652":"favorite book in a while","653":"the type of painful gorgeous gossamer real thing i wish to read i covet such crystal clarity of language","654":"quit 1 2 way through","655":" what a lovely little book the lyrical carefully chosen prose of this narrative is what struck me about this novella each chapter is beautifully written and written in a way that makes it seem each short chapter is a little poem justin torres has some great potential as a novelist his characters were real unabashed and lively and the stories he told were engaging and emotional i think when he really grasps how to go from each moment to the next from one chapter to the next he will be amazing and i can't wait to read what he'll come up with","656":"the shock of justin torres' poetic novella about three young boys growing up in an impoverished family isn't the beatings the abandonment or the drunkenness but the moments of tender love it's the unbreakable bond between brothers that shines through the day to day horror of belonging to two people who became parents at fourteen it's the surprising caress after the father's battering violence it's the magnificent flow of torres' language as he renders each painful scene in riveting detail finally it's the sensitivity of a young boy living in home that has done everything to deaden tender feelings this book is important as a testament of how love can endure in even the most impossible situations torres has captured the emotional heart of a wrung out family in this jewel of a novella","657":" another writer who has been spoiled probably forever by writing classes the book screamed workshopped so loud that i spent most of the reading experience being plagued by the vision of justin torres locked in a room with several other earnest driven young writers who are all spending way too much time worrying about their sentences there are 100 writers graduating every year from mfa programs who could have written this book out of the 10000 who graduate each year from writing programs there is just not enough payoff for me as a reader to spend time with a writer who sounds like one of the top 100 even if he's better than the other 9900","658":"if i had not been enticed by the good reviews given by some friends i'd probably not have picked this one up due to it's length and the storyline i'm glad i picked it up i didn't love it like some but i think the author did a wonderful job with so much in so little he definitely has a knack for writing and i enjoyed reading it interesting ending","659":"i liked it but found it hard to keep up because of the jumping around of the story perhaps that was the purpose to be choppy but i found that distracting","660":" i wanted to give this book five stars but i hated the end so much i just couldn't do it the prose is amazing and every page is filled with stunning word pictures that draws one in and makes one part of the story i loved these boys i felt for these boys i wanted more for these boys i didn't expect a happy ending that would have been lovely but dissonant but did feel that the end was a bit manufactured and possibly commercial i could easily have read another 200 pages if it meant the story had more time to develop all that said justin torres knows how to work words and i'd read him again","661":"the best thing is that it is short bleak and depressing not my kind of book at all","662":"heartbreaking but also intriguing and fun seeing childhood through the eyes of a family of boys i read this straight through on the first day on a trip out west this summer","663":"not too good wouldn't recommend","664":"the only reason i didn't give this book 5 stars is because it ended too soon the writing is amazing and i flew through this is two days which is really fast considering i have a teething eight month old it's the coming of age story of the youngest of three brothers though it's more a story about family and how we can be so much a part of something and yet so separate it's about how we express love to each other and how we interpret it's expressions from others and it's about how confusing it is to know what love is and how to deal with it the boys are biracial and there is some interesting discussion on how this affects their lives and their relationships with others outside of their family but also how it affects how they look at each of their parents and what they see in them versus each other i may have found this more interesting than most being a korean adoptee in an all white family but i do think it's worth noting i was also fascinated by the perspective being from someone who lead such a male dominated existence his brothers are so central in who he is and who he feels he can become both making him into someone and in some ways holding him in a mold he doesn't fit into and his father is this ultimate version of what he feels is masculinity in both good and bad ways each chapter is very short and you could read them separately up until the last few as little vignettes that start out beautiful when he's talking about childhood and grow darker and finally very dark as the boy's life progresses","665":" very impressed by justin torres in 125 pages he presents a complete subtle short brutal beautiful transformation from the family unit of childhood to the scarred and loved individual that emerges given that it's so brief i don't want to say too much the chapters are capable of literally shocking memories out of you each is a little visceral tale that wholly hones in on those feelings from youth a comfortable afternoon with mom familial respect both deserved and forced sibling protection etc ultimately hits hard losing something by being the uncommon element in your tribe diverging from the expected growing up","666":"this is sort of a grown up on the edge live life at the fringes amidst brutality house on mango street it has some of the most gorgeous writing i've read but it's painful and raw to read i would have given it 5 stars but the ending confused me a bit still i would call it incredible","667":" beautiful original language vivid depiction of angry lonely brothers who only have each other to lean on and fight with then for the narrator that ends too these are probably short stories or vignettes strung together which was okay with me i kept wanting to know more about this family it's called a novel but reads like a memoir my only disappointment is the very ending he seems to be setting himself up for a sequel which i would welcome but there isn't enough resolution to offer the satisfaction that a novel should","668":"we the animals is a coming of age story about 3 young brothers of mixed race parents growing up in a poor and abusive home in upstate new york it's one of those rare stories that was just so well written it is sure to stay with me for a long while unabridged on just 3 cds or under 150 pages in print this story packs a punch the story is narrated by the youngest brother just 7 whose name is never revealed a boy who seems to adore his older brothers just 9 and 10 when the story begins told over a period of 6 years the novel covers significant childhood experiences often jaw dropping that the brothers witnessed or experienced while living with their mixed race parents ma and paps parents who married and became parents when they were still in their teens paps is often unemployed and takes his anger out on his family ma works nights at a brewery is often depressed and distant the parents fight kiss and make up fight over and over again while the boys witness it all the house is often without food so the brothers scrounge for scraps and run around wild and unsupervised the title seems so appropriate we the animals is brief but intense and when our paps came home we got spankings our little round butt cheeks were tore up red raw leather whipped we knew there was something on the other side of pain on the other side of the sting prickly heat radiated upward from our thighs and backsides fire consumed our brains but we knew that there was something more someplace our paps was taking us with all this we knew because he was meticulous because he was precise because he took his time he was awakening us he was leading us somewhere beyond burning and ripping and you couldn't get there in a hurry it seems so inappropriate to say i enjoyed this book because it left me with a feeling of sadness it made me think of just how many children grow up with this level of dysfunction in their lives readers who gravitate toward coming of age stories especially ones about children growing up in an abusive and highly dysfunctional home should appreciate the writing talents of this new author the only reason that i gave this book a 4 5 5 instead of a 5 5 was because i was not thrilled with the ending","669":" this was sent to me by stanford university as part of their three books for the incoming class to read so i finished it but otherwise i would have put it down within the first 30 pages perhaps i shouldn't have expected to like it because i have never liked the kind of classic literature they feed you in high school and this book very much reminded me of that kind of melodramatic self important drivel additionally i tend to dislike fiction stories with child and domestic abuse in them because they always seem so contrived and forced to me and this story not only has that vibe specifically but similarly over telegraphed and heavy with symbolism themes in the race and sexuality fields i think perhaps if you liked brokeback mountain you'll like this but it's definitely not for me","670":"wow this may be my personal pick for best book of 2011 it is extremely short maybe 150 pages but the author packs so much into such a small space do yourself a favor and set aside an hour and a half for this one it basically tells a brief story of three brothers and their parents one of the main themes is how family can both heal and destroy us powerful wonderful stuff can't say enough read it","671":"a very quick read sections so short they might qualify as flash fiction the writing is very alive","672":"heart wrenching coming of age story with uniquely crafted point of view that evolves with the narrator fascinating style","673":"boyhood the rush and tumble of it the confusion and stillness of it unlike anything i've read in a long time favorite quotewe crouched in the dirt and smelled the air with the backs of our hands we rubbed life into the tips of our noses we sucked back snot after a while joel mumbled it's fucking cold because someone had to say the obvious so that the other two could ignore him and in this way we knew that no one wanted to go home","674":"no just no this patchy storyline did not work for me","675":"depressing and dark very well written but i'm glad it was a short read i don't think i could've handled much more","676":"some books can say a lot within a small framework this is one of those books it doesn't have what one normally considers to be a plot but it is the story of three brothers manny joel and the unnamed youngest born to a white mother and puerto rican father the mother was 14 when she had her first son the next two came when she was 15 and 17 ma and paps lived loved and argued passionately paps would disappear leaving ma to deal with the boys she would crumble he would return there would be fights sometimes physical the brothers also received physical punishments from paps for their real or perceived wrongdoings the book originally presents events in a we format then switches to being narrated by the youngest brother i was caught up in their lives without realizing it happened my one fault with the book if it can be called that occurs near the end when a huge chunk of time is jumped and the brothers are young adults i didn't see the situation snowballing that changed the tone of the book and the dynamic of the family i didn't understand what the last page intended to convey i enjoy books that make me think and that make me feel even if the feelings are unpleasant","677":"the writing was beautiful justin torres' ability to immerse us in the perspective of a child and to replicate the way in which small moments loom large in our childhood memories is remarkable however the violence was a bit overwhelming for me and i still am uneasy with the way that the violence surprisingly and rapidly manifests itself in the final pages","678":"pages 1 103 i really enjoyed seemed a little workshop to me but it was fresh and powerful and layered on something i recognize as truth even if i've never been in that world the last 20 pages are probably no less true well maybe a little less true but it's a completely different truth than what the rest of the book was setting up and the turn is so jarring and ended so abruptly i'm not sure astronauts punching through the atmosphere have to handle that many g's the ending just blew away all the good work that proceeded it so overall i'm left feeling a little jilted","679":"this was such a beautiful book and engulfs you in the simple enriching nostalgia of lost youth i could say more but there isn't anything that needs to be said it's short just read it","680":"a very fast read i liked the way the boys' voices mingled and mixed it was a bit heartbreaking at the end a novella that reads a bit like poetry","681":" this is one that may deserve more stars but it made me think instead of causing me to fall in love with it thinking is good but it's not always the birthplace of star ratings this story of a boy growing up with his two brothers in a working class family with his tumultuous parents is told in flashes and scenes you get the sense that the family is full of love but that the love itself is a dangerous thing tying them to each other bringing them together like elastic the last few pages are where it goes a little off the rails as the title comes into focus and the narrator's life changes dramatically it doesn't seem hopeful only craven it'll be interesting to discuss at the book club","682":"we the animals begins we wanted more and more the three brothers took from their parents and each other until the end hits the reader with a knock out punch i loved this book as i re read the last chapter again through tears eyes","683":"not for the faint of heart teenage parents raise three boys none escape the damage","684":"this author definitely has talent and i would probably read more of his work the book has a dark tone to it that grows even more so by the end of the book it is told in a short series of incidents one of those books that you might read again and come out with an entirely different impression than you had after your first reading 125 pages long can be read in an hour but it will stay with you for a while","685":" all i can say is whoa that was a book packed full of emotion family dynamics brotherhood acceptance loss betrayal everything an amazing novel has packed into 125 pages this little book is the story of three brothers who have a less than ideal childhood but it is told in such a minimalist way that you loose yourself in the emotions and don't get caught up in any details everyone should read this book it will only take about 3 hours and you will be touched the author writes such beautiful prose and manages a full on story in so few pages","686":" a story of a young boy and his two older brothers who grow up with an inconsistent and selfish father and a depressed mother efficiently told with broad strokes but managing to create a complete portrait of a boy shaped by his neglectful and unhealthy upbringing the boys end up being a trio of holy terrors like animals acting on instinct rather than thought torres excels in giving the reader vignettes not of extreme situations but of the everyday injustices that form these boys allowing the reader to better understand their often monstrous but very believable actions and behaviors a read worth returning to brief but packs a wallop great for a book discussion","687":"hmmm short interesting well written about boys if moms to be read this they may decide to hand their boy children off to the wolves just kidding read the summaries to see if you want to put it on your list a well praised book just not my normal 'genre'","688":"i really enjoyed it dysfunctional family with an interesting ending short and entertaining one friend described it as being like a poem","689":"beautiful and soaring and violent and visceral like a punch to the chest i read it in 2 hours and it's going to stick with me for a while","690":"loved this book the author's style is sparse and crisp he captures the life of a boy living in turmoil sweet and tragic","691":"too disturbing for me","692":" animals strength lies in its language it rollicks it careens from one side of the page to the next you don't have time to breathe with all the conjunctions linking thoughts and actions and sentiments and worries and doubts and love and bile and spit this book is hungry it wants to devour the reader and the frenetic pace of the language begs it to be devoured as well is it a novella with parts stitched together snippets of memories yield to scenes that are blurry along the edges or is it a novel the parts making a whole memories building on top of each other to tell the whole story who cares it's a perfect example of how the feral can be beautiful","693":"this has been a year of very emotionally hard books whew","694":"finally after a long drought a book i loved a short book with short chapters providing slice of life growing up episodes in a very effective visceral way the story is about 3 brothers growing up with a puerto rican father white mother but so much more","695":"unique and disturbing story of three brothers growing up in a dysfunctional family written in a prose poem style that seems to be a series of connected short stories","696":"beautiful book poetry loved it","697":"brilliant and devastating","698":"a dark and haunting coming of age story we the animals follows three brothers as they navigate their childhood and grow up in their dysfunctional family","699":"the premise was good but i didn't enjoy the short story format","700":"this book will divide people's opinions and i understand why the writing style the subject matter and the structure are all edgy the novella as a whole is one that i would simply describe as raw i read portions of this story in a literary journal and immediately wrote down torres' name and i'm glad i did this is one that i'll come back to read again and again","701":"this book is so good i can't stand it i never want it to end my only criticism is that it isn't long enough","702":"short and affecting read it don't read the copious reviews or if you must read them after","703":"i need to add a brief caveat to my really liked it the end of this book is insane i'm assuming it's based on some autobiographical situation but i wish it had been left out that's all i'll say for now if you've read it i'd love to hear your opinion","704":"really love it my only wish is that it's been longer and filled out a bit as it is it is a short book but not one single sentence is wasted very consicely written but full of character and a wide array of human emotions in a way the reader is allowed to fill in the blanks which actually happened to me as i myself was reading it","705":"torres does exceptionally well in reminding us that we are merely just human just animals regardless of how we look at this world coming of age never seemed so intense drastic and violent until i completed this novel having a closer look into someone else's life helps to change around the idea that though we are beautiful and young there is that wild side that we can't help but indulge in from time to time after all we are just human","706":"this book felt like someone asked you to talk about your childhood and you ran through highlights and lowlights that made you smile and cry it was dark and beautiful","707":"it just wasn't my thing stories about sad lives with even sadder endings just don't do it for me not that i'm not a sympathetic person i just feel like in one way or another we all have hard lives it's what you do with that life and what you make of yourself regardless of the cards you were dealt that counts i'm glad it was a short story so i didn't have to go through much more","708":"i was really torn on how to rate this book as a writer i know we have all written both crappy and brilliant pieces i appreciate the artistic fluidity the author was trying to acheive i also appreciate his attempt to reveal a bit of the ugly in family relationships especially if one member is different your family will not always embrace your flaws i hate hate hate hate the use of so many damned commas pun i didn't like that the story dwelled so much on the slow to build childhood and then sudden the rush to young adulthood i felt almost robbed of the transition as it wasn't exactly spelled out until the niagara chapter i gave a three for the artistic value but i couldn't give the last two because i finished disappointed","709":"this series of vignettes chronicling the life of three brothers from young boys to young men is brilliant the writing is amazing the stories are griping read this book","710":"dark and disturbing but with some absolutly beautifully written passages","711":"torres certainly knows how to convey emotion and he has a gift in his ability to create a scene with few words the story is told from a younger boy's perspective and the non linear structure works well","712":"short well written powerful but disturbing","713":"torres' writing is wonderful the story he told has such harsh moments but in between the harsh moments there are moments of great beauty the end was heartbreaking just heartbreaking","714":"almost a lyric poem vignettes from a violent bleak childhood progressing to the shock of an adolescence that cleaves the family apart wonderful sparking language and moving tale","715":"you rarely read a book like this first of all it is a lickety split slice of life second of all it not a slice of life anyone normally writes about it isn't pretty although it has moments of its own stark beauty most of all it is so real justin torres wrote this little literary gem called we the animals which stars three brothers who probably have more in common with my family than yours he gives us three brothers of mixed race with a puerto rican father and a white mother there is love and betrayal gentleness and brutality closeness and alienation there are three boys buffering each other from the world torturing each other playing and fantasizing and misbehaving together growing up almost wild in the end this impoverished family teetering on the brink of dissolution is unable to encompass the unique traits which are unveiled in one of the brothers as he grows up to embrace differences the family cannot accept i have never read a book that explored this particular reality in this particular way and with such a stunning sort of naturalistic poetry of course i have the activities of my own brothers to inform me but in other ways our life was nothing like the life mr torres describes in this excellent little book","716":" this is another spot where half a star would be a convenience i just did not become involved in this book i guess because it did not present characters with whom i easily identified there are some books that present familial relationships that are not easy but which ring true i think here mostly i suppose of the intensity of the husband wife relationship in paul auster's oracle night or the incredible tenderness of the brother sister relationship in tom piazza's city of refuge or the frank puzzlement of the mother son relationship of walker percy's the moviegoer perhaps even more impressive because it is not the main story line the narrator's sexual identity is sometimes crucial and sometimes irrelevant and we are never sure why the author seems to have written this book for himself not for his readers not that anyone asked by the way but i think that the two most impressive family relationship novels are surely cormac mccarthy's the road and richard ford's the lay of the land what fathers and sons","717":"just too weird for my tastes","718":" grade c l c ratio 80 20 this means i estimate the author devoted 80% of his effort to creating a literary work of art and 20% of his effort to creating a commercial bestseller thematic breakdown 40% dysfunctional family relationships30% reality of poverty20% coming of age10% brotherhood bondingi imagine there is an early draft of we the animals that is a little more captivating and a little more accessible than the final version of torres' debut novel my guess is that either the author or his editor spent a great deal of time whittling down the plot to make it seem as subtle and nuanced as possible what that leaves us with is a short book you can finish it in an hour comprised of loosely connected sketches detailing what feels like fictionalized memories from torres' own youth torres is purposefully unclear about the timeline of the scenes and doing so prevents the tepid climax from making any kind of honest impact the writing - specifically the use of a child's perspective - is powerful enough to convey the depressing atmosphere of the characters' household but after a while the lyrical nature of torres' language feels forced and unnecessary instead of poetic","719":"read in one sitting i think it's memoir but it doesn't adhere to the usual form it's about three boys growing up with a puerto rican dad and anglo mom in brooklyn they are tough and wild and close beautifully written","720":"powerful and poetic but the ending was too abrupt confusing and i was unprepared for it the three brothers are like this one wild organism a pack in a dysfunctional family with its fleeting moments of love and joy but the boys are suddenly teens and there's this big dramatic ending that wasn't set up well and so it was dissatisfying i wanted more its form reminds me of house on mango street","721":"fabulous debut novel a dark brutal dense short novel about childhood and abuse i will think about what i've read for a very long time","722":"well this was another quick read but i kinda wish it had been a bit longer i have read a lot of books lately that seem to hurry up quick finish this one was like that it had a lot of build up and then poof was done in 7 pages i enjoyed how vivid the story telling was and i will definitely be looking out for any other works by mr torres i will say that also esquire magazine is the reason i picked this book up so here is some feedback on getting your book recognized in that magazine shit sells books the book is a good one day read if you are into that kinda thing and i am happy i picked it up love ya goodreads followers justin","723":"this is more of a short story or novella than a novel only 128 pages that said torres is extremely talented and creates really compelling characters the plot is not especially interesting but the characters and dialog make this a worthwhile read","724":"justin torres you fucking amaze me raw and exquisite writing that paints a disturbing image of a family in poverty and innocence lost this is how writing is done would have liked it if it was longer and had more structure but this man does in 125 pages what some writers cannot do in 359 if you want a break from the same old boring shit i suggest you pick this one up","725":"justin torres has a bright future ahead of him i enjoyed the short stories to the fullest","726":" torres managed to pack a lot into a little book each titled section contains tiny jabs that poke the reader makes them feel uncomfortable but also unable to stop reading what seems odd is that once torres has trained the reader for those poignantly strong haphazard moments it drops off torres writes a narrator which is too honest but in the end at moment that the we want more need to see the ugliness and harshness he's had us grow accustomed to torres skims he even goes so far as to switch points of view in the last section because it is an autobiographical work this can be understood but after having so many strong rounds it seemed to hold punches at the end and falling short in comparison to the rest","727":"this small title stuck out to me at the library because of the title but the writing is savage dark and beautiful it's hard to forget once you've put it down","728":"readers seem to react strongly to this book with strong ratings and words at both ends of the spectrum i found it to be a fast read with a consistent descriptive guttural style up until the final chapter like other reviewers i felt the ending came a bit abruptly and was a bit of a non sequitur regardless the author pulled me in with the narrator's authentic voice and brutal wide eyed descriptions of growing up amidst chaos and dysfunction","729":"i don't understand why this book has been so highly praised it was a series of disjointed chapters about three mixed race boys the animals of the title just didn't float my boat","730":"beautiful poetic words he looks at his life in such a unique way giving childhood and imagination a different voice","731":"rambunctious noisy boisterous hungry or simply just being adolescent that makes you one of the animals be different you will be a cast away adrift alone left by your families no longer be part of the pack dark lyrical prose to fine storytelling we are all animals","732":"t enjoy the plot to cruel three puerto rican boys in a very dysfunctional family filled with abuse violence and sex fast read but didn't enjoy the plot to cruel","733":"i liked where this was going right up until the end then i didn't know where i was anymore huh","734":"i somehow felt cheated by this book it came across as autobiography hiding behind fiction i don't know anything about the author and if this is true but this book had no story was just a pastiche of events in a troubled life i felt like even though it was brilliantly written it had nothing to say the characters are not fleshed out and the ending seems bizarre and disconnected to the rest except for the fact that a similar situation happened to the author himself i was left wanting much more","735":"not what i was looking for ever","736":"love love love this book poetic and beautiful recommend it to anyone and everyone","737":"the writing is exquisite and evocative i would have enjoyed even more narrative and less disjointed chapters","738":"extraordinary book for its 128 pages engaging window into the hardscrabble yet often joyful world of three clise brothers growing up will not forget this book [?]","739":"i wanted to rate this book higher than i did short beautifully written passages and scenes about family abuse family love gay life racism didn't fit together into a novel suddenly a journal is found at the end of the book describing gay fantasies never even hinted at before author didn't seem to know where he was going disappointing","740":"coming of age story of three brothers","741":"great short read","742":"we the animals is not quite a novella but a collection of vignettes much like the house on mango street by sandra cisneros the language and rhythms are beautiful and the scenes are vivid there is a hole however and it would hold the how or the bridge of then to now in the story while i really enjoyed reading this book and look forward to more of torres's work i can't give this book the 5 stars that many of the individual sections deserve without overlooking that gap recommended reading for those who enjoy lyrical though still raw writing and vignettes of growing up","743":"i'm honestly not sure where to place this book but it was wonderful and it was sad","744":"this novella was very enjoyable torres does an excellent job depicting the lives of three young brothers from their point of view we see that they live in poverty and their parents aren't perfect but the focus is on their familial bonds the writing is charged pithy and emotional it's the kind of writing that punches you in the gut out of nowhere in other words it's a book about life","745":"this book isn't really for entertainment it makes you think about life especially hard parts of life and the ending is depressing","746":" this short novel made of short compact chapters reads like a poem in prose that burns our hearts and minds and yet is rooted in such a realistic context that it also has the impact of a vivid documentary at the core of the story the bonds of siblings the powerful ties of family the myths that mixes with reality in the world of childhood told in unexpected raw sensual brutal ways those themes have rarely been explored with such vividness and urgency without the usual sentimentality that often accompanies them but with a rising emotional power that rings very true torres' writing is superb - richly stylized and at the same time simple organic and profoundly human it's impossible not to be deeply touched by this novel torres is probably one of the most resonant new voices of american literature","747":"yeah i just didn't get this one for all the accolades bestowed upon this novella by other reviewers i was severely disappointed this book has been marketed as one possibly appealing to teen readers but i couldn't think of one student who'd like this","748":" it takes a lot to get me to actually write a review here i found this book delightful at the outset it's fun and led me to a good amount of nostalgia for my boyhood with three brothers i was on the verge of recommending it to mothers of boys or my own mother even then some of the other themes started to peek through and i decided to hold off the sense of unease and foreboding is immense and the climax of the final chapter had me reeling all told it's fantastically crafted not the delightfully nostalgic story i expected from the beginning but so much more and in such a great way","749":"not a book for me the writing was awful and the story was choppy and incoherent at times","750":"read this from start to finish in one sitting the writing is gorgeous will rip your heart out and give it a good squeeze the ending falters a bit for me but the voice and language are so strong throughout that it's still incredibly powerful","751":"interesting style of writing about his childhood fast read only 125 pages i thought it was kind of sad","752":"justin torres captures the magic insanity of boyhood in prose that rumbles like brothers brawling","753":"i got this as a gift for presenting recently really nicely done would not have picked it but glad i read it","754":" i really enjoyed this story the style was different and i appreciated that viewing the world through the eyes of a child and how things impact people differently was really interesting there were so many times that i laughed out loud while reading but it was often a laugh that left a bad taste in my mouth at first i really enjoyed this family and their colorful personalities and the odd things the boys did the ending was surprising and i m not sure how i feel about it yet i can see myself reading this one again after giving it some time to settle","755":"the story of 3 brothers raised by their parents a puerto rican man and white woman with minimal words it paints a vivid picture of the boys wild unrestrained childhood throwing things breaking things as well as laws spying on the parents told from the boys point of view a startling book short and hard to put down was disappointed in the ending though unexpected and sad","756":"angry and raw this book provided me a glimpse into lives i know nothing about","757":"this book was incredible it's just heartbreaking and disturbing and yet the prose is absolutely gorgeous really really great it's also short and so really easy to get through","758":"read like a poem which i like was suprised by the ending it was totally apropos of nothing yet also perfectly in place and recommend it if you have a minimalist perspective and an appreciation for lyricism it's like another bullshit night in suck city lite which is not bad","759":"it's a gripping tale that becomes more intense as you turn the page it's written well and it's a quick yet well develpoed memoir powerful story","760":"this book was like nothing else i've ever read i think the less you know about it the better it will be so i'm not going to say much except that it was funny sad honest dark frightening and utterly original","761":"beautiful writing realistic coming of age novel not clouded with kiddy goggles difficult emotional lovely","762":"sharp biting and humanely beautiful coming of age story","763":"i was not awed but i was intrigued not a quick read for me the brevity of text was lengthened by the weight of the scenes a good debut book for mr torres","764":"this is a work of art incredible","765":"justin torres is a friend of mine i had class with him in grad school he has been all over the place with this novel the new york times npr everywhere i am so happy for him b c it was a wonderful book especially if you are a writer it is a very beautiful written book poetic it tells the story of three brothers growing up and how they manage in tough times be warned that this is a different kind of novel in the sense that the time is played with loosely and the story is sort of loose if you can deal with that and you love language read the book the end is very interesting b c it takes a turn that changes the whole tone of the book i'm so happy for my friend justin another thing to note it is that the book is very short so if you're not sure it's for you you're not committing to a 400 page book but something much shorter","766":"i ran across his debut novel at the local indie bookstore i always check out their bookseller recommendations and this was one told in absolutely gorgeous prose overflowing with description this short novel packs a visceral punch it follows the formative years of three brothers navigating their riotous combined boyhood and survival of their parents' tumultuous relationship it explores how family and shared experiences shape us propel us forward and make us what we are beautiful gritty heart breaking highly recommended warnings on language sexual situations domestic violence triggers","767":"interesting perspective on a coming of age story it's short sweet airport read","768":"although some of the hard facets of we the animals are autobiographical justin torres creates the authentic voice of the young character the fictional character living the harrowing events of growing up in tough circumstances the prose is lyrical and propels the story forward with a lot of jittery energy all good but for the slightly rushed feeling of the sexual epiphany that concludes the story","769":"a coming of age story of three brothers living in a mixed race abusive household in brooklyn collective voice incredibly short sort of hated it there was too much in your face shock me with the language and the way the parents treated each other and the way the brothers treated other people and the ending i'm assuming its getting the buzz that it is because it's very autobiographical first novel","770":"this is the best prose i've read in years maybe decades i'm still reeling","771":"this was a bea editors buzz book this year and it shows great promise from a young author but it is too short u0026amp the end feels rushed the undeveloped teen years and sudden hospitalization are just thrown in this book should have been published a year from now u0026amp it should be 100 pages longer","772":"lovely and messy novel novella about three brothers lovely we flew trash bag kites for an hour or so until daylight fully buried itself into night and all the light sank back except for the stars and a toenail clipping of moon and the kites disappeared black on blackness wow messy read others' reviews","773":"this was a new kind of coming out story while this book was a little slow at first it really came to a nice finish for me i like what this author has done here i think that gay literature too often treats it's subjects like they existed in a vacuum before they realized they were gay this book shows us that the gay experience begins long before one realizes that he is gay torres shows how one day he was one of the three brothers and the next day he was so different that he was threatening","774":"whoa i am not sure how to rate this book the writing is sparse but exquisite and powerful i love the writing but i'm not sure about the storyline the storyline is not linear and so it is sometimes confusing it is about 3 boys who are half white and half puerto rican who are born of teenage parents and who are wild like animals the parents marriage is wild and out of control there is a abuse but there is also fun and lots of love and comraderie among the brothers it really is beautifully written","775":"i finished i read it again i read through tears maybe reading is the wrong word i was carried beaten shocked swept away by each and every word on the page not one word out of place each sentence a masterpiece and its entirety a word that hasn't been invented yet beautiful brutal these words take you where you don't want to but must go and in the end offer benediction absolution resignation very nearly perfectly","776":"liked the style but didn't really like the end","777":"a story of three brothers growing up like wild weeds written by a young writer just out of the starting gate nice and short","778":"not sure why this is even marketed as a novel since it is pretty clearly autobiographical or at least seems to be so reviewers appear to either really like it or dismiss it out of hand i fall in the former category appreciating the stark language and languid pave of these memories of a troubled childhood easily read in one sitting which probably helps the impact especially of the last three chapters","779":"unique voice the narrative offers a strong sense of vulnerability and at the same time ownership","780":"amazing so much said in such a compact book torres portrays all of the struggle hate love guilt betrayal in a family struggling with poverty and life's issues i wish this book was 1000 pages long instead of 128 it is powerful and moving","781":"i found the style suited me and what i was looking for descriptions were rich and creatively expressed story line was full of surprises simple straightforward very different and eminently readable i really enjoyed reading it straight through in two sittings","782":"passion goes both ways it can be joyous and it can be painful this book is about passion the story is about a family driven by passion whether it is the tragically violent and co dependent relationship of the parents or about three young boys who love each other and their parents almost unconditionally i loved justin torres' writing it was fast paced and thick with emotion my only issue with the story is that the ending doesn't really reveal itself earlier in the book it just hits you and leaves you and it leaves in a very cryptic manner it left me surprised because it seemed to contradict the tight bonds detailed in the first hundred pages with that said it's worth the read","783":"a gut punch series of stories about three boisterous brothers being raised by their white mother and puerto rican father who are both of a lower socioeconomic status and who have rocky marriage the two older brothers begin embracing the machismo of their father and the youngest brother comes to feel like an outsider not an emotionally light read the writing style reminds me a little of cristina henriquez's the book of unknown americans but this is different in style","784":"tender raw spare honest gifted writing he writes most of the book in first person plural which makes the ending when he finds his own identity and writes in the first person especially poignent","785":"we the animals is a story of three half breed white puerto rican brothers that grow up in a poor family in upstate new york it's the story of dealing with their mother and father through their tumultuous marriage and abusive household while showcasing the relationships both in good and bad lights and their growth out of childhood the chapters are each vignettes in their lives they can be choppy and disjointed but still give an overall feeling of the relationships and lives of the brothers it's interesting and sometimes beautiful but overall i wasn't sucked into or strongly affected by the stories i did feel like it ended rather suddenly it was ok not my usual kind of thing to me it has this feel of a book that someone wrote because his friends told him that his life story would make an awesome book so he followed through definitely an overall meh","786":"for the first half hour after finishing this book i tried hard to retain my composure i shed tears over this book it is wonderful and it has set the bar very high for what i plan to read for the rest of the year the words of justin torres have the power to uplift and the power to wrench your heart into agony i highly recommend this book this short and sharp tour de force this piece of a beautiful soul","787":"loved this book in fact i am going to name it my fav book of 2011 i didn't want it to end but i couldn't put it down i love books that are amazing like this one","788":"felt cut short at the end but otherwise excellent torres' prose is spectacular and engages despite there not being much of a plot line","789":"i very much enjoyed the almost choral effect at the beginning of the book and how it wrapped me in the world of these three wild brothers but then the book switched unexpectedly to the story of just the narrator and his story of self extraction from the family was much less interesting","790":"mixed race kids boys growing up together wild in brooklyn","791":"wish i could give it a 3 5 beautiful vivid writing life but i am still processing the disjointed ending that both works and doesn't work for me","792":"beautiful writing and very gripping and engaging but then the ending seemed really rushed are you with me on this","793":"wow this was unexpectedly fantastic loved it","794":"interesting book structurally in very few pages torres manages to create some really vivid evocative scenes scenes that i think will stick with me for quite some time great writing","795":"an ethereal coming of age tale torres' poetic prose tells the story of 3 brothers living a hardscrabble life and the consequences when one brother follows a different path","796":"a very quick and easy read the author had a refreshing way of telling this story which i think is what i was most impressed about","797":"good character development if not a tidge vague the ending was abrupt but a good short read","798":" what a remarkable debut novel it's a slim 128 pages you could easily finish on a lazy sunday but those 128 pack a mighty punch ferocious and tender all at once i keep reading these words in reviews of this book over and over ferocious and tender but they're so true this is an odd way to recommend a book but if you connected with terence malick's 'the tree of life' specifically the scenes of childhood remembered between the young brothers i think you'll love this book i can't wait to read torres' next work","799":"unexpectedly good http bit ly 1ewue4w","800":"scenes of 3 boys growing up poor through the eyes of a child powerful and sad","801":"gosh i've had this novel on my to read list for months so glad i finally got around to it beautiful haunting near perfect novel about childhood","802":"very good but a bit disappointed by the end waiting the next novel","803":"five star writing but the book reads like a novel in stories or a collection of stories i was expecting a novel and this was a bit disjointed","804":"near feral in its intense bursts of family instability more http bentanzer blogspot com 2013 11","805":"i wanted to like this book after the first 30 pages i thought i really would but when i got to page 35 and there was still no kind of distinction between the brothers i began to lose hope the brothers stay a lump unit with no real distinction between them for at least the first half of the novel the only characters with any real substance were the parents also the ending just kind of came out of nowhere there was no real showing that the character was getting any older and then suddenly he was no longer 7 there was very little character progression up to that point and then suddenly everything is suddenly completely different all that being said though the writing was at least pretty and some of the earlier vignettes were very poignant","806":"easy read but the ending was forced didn't flow jumped too much in time","807":"i loved this book delicious the only complaint i would have is the ending seemed to jump forward and i sort of felt like there was a novel in the middle of that jump","808":" this was a bitter sweet family and coming of age tale more bitter than sweet unfortunately and some just downright heart breaking and i'm not really sure what to make of the ending i think i'll have to go through the last few chapters once more to really get behind the meaning of everything that suddenly happened with two rambunctious sons at home i could see how some of these family and brotherly dynamics developed very well written from the pov of the youngest brother the reader frankie j alvarez or something sounding like it of the audio edition i have was a great choice for the book he really captures the voices and even accents very well i will definitely pick up the next novel justin torres gets published","809":"it certainly didn't live up to the hype i thought the writing was poor and disjointed he had a story to tell just told it poorly to call it a novel is a stretch too","810":"it was a fast read but i simply did not enjoy it","811":"perfection","812":" i've only just started this slim novel but wow i love the descriptions the author's mastery of the english language is a joy to read i really respect a writer who understands and respects the amount of story to be told and doesn't stretch it out watering it down over twice the pages it should be the first half is definitely the better of the two i don't have any issue with the directon the story went in or even how quickly the author jumped to adulthood but for me anyway the last chapters were not the same clean clear descriptions the writing got muddled a bit the first half or 2 3s i'd give four stars to but the later part of the book 3 stars","813":"vibrantly written vignettes into the lives of a family always on the edge the youngest of three brothers narrates the story of the boys attempts to find their way without guidance or much of anything children need in this family with more passion than common sense the parents uneducated immature and extremely young frequently desperate and confused really would rather run wild like their boys but do their best not nearly good enough for these heartbreaking children this very short book grabbed me immediately and i couldn't put it down emotionally intense and very true","814":"i like the writing style of justin torres as he narrates using we you get a group mentality and the togetherness of the brothers it really opened up by eyes to the ending and the isolation of the younger brother this is further illustrated by our limited knowledge of the younger brothers' name great story not one of my favorite but still something to be explored","815":" heard justin torres read the first chapter of this novella in an interview yesterday morning and was so captivated i got the book and read it twice that same day it doesn't have the force of a novel but the stories string together well growing up with two sisters i definitely responded to the insider outsider status of the protagonist even if you didn't settle your differences or claim your relational territory by throwing garage tools anyone in that familial triad will feel the powerful emotional truth of these glass shard sharp stories","816":" i think i missed the point of this story 3 brothers half white half puerto rican growing up in brooklyn living as 7 8 and 9 year old boys do as animals part of this is because their parents were 14 and 16 when they had their first child part of it is because children make toys out of dirt if that's all they have to play with and these children are creative and alive at least as children as they grown older only the youngest is interested in education only the youngest is gay only the last 20 minutes of the 3 hour book was truly lasting and probably because it was both most emotional and most confusing but i am missing what makes this book so lauded by the critics","817":" i remember the first fiction i'd ever read by david foster wallace his story of a young man confronting the high dive in \"forever overhead \" i loved that story even though--as i related to a friend at the time--it took me to the very last place i wanted to be in the mind of a pubescent boy i had similar feelings upon reading we the animals by justin torres moments that made me squirm--in a good way --with remembered feelings of childish uncertainty and adolescent angst read my full review here http hotmetalbridge org 2012 09 we on hot metal bridge","818":"liked it some of the scenes knocked my face off not a book i sank into--more like i read it in little gulps like poetry some of the scenes stayed with me some felt like a repeated idea it seems like half the people love the ending of this book and half hate it i loved the second to last scene with the father loved loved loved that part the last pages less so","819":" this book was lovely it had movement and violence and beauty and frustration all crammed into its pages to steal a quote from donna tartt beauty is rarely soft or consolatory quite the contrary genuine beauty is always quite alarming this book was alarming in a good way torres' use of language was jarring and impactful and lyrical his words his story felt like being slapped in the face in a good way torres also manages to do what few authors can which is successfully pull off a first person plural point of view without seeming gimmicky or in some way detracting from the story it reminded me a bit of and then we came to the end by joshua ferris if only for this my only issue with this book came down to pacing we the animals reads like a series of vignettes in the narrator's young life but at a certain point the book jumps forward in time and the transition is abrupt and leaves the reader wanting and while the beginning of the book deals with poverty and abuse it never seems entirely bleak because the animals are all struggling in it together by contrast the ending is dark and final and unsatisfactory what happens to these animals to the father animal and the mother animal to the brother animals what happens to their love and their hate where does it go i wish there were more of this book something in between something at the end after the end","820":"i loved the feelings and sensations torres' writing gave me i felt like i was one of the brothers beautiful read","821":"a brilliant beautifully written coming of age story with some powerful vignettes that capture the complexities of family really great read the ending felt a little out of place but the rest of the book shines so intensely that it doesn't matter","822":"i love this book because it restored the power of family for me in a very unique and natural way it is a good book to read with someone and discuss the complexities of pain and then to share the humble joyful moments i think it would make a beautiful motion picture especially if woody allen is the director","823":"reads line a non fiction novel reads like any untold story any boy with a less than desirable upbringing would write not hard to imagine or even identify with in some instances easy quick read","824":"not for me took it back to the library mostly undread not really sure why","825":" the pieces of this book don't add up into a story for example most of the novel is a series of vignettes of childhood life for three poor hispanic brothers the pacing is perhaps too slow or takes too long because we move somewhat abruptly from childhood events into their turbulent teens and finally are catapulted into the damaged psyche of the youngest though most literary and thus promising brother with each time jump the events become magnified more telescoped so that the final events must rely heavily on the grounding of what came before but that's the problem the ending did not flow from what came before or at least not convincingly so and the half page denoument was thoroughly unsatisfying that said i suspect torres will become a significant writer his talent is apparent and first novels are not generally the best","826":"a poignant portrait of an impoverished family in brooklyn as seen through the eyes of a very clearly drawn seven year old and then the last two chapters are completely out of left field","827":"as you can tell from reading just a few of its reviews this short disturbing novel won't be for everyone many reviewers believe the end is both unjustified and unprepared i disagree read it for yourself and decide","828":"i found this book powerful but the power wasn't used for anything a series of vignettes a time jump and another vignette this time with a whole new element of characterization and that's it if i'd read one of the vignettes alone as a short story i think i would have really really liked it if i'd read them as part of a more coherent larger work i think they would have been effective but as it was i felt like there was a really good build up to nothing disappointing","829":"a quick read with mostly first person plural narrative","830":"definitely more like 3 5 stars the story itself is really compelling and i liked how things clipped along at a fast pace you really get a sense of how fast the pack of brothers moved and how fast they had to grow up the reader never really gets to know the characters torres's clipped hurried writing keeps you well distanced from them all the short chapters offer tastes and vivid scenes of their lives but never a complete picture but considering this is an autobiography this style is probably the most truthful to the author's experience and memory so we get small rich tastes of cultural plurality the brothers have a white mother and puerto rican father poverty sexual identity and complicated truncated love overall i guess i felt that it was a teasing kind of novel because just when the brothers' bonds disintegrate and we wonder what will fill that void the novel ends there's no falling action after the climax which left me a bit puzzled but i liked the novel and i look forward to reading more from torres in the future","831":"tight short kinetic book about three young brothers growing up in working class nyc his new yorker short story 8 1 11 is one of my favorites","832":"really torn between 3 5 and 4 stars on this one very powerful writing but perhaps i was expecting something else","833":" idk idk there are sentences passages that i loved so much i want to rip them out and have them on my person always so five stars but overall the cohesiveness and sudden tonal shift and feeling like those wouldn't have been problems in a longer more fleshed out book three stars so compromise i will say this book sure isn't for those who like their narratives linear and their prose straightforward it's poetic vignettes some beautiful and spectacularly so some trying a little too hard to meet that standard reminds me a bit of mango street","834":" this is a family warts and all drama throughout focused on a challenged family growing up in a working class neighborhood i think torres is at his best when showing the challenges of the parents both were teenagers when the eldest son manny was born and they seem to wrestle with their responsibilities as parents and to each other over the course of the book there are three different separations yet there is also much love and passion too one of the most bittersweet scenes in the book occurs when the brothers meet a pregnant woman and ask her he the daddy trick you and you fourteen echoing complaints they had heard from their parents the sexuality of the narrator takes over the last three vignettes in the book but it doesn't overwhelm the narrative as a whole looking back the narrator also the youngest of the brothers is always treated special set apart drawn by his desperate father to sleep on the floor overnight at his security job or left in a wax museum for hours on a business trip he develops into a full realized young man i agree somewhat with the comparisons withthe house on mango street primarily because of the vignette style of the narration and the meaningful observations that can be found in each chapter but unlike thoms while the narrator is half puerto rican there is little evidence of latino culture provided and hardly any spanish","835":"a quick read short and bitterly sweet","836":" i enjoyed most of the book the language the feel of the book the characters i felt like this worked as a short novel up until the last couple chapters the pulling away and going in a different direction does not work in 125 pages for me i feel that in order for torres to be successful in ending this the way he wanted he would need quite a few more pages to make any type of natural transition i would have easily given this more stars but it's one of those books where the ending chapters feel unnatural and forced out to ruin the entire experience of the book what a shame i still enjoyed most of it though","837":"heartbreaking but the last couple of chapters don't mesh with the rest of the book","838":"raw edgy account of three brothers growing up in an abusive household i tend to like edgy books and movies but i found this book gratuitous the often hard to read details didn't seem to meaningfully contribute to the story other than to reiterate abuse repeatedly i found the ending both sad and incomplete","839":"i had to stick with this brief novel which reads exactly like a memoir after the second chapter which i almost violently disliked i was glad i kept going and found some reward toward the end i don't think it's a mature work but that's all too easy a charge to level at an author who was born in 1980 it will be interesting to see what torres can do with material that doesn't appear to be pulled directly from his own life","840":"a beautifully written book that had me in tears","841":"this book kept surprising me nicely poetic language and a really sad story","842":"read this it is so great","843":" i sat down and read this little number in one go which i think worked for this book until the ending the flow was effortless until the night i am made which may or may not have been intentional on torres' part i have no idea what to say about this book i can understand the hype i don't know if i agree with the hype but i understand it torres' writing is lyrical and quite lovely it did evoke emotions from me though mostly feelings of disgust distaste and distress that's a lot of dis words but that is how i felt i got zero sense of a novel from this book it felt more like a memoir than some actual memoirs that i have read and that kind of bothered me mostly because i felt torres and i don't know him nor am i trying to be a jerk was taking what i'm guessing was a less than ideal life and coloring it to be something worse as a way to exorcise the demons at least this reasoning was the way i dealt with trying to understand the motives of the characters in this book maybe that was my problem i didn't feel that i understood them and i didn't really get a sense of the narrator being different from his brothers until the very end the story of niagara was the first real hint that he was different to me and by different i mean the sudden sense of softness and gentleness in the narrator that came from that story otherwise i just saw them as a snarling group of boys that i would hate to encounter little jerks the chapter vignette essay short story the night i am made was so different from the rest of the book that i felt like torres had completely abandoned his characters and moved into a different version of them i understood why he needed that ending i guess he wanted to show the unraveling of the wolf pack and i understand that however the way it was written was so gritty and full of rage that at the point when the narrator is on his knees in the living room screaming at his family i found myself looking around the room saying how did i get here having read an interview with the author after finishing the book and knowing that he was indeed institutionalized by his family helped me understand the depth of rage behind the ending but it didn't save me from wondering if our narrator and his family had morphed more closely into torres' real family in that portion of the story","844":"exquisitely written and i think ferocious is a good word to describe this book","845":"1 5 starsglorified self conscious convoluted series of vignettes lacking focus or theme this is very much the tween i have an mfa style of writing which sinks in its own quicksand of trying too damn hard some of the writing was lovely but none of it added up to actual plot stream of consciousness is rarely done well faulkner did it in the benji section but torres is no faulkner the changing of gears at the end toward a focus on the narrator's sexuality came out of nowhere there was no lead up to the reveal and no reason for it to be there except it garnered torres more literary attention than this book warrants he started with one kind of coming of age story and moved to another in an endless loop of nonsensical pretty pose it's the equivalent of sculpting a penis out of shit and calling it art","846":"i read an excerpt from this book in a magazine and it was very powerful unfortunately it's the best 2 3 pages i read it on a kindle of the book","847":"3 5 starsit's a very short novel rather raw tale of three boys born to very young parents running their own world where they are kings it's a metaphor not a c s lewis thing","848":"really 4 5 stars excellent i read a lot of books and sometimes the details of the different stories get a little blurry over time i cannot imagine this ever happening with we the animals by justin torres this memorable book is beautifully crafted and the story is impossible to forget we the animals is a book worth reading both for the story it tells and for the different writing techniques employed a short autobiographical novel written in memoir style we the animals explores one family the bond of brotherhood and what happens when it all falls apart the author uses vivid imagery and detail to draw the reader into the narrator's place and time each chapter is almost a short story by itself but the characters are so compelling you want to keep turning the pages to see how it will all unfold moreover the book is not crafted along a traditional plotline nor with traditional techniques which makes for an interesting read from a writer's perspective","849":"strange book enamored by it and beautifully written but a little too pat yourself on the back y","850":" i found this short little book to be disturbing it reminded me of the glass castle by jeanette walls while many people raved about her book i was sickened by the terrible parenting and disastrous upbringing she had and i just couldn't enjoy the book i felt similarly about this book however i have just learned that it is fiction not a memoir which is what i thought it was the whole time i was reading it somehow this is changing how i view the book perhaps as fiction i can put more distance between myself and the story rather than be traumatized by the terrible child rearing i can focus the high quality of writing torres writes in the chaotic choppy fierce style that creates and adds color to the story the characters' lives are in fact chaotic choppy and fierce their truths are brutal it's a very short but powerful read which should spark discussion in a book group","851":"a quick afternoon read but somewhat disturbing the narrators give you a view of their chaotic childhood which leaves you a bit empty it reminds me of pigeon english but not as good a read the ending which is sprung on you in the last few pages just doesn't work the story simply stops and leaves you","852":"a very raw book with an unexpected ending","853":"i finsihed this book in two hours it's that good there was so much rawness in it and i found myself worrying about the boys and their outcomes let's just say the ending wasn't really what i expected i kind of expected the underdog kind of story but this is different better although u would not wish it on a real being","854":"we the animals is a short sad affair a series of stories chronological first began in the voice of we until the we snaps apart and the narrarator's brothers become they and the narrarator an i pleasantly surprised","855":"a look at a family how they wreck and save each other over and over again the bonds of love the abuses intense ending","856":"very mixed feelings about this book","857":"powerful every single sentence","858":" justin torres' debut is one of the most powerful coming of age coming out novels i have read technically he combines lyricism with extraordinary economy to powerful effect he uses this ability to give us a series of harrowing and occasionally joyful snapshots of the life of a boy growing up in upstate new york the child of a puerto rican father and white mother with two brothers in a sometimes violent and usually dysfunctional home this child is recognized by his family as different first because he is successful in school and is encouraged by both parents he also comes to realize he is gay these differences lead to an unexpected and very moving conclusion","859":"incantatory and episodic or vague and meandering sometimes one sometimes the other great voice though and real facility with language","860":"what a beautiful lyrical book so much in so little space justin torres tells a tale that is at turns heartbreaking and funny","861":"fell short of it's promise","862":"three bothers only have each other and their parents dysfunctional relationship to keep them sane they are rowdy rude and inconsiderate to their surroundings but their bond as brothers is not to be underestimated their mom has been their rock and strength she caters to them as little kids not wanting them to grow up so they can leave her alone with their drunken father abused and neglected by their own but still manage to remain strong through the thick and thin this is a very persuasive thought provoking book about an unbalanced family a book that reminded me of childhood bliss i will read more books about this author i love his distinct writing style","863":"a small heart breaking work of utter brilliance from the moment it starts you are praying life cannot be that hard on anyone and by the end you only can hope for brighter futures amazing and tragic all in the same time","864":"a wild chaotic childhood things got complicated and i wanted to hear about survival but got something more like reality","865":"still waiting for something to happen the author used so many shocking and ridiculously traumatic events in such a a short book the chapters are totally disjointed the ending is this really the end","866":"i thought this was unique and a good quick read","867":"barely over 100 pages this book packs a powerful punch beautifully written and really creates a feeling and atmosphere also i know it shouldn't matter but the typography used for the page numbers was really pretty and leant to the aesthetic of the book","868":"i feel numb after completing this book a dull heart wrenching nauseous kind of numb i sat up straight in my bed at 3am after turning the final page wide eyed and broken i went back and re read the final two chapters three more times before deciding if the ending was an utter disappointment or not i'm still undecided to me the ending did not feel like justin's own voice or maybe it felt more like justin's voice than ever it changed the entire way i looked at the book i really dislike it when you're so engrossed in an author's work only to reach a point where they change their style so dramatically that you cannot identify this new voice from their old i understand that a shift was needed that closure was needed but i didn't approve of the way in which it was done up until that point i had loved the writing and despised the subject matter up until that point i had a clear image in my mind of a broken and tortured family those final chapters threw me call me naive but i didn't understand what was happening what had happened or when it was happening i understand it now i understand now and i kind of wish i didn't if i could i'd go back and unread this book not because it wasn't good it was incredible well written beautifully poetic and jarred with real emotions that at times made me feel highly uncomfortable but it was just too painful it was far too reminiscent of my own childhood at times of the violence and the aggression the confusion and the abandonment i've closed this book left it on my bookshelf and mentally labelled it as never to be read again","869":"\"we wanted more \" from the first line of this slim volume i was captivated justin torres' prose is short crisp economical each carefully chosen word precise sharp as a surgeon's knife there is something universal about this story \"after dinner he led us all to the bathtub no bubbles just six inches of gray water and our bare butts and elbows and our three little dicks paps scrubbed us rough with a soapy washcloth he dug his fingernails into our scalp as he washed our hair and warned us that if shampoo got in our eyes it was our own fault for squirming...and we tried to be brave when he grabbed us we tried not to flinch \" this reminded me of my own growing up my parents too had three boys and they would bathe us together in water run too hot by our father and we'd squirm and fight to have our mother rather than our decidedly rougher father bathe us i was completely unsettled by the second to last chapter here there is an abrupt shift in pov in language i read this chapter and the last three times trying to make sense of them trying to understand what happened to that early promise that voice that had seduced me into love into fandom and then days later as i was mulling over this review i thought i understood this abrupt shift was probably deliberate early on everything was simple defined clear the road ahead as carefully laid out and familiar as the road behind but one night changed everything the night a night the protagonist describes in his own voice \"cold thick fingers wormed past my waistband i held still 'you want me to make you ' the driver said 'i'll make you i'll make you ' and i was made 'he made me ' i screamed 'i'm made '\" the night that resulted in this unmaking and now we like the protagonist himself are left confused hurting hurtling in a hand basket through an endless night dark and unfamiliar as it turns out to my relief mr torres hadn't t failed but had succeeded in plunging this reader into the chaos and doubt his protagonist was surely experiencing well done mr torres well done","870":"harrowing passionate mesmerizing loved this book","871":"wow it's been minutes since i finished we the animals and my heartbeat has not returned to normal yet this book in its raw animalistic energy and sheer lyricism had the same effect on me as david vann's legends of a suicide and from me that's a high compliment the book is a slim one - a novella really which spans less than a decade the first two thirds makes ample use of the \"we\" tense for example \"we wanted more we knocked the butt ends of our forks against the table tapped our spoons against our empty bowls we were hungry we wanted more volume more riots we turned the knob on the tv until our ears ached with the shouts of angry men \" the \"we\" are three brothers the unnamed narrator and his slightly older siblings manny and joel offspring of a very young white mother and an equally young puerto rican father who are barely getting by suddenly - in a very subtle way - the reader becomes aware that the \"we\" has been replaced by \"i\" and \"they \" \"see me there \" the author writes \"see me there with them in the snow - both inside and outside their understanding see how i made them uneasy...look at us our last night together when we were brothers still \"there are searing scenes that will remain imprinted forever in my mind for instance a father who is bathing his young boys and becomes distracted by his wife's entrance suddenly their parents begin making love as they huddle in confusion \"we hit and we kept on hitting we were allowed to be what we were frightened and vengeful - little animals clawing at what we needed \"scenes vibrate with potential violence and then dissolve into tender love others start with tender love and then burst into violence a turbulent yet in its own way caring marriage is darkly explored and its effects on the three brothers this magical work - of brothers smashing tomatoes and toothpaste on each other tiptoeing around while their mother works a graveyard shift in the brewery and watching each other's backs is incredibly rendered i only wish it had been longer","872":"i read this book in one day it was really well written sad in parts about a dysfunctional family and the violence and love that they are wrapped up in i was disappointed that it was so short but i'm not sure it would have lent itself to a longer read","873":"this short novel tells the story of three half white half puerto rican brothers through the eyes of the youngest i felt it started strong with humor and clarity but the ending was forced and not as carefully crafted","874":"was really liking this book but bummed that i figured out the ending liked the style of writing kept me interested was great at this length of a book not overly drawn out yet the characters were well developed","875":"wow this tiny little book rips your heart out and then stomps on it","876":"this is quite a world away from my usual selections but i found it mesmerizing as it applies to families i serve as casa the mixed ethnicity the love the lack of supervision and the hopelessness all offer insight for white bread me i'm curious now autobiographical","877":"a dark unsettling yet humane tale http en m wikipedia org wiki we_the","878":"short haunting great writing need more","879":" torres' short novel is a revelation the way the house on mango street was for me fifteen years ago while the stories are similar in their length structure and approach i don't want to make silly comparisons and end up selling both books short but both are extraordinary novels that derive power from their simplicity we the animals is a gritty intense novel but by no means harsh in fact torres' prose is some of the most beautiful i have read the novel reads like a memoir and turns out the book is semi autobiographical but the poetic narration elevates these fragmented sharp edged glimpses into this one family's struggles and moments of joy this novel is the perfect companion piece to terrence malik's recent tour de force film the tree of life both touch upon the complexities of family in a transcendent way that chills one to the bone simply perfect","880":"first u0026amp last thoughts this book was happy sad a fast concentrated read of related vignettes ending in a longer stranger vignette read in bed on a saturday morning recommended for i really don't know definitely not me","881":"incredible writing although i wish it was longer and didn't skip what seemed to be many years before the final section short and intentionally opaque but great","882":"similar to junot diaz's style and executed just as brilliant","883":"gorgeous little book the bittersweet story of a dysfunctional family based on the authors real life childhood fierce lovely sad angry beautiful desperate hungry lonely violent it's all here in just 125 pages","884":"this is a very unusual book told from the vantage point of the youngest of 3 brothers in a poor household with a dominican father and a white mother the language is sparse and powerful it brings us into a harsh but sometimes loving world full of chaos it is one of those books one could reread and enjoy it more each time","885":" i don't know i didn't love it maybe simply because i didn't identify with it and i wouldn't call the writing exquisite to me it was just a bunch of stories loosely tied together i'm not sure but i'm guessing it was at least semi autobiographical and if it was bravo for telling the story it just seemed to leap to the ending and what a strange ending it was it was a quick read which is one of the reasons my book club chose it maybe i've been reading trashy pulp fiction for too long and i just can't absorb real literature","886":" half white half puerto rican the young boys in torres' work live love and play in a poor neighborhood in new york state justin torres' slim debut novel captures so beautifully and elegantly the joy of growing up amongst brothers his description of his stern father and sensitive mother are immense you will be tearing up by the end of this book recommended for people who enjoy reading about the mixed race experience the joys and struggles of living in a family of boys a young writer limbering up for his task","887":"i heard great things about this book and then justin torres did a reading in my town which i really enjoyed hearing the stories in the author's voice is always a cool thing he is such a nice person too this was a great book to read interspersed throughout time since each chapter was a separate story and pretty unrelated to the others","888":"the book which seems perhaps autobiographical is about three brothers growing up with their puerto rican mother and white father in a chaotic abusive household it is a coming of age story of the youngest brother and told in a stream of consciouness lyrical narrative with each chapter its own vignette in the life of the boys' development the book is angry and uncomfortable and while i'm not usually a fan of this type of disjointed piecemeal storytelling i found this book quite powerful at times it seems the author is trying too hard to create a new style or to be a bit too literary in his presentation but ultimately this book worked for me because i like stories i did finish the book wanting to know more about each brother and wishing it had followed a more traditional narrative this is a book that stayed with me and is short enough that i could go back and find the parts i wanted to re read for clarity and emphasis seemed like a bit of an experiment of a novel to me and i look forward to reading more from this author","889":" three boys battle through a poor and violent childhood together with their own brand of love and loyalty we the animals is unique and realistic with a young narrator who is revealed as smart gay self destructive and crazy overall however the narrative style didn't really appeal to me it felt too withdrawn from the insanity of the story but perhaps that was the author's intent the narrator stayed on the edges looking in on his life in an effort to protect himself from his own childhood but in the end the effort became too much and he just snapped","890":"i debated between 3 and 4 stars mostly because i liked the book but felt let down a few times and felt that some chapters ended with more questions than answers it read more like a memoir and was such a sad story but was impressed with it being his first book after further review it makess sense that it felt more like a memoir it is apparently loosely based on his own life","891":"strange novella about three wild young brothers in a rural upstate ny town a little hard to read intense and tough family life and a strange narration overall i liked if and at a 126 pages it was a fast read","892":"only 125 pages this is an intense novella which reads like a series of short stories three brothers born to teen parents puerto rican dad white mom in brooklyn the dad disappears and is abusive the mother cannot figure out if is 8 00 am or pm she works nights in a brewery the brothers are close knit and full of piss and vinegar i would have enjoyed a longer tale since things switch gears late in the story","893":"quietly dark and unsettling throughout but i felt let down with the ending i didn't need to read about another gay character forced into life's dark periphery","894":"you know what while i was reading it i wasn't too impressed but then when i finished and started talking about the book i realized it was alright it's not a beginning middle end story it's a collection of stories when read together kind of give you a peak into this author's challenges and struggles during his childhood i just finished reading the glass castle so i feel like i'm on a path of bad parenting books i need to change course","895":"short and powerful but also sadly not anything that hasn't been said before somewhere else the last chapter vignette was powerful but also very obviously an attempt to bring it to a close and make it feel more like a novel than a series of scenes an images which i had liked about it until then it also came out and said everything that until then had been implied and to me it had worked better when things were just subtext","896":"not what i thought at all can't decide if i liked it or not","897":" i'm not going to say i disliked it but i wouldn't go crazy recommending it a coming of age story of three kids growing up in a dysfunctional family in brooklyn told through vignettes this novella includes some hot topics like poverty racism homosexuality domestic violence i a pretending to get away with it without any depth not even showing the relevant transition in the characters' personalities dropping bombs all of a sudden like it's no big deal besides the final chapter felt like the author was in a hurry to end it making a short story shorter","898":"strong condensed writing written in first person plural about three brothers torres does a great job of capturing the pain confusion and joy they face","899":"normally earnest fiction about the interpersonal dynamics of a particular family with no references to the sweep of history politics and culture bores me this book however redeemed itself with pleasingly lyrical language as well as some vivid characters and scenes","900":"wow could not put it down amazing first novel","901":"torres amazed me with this work his prose is fluid elegant and heartbreaking we the animals takes you into the heart of brotherhood and reminds you what it means to be human though some may struggle with the ending it too serves as a reminder that such ignorance and pain exists in this world","902":"a quick flash of a novel novella with writing that was tight and poetic the end seemed to fall apart though it became disjointed and just ended the beginning was so immersed in the relationship between the sons and their parents and the ending became solely about the narrator without much resolution it feels like the author just gave up and stopped writing or more like another short story was just inserted into the end it could have been fleshed out to a full length novel","903":"amazing picked it up to read the jacket and couldn't put it down even after i read it from cover to cover every word every sentence matters poetical lines extremely painful and empowering all at once","904":"this is a read in one sitting book about the youngest of three half puerto rican half white brothers surviving an unpredictable father and mentally unstable mother it's a sharply beautifully written novella that is intimate and frightening and judging from the acknowledgments true","905":"wow i discovered justin torres a few weeks ago while listening to npr in the car he talked about being a queer latino writer this is a slim gorgeous book you can read it in a day if you're motivated or a long plane ride beautiful beautiful writing what a talent can't wait for his next book","906":"loved it until about 3 4 through then it completely fell apart beautiful writing plot pacing needs work","907":" the realism of this family in all its bare bones brutality makes this novel great the raw animalistic nature of the three boys is horrible and fascinating at the same time more like a pack of wolves than siblings yet don't get me wrong this novel is not about violence and hatred it's about that sort of familial love that binds itself in even the most abject situations this is the beauty of the writing the lure of the characters in this mess of a family there is still such love a bit unforgiving in ways but present nonetheless wow","908":"beautifully written the short chapters are like prose poems and create a subtly quick pace there way a disconnect for me between the majority of the work and the last few chapters it felt much stronger as a story of brotherhood than of sexuality","909":"a boys growing up in a abusive house arresting language and harrowing situations to some small degree this was my childhood it hurt reading it i could identify with the perpetual anticipation of explosive verbal emotional and physical attacks these are people i know and lived with and coped with and loved and feared add that this is the story of a gay boy and it become all too real reading this was like watching boys don't cry too real don't want to go back don't want to spend any more time with these people or reliving bad memories this is very brutal very real and beautifully realized a great triumph mercifully short","910":"jesus so gorgeous and so delicate and so casually cruel that it makes me glad i'm not a writer i'd never be able to pick up a pen again after reading something so insurmountably achingly beautiful absolutely stunning","911":" on the plus side this book was short on the minus side this book was short i had a couple of free hours today and that's all it took for me to find out what a talent justin torres is but unfortunately the story ended all too soon and in my mind too abruptly there was no denouement just justin goes spoiler alert to the mental hospital the end now i realize that justin is a young guy and that his novel is more like memoir and young guys don't have a lot to write about but he is talented and as his life progresses i expect to see a lot more from him and longer too","912":" a childhood in a series of vignettes they are startlingly vivid visceral and well told there were one or two moments when the narration seemed in conflict with the narrator's age and level of understanding but the one moment where i was truly struck by this is almost forgivable because of the beauty of that description i wish there had been more of a cohesive narrative vignettes are better for a sense of things than an actual story but i still enjoyed this for what it was the ending brought in elements i didn't feel were properly foreshadowed or established earlier on but i didn't mind much if really good writing and interesting scenes are enough to distract you from the lack of a larger plot structure this is for you looking forward to reading more torres","913":"if you've got a couple of hours read this and judge it for yourself if you can't spare the time skip this one","914":"fantastic coming of age story a must read","915":"i believe this was a pulitzer nominee so i was expecting more it's well written but plot is nothing special","916":"this book reminds me of what's possible the kinds of stories that can be told and the ways they can be told","917":"this book blew my mind it is short so i read it quickly and it was intoxicating that's the word that comes to mind when i think of how i felt reading it","918":"the title is too \"heavy for the content slightly disappointed","919":"an absolutely amazing story of love when it doesn't always look like love and how no matter how much you wish to remain 'we' this fucked up world we live in makes sure that doesn't happen it's heart wrenching and heartwarming all at once and there's a true feel of maturation in you the reader once you've finished the book the account of growing up poor and smashed together by your myriad of unfortunate circumstances is beautiful but the tale of how through it all the family managed to string together through tears and blood and pain and laughter a we for the sake of the boys or for them all i think is the best part of the book you'll definitely end it with an indescribable hope that things work out for them","920":"really loved the majority if this book but sometimes felt like i just didn't get it amazing writing beautiful moments and moments that are so sad really shows the bond of family for better or worse","921":"a raw and lyrical portrayal of a family it's honest and sad and wild the ending was not what i wished it would be but overall the writing has its own flow and style fitting to its theme","922":"i take it that it shows life as it is and may even show how perversity in men's sexuality starts starts as such a small thing be on the look out but not an uplifting book","923":"breathtaking tragic yet you can't put it down","924":" we the animals is a unique beautiful and truly disturbing portrait of a troubled family i can't think of another novel that so convincingly depicts the desperation and insanity of abusive relationships the family unit functions as a single wild entity each family member unable to define himself outside of these relationships i was completely entranced by the undulating family dynamic all the shifts are subtle and masterful until the jarring ending the narrator isn't drawn strongly enough to stand on his own so suddenly although i suppose that's the point","925":"justin torres' writing reads like poetry really beautiful poetry his writing style is economic so the novel reads like a collection of jewels with little in the way of plot to string these gems together i understand what he's trying to do here with little in the way to link these vignettes to the real world the moments he describes almost float outside of space and time like something by the brothers grimm only modern a lot of what's different in this work is iowa workshop clever and i mean this in a good way the move from the we in the beginning to i in the later chapters a representation of the individuating we all do as we grow up is but one example i personally had a couple of issues that keep me from fawning over the work one is that the story felt less real as it matched up less with torres' own childhood without wanting to give the story away the scenes near the end in the hospital including the second bath from his father matches nothing in the real world how health care operates and how teenage sons interact with their fathers more important with all the whittling away of traditional elements of the novel there's a bizarre lack of emotion and motivation in the protagonist in real life from diapers to their teens even middle class waspy kids have moments of rage and passion directed at members of their family torres' main character has all the agency of a plastic bag in the wind","926":" a similar version of this review can be found here at into the hall of books http intothehallofbooks blogspot co it is so hard to find the words to say about a book like this at only 128 pages we the animal is actually a big big book i picked it up from the shelf of the library eagerly knowing only that it was another respected blogger's pick for best of 2011 that was enough for me so i brought it home my first reaction when i started reading within a few pages actually was that justin torres has a talent for writing his writing is so beautiful but we the animals is so much more than beautiful writing this is the coming of age story of three young brothers manny joel and the narrator who remains unnamed throughout the novella these boys love and protect each other after all they are brothers but they live in a home that is tumultuous at best there is violence and hunger and confusion and neglect there are things done in the home that the boys should not have to see but through it all they stick together because they are brothers the boys grow up and experience life the good and the bad and each boy eventually takes on his own personality and place within the family soon the narrator begins to drift away from the rest of the family and discover who he is separate from his brothers with his own identity the last part of the book focuses mostly on the development of this brother as an individual and reveals some truths and secrets about this family and how they come to deal or not deal with that the story was dark and sad and poignant but it was also funny and very true to life for me it was tough to read because it brought out some stuff from my past as the contemporary genre can often do this all was in the beginning of the book and once i was able to slowly work through it i felt a deep connection to the narrator and cared so much for him as a person i felt like this boy is a person that i could know in real life and that is what made the first part of this book so tragic and yet so exhilarating for me by the time the end of the book came and went and it comes and goes so quickly i felt so deeply for the narrator that i struggled with my feelings and my words and i won't lie i still do there are so many social issues tucked into this book it would be hard for someone not to be affected in some way if you read it with an open and nonjudgmental mind this story has things in it that are real life for a lot of people and for this reason this short little book can bring beauty pain and healing to so many also and equally importantly this book can cause raging and screaming feelings too i have them but i'm not yet able to swim through them and figure them out the story has elements too it is a short quick read it is not linear but rather a collection of short story bundles made nicely into a novella it it not action driven and it is not in my opinion heavily character driven instead there are just the collection of stories it is worth mentioning that most of them have a theme of some type of conflict although some of them are humorous most of all the writing is lyrical and beautiful i think what i'm trying to tell everyone is this i read this book and i loved it i am deeply affected by it and it is in all positive ways it was a job for me to get through but one that i don't take lightly and i am so grateful for that process i learned so much from the book and i'm still learning from it how is that even possible i'm not sure the book is so short and i read it several weeks ago it's just a beautifully written true to life story written by a talented writer i hope some of you will give it a chance and read it with an open mind i am still in awe of this story after finishing it so long ago it is such a gripping story about love so many different kinds of love and poverty and brotherhood and justice i love and am so grateful for the dialogue this has created internally and in my house about some of stuff in this book i sincerely hope some of you will read it and love it as much as i do this was a solid recommend from adam @roofbeamreader as one of his favorites of the year","927":"loved the book did not like the ending it just came out of left field","928":"this review has been hidden because it contains spoilers to view it click here five stars for the first half three for the second they didn't seem to meld together very well in my opinion brutally powerful beginning","929":" i had to read this book because two prudes at my san antonio texas usa book club called it filthy i found it funny for the most part despite the poverty crudeness and impulsiveness of the family a la the violent father --as when father has sex with mama in front of the three young sons in the bathroom what i didn't like was the prose yuk which seemed to call attention to itself rather than to the story but i see the author is a graduate of two \"elite\" writing schools so that explains it one thing i abhorred was the abrupt shift in tone and development toward the end i had to go back and make sure it existed the story could have ended this way i suppose but i didn't see much sense in it and from all the acknowledgements the author had a least forty people read the manuscript so you would have thought among forty \"experts \" they could have come up with a better ending","930":"edgy beautiful and dark a coming of age story unlike any other","931":"bold in your face story had to read between the lines many times wondering why this book was written it made me very sad especially knowing the lifestyle presented in the book is not as uncommon as we'd like to think","932":"three brothers - joel manny and the unnamed narrator the youngest of the three- are raised in upstate new york by their white mother and puerto rican father at the core of their familial relationship is their love for one another which in many instances rings deep and true but also the violence inflicted upon them by the father and the violence and life irreverently inflicts upon little boys growing up to become men in other words impending adolescence as well as poverty hunger and neglect even during a poetic retelling of the father's mambo kitchen dance the sweet familial scene is loaded with an undercurrent of violence \"in his fist was a glistening greasy metal spatula which he pumped in the air to the beat of the bongo drums\" 10 but also of a resigned acceptance for the type of man his father is the type of life they have to live because this family loves each other but they also hurt each other yet they would rather be together and hurting than apart from each other such is the complex nature of this family the mother weary fragile and sometimes inattentive and even immature \"this silly goose of a woman\" protects the boys as best as she can although in reality it could be said that the boys do a better job of protecting her the mother unsuccessfully tries to prevent her boys from growing up not just into men but into the same man as their own father through their journey the brothers at least have each other three animals musketeers cavemen a pack of wild wolves trolls - the boys band together in order to brave the mystery and confusion of their youth much of the narrative touches on displacement at first the boys are a collective a single entity only they understand each other their half breed ways which their parents cannot understand \"mutts \" the father said \"you ain't white and you ain't puerto rican\" 10 yet throughout the novel there are hints a foreshadowing to the point where the boys will morph from \"we\" to individuals the narrator being called a baby a pansy a faggot the scene where the boys imitate the parents and the youngest plays the mother his participation in the violence while being squeamish and questioning it \"i got myself a pretty one \" the young narrator separates himself from his brothers and the entire family he has a different sensibility \"white ways\" intelligence and potential he will not grow up to become his father","933":"heartbreaking wower very finely crafted","934":" there's something really neat about this tiny book it packs alot into its short space while i was reading this i said to my husband this book is amazing because it talks about a really difficult family situation using language that is beautiful i felt that the protagonist was beautifully in the weeds with his family describing the dynamics of violence and love and life in terms that were poetic and moving the language is at odds with the subject matter i think in a way that is powerful and interesting","935":"this debut novel is a collection of vignettes about three sons of a puerto rican father and a white mother in upstate new york heartbreaking hilarious and haunting in its portrayal of family class ethnicity and sexuality the book reads like a fusion of rick moodys classic short story boys and junot diazs autobiographical short story collection drown from the first paragraph the prose is hypnotic we wanted more we knocked the butt ends of our forks against the table tapped our spoons against our empty bowls we were hungry we wanted more volume more riots we turned up the knob on the tv until our ears ached with the shouts of angry men we wanted more music on the radio we wanted beats we wanted rock we wanted muscles on our skinny arms we had bird ones hollow and light and we wanted more density more weight we were six snatching hands six stomping feet we were brothers boys three little kings locked in a feud for more","936":"a beautifully written bleak look at the life of three undereducated boys growing up with an abusive father i read this without knowing who justin torres was or that it was loosely based on his own life nor did i go into it known the 'twist' at the end which is pretty guessable if you look at the genre tags on goodreads so don't but even without that knowledge it holds out as being a wonderful dark coming of age novella on its own","937":"at times quite smooth and flowing sad almost like listening in on someone's hither apt session based upon this reading i would pick up more of his stuff in the future","938":"i did really like this book i thought it was beautifully written and filled with emotion i have to say i didn't care much for the last chapter because it seemed to come out of nowhere but it didn't color the whole book for me then i came on here and read some of the other reviews and felt stupid what am i missing what don't i understand because i'm white should i be outraged at the stereotypes should that detract from the story and the heartbreaking beauty i found in it i don't know","939":"dark deep tale of human nature at its core and the underlying complexities of growing up brilliant debut cannot wait to read more from this author","940":"spectacular writing a story of brutality pain and piercing love an incredibly moving account of a family's struggle for survival and the love that binds and wounds","941":" upon reading the first few chapters of this book i knew i was reading something similar to jeannette walls' disturbing memoir the glass castle on speed but then it got worse so much worse a recommended read if you don't mind reading about volatile repercussions of child abuse i give three stars for magnificent writing talent for some that's reason enough to read my favorite moment this beautiful cover probably one of my most favorite of all books that symbolizes the best part in this heartbreaking story we were safe as seed wrapped up in the fist of god","942":" from all the books i've read in the past i learned to never judge them by their covers its what's inside the matters now after reading we the animals i learned to never judge a book by its size either it's only about 120 pages but within those pages is so much story it's told from the point of view of the youngest of three brothers and the hard life they lead with their mother and father it's not your normal continuance of a story instead with each passing chapter we get pieces of their life the good the bad and the ugly the mother works the graveyard shift and a lot of days she wakes up not knowing what day or hour it is the father can't keep a job he's loving to his family but also at times abusive and short tempered this book reads like an autobiography even though it isn't the story felt real as if i were getting a peek into their lives seeing all the good and bad that comes along with raising a family when you're young over worked and always feeling like you're never going to get ahead in life there were times that made me laugh and times when i was angry and upset over the way the father treated his wife and kids i cried at the sweet moments they all had together but there were times i cried over the heartbreak and what they had to endure i watched their story unfold piece by piece making me believe that there are families out in the world like this they love their family one minute and hate it the next their life sucks they do the best they can to get by with what the have it's life it's not everyone's life but i think it's more than we may realize torres writing it's stellar i found my self reread parts thinking to myself wow i don't know how to describe it poetic lyrical whatever the technical term is it's beautiful some lines fill you with goodness or inspiration while others cut you to the core and fill you with sadness with writing like this i predict torres has a long writing career ahead of him i don't think i would have picked this book up on my own it's not my normal kind of read but when i hear someone raving goodness over another book i become intrigued i like to have my views widened my eyes open to the world around me and we the animals did just that so i send a special thanks to adam over at roof beam readers for intriguing my curiosity with his raving review i encourage you to head on over to his blog and check it out because he's able to break down a book so much better than i can and he touches on so much more his reviews are always spot on go have a look let me wrap up by saying i highly recommend this book does it have a warm and fuzzy happy ending no does it make you step back and realize that this could very well be someone's family someones life yes i'm thankful to have read it it's honest it's heartbreaking it is fantastic","943":"i enjoyed this book part of that was because the chapters were short and the book overall wasn't long something about that was endearing to me however in all the descriptions i read it seemed as though the main character was going to have a positive outcome at the end of the book but the ending left me sad i felt bad for him and don't understand how the reviews all stated he came of age or broke free i was left feeling wistful and wishing more for him not to mention i was a tad bit unsure as to what happened to him but i still enjoyed it i must say","944":"this was a good book quick and easy read the best thing about it is that you never knew what was going to happen it wasn't until the very end that i realized the story wasn't about the mother now i must read it again","945":"this was a beautiful autobiography styled novel with intense tenderness imagery restlessness pain and reality a lovey work of life and time a quick read brimming with integrity","946":"pretty amazing in an experimental sort of way","947":" the short of it torres manages to inject beauty into what would otherwise be a dark depressing little book about love and neglect and growing up male the rest of it three brothers tear their way through childhood-- smashing tomatoes all over each other building kites from trash hiding out when their parents do battle tiptoeing around the house as their mother sleeps off her graveyard shift paps and ma are from brooklyn--he's puerto rican she's white--and their love is a serious dangerous thing that makes and unmakes a family many times i had mixed feelings with this one i was impressed by its fierceness it's brutal and honest and the images that torres creates are unforgettable he definitely has a way with words and it's obvious to me that he poured a lot of himself into these boys when creating these characters but the format of the novel is not like traditional novels it's really a collection of vignettes and one of the things that i noticed right off is that as soon as i found myself fully absorbed torres moves on to the next scene which left me sitting there wanting more this is a debut novel for torres and it was beautifully written and parts of it literally made my heart ache but i feel as if he experimented a bit with what to include and what not to include and perhaps it was too lean at just 144 pages i think he had room to not only scratch the surface but really give us a feel for his narrator as the story is told from the youngest brother's point of view this is one of those instances where the writing won me over although the structure of it didn't work for me i was taken with the prose and i had no trouble appreciating the amount of work that went into constructing each and every sentence broken apart each sentence could stand on its own which made it almost like reading a poem if that makes any sense at all in the end i would absolutely read another novel by torres and i'm glad that i had a chance to experience his writing for more reviews visit my blog book chatter","948":"didn't care for it at all a real downer","949":"eloquent evocative even brutal at times the story of three puerto rican brothers and their mother and father in precarious living conditions in upstate new york the love in this family rings true especially in the opening sections and that's what i clung to in my reading overall a short work and i wanted more the ending was too abrupt i hope mr torres has many more books in him truly the author of lie www carolinebock com","950":"not my cup of tea","951":"beautiful writing incredible craft wish there were a longer story because i loved the writing and characters","952":"this book can be read in one sitting or during one good bath it's really sad and i think maybe it's almost a memoir either the author wrote from his own sad experience or he's just that good and it's his first book reminded me of john steinbeck's writing but with much darker content","953":"i don't understand all the hype interesting and complex themes are glazed over in passing and the quick paced poetic style makes it hard to like any of the characters some people i know who have read it love that it is all about being gay they think it's very clearly about being gay what it is always like for gay people growing up wrong i went to the same high school as torres and can say even it's not representative of much beyond a single experience","954":"a bit too graphic and brutal for me had me squirming with the uncomfortable situations the trio get into but 3 stars because thats what books are supposed to do just not my kind of squirming","955":"this is torres' first book and what a beautiful one i loved the language and the way he provokes emotions the theme is delicate and deftly treated a must read","956":"i loved the writing absolutely gorgeous the story is heartbreaking","957":"wow this book is like a stiff shot of whiskey or at least how i imagine it tastes anyway a concentrated dose of something strong it is beautifully written and devastating in its content i can see why people rave about this outstanding little book","958":"one of the best books i have read this year beautifully written and moving","959":"it was a good book however seems just the same of what we have already read of hard up bringings","960":"really liked this debut the end section didn't jive with the rest of the book for me not sure how they connected but each section was powerful on its own each chapter a taut tense short story great book","961":"the style of this book is unusual it is a moving and very believable story about a family of three boys raised in a bi racial family i loved the child view of life where the parents don't explain everything but the child is still aware and part of the decisions and actions being made in the family i felt the ending was too abrupt and kind of confusing worth reading","962":"i loved the way the story was told the brief chapters the poetic writing style and the author's ability to show a dysfunctional family as both abusive and loving","963":"beautiful writing","964":"this book is not something everyone will connect to however the craziness and the fervour of childhood is captured pretty well by justin torres read it on a relaxed summer day","965":"this grabbed my attention immediately and held it throughout the book which is only 125 pages long very lyrical writing style and really more of a series of stories than a typical novel","966":"this book was so beautifully written i heard torres speaking about it on a local radio show and from that moment i was desperate to read it funny thing is i decided that this should be the first book to read on my ipad which i think was a huge mistake as a first ebook experience torres text highlighted for me the limitation of this delivery mechanism and my experience with the book unfortunately suffered the medium may have messed with the message i'd like to re read this book eventually","967":"an incredible beautiful lyrical novel done in a minimalistic style which is just perfect each story could stand on it's own but works together as a novel as well not a book easily forgotten very tiny but each word is to be savoref","968":"it's really a novella and not a long one at that but i love the style and i would have given it 5 stars if i hadn't thought that the conclusion was just too sudden and the very end perhaps a bit obscure quite out of keeping with the rest of the book","969":" writers who attempt to tell a story from the point of view of a young child usually struggle with voice you either create a protagonist who sounds too old for his age or you dumb down the language so that it winds up feeling simply childish justin torres has come up with something unique a lyrical descriptive and sensory narration filled with wonder and mystery the reader fills in some of the gaps and is left questioning the meaning of other moments either one step ahead of the narrator or struggling alongside him for comprehension the unnamed narrator and his two slightly older brothers are the we of the title usually grouped together in the narrator's mind as an indistinguishable unit a trinity they observe the stormy relationship of their parents a swaggering father and a broken down mother they skip school and hide in the woods they create havoc and make discoveries often beyond their grasp late in the book the narrator who has begun to understand what makes him different from his brothers separates from them and ultimately is cast out by his family the final pages speed up and then away an abrupt ending to a gently paced tale and the very last page of the novel is too abstract to completely satisfy but a second reading of the book illuminates many subtle clues revealing where this story has been headed all along this short book is one i expect to remember for a long time","970":"we the animals is a fierce gut wrenching ride through growing up the three boys alternately cry battle and love their way through a childhood dominated by the loud abusive and yet close and loving relationship of their parents wildly exuberant the three boys fight their way into adulthood with many missteps and triumphs along the way in the end the narrator the youngest boy will have to step out of the shadow of his family and find his own path wow a gorgeous intense coming of age book that you won't be able to ignore not a comfortable read this is more of a train wreck you can't look away from so searingly honest and bare yet funny in parts and even heartwarming we the animals captures the experience of growing up and finding your way perfectly the audio version is narrated by frankie j alvarez he portrays the animal energy and brutality of the boys well you can hear in his voice the cockiness of youth in one minute and the utter lack of confidence in the next its a great match that makes the book even better","971":"i haven't been this gripped so early in a book since i read roth's goodbye columbus bravo touching as i couldn't help but view it as memoir maybe the first time i read a novel and wished it were adjusted to memoir and not vice versa meaning i think if it were memoir he would have done a bit more searching in himself for the end while the caparison is far off i couldn't help but think of the late great frank mccourt as flipped these e pages","972":"a beautifully written and poignant little book at the end torres left me wanting more","973":"i shifted between enjoying the relationship between these three brothers to anger over their young parents when they acted more like children than their own much like the title it was akin to reading about a pack of wild animals and their life in the wild except they were humans this short novel was quick and raw to read","974":" torres's novel offers a kinetic visceral multi sensory and ultimately memorable evocation of childhood as experienced by three mixed race brothers in upstate new york it proceeds via brief but intensely revealing vignettes always keeping the reader rapt and on edge as the family veers unpredictably between destructive emotional tempests and the renewals of love the snapshots of a boy's childhood experience in particular remind me of the similar wordsworthian glories offered in terence malick's film tree of life but one still finishes this book feeling a little unsatisfied perhaps because of its brevity and focusing mostly on the great promise of justin torres","975":"intense book family life seems tragic at the beginning but other sides come into view as the book progresses it's the kind of book that left me in a reverie for some time after i finished it","976":"it was interesting as a peek into another's very different family life kinda brutal at times but i did not bond with any of the characters never got invested in what happened to them it is a short read however","977":"raw power very short very intense ending was a little disconnected but thought provoking worth reading","978":"we wanted more we knocked the butt ends of our forks against the table tapped our spoons against our empty bowls we were hungry we wanted more volume more riots we turned up the knob on the tv until our ears ached with the shouts of angry men we wanted more music on the radio we wanted beats we wanted rock we wanted muscles on our skinny arms we had bird bones hollow and light and we wanted more density more weight we were six snatching hands six stomping feet we were brothers boys three little kings locked in a feud for more we wanted more with his short 128 page debut coming of age novel we the animals justin torres packs a powerful punch this is one of those little books that i had in my queue of electronics books to read last year and didn't get to until december once finished i was sorry i didn't get to it earlier where do i begin do i summarize the story first no i'll begin by giving you my impressions of the book itself there's such velocity and power in the narration that it's tough to put this short book down for even one minute the characters in this story are so rich and vibrant that they jump off the pages and the reader can't help but want to go on to know how the story ends torres' sparse writing style like negative space in a painting used to emphasize shade and color is highly effective as what it's not said is just as powerful as what is written the story is about three little boys three brothers who are basically raising themselves as their mother works the evening shift and sleeps during the day while their paps is in and out of their lives their father is puerto rican and their mother is white and the relationship between these parents is volatile unstable sometimes loving confusing and ultimately traumatizing their parents are originally from brooklyn but they live in upstate new york where families like theirs are not the norm this is your heritage he said as if from this dance we could know about his own childhood about the flavor and grit of tenement buildings in spanish harlem and project in red hook and dance halls and city parks and about his own paps how he beat him how he taught him to dance as if we could hear spanish in his movements as if puerto rico was a man in a bathrobe grabbing another beer from the fridge and raising it to drink his head back still dancing still stepping and snapping perfectly in time heritage the brothers grow up almost as a unit with wants and needs that they scrimp and scrape to find on their own there's a self absorbing love within the family unit that keeps them in a fierce sort of protective vacuum for years they grow up learning how to avoid their parents' battles their father's belt how to tiptoe while their mother sleeps during the day making up their own games and getting into mischief as a unit torres effectively conveys joy as well as the dysfunction in the boys' lives through their games whether they are flying trash kites smashing tomatoes or pretending to be the magic of god as the story quickly moves along and the brothers grow in the midst of a chaotic household physically and psychologically abused by self absorbed parents they begin to see beneath the surface of the fights and into the real dysfunction that permeates their family the brothers' relationship begins to splinter when we were brothers and although the two older brothers remain close our young narrator feels more and more like an outsider separate alienated as the story races to its climactic ending to uncover the reasons behind the boy's alienation the story gains speed and by its conclusion the reader is left breathless and more than a little heartbroken the story is sectioned off into vignettes or short stories narrated in the first point of view by the youngest brother the narration is powerful the sections are short and to the point with a sparse prose that makes we the animals a quick if powerful read is the book perfect of course not there is a section at the end of the book where the point of view shifts to the third person distancing the reader from the most poignant and heartbreaking moment in the story whether the author's purpose was to place that distance there or not the abrupt change in perspective broke the spell i was under and interrupted the immediacy and urgency of that first point of view perspective that is so effectively used up to that particular point we the animals by justin torres is a unique coming of age story that will leave you breathless with its content and speed this is a heartbreakingly memorable story and one i highly recommend","979":"very creative short book told in bursts from the perspective of 3 young brothers as a group or a pack through these glimpses you discover that the parents are very young themselves one is from puerto rico and struggling to make a life for their family such strong characters","980":"this is a sparsely written novel that was often brutally sad to read torres' writing was at least 4 stars but i just found this novel too disturbing to rate it higher than 3 stars","981":"4 5 stars really really awesome writing paints great pictures the ending took an odd shift but i understood why the author did it","982":"this one was a little thin the characters were engaging and i was left wanting more i wish it would've been a full novel rather than a novella","983":"i liked some of the writing which i thought was beautiful at times then again most of the book felt like the author tried to impress everyone with his cleverness see how original i am see how i leave out everything that might make a linear story and just give you flashes of the boys childhood so you can try and puzzle out what i meant ain't that clever and please what's going on here with the bus terminal and the few pages that follow and make up the ending that just came out of nowhere if you disregard the strange interlude with the white headbanger showing what might be child porn to the brothers in his basement yes i don't get that either that's another thing that's too clever for me there's also physical abuse which i'm not sure how to interpret because it's a constant theme yet doesn't seem to have much of an effect on the three brothers plus it feels like the story might be set in the seventies or eighties another clever thing don't tell us when the story takes place or how old everyone is where sometimes parents hit their kids when they were out of line without the state calling it child abuse or maybe the vandalism is supposed to be an expression of that abuse who knows the parents behave strangely who goes swimming with their kids at midnight lets them wreck the kitchen and takes part in it too you get a picture of a family that's out of control yet bound together by casual love or if not that then by blood characterization is thin you can describe the mother with a few adjectives overworked tired juvenile looney unpredictable the father violent unpredictable unfaithful likes to cook spicy food manny and joel basically the same character the most important trait is that they're older brothers and they like to fight and destroy stuff the narrator stays a complete mystery which doesn't help to make me care about him in fact i'm having difficulties caring for anyone in the family and wondering why i'm even reading this book this isn't what i'd call a good book it's just a confusing mess with some good writing shining through here and there but it wants to be way too clever and literary for its own good","984":"this collection of searing haunting essays of the author's childhood chronicles the childhood he shared with his two brothers some people survive and thrive despite his her childhood and justin torres is definitely one of those people difficult to read and even harder to imagine these creative imaginative and brutal essays stayed with me i woke up in the middle of the night thinking about them torres is extremely talented and i wish him much success as he has had more than his fair share of pain","985":" very disappointing this book did not work the writing was choppy disjointed and incoherent sometimes authors do this to seem unconventional and unique having some profound insight that makes them seem worthy of greatness in reality they are just bad writers the subject matter was ripe with stereotypes that were quite offensive a poor puerto rican family filled with abuse violence and sex parents having sex in front of their three young sons a mother beat up with two black eyes parents' behavior so erratic they seemed strung out on drugs or alcohol neglected boys ravaging someone's garden for traces of food the parents and the children all vocally said how much they wanted to escape from their life strange things happening with child pornography and parents molesting their children one of the sons turns out to be gay how much drama and insanity can one fit into a 100 page novella so much so that we are so confused as to the point of it that we regret having wasted our time reading this there are much better written novels about poverty that actually treat the subject matter seriously and with respect this is not one of them","986":"meticulous frenzied haunting voice delivers a gutpunch narrative","987":"a story of a family three brothers and parents which involves scenes of domestic violence and heart breaking relationships between each member of the family told from the point of view of one of the brothers as a coming of age this visceral style of writing is a cathartic study of urban alienation","988":"what wta has going for it it's short i kind of cared about the characters what wta has going against it too too much with the atmospheric overwriting i'm reading siddartha mukherjee's book right now and it's interesting to see mukherjee do what torres was trying to do stylistically but better and about cancer research","989":" here's another one that i just picked up at the library i liked the idea of a book about three brothers and the chaos of their childhood but the orchestration of this novel was a bit tedious first the writing reminded me of mercer mayer now i love mercer mayer but mostly because he does a great job of mimicking the speech patterns of children that would have worked better for this book i think if the narrator had been a child but this narrator is one of the brothers grown up so it feels awkward and by the end repetitive second i really wanted something concrete to happen i wanted more than just a vague growing up plot these boys experience childhood their parents' fights abuse sibling rivalry poverty etc but in such a vague way that had i not read it pretty much straight from cover to cover i think i would have had a hard time remembering what had happened by the time i picked the book back up again so not a great read however then i read the author's bio and i got suckered in this book is written by this young guy who's also worked as a farmhand creative writing teacher and a bookseller all jobs that i've had so i kind of softened up i mean he's a graduate of the iowa writers' workshop so who am i to judge anyway i think i would have liked this book better as a poem","990":"what a painful book i can only assume it was written from a place of personal experience it was a look at a life of a fractured family and three boys that were raising themselves with parents that were trying to make life work i could feel the pain and the want for more but the book did leave me wanting for more more of an ending one that could help me to take a way the gift of the experience but overall a quick and powerful look at a different life","991":"there is something so poignant to me about a young narrator who is simple without being painfully so when this is done right i find this particular type of narration to be extremely powerful in we the animals it is definitely done right filled with simple sentences and spanning an unidentified time period this book is filled with poignant and poetic moments it isn't fast paced nor does it bumble along rather it strikes a steady pace and keeps it for the entire read i read this in less than 24 hours the credit for this is due to the narration and the story it's linear sort of you can't really tell when one moment ends and when another moment ends or how much time has lapsed in between at least not precisely this is interesting because it doesn't really bother me i don't need to know how old the narrator is at every step of the way i know enough manny and joel are the only characters in the novel who have names the narrator's name is never revealed i'm not sure if i entirely like this but it feels true and not contrived since we are hearing the story from his perspective and the other two main characters are only referred to as ma and paps though their other names are alluded to though not named other characters are referred to by identifiers such as 'old man ' or 'headbanger ' this is a powerful work a coming of age story centered around the youngest of three boys at war with who he is that i feel i can only describe as 'haunting ' i definitely recommend this novel it's a quick and easy read but it's also meaningful and powerful the best of both words","992":" in the first half of this novel i was an uninterested reader reading only to get through it so i could discuss it at book group but in the second half the charcters became more real especially the youngest son and i started to see where this story was going and i found myself feeling sorry for him angry for him and wondering what happened to him it is a book that makes me think of my students and the lives they see outside of the classroom and i wonder how many of them are living the same types of lives","993":"a short dark novel it is written in a way that makes you bring your own experiences to fill in his lack of description and narrative the characters are mainly nameless we know paps and mama and that two of the boys are close in age and the younger is four or fives years under them the older ones include the younger in their many adventures and show him much love and caring all the while teasing him mercilessly poverty is a constant in their loves as is the stormy relatioship of the parents things take a trafic turn in the end not sure i'm a fan of his short clipped style of writing but the story does give something to think about and ponder","994":"i liked it until the end i just didn't follow the transition i'll leave it at that to avoid spoilers writing is interesting plot doesn't do it for me at all","995":"i am not sure about this one my overwhelming feeling is there are some very interesting short pieces but it does not add up to a cohesive whole the shape of the writings together give the reader a sharp curve to follow and that does not make for an absorbing experience rather feels like a project in progress","996":"raw real succinct unexpected will have to think on this one a bit more","997":"a poetic snap shot style story line it is captivating from the first to the last sentence must read","998":"a very quick read entertaining and a bit disturbing","999":"i loved the beginning parts of this book the life of boys together the book took a dark and for me sudden turn that was ok but i wish there had been more leading to that point there were clues but it all happened so suddenly","1000":"absolutely gorgeous prose poetry","1001":"some of the best prose i've read","1002":"this book contained such beautiful prose there were so many paragraphs that i just wanted to read over and over again before the author's mastery of language is incredible the short but poignant chapters kept me pushing forward through the novel however throughout the book i kept wanting more content and more clarity i recognize that there's a beauty in the ambiguity but i wanted to find something to connect to as an lgbtq individual of color i would definitely re read this in hopes of catching more of the imagery that i perhaps missed upon my first read and am looking forward to reading more of justin torres's work","1003":"i should have read instead of listening to the audio","1004":"powerful story lyrically written","1005":"this short book only 125 pages is actually a series of vignettes in the rough life of three brothers it may have been short but it was not an easy book to read and i am still not sure i understand the end","1006":"this book kept me interested from beginning to end","1007":"this book started of pretty good mostly autobiographical and at times disturbing half way through the book it got a bit too slow for my taste and it's quite a short book the ending did have a bit of an effect","1008":"very short listened to it on cd so may have tuned out here and there i did not like it for 2 3 of the book i so disliked the abusive neglectful parents and they made me feel so angry i wished protective services would have been called on them this book is sad and harsh but i am sure there are too many families like this the wrap up kinda took me by surprise but as i said i may not have been 100% tuned in during the first 2 3 or so it did move me","1009":"incredible images loosely link this narrative about three brothers growing up with a patriarchal father and a mother who forgets to feed them the details are precise and the language spare the story is compelling and i read the book in one big gulp i'm not sure about the end though it's hard to imagine how else to end such an elliptical story but the major time shift felt abrupt","1010":"reminded me of running with scissors but not disgusting","1011":"i don't know where to put this book i'm not even sure if it's a good book club choice the language was beautiful the character's relationship was complex and at the same time simple the best way i can describe the writing is that it was based on emotion not story plot or character or setting interesting we the animals","1012":"wrenching achingly raw and so beautifully written i read it in an hour or so couldn't put it down i would read it again just for the language torres knows how to craft a powerful pretty painful sentence eta i couldn't sleep last night for thinking about this book it's unforgettable such a strange mix of emotions when reading it joy at the beauty of the language plus fear heartbreak anger disgust excitement for some of the content really one of the better memoirs i've read","1013":" this short novel made me feel a whole spectrum of emotions in only 125 pages torres' use of the first person plural narrator 'we' makes for one of the most refreshing novels i've read this year the use of the group narrative allows you to follow the journey of three brothers a group bildungsroman a group coming of age novel the brothers are the children of a mixed race family a white mother and a puetro rican father who grow up in upstate new york their journey is one of adventure excitement and hardship they are growing up in a struggling family their parents had them as teenagers and they struggle financially forcing the boys to sometimes go without food the struggles faced by this family are written beautifully by torres who writes the struggles through the naive perspective of children even though the novel is narrated by a 'we' narrator torres makes it clear that the audience should focus on the youngest brother the unnamed narrator we are aware from the first few chapters that he is different to his brothers that there is something different about him spoilers the novel's ending was what really made this novel for me what really broke my heart and made me connect with this book on new kinds of ways i'd never experienced i think this happened mainly because i was shocked by the ending a couple of my peers weren't shocked at all they had seen it coming but i didn't expect the unnamed character to come out as gay the story turns to a first person narrator as we learn more about the youngest brother we discover that he is gay when he takes part in sexual activities with a man he meets at the bus stop this and the subsequent events seemed a bit too rushed for my liking only because i wanted him to go into more detail about his sexuality his life and his journey after his parents discovered his sexuality all in all the ending of this book will break your heart the story follows the unnamed narrator's journey as his family discover his sexuality and as he gets institutionalised in an emotional manner the boys' father referred to as 'paps' has been a stern force in their lives before this moment but he softens after the narrator's breakdown and the raw tender moment where he bathes his son's feet is poignant and moving the novel's ending is annoyingly ambiguous the fact it left me with so many questions had me ranting because i cared about the characters i grew so attached to a protagonist who didn't even have a name i wanted to know what happened to the beautiful young queer character who i had begun to love my attachment to a character i have very little in common with to me signifies how brilliant this book is i wish i could've given it 5 stars but i wanted more i loved that it was a short read it was beautiful for so few pages but i really really wanted more","1014":"wow i haven't read this kind of book well ever the writing is superb raw you can smell each character end event described inspite of the final 20 pages which felt like out of context and just there to add some shock factor i absolutely loved reading it and it's a one i'm definitely gonna remember","1015":"i'm still working through my head how i feel about this book i found it in equal parts horrifying and heartbreaking justin torres says in an interview that this is a complete work of fiction and that he is protective of his family but at the same time the story seems to parallel his own life in almost every way i got the impression as i read it that writing it had been a cathartic experience for him","1016":"the ending of this one didn't really go where i expected after chapters that were a series of vignettes the last part of the book which actually seemed to have a semblance of plot was off putting everything seemed like a set up for the last story but i preferred the set up torres did an excellent job of describing the world around his characters showing the reader the vivid and feral lens through which they see the world","1017":"despite all the breathless critical praise this was only ok for me a little too self conscious and a much paler version of lots of similar books i've read most notably twelve tribes of hattie written by this author's iowa workshop friend i was never really hooked just felt like it had been done before and done better but i might not have been in the right mood","1018":"this book is raw and full of grit if you are a parent the story gets into your bones","1019":"a short visceral book that reads like prose poetry in its descriptions of one family's life raw and lovely","1020":"loved it it's like the male version of house mango street","1021":"torres' debut novella is an intense and authentic sounding bildungsroman and the main character the narrator has a bold eloquent painful and at times fragile voice that mutates from a unique combined identity to a singular state of self awareness for example as the story progresses the author deftly switches narrative points of view pov and this shift effectively shows the narrator's growth from early childhood to the climactic period of his late adolescence to achieve this torres at first presents the main character as a rambunctious pile of we that is torres designed a single character out of three young brothers and they are presented as a collective first person plural we as in we wanted more music on the radio we wanted beats we wanted rock this device establishes the fact that the brothers are an integral part of each other's daily existence and so instead of thinking of himself as a first person singular i the narrator thinks and acts in unison with his two older brothers as a we later torres changes the narrator's perspective to a first person singular and this strategy emphasizes how the main character has evolved away from a grouped consciousness and now has to walk his path alone the narrator's original joined at the hip progression into one of isolation is mirrored in the structure of the book because every chapter could almost act as a separate short story even though it is a cohesive narrative as an example the first chapter we wanted more has the quality of a lyrical poem because the imagery evocatively floods tumbles and cascades over the pages the narrator's voice is provocative sensational enticing and stirring and the motion of the words matches the three boys' movements and thoughts as they tear through the house the yard and their parent's hair and nerves however in subsequent chapters the main character's voice matures into a less impressionistic and impulsive sound and instead becomes querulous and confused much later as adolescence settles in his voice progresses through varying moods such as reflective anxious depressed frightened triumphant etc throughout the book torres artfully manipulates the architecture of different scenes to illustrate the narrator's emotional and intellectual dramatic arc as he processes the conflicting layers of strife and affection that the boy's parent's pile on them as a result torres dynamically absorbs the reader into an alternate reality to clarify even though torres' protagonist narrator is part of the unified we of his brothers the steady rhythm and repetition of the word we embraces the reader and through a vicarious process the reader melds with the books' collective consciousness and becomes a part of the we in the story it almost creates an interactive subconscious element of group participation where the lines of reality and fiction merge united we stand united we fall as well i almost cannot say more because some of torres' writing is so painfully exquisite that it leaves me breathless a beautiful example in the chapter seven occurs when the narrator looks out the window and thinks the light reflected back and forth from the white sky to the snow the light caught in the frost on the window outside it was too bright to focus on any one spot i opened my eyes as wide as i could and they burned with light and i thought about going blind about how everyone said if you looked right up into the sun full on and held your gaze you'd go blind--but when i tried i could not blind myself this entire scene is so painterly and emotional that it is almost abstract afterward a searingly poignant moment transpires when the narrator listens to his mother's entrities to remain a six year old and the narrator responds naturally and passionately with an impulsive response to give her a full lip kiss but because of her repressive religious upbringing she does not understand his action she cannot comprehend that his response is a normal oedipal innocent desire to merge with the mother the creator so she rejects him and thus jettisons him away to grow older and separate from her since he is no longer ma's baby boy the insight torres gives to all of his characters is sharp and incisive and he takes his narrator to a startling transition from his days as a precocious wee lad to an explosive epiphany as a restless young man despite the painful climax the experience of witnessing his transformative process leaves the reader in a state of liquid grace a purely transcendent moment of ephemeral tangible sensations that evokes a gentle empathetic resonance because of the authentic passion and defining voice of the story it is natural for one to extrapolate and assume it is at least semi autobiographical the links below provide more information on that this salon article explains torres' connection with this story http www salon com 2011 11 17 salon entertainment weekly's interview with torres http www ew com article 2011 08 31","1022":"omg it's scarey to think that there really are such dysfunctional kids but what is scarier yet is that the parents are even more dysfunctional this book was like watching a car crash in slow motion from beginning to end it was disgusting but i couldn't turn away unfortunately there are too many failies like this","1023":" by far the best book of 2011 not sure what to say about those reviewers who believe this book has no literary merit or that torres is a bad writer the book is brilliant yes it is short yes it is sparse no it is not a linear plot being episodic but it cuts deeply if you can set yourself aside for a moment and really sink into the story imagine what life was like for this family for this young boy so different from anyone else he knew it seems impossible not to 'get it ' unfortunately there are those out there who just don't get it and i think the negative reviews come from a certain lack of understanding or empathy period read the review at www roofbeamreader com","1024":"loved until the last 5 pages story didn't need the big reveal was more beautiful w o it and when it was just about the relationship among the young brothers","1025":" a few times i had to stop and remind myself i was not reading a joyce carol oates book torres writes in such a similar style as oates short stories that have a fast development of complex characters familiar beautiful settings and plots with ambiguous ends leaving me pondering far after i finished each story i couldn't help but be touched by these characters and fall in love with this book i picked this up at a local used book sale because i liked the cover i had no idea i was finding such a diamond in the rough i look forward to reading more by torres","1026":"beautiful poetic strange the love and tragedy within this family is strongly felt and eloquently expressed","1027":"i know there are people who love this book but i found it derivative and dull not my cuppa","1028":"fantastic writing about a frenetic sometimes funny mostly tragic childhood a very modern and hispanic holden caulfield that deserves a second read","1029":"haunting and lovely effortless writing that's compelling for its simplicity and honest emotion","1030":"i am not sure what i just read stylistically it was intriguing but it did not captivate me in the slightest in fact it left me confused and frustrated most of the time and the ending what don't bother","1031":"3 5 stars tough subject paired with an interesting writing style","1032":"a short sparse poetic novel narrated by the youngest of 3 brothers half white half puerto rican poor growing up in upstate new york they fight they get into trouble they sidestep their parents' tumultuous relationship as best they can the narrator discovers his own secret and i am still a bit confused by the last chapter it's a little too sparse","1033":"a very solid debut novel beautifully written there are people comparing it to house on mango street i guess because the author looks hispanic and has a latino sounding last name this book is vastly superior","1034":"i like this book but i feel fairly disturbed by it my fiance gave it to me as a gift i think for my 2011 birthday along with the night circus most of the book describes the main character's childhood but all too soon he is grown up and wants to leave and then ending is what i feel disturbed by but i hope this author publishes more books","1035":"the writing is exquisite but i hated the ending","1036":"amazing book until the final 3 paragraph chapter","1037":"so sad and so real stayed with you a long time after you finished reading it","1038":"part of me felt this book down to the core at times it was too unbearably similar to the animal inside me nawing wild angry but the ending brought me back complex indivuals yet still primitive kinda the distinct yet relatable voice torres brought was only overshadowed by the lacking end but maybe such a story needed such an ending and maybe im reviewing this book after staying up past 4 reading it","1039":"go to amazon and you'll see some great reviews and others not so good a slim novel is it really a novel it's stark but i just didn't understand why so many were moved by it","1040":"throughout the whole book the writing style kept me so intrigued but i absolutely did not see the ending coming i'm looking forward to discussing it in book club","1041":"a first novel of three brothers in a combative close knit family i was disapointed in the ending but i really liked the depiction of sibling love hate","1042":"as a reader that does not like everything spelled out i loved the way this book is written i think the disjointed style fit the story characters' perceptions narrator's perspective and the controlled chaos of the family i agree with other reviewers though that the ending was rushed violent and the least developed","1043":"very tragic and sad but beautifully written from a young boy's perspective","1044":" i thought this was an interesting read it wasn't really my kind of story but i do enjoy to spice up my reading list every now and then i agree with some reviewers in that the narrative of this book did feel workshopped telling a story through little vignettes is difficult to pull off without making the reader feel as though they are being manipulated to feel and experience something that just isn't there i think that torres doesn't quite pull off the magic that would make this book feel as profound as it seemed he wanted it to feel view spoiler also the ending completely doesn't mesh with the beginning there were little hints that suggested at what the younger boy would become but nothing substantial enough to warrant that big of a change and then they take him and have him committed the ending just seemed so strange and yet for me was the most interesting part of the book i wish that torres had focused on what the story had turned into instead of 90 pgs about the family and then the last 30 about this huge shift in the main character's life i would have been totally interesting in a mixed breed gay man coming to terms with his sexuality and how his family deals with it instead we get a glossed over version of what that might be like for him i'm a bit disappointed in that hide spoiler","1045":"a very unique book i ended it feeling somewhat haunted wanting to re read it it explored the bonds of siblings who grew up in an unsteady uncertain violent poverty stricken household and how the events of our childhood shape us into the people we become a story that will resonate with everyone at some point i hope to see more published works of justin torres in the near future","1046":"superbly written but deeply disturbing","1047":"this book was not at all what i expected but 24 hours later i'm still thinking about it i expect it to haunt me for some time to come","1048":"is this fiction or memoir the kernel of the story and descriptive elements were great but the book as a whole was disjointed i compared it mentally to machart's wake of forgiveness a much better story about the animal nature of boys and men still i look forward to reading another by this author","1049":"i only finished this because it was short but i have to say it this was one of the worst books i have ever read it's sad i wanted to enjoy it because i heard so many good things about it but i just couldn't there was no connection no loveable characters and it felt like a chore to read i think my major problem with it was the language it was frustrating and jarring at times which tore me away from the narrative","1050":"searing portrait of a troubled mixed race working class family centers on the youngest son as he struggles to find his identity amid affection and abuse for the complete list of 2012 notable books winners please visit rusa awards 2012","1051":"this is the kind of book that sticks with you it's short and chaotic and at times vague it didn't really come together for me until nearly the end which makes the story all the more gut wrenching the book escalates quickly and portrays an emotional trauma that lives up to its title","1052":"justin torres does not hold back in his debut novel these are the hard hitting and painfully honest stories of three brothers growing up in brooklyn and in poverty the mother works the late shift at a brewery the father works at making already difficult lives even more difficult the writing and the lives of these boys are often haunting and painful but nonetheless beautiful in their brutal and unique honesty and while the family is mostly male there is not the sexism and the machismo that exists in the works of so many other latino authors ahem junot diaz i loved these stories and i loved the youngest of the brothers who narrates them the most","1053":" this book has received many 4u0026amp 5 star reviews and i have no idea why this book is little more than a short story and not a very good one i didn't learn much about the characters and what i did learn i didn't like the truth is that i thought the book was just plain boring i may have been predisposed to dislike this book because of the plato quote at the beginning a boy is a wild beast their may be some truth in that but what about the girls i do not believe that this is a book worth talking about","1054":"i'm not sure what i think of this book i couldn't stop reading it and the characters were great but the ending didn't answer some of my lingering questions it's a messy real life isn't always pretty sort of story","1055":"beautiful writing","1056":"brief powerful heartbreaking and heartwarming amazing debut work by justin torres it would make an interesting choice for high school level english classes highly recommended","1057":"beautiful writing lyrical style sad and disturbing","1058":"the writing is lyrical and beautiful and the chearacters are engrossing but i felt like this was more of a collection of prose poems or sketches than a novel still enjoyed though","1059":" beautiful writing but rather dark i found parts of this book so painful i physically hurt while reading it i have returned to this review to increase my stars i am not able to get this book out if my mind from the beginning line of we want more i was transported into the life of these 3 brothers i felt like i could hear what they heard taste what they ate and smell the atmosphere around them i wanted to grab them up and fix them a hot meal and read them a story and feel their fierce love loved the chapter about turning seven it articulated my feelings of wanting my boys to stay little very well","1060":"it was an easy short read and some of the story line tugged at my heart but it tried to cram a lot in a short read not providing you with enough time to transition well as the main character grows older","1061":"spare and haunting like michael cunningham stated ferocious yet heartbreaking thank you justin","1062":"oh wow this was stunning such a little thing but when i finished reading i felt like i had been punched in the gut the sparseness of the novel was exquisite the message dark and powerful","1063":"beautifully written starts almost like a children's book but towards the end the direction of the story stops making sense would probably read again just to see if i missed something but a super quick read if you're looking for one","1064":"i have brothers and this book immediately transported me back into a time of games rough housing and pressing boundaries as if it were yesterday and even though my upbringing was quite different torres really captures the camaraderie of brothers trying to figure out the crazy world of grown ups and their places in it it's emotional without being sentimental the ending however seemed forced and too fast as if the author didn't want to deal with the disillusionment of brotherhood which must at some time come and just wanted to end it i give it five stars because its such a unique revelation of young brothers that i've not seen before his writing too has the simultaneous fast and sleepy pace that is boyhood i had to read it all the way through in one reading","1065":"more like we the animal crackers the gluten free cardboard bland bits this random collections of essays isn't exactly a book but whatever it is fairy tale fable it's definitely one of those texts you wade through turn to the end and find out the author attended a workshop not college though oh yeah he 'hit the jackpot ' the writing doesn't so much read as read worked over i'm not a fan of animal slaughter but someone needs to put this tired horse out of its misery","1066":"while i marvel at justin torres as an author i read for enjoyment and this was not my cup of tea","1067":"beautifully broken i absolutely adored the poetic language of this short novel and was touched by how powerful so many moments were both the dramatic and the subtle","1068":" i debated and debated with myself whether to give this 3 or 4 stars the prose is absolutely exquisite throughout every page felt like poetry and i was enchanted by how personal the story felt despite the fact that we actually get to know very little about any of the characters so i ultimately leaned toward the 4 star rating yet the single flaw with the novel was for me a doozy in the penultimate chapter which appears about 80% into the book and is the longest single chapter the whole book takes a screeching turn both the style and the tale itself suddenly change in essence the novel becomes two stories in one and neither is anywhere near complete i actually could have accepted the incompleteness of the first narrative line that fit with the rhythm but the last fifth of the book introduces a story that demands a true plot instead it just drops into a void i found this totally jarring and unsatisfying","1069":"this review has been hidden because it contains spoilers to view it click here this book painted vivid slightly disturbing pictures of childhood three rough and tumble brothers growing up in a dysfunctional household the characters were human the emotions were raw and the events that unfolded were startling the only reason i gave this quick read 4 stars instead of 5 is because i wasn't entirely sure what had happened by the end did the main character turn out to be gay hook up with a bus driver and then get put into a psychiatric facility by his family i think so this book painted vivid slightly disturbing pictures of childhood three rough and tumble brothers growing up in a dysfunctional household the characters were human the emotions were raw and the events that unfolded were startling the only reason i gave this quick read 4 stars instead of 5 is because i wasn't entirely sure what had happened by the end did the main character turn out to be gay hook up with a bus driver and then get put into a psychiatric facility by his family i think so but it all happened so quickly i was also a little unsure of what happened at various earlier times did the boys' parents have sex in front of them that time in the bathroom did the dad beat the mom or did she really just go to the dentist that time how big of a problem was the dad's alcoholism huh more","1070":"often beautiful and definitely readable but for some reason i couldn't fall for this book like everyone else did the last story chapter was powerful but others felt predictable to me for some reason maybe overly familiar but i think i am alone in this feeling","1071":"a tale of family dysfunction complicated love and equally complicated betrayal told in short story glimpses incredibly written prose just as much concerned with the feel and sound of the language as the story it tells which you don't see much these days loved it","1072":"i'm really glad i gave this a second chance at first i was turned off by the flowery magical language but i gave it time and it really worked for me it's strange primal poetic and i the end surprisingly tragic","1073":" although this is a slim volume it packs a punch while the narrator tells us the names of his brothers his own remains a mystery to the end and i almost had the feeling that despite its claim to being a novel this work is indeed autobiographical i have just googled justin torres and found out that it fact it is autobiographical this is a story of family love of disfunction and of growing up sometimes funny sometimes painful but always compelling if you read only one book this year then this is the one","1074":"three brothers and their childhood days","1075":"its a short read very strange and just sad","1076":"they smelled my difference my sharp sad pansy scent they believed i would know a world larger than their own they hated me for good grades for my white ways all at once they were disgusted and jealous and deeply protective and deeply proud really needed to a good book and this landed in my hands thank you justin torres","1077":"the book was good but the end was a total shock and definitely made me like it a lot more that i would have","1078":"mixed reactions about this book evocative and captured the looseness and interaction of boys close in age trying to battle against all odds felt there could have been more but torres said what needed to be said and did it quickly and neatly not my favorite but would like to see more from this writer in the future","1079":" i was drawn in by the rhythm and vitality of the prose and i enjoyed lingering in the moments that the family shared torres' use of the first person plural voice instantly connected me to the narrator and his brothers however the last twenty pages felt like an entirely different story without a smoother transition into the last few chapters it seemed like torres abused shock value and forced the plot to twist in a pre determined direction although the ending is adequate given the twist torres missed an opportunity for a stronger ending to this otherwise engaging story","1080":" even after having access to an incredible university library system getting a public library card in my new neighborhood felt empowering and browsing the plastic covered books no longer those academic hardcovers that green that red was a comforting thrill i sat down with _we the animals_ and read it in an hour and a half sitting the writing is fierce so refreshing and gosh the way torres captures familial moments his father dancing in the kitchen with the hips snapping drinking his beer his robe flying open and around him having the kids dance in imitation of people how he describes the sky as bleeding pink in a particular scene how i paused and read it again reveling in how perfect that image was for that moment i often got the sense that torres captured that quality about someone in his family with the precision that perhaps only fictionalizing it somewhat can achieve it was illuminating to read interviews with torres after i finished the book to see that he spends a lot of time revising choosing his words rewriting and the ending goodness what a punch","1081":"wow didn't see that coming powerful and unsettling despite it's length this is one that people either love or hate","1082":"very powerful story fantastic writing","1083":"powerful book i like how it was written in those chapters i wasn't expecting it to end the way that it did i finished reading it wishing there was some more","1084":"good story it's a short book so i read it in about a half a day good characters","1085":" this is a book that i probably liked more than 3 stars but it scares me to think i would this is a book about desperation savagery and pain there are scenes within that i didn't want to read about this is a story of a young boy and his two brothers growing up with an abusive father and a dysfunctional family although the story is told by the youngest it is never just his voice everything is experienced with his brothers everything starts with we we wanted more we got ready to pounce we were half as ugly there is no individual here there is only the pack until the point where the individual emerges and it is such a lonely heart breaking transition that neither option seems better off i can't recommend this book i think the content is simply too raw for most i loved the voice of the novel well actually a novella i found the pack mentality kept me off balance and slightly nervous i was never quite sure what would happen next which kept me morbidly entertained for most of it","1086":"someone said that this was a dark jewel of a book that is the best description i can think of for it very sad but also very beautifully written","1087":"it was good...very touching it is a montage of family events some familiar some exotic to me still it gives an universal appeal that's undeniably true to everybody's hearts i wanted it to be longer and more solid a real novel somehow it seems random and a bit sketch torres undoubtedly has amazing writing skill and he definitely knows how to play the readers emotional flow hope to see his novel soon","1088":"this book was so hyped by the media when it came out even bu0026amp n had it as one of their discover new authors and most of the time their choices are good but not this time a terrible book for young adults because this is not our average american family of today it's a good thing it was only 125 pages because otherwise i wouldn't have finished it sorry i did anyway","1089":" well written in a vernacular type of style i am surprised about some of the trashing of this book oddly enough most of this story felt a bit like my experiences growing up in rural upstate ny after leaving queens the poverty seems real and believe me upstate has some grinding poverty the three brothers portrayed remind me of my brothers living in a quasi fantasy world to cope with being so poor and dealing with some severe family issues my only problem with the book is the end i thought it moved too quickly to the narrator's sexuality it did not seem nearly developed as the early portions of the book all in all a good debut","1090":"this was five stars until the penultimate chapter that's all i'm going to say in order to render this spoiler free the opening chapter all two pages of it is kind of stunning a lot of it is most of it is until it's not short sweet and a quick read","1091":"not sure if this really a work of fiction really a memoir or one long stream of consciousness whatever i was underwhelmed there is some beautifully descriptive writing","1092":"not a wasted word this is coming of age with the pain of agee or richard wright american fiction has always relied on its outsiders like dinaw mengestu this is a voice we have not heard before","1093":"wild bewildering beautiful portrait of boyhood and family violence sexuality social position","1094":"this book didn't make me feel good i didn't learn anything from it but it is absolutely stunning the writing style has such rhythm u0026amp beat that it flows through you twisting your insides u0026amp knotting your stomach with the painful subject matter the dichotomy is astounding throughout this book absolute quality","1095":"pellucid prose and crisp imagery are the hallmarks of we the animals a sequence of vignettes formally reminiscent of cisneros' the house on mango street and paley's the disturbance of men anderson's winesburg ohio and hemingway's in our time","1096":"can't wait to read his next book omg i loved it","1097":" this is a brilliant little novel it's 125 pages of pure delight i literally sat upright and read the first page wide eyed in disbelief the novel is written in what can only be described as prose poem most of the sentences have a rhythm and cadence to it each word the novelist chose was completely unexpected and each sentence was like a feast i find myself re reading each sentence twice once for the story and once to admire the novel is written in the first person and although it is fiction one wonders if it's not a snapshot of the author's real childhood the novel can be described as a coming of age story it is the story of 3 brothers growing up in a tumultous home the love shared in the family takes on an unpredictable quality and swings from passion to hate from joy to violence unlocking an animal quality within each brother amazing book","1098":"kid's story grows up to become poetry sad poetry","1099":"i found this book to be really well written it was thoughtful and had potent moments that felt real the relationships were interesting but not quite credible i didn't see enough of the main character until he was suddenly being described by his brothers and then forcibly outed now the ending don't even get me started it was sudden and escalated far too suddenly it wasn't believable at all there was hardly any foreshadowing it was subtle on his sexuality which i liked but his shame on the subject was so intense i needed to see it a little more to believe the end as plausible","1100":"lyrically written pulling from snapshots of the narrator's life and perspective the reader is provided vivid details and insight","1101":"there wasn't anything i disliked about this","1102":"an odd book the beginning is about childhood and is not all that interesting the second part jumps ahead to late teen years and the third part is told in a 3rd person voice the rest is in 1st person why this mix of styles who knows does it work not often enough","1103":" i really like the title of this book as many probably know in spanish poor kids are often refered to animalitos both sympathetically and derogatively by translating these three words as a title the author conveys the narrator's family his mixed culture and his struggle with identity what's nice is torres never abandons his theme i wouldn't compare this book to cisneros while the prose is simple the substance differs cisneros work as i recall felt tremendously grounded though conflicted overall she embraces being mexican as evidenced by her effortless use of spanish words whose concepts are difficult to translate i find this both appropriate and admirable probably the reason she is a singular voice in female chicana writing torres's work is more ambivalent he uses spanish cautiously this also seems appropriate given that the narrator is bi racial bi cultural subjected to ongoing domestic violence and gay though the narrator is certainly loved his struggle is different even with his brothers he ultimately does not fit in those that indicated they were caught off guard by torres's revelation may not have read close enough he refers to himself as a pansy early on there were some descriptions that could've been stronger but they didn't really bother me i'm happy i read this it took a lot of courage and it's understated","1104":" i've read some of the less complimentary reviews and don't necessarily disagree with them on the other hand i'm a sucker for this type of story we the animals had the same sort of sentimental loveliness in spite of poverty and parental frailty as a tree grows in brooklyn and house on mango street where this falls short though is in its pacing the final heartbreaking series of vignettes felt only tangentially related to what had come before torres did lay the groundwork in later chapters but there was still too significant a gap between the narrator's boyhood and sexual awakening","1105":"his is the story of three brothers growing up poor in a family of mixed race they have a puerto rican father and a white mother it's very interesting because for the most part it's told in a plural first person narrative but torres pulls it off he tells the story in a collection of short stories with each chapter being a defining moment or part of the brothers' lives it's odd harsh and beautiful all at the same time it's a quick read and i recommend it","1106":"more like 3 5 i loved this book until the last few chapters","1107":"this is an excellent collection each word is critical in these short shorts and he captures the emotional truth of a situation so well","1108":"a novel memoir of 3 boys growing up in a poor dysfunctional family depressing but well written but not anything i would recommend","1109":"1 star purely for the writing the content was not what any christian would want to read this was a short novel and the first 75% was okay there was domestic violence u0026amp language and it reminded me of the glass castle 3 brothers growing up hard then it just suddenly nose dived into crazy town and ended so weird","1110":"it's a short short book but absolutely powerful and really the stellar part of this book is that it is almost entirely written in first person plural hence the title we the animals this is the kind of thing that either works exceptionally well or comes off pretentious pisses a lot of people off but i think torres employs this point of view masterfully also of interest is that it is a response to the typical narrative of the coming of age novel note torres doesn't believe that such a narrative exists particularly in light of the typical queer coming out trajectory in short it is fab","1111":"nice to see a family member acknowledged in a well wrought elliptical hypnagogic bildungsroman","1112":"4 6 pretty good to me felt like it took a dramatic turn in wasn't no one to stop this while this makes sense as a sort of end of eden moment it didn't feel entirely right for me definitely a strong debut novella at times magical","1113":"a crazy quick read so tender these three boys have lived a lifetime in their short years","1114":" short lyrical impressionistic story about three kids growing up in challenging economic social emotionally and physically abusive conditions narrated by the youngest the book is a good representation indictment of how damaging our modern it gets better culture can be for kids who are different which here means intelligent gay and not white while exploring a more universal desire for literal and symbolic escape there is a meta component at work here that allows you to feel some relief knowing that the author did apparently escape but the implications are heartbreaking for those who do not","1115":"spectacular brilliant writing the kind you want to go back and read whole sections again and again powerful characters in the mother and father my only real issue with the book is that the three boys are at the center of the stories and we never really get a feel for how they are each individuals instead they are a pack and rarely do we see how their personalities are different from one another but definitely a great read overall","1116":"this book showed promise if only torres had focused less on rhetorical devices and more on themes plot and fluid progression the book was disjointed not by the vignette format which i thought worked well for this type of novel but by the disorganized thematic choices the book to me is about three animalistic brothers who share a strong bond as children surviving their rough upbringing but separate as they grow older this is a much more interesting dynamic than what the majority of the book focuses on an abusive father and a capricious mother torres brings nothing new to his portrayal of the parents and he spends way more time on them than he does the brothers the parents take center stage for about 3 4ths of the novel and then suddenly torres switches back to his original focus on the brothers' relationship at the end while i understand the parents play a huge role in the lives of the brothers the heart of the novel the brothers gets less time than the been there done that dynamic of the parents torres's strength is language he can write truly beautiful moments however these get overshadowed by his compulsion to make each sentence very meaningful he obviously chose every word carefully so much so that he loses fluidity and poetry if every sentence is stylized then nothing stands out it seems as if he couldn't figure out which moments mattered most so he decided everything mattered equally not only did this affect his writing style but also his narration when those beautiful heartbreaking meaningful moments would come around he spent only a few sentences on it before he rushed to the next event he would move past the moment to his commentary on the event before the reader has had a chance to process what has happened and why it's important i wanted to like this book but instead i found myself disconnected from the novel unwillingly focusing more on the writing than the story","1117":"a searing touching sometimes violent yet surprisingly tender story of a young man growing up and coming to terms with who he is in a family that always seems on the verge of functioning as it struggles through many layers of dysfunction a short book that grabs you by the collar from page one and doesn't let you go achingly well written bravo mr torres","1118":"part poetry part memoir part novella part short story collection a very unique read it's a short book and a quick read but it sticks with you the writing is gritty without pushing too far and plops you right down into the action the ending although it doesn't really follow any particular story format was a little gut punch about family and the limits of love i'd recommend it to anyone who wants to get into poetry but isn't quite ready to take the plunge","1119":"a quick and disturbing read that reminds us just how fine the line is between civility and our animal instints","1120":"we the animals tells the story of three biracial brothers growing up in upstate new york raised by they puerto rican father and white mother through a series of around 20 short vignettes the youngest brother relates how they grow up amidst their parents' strained marriage physical abuse at the hands of their father and poverty this is a weird book for me the way torres writes really does kind of grab you by the heart and make you feel what these boys are experiencing and for the first 103 pages it was fantastic the ending really fell short for me though looking back on it i can see there was a bit of a build up or lead in to it but it just fell short for me i'll probably read parts of this over and over though because despite my reservations on the end it really is good","1121":"i loved this beautifully written emotionally charged want more","1122":"sensitive coming of age tale http luhathoughts blogspot com 2012","1123":"a portion of the three stars is for author potential something i very rarely consider when rating a book if torres turns out to be capable of writing an actual story rather than a collection of scenes that may or may not reveal a sad character arc he will prove to be a gifted writer right now he shows the ability to pull a reader into the heart of his characters but he doesn't seem to know what to do with them once they are there","1124":"side eye this book sucked major balls the end","1125":" i can't say i liked this book but it had a deep visceral effect on me the writing is spare and rhythmic almost like a prose poem describing events rather than emotions this is a family with no boundaries and the narrator the youngest child evokes this by using we through most of the book there is also neglect and violence in this family painful to read and made even more painful because of the matter of fact way it is described as it would be by a stoic child who accepts what comes his way i found it interesting that the shocking ending in which the narrator is set apart from the rest of the family begins to use i not we the ending is ambiguous but his separation from we the pain love of his family also seems to precipitate a breakdown i thought the ending was abrupt and as other reviewers have noted the sudden time shift in the last few vignettes was disconcerting it was a good choice for our book group as we had a lively discussion","1126":"beautifully written amazing novel","1127":"told from a young boys perspective plenty of you are there right now feeling told from a young boy's perspective plenty of you are there right now feeling more","1128":"so good so well done would have been four stars high for me i reserve fives if not for the ending no spoilers here it's just that the book flows along beautifully and then hits this jarring ending i saw where he was going but didn't at all like how he got there it is however absolutely worth reading","1129":"a very original formal plotting that can't be repeated without being a clear copy that's both the strength and limit of this book as someone who likes a complexity of form that has the potential to be handled and pushed further i sometimes found this story limited in a few instances even gimmicky that said the various small 'looks' that make up this book are steeped in a passion that is easy to lose yourself in","1130":"powerful snapshot of lives of three brothers growing up without sufficient parental involvement","1131":"we the animals is a luscious and shimmering little book about three brothers growing up in poverty and dysfunction it's called a novel though i would say it's more a book of short stories each story stands on its own and is not entirely dependent on the story before or after it however they all seem to enhance each other in a way that is very refreshing a wonderful read","1132":"this novella is the author's first full publication other than short stories published in magazines he's a graduate from the iowa writer's workshop which is always impressive the novella was brilliantly written and it got me all excited about the possibility of having a little boy justin torres captures 'little boyness' perfectly down to the skinny knees and knobby elbows and knees i would highly recommend reading this book it's incredibly moving and just very well written","1133":"hey so let's cram as many crazy ass dysfunctional family shit into the pages as we possibly can and then throw most of it away in the last five pages for an ending that makes absolutely no sense","1134":"this was a quick little read i pretty much enjoyed up until the end when it was like where did that come from","1135":"this was an amazing book and a quick read the story takes you down one path but ends in a spot not even on the map fascinating","1136":" this is a most bizarre story about a family with many unfortunate circumstances trying to make it together sometimes this book made me very uncomfortable with its topics and other times it was pleasant to read unfortunately this book reminds me too much of the families that i work with with their physical and emotional abuse foul language drinking and drugs being unable to hold a job etc so in that way it was an interesting insight into the lives of many of my students yet it was almost too much to know about as if i was spying on a family that i work with","1137":"there are some very powerful scenes here but i'm not satisfied with how they came together the last few chapters are rushed and not paced with the rest of the novel also not sure if it's a novel or strung together stories or torres' memoir thinly disguised not that that's such a problem i'm just not sure what to do with this angst he's burdened me with great potential for a great next novel if he still has enough passion left in him","1138":"there's nothing 'exquisite' or 'haunting' or 'blistering' about this writing this book is an excuse a poor one","1139":"two great short stories with a lot of beautiful boring noodling in between","1140":" honestly i bypassed this little book in the store a dozen times before i finally picked it up the cover image caught my eye every time i saw it but it was my friend adam roofbeamreader 's glowing review that made me decide it was worth picking up the book is a fast read and as the cover copy promises it is full of lyrical language that often feels just a step off from hard reality don't take that statement the wrong way the book is absolutely about the realities of life but torres' word choice and phrasing make some scenes feel a bit dream or memory like which is totally appropriate for the young narrator's voice even though the book is told entirely in vignettes that don't seem particularly well connected you can tell the narrator and the story are cannonballing towards something inevitable what seems just memory like throughout the book becomes nightmarish at the end my reason for four stars instead of five is simply that when the narrator's life unravels the tone becomes hopeless and helpless i was disturbed enough that i was glad the book was over if this is in fact based on justin torres' real life my heart goes out to him for the pain he endured and my hope is that his life has regained some of that fullness and happiness from when he was younger i'm just not sure i can reread the book anytime soon knowing where it goes in the end and how difficult i found those last 10 pages or so it is rare that a book so disturbs me in this way and i'm really not sure how to verbalize it that being said i'm pretty sure if torres writes another book i'll be buying it right away","1141":" this is a short but powerful novel told in brief chapters that are slices of memory from the narrator's childhood it's a coming of age novel unlike any other that i've read before the narrator and his brothers live with parents that are barely able to provide the bare necessities for their kids and much of their childhood experience is stripped down to the basics with little supervision or guidance the writing somehow manages to be both visceral and poetic there's no plot it's harsh and gritty and the style of storytielling is unusual those sound like they might be strikes in the negative column but i really liked this book as good as i think it is it's not a book that has a general type of appeal","1142":"so good powerful sometimes painful to read always shocking and lovely","1143":"a whole lot of book for about 125 pages very powerful novella of three boys growing up in a tough environment each chapter shows the family in a different snapshot of their life together mostly over a few years in the narrator's very early life and then a few chapters when he is a teenager each chapter reminded me of a picture but viewed as a whole the reader comes out with a really good sense of the whole fabric of their life this was an inaugural book group pick and it generated a lot of good discussion","1144":"great coming of age story written in beautiful prose the ending isn't as strong as the rest of the novel but it's a great read and is also short if you're not looking for a long fiction novel","1145":"well that lived up to the hype i'm sad i got it from the library cuz i kind of want it for my own","1146":"a novella with chapters that are sort of scenes in the life of this family i sometimes wasn't clear on what was going on or the timeframe i'm def used to a more straightforward book it wasn't horrible just not my usual","1147":"short and sad but awfully good beautiful and striking imagery worth reading","1148":"i first heard about justin torres and we the animals on kcrw bookworm and remember being struck by the vivid reading the author did of his own work it felt like it came from him having read this set of short poem like stories all about three brothers in a volatile family it feels even more that way like it was a conversation i wasn't meant to hear in a good way and a terrible way it doesn't feel like fiction at all","1149":"harsh raw powerful uplifting depressing disappointing brilliant this tale of three brothers and their parents is told in the form of 19 chapters or short stories and it will generate a response there are times when the writing seems forced clumsy or uninformed in one story the lake the boys' mother from brooklyn claims that no one swims in brooklyn may i direct your attention to the southern edge of the borough home to coney island brighton beach manhattan beach and with ready access to rockaway far rockaway and more should one care to venture eastward not to mention more than one or two public pools for those with an aversion to salt those massive moving clumps that blot the sand from view every summer are not walruses and there are some of us nyc natives who have ventured into one or more of the rivers that entwine the city although not all having dropped into the questionable waters after swinging out over them on a rope while it is theoretically possible for someone from brooklyn to claim that no one swims there one might be tempted to check that person's cranium for recent damage another tale has a father physically bathe a nearly grown son who has engaged in particularly troubling behavior while we may appreciate the significance of the character's need to cleanse his child of the stains on his soul and maybe even for that youth to be reborn in some way that this young man would sit still for such a thing is so inconceivable that spotlights glare onto the author's manipulation of his characters and loudspeakers practically bark \"stop that metaphor \" clearly this bit was workshopped to death or maybe not workshopepd enough don't get me wrong i am a huge fan of imagery literary reference and all the toys and trickery good writing can employ but don't force characters to behave in ways that are not credible to make a literary point peg square circle round these examples sit cheek by jewel with others that sparkle stories and ideas that struck me as clever insightful sometimes brilliant the boys in their playing act out imagined conversations between their parents clearly informed by what they had overheard in another the boys are bad little rabbits stealing from a local farmer's garden and being nabbed by the equivalent of mister mcgregor torres uses the boys play with kites to introduce their contemplation of fate and god that their attempts to rise above their dreary existence were constructed of trash adds to the poignance torres offers a harsh look at life at the economic and social periphery there is much breakage in this coming of age tale food belongings people their parents are often absent whether it is dad who takes off for extended periods or mom who vanishes down a well of depression the boys are nearly feral at times animals indeed there is violence and sex aplenty some of it tough to read more importantly there is a picture of what surviving looks like at the lower end and feeling a lot of feeling this is more than a demonstration of writing technique these stories are alive with emotion i was reminded at times of david vann in how harsh how bleak an image we are offered of this piece of our world and also of vann's brilliance in using a challenging environment and dark behavior to illustrate the human condition also stephen graham jones's look at life at the fringes mongrels torres is a gifted writer who needs to hone his creative edges somewhat maybe engage a more demanding editor or maybe listen to the one he has but the raw material is there much of his talent shows through in we the animals i expect that there is masterpiece work ahead for mister torres","1150":"great read loved the pace and the ending","1151":"this is a novella about the fierce love of one family in upstate new york although their is poverty beatings sadness i haven't read such beautiful descriptions of familial love in a long time there is nothing bitter in the author's tone reading about these three brothers grow up as i watch my own two sons tear around my house make me long for the sibling i never had","1152":"from page 98 to 128 in 10 mins","1153":"a small novel although at 125 pages i'd argue novella of a very intense look at the life of 3 boys and their parents in brooklyn told through the youngest boys eyes you get snapshots of what is sometimes abusive and heartbreaking and sometimes silly and wild i ingested it in one sitting and was only slightly taken back by the last 2 chapters or so when the book jumps ahead from ages 7 10 to mid or late adolescence at which something happens and it seems to not quite fit in but i enjoyed this book very much anyway","1154":" quick read with a lot to say love the first person perspective wherein the narrator is one segment of a three headed us i've never seen this done before and i thought it refreshingly different i also appreciated the snapshot quality of the chapters the short story fragments are chronological but it's unclear how much time goes by in between chapters the story has gaps and not all questions are answered but this just adds to the impression that these are fragmented memories told by a child narrator really neat short novel that plays with narrative and form wonderfully","1155":"short read the narrative from the point of view of the youngest brother captures the insightfulness that young children have as the boy grows the childlike narrative remains which lends to tender insight at key moments but also feels stunted in others","1156":" i loved this book i loved the main character's voice and his bare essentials attitude to storytelling stripped of all verbosity and clutter and with every tiny chapter adding an additional layer to characters so vivid and believable that made me feel i was there an animal too i loved the storyline and the fact that so much was implied by the glimpses into the every day lives of the three boys and their parents all the way to the hard ending i loved that some questions were left unanswered just like in real life where some things are left unexplained some threads untied for us to think about and wonder","1157":" spoiler alert spoiler button not appearing on app so consider yourself warned hmm i'm not entirely sure what i think suddenly went from being a book about three brothers and their life growing up in poverty to a very rushed few pages of hey i'm different from them because i'm gay and shit the rest of my family is not okay with this there were some skillfully rendered lines but overall the book didn't move me the way i'd imagined it would the short vignette style and racial ethnic themes reminded me of house on mango street but this story just didn't soar for me","1158":" the tale of three brothers three animals told by the youngest i'm always very taken with stories that contain trilogies of characters i have three daughters three brothers spans six years beginning when the boys are 7 9 and 10 told by the youngest brother very short an easy read don t skip anything some very beautiful writing magical realism here's an excerpt they grew up wiry long torsoed and lean their kneecaps their muscles bulged like knots on a rope broad foreheads and strong ridges along the brow announced their resemblance their cheeks hollowed their lips barely covered their teeth and gums as if the jaw and skull inside wanted out p 103 another excerpt describing kittens suckling from their wild mamma cat they live in a dumpster p 107 of 126 the kittens clawed and pushed in the suckling pile some seemed to be asleep at the tit they were ugly desperate things how long before them kittens forget their kin start fighting and fucking each other how long before they jump the runt so you see the ending is very sad i was confounded just couldn't give it four or five stars even though it most likely deserves it author is very young 31 i look forward to more from him i think","1159":"sensuous lyrical gut wrenching and heart breaking all at once","1160":" we the animals by justin torres is a perceptive tale of three boys told from the viewpoint of the youngest growing up in near poverty with their caucasian mother and puerto rican father the household is a whirlwind of emotion the boys are continuously fighting running eating their parents habitually display their attraction to each other but the family is also charged with the desolation of their situation and they blame and hate each other just as fiercely as they love torres uses vibrant words to put the reader right alongside the storyteller as he discovers his place in the dysfunctional family 5 stars","1161":"http amagi gr content emeis ta thir","1162":"some really great imagery and really well written not worthy of the hype it has been given though i mean honestly it seems like if put an abused questioning lead into a novel people think it's mind blowing come on people not that i'm offended by the content i'm offended that people still think this stuff is mind blowing books have been written about this stuff for decades rant over oh and he's a minority which if you're a book reviewer means that this is the most mind blowing book ever other rant over","1163":"mesmerizing this book a short novella really packed full with emotions read it in one sitting and will most likely think about it for longer than that probably not for every reader but i found it to be all i had heard it was","1164":"this is a fast read and the story just comes at you like a punch in the face it's quite dark to start with and only gets darker the parallels to christ get a bit heavy handed at times but the prose and narrative clarity always shines","1165":"heartbreaking and powerful left me thinking about it for days after i finished it","1166":"this is a short poignant novel with a lot going on just beneath the surface the writing is straightforward and clean though this reader found it slightly sparse the story unspools in brief chapters depicting abuse dysfunction and the ongoing quest for identity and acceptance justin torres hits the reader with scene after scene of vivid at times raw intimacy a white mother puerto rican father and three boys we the animals reminds us that life and inclusion is an ongoing struggle","1167":" we the animals is about three half breed brothers being brought up in brooklyn by a puerto rican dad and a white mother why animals you ask as one might expect in these dysfunctional families equal sales times paps likes to beat the ever living purgatory out of ma and occasionally for good measure out of his little hellions too at the novella's talking 125 pp folks start the narrator son is at age 7 the youngest and the three amigos are separated by three years this fact carries some weight considering the voice of the book it is for a first person plural we as in the boys collectively which transitions to a first person singular i as in the youngest son point of view quite sophisticated too sophisticated author justin torres might take refuge in the fact that he is an adult looking back but that wouldn't explain some of the more mature and clever words the boys mutter in the dialogue by the rules of narrative dialogue is embedded in time after all this is one of those vignettes strung together as an excuse for a novel books that have increased in popularity of late in fact the whole time i was reading it i kept saying torres is writing a boys' pov version of sandra cisneros's the house on mango street only not as well the language certainly has that sometimes poetic sometimes workshop colony air to it torres is a product of the famous and in publishing circles self perpetuating iowa writers' workshop among others he thanks many at the end including one of his writing teachers the famous michael cunningham surprise surprise on the cover we get a blurb from this well known writer his initials are michael cunningham that states we the animals is a dark jewel of a book it's heartbreaking it's beautiful it resembles no other book i've read editor's note apparently he hasn't read the house on mango street we should all be grateful for a brilliant ferocious new voice apparently cut off during printing was the ending who i happened to mentor thus making him easier to discover looking at cunningham's blurb i see that torres comes by his penchant for anaphora honestly another torres strength when kept in check is cascading participial phrases sometimes in twos sometimes in threes or fours i'm not saying the book lacks good writing it's in there if you care to pan for it what really jolts the reader taking this book as a whole is how it shifts from a coming of age story with rather violent parents say for 85% of the short way to an entirely different kind of coming of age story at the end that's right in the last three or four vignettes torres springs some new information on us and this causes the family to act in ways that not all will buy whether they're packing plastic or not honestly i had the literary equivalent of american express in my pocket and i was rolling my eyes no no no in the first place you're shifting gears too late and too suddenly if you want to try and pull this off you might need an additional 50 pp to transition us to it but no one listens to readers reading in a void the writer reader transaction is a mute one alas anyway i guess this new information might be considered a spoiler so i'll leave it at that what i won't leave is how it became a spoiler of another sort the type that spoils a book that was actually trying to be something","1168":"i enjoyed the book but i am not sure i got the ending will have to check the reviews and reader's guide not for cp book discussion","1169":"it's been some time since i've read something that feels unique i think what struck me most while reading this is that it didn't really remind me of anything loosely sure but i wasn't thinking this is a book u0026amp oh it took me apart over u0026amp over that switch from us to they it gutted me","1170":"loved it heartbreaking and beautiful i couldn't put it down please read it so i can talk about it","1171":"three brothers do things outside for one hundred pages also homosexuality the end","1172":"intense brutal story of three boys in a very dysfunctional family a very short book with not one wasted book a single sentence conveys so much this is an author to watch the story is haunting searing the characters beautifully formed the writing so incredibly good","1173":"this book is a poem burst into life and beaten back down few people i know will love this book as much as i do so don't go by my 5 stars not unless you want to see inside the folded edges of a boy's secret pain and pleasure both of a self awareness just beginning to unfurl despite the terrible love that tries to press it flat if so then take those stars and run with them make them your own","1174":"lady book club december a bit of pacing clumsiness see last 1 4 of the book and the autobiographical bones show a little clearly for my taste but gorgeous and nonetheless loved the vivid intensely physical way he brings a feral childhood to life the book club ladies looooooooovvvveeeed it","1175":"we've all heard of plot twists before well about 3 4s of the way though this short book torres did more than insert a twist he pulled a u ey sped into oncoming traffic doused the car in gasoline and set it aflame i quite enjoyed the coming of age story told in the first 90 or so pages of this book often brutal and raw in its description of a poor and abusive family of 5 it had me wondering how many kids actually grow up like this with parents never around eating whatever random and scarce food is left in the cabinets and relying on each other for support even when it comes via a wrestling matching or funny insult torres' writing style is unique and addictive he describes people and events in an almost poetic way i think the chapter i loved best was when the 3 boys were messing around with their increasingly drunk dad and he was barking orders on how to dance now dance like you're white and they all break out into robot moves ha man it's too bad the ending sucked no pun intended","1176":"loved the first 2 3 of the book then it went off the rails in a way for which i for one was not prepared the ending was slack and not earned i'll admit that the early scenes which i enjoyed were a bit cliche the beaten mother the scrum of kids but the writing was great and so carried the day but the end ruined it for me","1177":" i can understand not liking this novel for several reasons but the reviewers who are bashing the quality of the prose are straight up crazy it's gorgeous beauty may be in the eye of the beholder but if you can't see this you are blind the ending though makes me a little frustrated if we try to reassure ourselves by saying well but it must turn out ok since this novel is clearly autobiographical and justin torres has survived to write it which i feel is the intent it feels like a bit of a cheat","1178":"well written and poignant heard about it on npr and author is def up and coming","1179":" lines so good i wish i'd written them always more always hungrily scratching for more but there were times quiet moments when our mother was sleeping when she hadn't slept in two days and any noise any stair creak any shut door any stifled laugh any voice at all might wake her those still crystal mornings when we wanted to protect her this confused goose of a woman this stumbler this gusher with her backaches and headaches and her tired tired ways this uprooted brooklyn creature this tough talker always with tears when she told us she loved us her mixed up love her needy love her warmth those mornings when sunlight found the cracks in our blinds and laid itself down in crisp strips on our carpet those quiet mornings when we'd fix ourselves oatmeal and sprawl onto our stomachs with crayons and paper with glass marbles that we were careful not to rattle when our mother was sleeping when the air did not smell like sweat or breath or mold when the air was still and light those mornings when silence was our own secret game and our gift and our sole accomplishment we wanted less less weight less work less noise less father less muscles and skin and hair we wanted nothing just this just this","1180":"i loved this book the emotion was so raw","1181":" what a visceral read the opening chapters had me under a spell torres has an amazing and distinctive writing style and i am always a sucker for beautiful language still after awhile the gritty plot wore on me everyone is always either beating someone up or naked or both i am still mulling over a pivotal early moment in the main character's life and exposure to sexual content and wondering what the author's intentions were in that scene and the ending currently leaves me cold and uncertain it may warrant another pass torres is an undeniably powerful talent though","1182":" a series of vignettes passed as a novel there are times when this works and times when it doesn't and it doesn't work for we the animals as well as it could have while there are strikingly profound moments and the occasional stretches of beautiful captivating writing a great deal of this novel didn't make sense to me i couldn't understand the progression of time and the ending felt like it came out of nowhere i did not see the narrator progressing from beginning to end rather i saw him make a shocking and sudden and dramatic change an entirely different person in the last chapter than in any of the preceding chapters he wasn't developed to that point when i finally closed the book it was with a very confused look on my face it's a quick read though even for 127 pages","1183":"wow what a gem of a book","1184":"did not like the foul language i suppose it was to show the upbringing of the character i felt the story was too choppy couldn't tell how much time pasted between stories thank goodness there was only 125 pages","1185":" this is a great book for people who want to think about what they are reading instead of having it explicitly stated if you do not like a book where you have to read between the lines and fill in the gaps then this book is not for you if you enjoy a book where some of the passages are up for interpretation and you must understand what each lines implies then you will love this book this is a unique book and i may read it again i enjoyed this book so much because of the fact that i had to think while reading it the below lines are my favorite in the book and exemplify how some things are not explicitly stated but you understand the author's meaning then paps grabbed a can of beer from the fridge and our eyes followed the path of the can to his lips we took in the empties stacked up on the counter behind him then we looked at each other manny rolled his eyes and kept dancing so we got in line and kept dancing too except now manny was papa gosoe it was him we were following god's scatters all the clean among the dirty and me now look at me see me there with them in the snow both inside and outside their understanding the end if a little unexpected but was foreshadowed in the novel by the emphasis on the narrator's difference from his brothers the ending was also foreshadowed by a scene with the narrator and his father the father calls him pretty you will see why this matters go read it","1186":"harrowing beautiful i can't find the words but a worthy read","1187":"i wasn't super into this","1188":"disturbing it was really well written but the story was just psychologically messy it was raw and felt like it could be true which made it get even further under my skin","1189":"pretty goddamn good a good first effort by a young writer there were tears","1190":"this book reaches into the primal guts of childhood and growing up it captures the fear the confusion the joy in the little things and the need for comfort and the sense of belonging these three brothers have a bond that you're sure cannot be broken but reality sometimes sucks this book is painfully real","1191":" told in short chapters the novella we the animals relates the childhood of three brothers growing up in the shadow of their parents emotional passionate violent loving marriage while often told in the first person plural it is from the perspective of the youngest brother torres uses vivid and lyrical language and each vignette is a snapshot that contrasts typical growing up experiences with the turmoil the boys feel from their parents the novella sharply changes focus when one of the brothers comes of age and realizes the ways in which he is different from the rest of his brothers and family whether the author's intention or not the story loses its momentum recommend this to your literary fiction fans who like non traditional storytelling i can't wait to read more from this author","1192":"almost redefining the novel powerful","1193":"beautiful and poetic a story that digs deep into your heart and lingers","1194":"read 3 times only needed to read the beginning for class it reminded me loosely of jeanette walls the glass castle i'll probably thoroughly review this as soon as i have the time","1195":"i've been ridiculously excited for this book for the last month and gladly it just plain rocked a story of familial bonds frayed ravaged and reshaped over several years this novel is also an incantation there's a precise concentration on the music of words that rushes over the characters and you while reading it casting pin point emotional moments between three brothers and their parents as a spell that isolates you from everything going on in the outside world there is only you and this book and its characters torres takes an often used trope viewing humans on the level of beasts and dazzles by embracing it as the blood and soul of his characters not just as a symbolic commentary they could be shape shifters struggling between warring emotions","1196":"gorgeous and heartbreaking loved","1197":"this slim volume was a quick read for me but really got inside my mind the language is sparse and evocative painting the picture for the reader with the words unsaid the plot is an alternating wave of detail and action the last swell takes you right out to sea with its strength","1198":"some beautiful writing","1199":"very good book i really enjoyed it","1200":"a very quick read torres definitely leaves you wanting more his vibrant prose is exhilarating painful and beautiful","1201":" airport intrigue purchase composing review took longer than actually reading my flight was longer too why it's short 1st 8 pg are glowing reviews u0026amp comments really u0026amp written in a run on sentence stream on conscious way that pulls you in u0026amp through can't say i enjoyed it because it's not a leave it to beaver feel good left me admittedly distraught but it's well written compact hodge podge red table wine recommend decanting for a long time beware it will stain your teeth","1202":"i could not put this book down as soon as i finished it i wiped my tears and started it again sharp and beautiful heart warming and wrenching it's so good","1203":"totally engrossed in this book at first but it wrapped up weird which was a little disappointing great voice interesting stories about the boys childhood and the intrigue of the future and how it all resolves make for a good story i wish the ending felt like it was on par","1204":"beautiful and poignant vignettes many of the chapters could be stand alone short fictions and some of the more resonant sections are like prose poems lyrical and lonely","1205":" i loved this book from the first paragraph i had a hard time putting it down this is the impressionistic story of a young boy's growing up in a mixed race family mother white father puerto rican three sons from the age of six till young adulthood the family is poor and the parents are very young they had their first son when the mom was fourteen and the father was sixteen and the boys' growing up includes a mix of violence hunger fear deep love and sensual pleasure in the world and each other throughout the writing is concise and evocative when the boys are very young most of the story is told in the first person plural as the actual narrator the youngest son gets older and learns to differentiate himself from his brothers it's more and told in the first person singular i found this novel a real pleasure to read i just wished there were more of it","1206":"this book riveted me and broke my heart until the last chapter and the twist is enough to downgrade it from five stars to three for me the writing is sparse and vivid throughout but then the story does a 180 in the last few pages that feels like it belongs in a different novel it seems so disjointed like a few chapters are missing totally took me out of the story it's too bad because this book could've been perfect","1207":"first chapter is amazing that's about it overrated","1208":"i'm not sure i particularly know how to describe we the animals except to say that i enjoyed it it is about three brothers who grow up in an abusive household half white and half puerto rican the story is told through stream of consciousness which normally i am not fond of but which torres did very well each chapter is an episodic vignette that dips you into the brothers' lives at a different point in their development the book was short and while it did seem like it was trying too hard to be literary at times i really liked it and the story stayed with me long after i'd read the last page","1209":" wow i found this book after reading a partial history of lost causes and being so impressed that i googled the author she jennifer dubois and this guy justin torres won an award together for young authors so i downloaded this book from the library and was not disappointed i don't know if the mastery of these two works can be chalked up to pure raw talent or to a fabulous education from the iowa writers workshop but whatever it is it works for me this book for me felt like a cross between glass castle the go to book for familial dysfunction and junot diaz not because i'm clumping all young male talented latin authors but because of the rawness of the tone and the self effacing and funny descriptions of the young male narrator and the chaos and ok latin surroundings in which the protagonists are raised i agree with other reviewers who said the end could have been foreshadowed a bit more it came from nowhere","1210":" this is a highly celebrated awarded and reviewed book first published in sept 2012 it's a short book 125 pages and fast paced the first few lines of the novel seemed innocuous but they built up into a crescendo of emotion as a reader i had a good picture of who these boys were and i wanted to know where they were going or had gone we wanted more we knocked the butt ends of our forks against the table tapped our spoons against our empty bowls we were hungry we wanted more volume more riots we turned up the knob on the tv until our ears ached with the shouts of angry men we were six snatching hands six stomping feet we were brothers boys three little kings locked in a feud for more how did that feel to you i could see their faces their fists and fury the story fully characterized each brother ages 6 8 and 10 heartbreaking tumultuous times interspersed with funny or tender moments marked most chapters sometimes you wanted to put down the book just for a breather only to find your place again and keep reading the novel is a coming of age story voraciously told by the youngest brother the author his parents rage fume drink and are all together depressing but human with it's tenacious prose and pace the novel reminded me of jack kerouac and junot diaz maybe they were justin torres' older brothers in another life the book is that great","1211":"a powerful original and intimate voice emerges in this novella leading us through a series of vignettes that show us an impoverished family's struggles with money love anger booze brotherhood and mental illness unfold in startling and gripping detail torres is definitely one to watch","1212":"if you liked cavedweller running with scissors or glass castle you'll probably like this book although it's a novel and not autobiographical unless torres changes his mind about calling it a novel at some point it is beautifully written and incredibly poignant this is a story about finding yourself within and by pulling against family ties it is fascinating and evokes strong feelings in the reader it is also short i think too short the story clearly didn't end where the book ran out of pages but it's well worth reading for the poetry of the earlier chapters","1213":"it opens with the some of the best writing i've read in years the magical delivery fades halfway through as the tone changes the end seems a little incongruous and tacked on its a short and i mostly read it without stopping once i started its semi autobiographical","1214":"this coming of age story was pure poetry raw intense and gripping but beautiful too","1215":"justin torres in the first few chapters uses many literary tricks that he probably learnt in iowa but none of them matter it is the empathy and grace with which he treats the 5 main characters that make it such a deeply disturbing read","1216":" growing up is never easy especially in justin torres's novella we the animals three brothers manny joel and our unnamed protagonist are growing up in a poor puerto rican household in brooklyn their mother works night shifts at a brewery attempting to feed her young sons their father paps is keeper of the heritage he also seems to lead a very odd lifestyle that includes long disappearances strange jobs and less than stellar decisions the book follows the protagonist as the boys fight tumble argue bond and basically try to discover who they will become in spite of the family hardships the bonds of brotherhood remain strong and help glue the family together yet by the end our narrator has fallen from his brothers' gaces thanks to his journal of male relationship fantasies as he ponders his fate in a psychiatric hospital we are left to wonder whether the anamalistic household and upbringing will eventually save his mind or destroy it a very harsh and truthful look at the life lived underclass and how it can impact the future","1217":"love love love the start of this book the texture of the prose the voice of the narrator the sparse and effective evocation of person and place the end comes too suddenly time speeds forward and i lost touch with the main character","1218":"challenging and rough coming of age story beautiful writing","1219":" the bulk of this novella centered on a trio of half white half puerto rican brothers has such promise the prose is luminous arresting conspiratorial the portrayal of the magic and confusion of childhood a fraught one at that is sensitive and skilled as one of three sisters myself i can attest to the truth of the sibling dynamics i almost missed my bart transfer once while reading this but that ending what happened justin content wise it's fine my issue is the strike slip fault that separates the finale from the rest it comes out of nowhere chronologically thematically even tonally with its self pitying air and ends abruptly like some ostentatious architectural addition hastily abandoned at cliff's edge had the narrative remained seamless i'd be all over that fourth star alas","1220":"justin torres is probably a genius and i'm not just saying that because he was nice enough to blurb my forthcoming collection i swear this book is astounding","1221":"i didn't like this book at all it was scattered and sad and everyone dysfunctional","1222":" i absolutely loved this slim little book it's lyric without being precious it's spare without being sparse it's identity without the politics a lot of we the animals is written in the first person plural i appreciated the chorus of voices within a unified experience that such a pov puts forth it's something i've played around with in my own writing and something that i've always appreciated in the works of writers such as andrew holleran justin torres is in good company beyond craft though this book packs a great deal of pathos into few pages and the confluence of these vignettes spins the narrative to dizzying heights i really did just love it if you liked this make sure to follow me on goodreads for more reviews","1223":"it was good but i feel like there's so much more there","1224":"the writing is beautiful the content a bit disturbing","1225":"perfect i will read it again and again for its depiction of the love of three brothers and their acceptance of wild and erratic parents beautifully written","1226":" the book is at times brilliant depressing and unnerving the analysis i've seen of the book indicates that the writing style is polarizing...some love it some hate it i mostly enjoyed the short choppy style in which the novel is written the verbal and physical abuse outlined in the book is jarring and the style only emphasizes the brutal nature of the brothers' childhood the brutality of their family life isn't always easy to read or comprehend but is the core of the novel and ultimately what makes it such and interesting and heartfelt book torres was on the diane rehm show in 2011 to publicize the book and after hearing parts of it while driving i knew that i'd eventually read his debut novel the book is based on his life and the interview is illuminating if you enjoyed or didn't the book go and listen to the interview which is archived online","1227":"love hate relationship with this book some parts were amazing then other parts i wanted to toss it out a window","1228":"a really surprising tale of three brothers that is tender and brutal the main character grows up being pulled in many directions and finds his own way in the midst of all","1229":"a masterfully written little gem about a dysfunctional family in brooklyn","1230":"so dope best book buy it and give it to all your friends","1231":"the style was really interesting choppy but experimental in that way and it made it flow in a special kind of way this is the way we remember our past by piecemeal so not surprisingly it is compelling but i just found it extremely disturbing and did not like the aftertaste maybe that was the point but did not leave me with a good feeling but very provocative so worth reading","1232":"disturbingly beautiful and full of proetic poetic prose","1233":"can't decide how i feel about this one has a glass castle feel but very sad i might have read one too many awful childhood but muddling through books lately and so so short mostly this just made me sad probably not widest thanksgiving choice","1234":"powerful and very well written keep an eye out for this upcoming debut novel","1235":" kept hearing about this so i finally read it underwhelmed lyrical but not innovative in language a touching story but ungrounded i had a hard time believing the family's reaction considering there was no context to rationalize their decisions my boyfriend is the youngest of three brothers and the middle son is gay they would make for a more intriguing story as they are 3 definite characters distinct dynamic at least it was short the conceit is good and the last 30 pages redeemed it but i wasn't ultimately impressed","1236":"wow kind of weird short enough to read in a day or two deals with brothers growing up disfunctional family life homosexuality family dealing with it nobody i would recommend it to","1237":"you should read this","1238":"such a visceral use of rhythm loved it","1239":"exquisite writing","1240":"honest filled to the brim with love strong and masculine and broken wow is all i can say wow","1241":"it's the only novel i've read in one sitting in my whole life partially because it was so good and partially because it was so short hashtag really well written pamphlet","1242":"loved this book short believable prose interesting the only caveat is that the book ends to quickly i would have liked to see the ending expanded and developed on of the best short fiction books that i have read this year","1243":"loved everything about this book except the last chapter which veered into a metaphorical style that differed dramatically from the novel's realistic groundedness this would make for a great book club discussion","1244":"so much packed into a small book beautiful writing you felt the joy the pain the anger the love excellent i would highly recommend it and look forward to re reading it","1245":"this just wasn't my cup of tea it is a sad and harsh telling of the lives of a sometimes close but usually angry and fight filled family with three boys who are generally off on their own causing chaos i think the writing is very good but not a story i enjoyed","1246":"i loved the beginning of this book torres's prose style quick jolting sentences mirrors the horror that is the boys' childhood towards the end however he lost me he started his novel as a tribute to childhood but ended in a graphic unnecessary way this story could have been awesome","1247":" so much can be said with in few words or in this case pages which is what justin torres does in this short novel the way this book is narrated with such a beautiful prose makes the words flow effortless and it tranpsorts you in the mind of the youngest of three brothers with so much anger and love and pain and joy it's such a discordance of emotions all perfectly justified the characters give life to this novel from the young mother who works the graveyard shift and can't quite recall what time or day it is enduring an abusive husband who dissapears for days at the time but always comes back to try and make it better and the three brothers the animals the three musketeers the three stooges who stick through everything and destroy everything in their path but are there to protect one another great book all the way through the end with one twist at the end that is well hinted throughout the book and is revealed in the most bold way 3 5 stars","1248":"meh could have been so much better ended up with a weird ending and an in unimpressionable read","1249":"fun moving u0026amp well written","1250":"ehhh easy quick read but too much despair hopelessness etc a bit dark probably not a good summer read","1251":"this is a tiny little freight train of a book that will break your heart if dan savage read it he might change his tune about it getting better","1252":"i enjoyed the large majority of this book but it took a sudden and quite unexpected turn in the epilog i didn't think it was handled as well as the rest of the content i also found the writing style a bit too rich every page seem to be packed not necessarily a bad thing but in this case it felt a bit creative writerly in a off putting way","1253":"absolutely beautiful prose while still managing to stay true to the age of the character","1254":"we the animals is structurally perfect the earlier chapters so vividly capture the luminescence of adolescence that it feels all the more obscene and tragic when the darker turns begin to form like storm clouds in the final quarter of the book the prose throughout is crystalline and dynamic for torres is wise and loving with his words ultimately though the whole affair is too slight and too sly for its own good it wants to slice like a guillotine but it's more like a paper cut it points to great talent that it never quite manifests in itself it will linger on a shelf forgotten and i think it could have should have been so much more","1255":" a seriously remarkable book recommended to me on twitter by a writing friend in london whose literary taste i trust thanks kevin franke i found a copy in my local library and by the time i'd read the blurb i was pretty confident i'd like it by the time i'd read the jacket bio i couldn't wait to get home and start it how's this for the some text underneath your photo justin torres was raised in upstate new york his work has appeared in granta tin house and glimmer train a graduate of the iowa writers' workshop he was the recipient of a rolon fellowship in literature erin united states artists and is a wallace stegner fellow at stanford among many other things he has worked as a farmhand a dog walker a creative writing teacher and a bookseller the writing is tight and tense and 'we the animals' is another wonderful example of the power of a novella","1256":"like a beautiful mashup of rick moody's boys and sandra cisneros' _house on mango street_ i read this in less than 36 hours i e could not put it down it's lyrical and haunting it's a wallop of a novel in stories will be using it in classes as excerpts and whole text assignments for years to come i anticipate","1257":"late to the party on this but who cares beautiful sentences and an amazing conceit executed so well","1258":"this guy can write his way with words kept me reading right through the dark side while hopingfor some light while i did not love the story itself torres' literary pictures kept me turning the pages","1259":"ummm that was disappointing","1260":"yes it's well written but i was conscious all the time that i was reading a work of art--that the story of these three boys growing up had been filtered and refined retrospectively by the eye ear and pen of the youngest the i at the core of its largely first person plural narration there's nothing wrong with that per se but it means we receive the story not via someone the protagonist's age but via an adult whose primary concern is making art it comes as material not experience and the experience is and should be what attracts a reader to these stories they are strung together into a novel but they can all stand alone quite well the nature and expression of the bonds among brothers--moreover brothers whose paps is puerto rican and whose ma is white with all the differences that implies in views of masculinity and male roles--is fantastic material for a book it shouldn't need to be told in the first person it shouldn't matter that it culminates in a life and career for its narrator that tears the family apart frankly i don't care and i don't want to know who the narrator becomes as an adult i want to hear about the kids the last story the night i am made the longest in the book the only one with subsections of its own the only one with a real plot involving multiple events not just event epiphany --that last story is where we're suddenly thrust into the narrator's adult first person singular perspective it tells the events and revelations which spell the end of the family unit particularly the unit of we three brothers it's a good story too and it tells of an experience worth reading about from the perspective of its more or less adult protagonist we can't help but suspect that protagonist is a version of the author is this really a novel or is it a memoir but after 17 tales of the brothers as unit it's an unwelcome shift joyce managed a smooth transition from the child's perspective to the adult's and specifically the adult as writer in a portrait of the artist as a young man sure he was joyce but that means it can be done and i didn't see it happening here i'd love to read the same stories told by manny or joel rather than justin the book overall is remarkably similar to malick's the tree of life and the film has the same flaw the sean penn character forces an adult perspective which is unnecessary and unwelcome especially when the child's perspective has been presented so well but unless you're a very slow reader the book will go faster","1261":"well written and compelling this novel is constructed as a series of stories many with small and surprising climaxes it runs along at a blistering pace that keeps you wondering where it's going to the sudden and somewhat surprising finale","1262":" spoilersi'm not sure exactly how to describe this book it's that good i'm so glad i picked it up and i hope the author has more books plus it's a quick read only about 125 pages or so i saw this book at the library and decided to read it with no idea whatsoever what it is about sometimes that isn't good for readers and book bloggers this is an exception not to sound too corny but this is a gem of a book that did sound corny so the book is about a family of five the three sons joel manny and the narrator and the puerto rican father paps as well as the white mother ma at the beginning of the books the children range in age from 7 to 10 the story is about their lives how they play and have fun and be kids the family is living in poverty and the parents were teenagers when they had the kids ma and paps work late hours and are very bipolar around the others sometimes they are very nice but then they become mean we the animals also tells of how they come to learn about life and the good and bad things it brings about three quarters through the book i was wondering when the plot was going to show it seemed more like a slightly fictionalized story of the author's childhood very simple and light not funny all the time though oh but wait until you get to the end no joke one page to the next an intense switch from childhood to young adulthood and the change in plot will hit you like a train it was so unexpected i was reading it smiling and then i was like where did that come from but if you think back to the middle of the book you will realize where it came from so then the sudden events do not seem so strange except for when he goes to a place that i won't name this may or may not be due to some other things mentioned in the later chapters ahem ahem alcohol and drugs ahem yes the characters lose their innocence in the blink of an eye after doing a little research on this book i found that a lot of amazon reviewers did not like the ending things like it was selfish of the author too sudden which it was sudden but made the story better and confusing but that doesn't necessarily mean it is a bad thing warning do not read this book if you are offended by sexual acts homosexuality drugs or other things of that nature there wasn't a whole lot of plot to this book but still to me it felt raw emotional real and unforgettable this is definitely a book that will make you think for a long time i'm sure i do not know how this book has not been read by everyone it is very important the characters were not boring at all and it had such vivid language i highly recommend it to any person now i do realize why this book will offend people not how the parents treat their kids but the ending meaning what is revealed about the narrator but i'm asking you to please read it and think about it this book is so inspiring and emotional and hardcore we the animals is absolutely on my list for best books of the year if you read one book this year read this and also daughter of smoke u0026amp bone by laini taylor so many things are running through my head right now about this book i am going to try and buy a copy for myself","1263":"gave up kind of depressing finished it for book club","1264":"i really liked this book it's a story of three boys growing up in a hard time as multi racial interesting perspective and well written short too if you want a quick but intense read","1265":" this was an incredibly engaging story that was visceral in its portrayal of a family on the edge of total dysfunction yet bound together with a resounding sense of family and love you wanted these characters to be better than they were and find a way out of the pain of their lived experience despite its compelling storyline weaving the intersection and commitment of brothers to each other and children to their parents the ending took a turn that was unexpected dark and disturbing this is not a story for the faint of heart but will be a story that will remain buried in your thoughts for a long time","1266":" we the animals is a thought provoking mucky little book torres' writing style is unique and poetic each chapter gives a glimpse into the difficult chaotic life the brothers and their parent's share and it all comes together and creates a whole if not always clear picture throughout the book torres' says a lot without really saying anything specific and that worked at first though i picked up on the subtle hints through out the book and wasn't shocked by the events in the final chapters i was unsettled by the jumbled ending and the weird vagueness of the final chapter in those last chapters torres took my emotions and rattled them so that they were all tangled and in disarray and than left them that way i could not resolve how i felt toward any of the characters because i wasn't sure how or what the author wanted me to feel after all the effort torres' made to bring his characters to life the unclear ending was a disappointment an interesting slightly peculiar read not necessarily a book i would pick up again but worth checking out at least once","1267":"not a novel but didn't matter so beautiful i wept","1268":" this book was good but very short i wish it would have gone on longer and in fact the narrator didn't cover his pre teen or teen years i wish he hadn't skipped over that part it would have helped to understand how a beautiful little boy became the person he did though it isn't all that surprising based on the kinds of parents he had they were at times neglectful at others abusive and fleetingly loving his brothers were his saving grace and it was touching to see their love for each other i do wonder how much of the book is autobiographical because then you really wonder how justin torres became an acclaimed author","1269":"an intense coming of age short novel halfs 3 brothers the animals puerto rican dad white mom growing up in brooklyn and upstate ny tells of the crazy passions wild shenanigans love and coming into consciousness told through the youngest the 7 year old i'd love to read more by torres","1270":"some of the most beautiful writing i have ever written but at first i was enjoying the character studies but the novella turned very dark i cannot say i enjoyed the story line at all this is worth reading for the word mastery alone i strongly disagree with the reviewer that compared this to house on mango street maybe same theme but very different take","1271":"torres has written very candidly about his childhood a trio of brothers animals in an unstable house the boys beat each other tease each other and defend each other torres begins his memoir at the age of seven when his mother begged him not to grow up and grow away from her as his older brothers had and ends with his staggered memories of being locked up in a mental hospital upon coming out to his family it was very difficult for me to get into the short stories at first but as it is a short book that i read in one day by the end i was hooked i think when i have read other memoirs of this style they have been people i was familiar with and could easily picture while i have no familiarity with torres at all all in all i think it was a great easy and interesting read i would be interested to read whatever torres publishes in the future","1272":"tiny little sliver of a book but a unique style definitely want to read more of his work","1273":"i loved the writing was hooked from page 1 read it straight through with just enough time out for supper","1274":" listened to the audiobook all right can we call this 3 5 stars i'm having a harder and harder time with this ratings game because this time i loved the writing even though afterward i read some critic expert types criticizing it for having borrowed too many old tricks that had apparently gone right over my inexpert and therefore unnecessarily critical head but really it was carnal and lyrical at the same time most of the time and that i cherished like we wanted more we knocked the butt ends of our forks against the table tapped our spoons against our empty bowls we were hungry we wanted more volume more riots we turned up the knob on the tv until our ears ached with the shouts of angry men we wanted more music on the radio we wanted beats we wanted rock we wanted muscles on our skinny arms we had bird bones hollow and light and we wanted more density more weight we were six snatching hands six stomping feet we were brothers boys three little kings locked in a feud for more \"so pretty so powerful i kept listening for the writing because the content was often so hard to stomach as a mom as a softy and c'mon who's not going to feel something when the stars of the show are children and when the action is abuse i cared though about all the characters i was afraid for them and afraid of them and i believed in 'em too until the end the end threw me it tried too hard the end was an attempt to put a bow or an exclamation point and explanation point on the whole thing in an inexpert and unnecessary way from utterly and heartbreakingly believable to naaaah and as will happen the whole experience lost some traction because of that i didn't stow away this kid and his bros with me as you do the characters that really nestle themselves deep in your heart the audio recording powered down and i turned the page","1275":"this book was a really great read until the very end i'm fine with what happened at the end actually saw it coming but it was too rushed the whole book read like a hot languid summer day up to that point and then there was a switch with no real explanation for how we got there i think the author probably did this intentionally he had some notion of portraying how life happens and sometimes we get somewhere with no real idea how we got there but it doesn't work in this book it's too fast and harsh after the rest there needed to be maybe 25 more pages to slide us to the ending with the same dreamlike ease the rest of the book was written in","1276":"justin torres does a remarkable job of capturing the insanity of life in a a violent household and its impact on three young brothers in many ways we the animals is a depiction of family life at its worst with unsettling descriptions of abuse and neglect however the aspect of the book that still haunts me several weeks after reading is torres's ability to preserve the family as a precious though fragile thing","1277":"intimate touching beautifully written","1278":" consisting of the intimate seemingly average for the characters scenes that construct a coming of age portrait we the animals plays out like a movie elements of narratives like boyhood tracking young characters over time using small bits of stories also similar story elements mysterious skin sexuality being forced into fruition and the perks of being a wallflower re the final act the protagonist's mental collapse are blended to create not a single story but a collection that entertains evokes concern and fascination and haunts using its own impressive literary style the language bounds from triumphant to defeated tones there's always passion in the words in the last few chapters the three boys must finally face grown up problems the novel's haunting aspects stem from the family's love and concern for the narrator the effect is one of awe and hope rather than dread or pain i found it fascinating how the narrator wavered between speaking on behalf of all three brothers and setting himself apart from the other two the latter of which happens more frequently towards the conclusion it's quite an engaging tale about growing up and quite accessible while remaining mature in its descriptions immaturity definitely worth another read easy to get through in one sitting too","1279":"this beautifully written but hauntingly desperate story of three boys growing up in a difficult situation will stay with you long after the last page has been read you'll read it in a weekend and will not be sorry that you did","1280":"amazing torres is a very gifted writer who paints you a portrait of a boyhood beautiful and ugly poor yet richer than many others i swallowed this in one sitting and was left wanting more","1281":"wonderful voice young boys and the keenness of their observation the poignancy of their experience of the world disappointed in the end but maybe the dark shift in the tone has a kind of resonance of its own childhood its freedom tragedy innocence and suffering must end the discovery of sexuality strangely opens our lives to the possibility of a greater intimacy with another person but it also closes us off from the intimacy of our shared childhood","1282":"wow hmm i dont even know what to say about this amazing book it is eloquent and moving it is very short which made it even better probably now that i know the ending i need to go back and read it again i never saw it coming how did i miss it best book i've read in 2011","1283":" i thought this would be a quick read a palate cleanser if you will between other longer more engrossing books but this 128 pager is exquisitely written and also emotionally hard so i found myself savoring it putting it down when i needed to breathe after a devastating scene and then coming back to it my only complaint is that it is so very influenced by cisneros but never does torres acknolwedge this literary precursor the struture tight poetic vignettes the point of view of a child the novella length all echoes _a house on mango street_ without being derivative at all","1284":" this book is an excellent example of why children should not have children the parents are 16 and 14 when their first son is born and they quickly have 2 more sons they are pathetically unprepared to be parents they love their kids and they do their best to provide for them but their best falls terribly short most of the time despite the harsh realities of this book i found it impossible not to laugh at some things that taken in context were really not funny big dick truckbig dick truckstill makes me laugh whenever i think about it not so funny was paps slapping ma in the face for saying it against all odds the youngest son is lucky enough to be gifted with intelligence and makes something of himself and becomes a writer the other two turn out exactly as one would expect an interesting example of nature vs nurture","1285":"this book was definitely different from any other novel i have ever read but i felt it lacked a lot of detail in the actual story telling","1286":"i wish i could give this 3 5 stars much of the writing is truly bold and very effective the first chapter reads more like a wonderful poem and many of the other sections have an almost poetic feel the author uses very short tight scenes and descriptions to create very clear images of his characters the reason i cannot give this 4 stars is the ending it feels somewhat forced and comes out of nowhere with not a great deal of forshadowing it could have been more effective if the author had built it up more to give it more of a crescendo rather than feeling like it was tacked on","1287":"a little too out there","1288":"i liked torres' style it was staccato almost streaming of consciousness shifting from one idea to the next yet it flowed at times the prose was beautiful the raw descriptions from the point of view of a seven year old boy though spare elicited vivid and wild visions of the animalistic behavior of the three brothers the familial dysfunction was heartbreaking the ending was shocking and unexpected","1289":"i think this is beautifully written but i wouldn't recommend it for a book club","1290":"a short fast read about a mixed race family and the boys that watch their mother and father love and fight","1291":"this is a beautiful book very powerful it is at times uplifting and at times depressing","1292":"4 5 starsreading torres is like watching someone with a flare in hand dancing around a powder keg not a perfect book but this is one of the most powerful books i've read by a contemporary author in many years","1293":"anyone who doesn't think this is a five star read is brain dead","1294":"i wish i could give it 3 5 stars loved the writing and fierce descriptions but its not necessarily a book i would read over and over which is a 4 star and up for me","1295":" i raced through this novella in a single afternoon it's so dissimilar in style from anything i've read making use of a strange first person plural and an interlacing of chronological vignettes that just somehow works torres gives us a stunning insight into the violence that was clearly part of his own coming of age experience it's hard to take at times but tempered at many intersections by real warmth and loving bonds between brothers and their parents the first three quarters of this short work is a gripping well executed portrayal of a young boy trying to make sense of the violence in his life of the rural poverty he finds himself in of being a different race than those around him and later as we find out of being gay as well torrres takes these coming of age themes and puts a novel fresh and brilliant stylistic twist on them it's so clear that this tale is an autobiographical one that it just punches the reader really hard in the gut we the animals was headed toward five star territory until the abrupt turn towards the end while torres deals with the themes of an adolescent wrestling with his sexual orientation in nearly as compelling a fashion as the work's other themes i didn't really understand the chronological jump or the radical thematic shift the issues were clearly foreshadowed but it would have been more deftly incorporated if we had a few more transitionary chapters to digest them a great first effort though and i'm sure we'll he more from justin torres","1296":"oh i wasn't prepared for the ending of this brief book of connected stories about 3 wild brothers and their parents parents who married too young were unhappy with their lives and yet kept their little band together the writing is sparse and i couldn't help compare torres' prose to the poetry of lorine niedecker ideas and situations condensed to their essence","1297":" really enjoyed this quick read from page one i was totally immersed in the world of the main character and his family and wanted to dive into it like an expressionist painting to soak up all of the life color heartbreak and raw emotion that is put into so few pages personally i like books that have very short chapters because i get more absorbed in them when they are less chronological and more painting a general picture of the author's world or a fictional world i can't tell the main character is a young boy growing up new york with a caucasian mother and puerto rican father and shares stories about growing up with his two younger brothers as he comes of age","1298":"this was a great novel filled with so many brilliant metaphors which left me wondering so much more the beautiful story of a boy and his family which brings in both the strength of family love and the reality of the read world you can't go wrong reading this","1299":"beautiful torres's debut novel is a breathtaking whirlwind of emotion packed into short punchy scenes that will haunt you long after you've finished i repeatedly found myself laughing and crying within the span of a few sentences wonderful","1300":"very short easy to read great writing","1301":"stunningly evocative","1302":"there are good bones here but the individual vignettes feel haphazardly cobbled together and the whole somehow ends up being less than the sum of its parts","1303":"loved this book 4 5 stars really quick read reads kind of like short stories read it in about 3 hours over a couple of days powerful poetic read about 3 brothers growing up in and impoverished and abusive environment","1304":"i heard justin torres speak last saturday at west coast live knew i had to buy his book and just finished reading it he told of composing lines in his head as he walked dogs in new york city for a living memorizing what he thought then writing it down when he got home he figured he completed only 20 some pages each year the book is only 128 pages long and composed of short noncontiguous chapters vignettes but somehow it fills your head and your life as if it were a novel three times its length it is powerful mesmerizing intense and altogether beautiful though disquieting this young man has a brilliant future ahead of him","1305":"a short natural history of three brothers and their feral explosive love","1306":"this is a gorgeous book with fierce ideas the family is exceptionally rendered and race and sexuality are approached in new ways here torres does a fine job of capturing the rambunctious energy of young boys being raised rough by parents who don't quite get it right with their children or each other where this book falters is in that it is meager it is not as fleshed out as it needs to be and there's a bit of a twist at the end of the book that is rushed and out of place when it doesn't need to be that way i highly recommend this book but i wish i could have read the book that was twice as long and twice as well considered","1307":"i found this book ugly and depressing don't know why the comparisons to cisneros except for short chapters","1308":"this is a deceptively quick read three brothers united by parentage poverty and attitude defy much to stay together family love is stronger than almost anything it is the almost anything that breaks your heart one of the three grows up differently and hides that difference with relative success until he can't contain himself any more when he breaks free the response from his family is sad and shocking this book turned out to be much much more than the sum of its parts great book","1309":"both dense and light like a bakery that resides in memory this novel exudes depth and pathos in a sparse amount of pages","1310":"fast read for my american literature class this is a heavy book but lives up to its reputation very rich in material to write about for a literary analysis paper","1311":"we the animals is playful humorous heartfelt intimate dark and realistic","1312":"a well rounded short story this book displays a realistic portrayal of brothers or so i would guess since i'm neither a brother or have brothers the last 30 it so pages is what really makes the book worth discussing and i give props to the authors for being able to keep my full attention tell a complete story and give a voice to each character all within 125 pages a good book club bonus book","1313":"this book is either a really long poem or a really short novel i cannot stand that style of writing where you're grateful for chapter breaks because the whole thing is a huge poetic good lord when do i get to come up for air run on sentence however this book is fantastic really really awesome just read it it's only 100 something pages long and if you hate it you only wasted an afternoon","1314":"a brief but memorable read quite honest and brutal in parts","1315":"excellent story of three brothers growing up as a tight knit unit amidst the hardship of a turbulent home life in brooklyn very well written and heart breaking","1316":"considering i read it in two hours i'd say i had a good ride controlled but still going wild inside","1317":"poignant gripping beautifully written i think i should read it again","1318":"overcooked bullshit the several pages of praise filled blurbs at the beginning of the book should've been put to use by the author to actually i don't know write a story this book is essentially the transmogrified result of putting an overly poetic circle jerk and faux authorial angst into a microwave","1319":"this is in my top three favorite books","1320":"i loved this brief lyrical novel more scene sketches than an actual story but the prose is so pared down that you don't need copious detail the emotions shine brilliantly from the page i think it resonated more with me as a gay man with a straight brother torres really captures how complicated that relationship can be growing up you are bound to that person by blood but wholly alien from the way they address world","1321":"like a punch in the face 5 stars for the flow of the prose 1 star for leaving me feel empty and sad which is where i end up with a 3 star review","1322":" a short fast powerful read at first the short chapters in the voice of a child reminded me of a house on mango street but the boys in this story are less innocent less secure it's heartbreaking to see how alone the brothers are in the world and but how steady they are with one another the narration from the child's perspective is well done i think there is an openness that the author manages well and it's fascinating to see the way the boys interact with their parents what the youngest one notices about them and how he interprets what they're doing i wasn't really happy with the ending of the story the ending came too suddenly it seemed that there was a big gap between the final few chapters and the first part of the book and even the ending itself seemed disjointed","1323":"this book relies more on style than substance and overall feels more like a brilliant short story that's been stretched out and distorted into a decent novella while the second person plural voice we is initially compelling it wears out quickly because the book is basically vignettes of an unhinged mother an abusive father and increasingly violent brothers another tale of a poor dysfunctional family featuring abusive and or mentally ill parents you can find in memoirs like the glass castle or the liars' club however in those books the first person voice narration gives you the interiority necessary to make the tale so unique and memorable in this case the second person feels more like a gimmick quickly abandoned once the story takes an abrupt turn in its last third so while the book does offer moments of poetic beauty about the wrathful nature of familial love i kept finding myself waiting for the center to hold and for the story to solidify the moment it almost does it ends","1324":"this stream of consciousness writing just didn't work for me i didn't feel the chapters blended together cohesively i also felt like i'd been here before mean afro latino father meek white mother crazy biracial kids yawn i could see new yorker type critics salivating at this kind of writing calling it real and brave but i just felt like there was nothing new here","1325":"fresh and different","1326":"it was almost too terrifying to turn the pages","1327":"this is one of the most creative short novels i've read in some time it is unlike most coming of age stories in every desired way torres simultaneously writes with such control and freedom that it is a delight to read even in its tragedy if however you need a novel to fit into a box of what a novel is supposed to be you may be disappointed","1328":"staggering ruminating don't agree with the angry negative reviews 75 understand that there is beauty and imperfection here well worth the time and thought","1329":"sparse feral flawless","1330":"ummmm ok so i listened to the audio version of this one and i think the reader's voice made it more intriguing otherwise i never would have gotten past the first bit of the book i finished the first of 3 parts and i just felt nasty and sick and sort of like i discovered a secret i preferred not to have known the most striking scene the most repulsive is when the three brothers' parents are having sex as the boys watch what the it made me shudder i felt some pity for them but not so much that i really cared what kind of parents are they apparently the kind that sleep all day and let their children lick the crumbs off their plates scrounge around in the backs of the cabinets and the fridge for outdated food and steal from a kindly old man's garden apparently the kind that leave home without any explanation apparently the type that push their kid's head under the water because she's too afraid of the water and nearly drowns him normally i love stories about dysfunctional families but reading about this one me feel nasty and sad the writing style was terrible awful so bad too much time was spent describing meaningless details and some scenes left me wondering if i actually grasped what was happening because it was just too weird and vague some good things about we the animals 1 mixed race family2 the parents' backstory though extremely short 3 the honesty and fearlessness of the author i would not recommend unless you like to feel like a slimy mildewy old mop","1331":" i did not read this it read me this is by far the most lovely and powerhouse reading experience i've had in a long while it took me by force yikes this book would get 6 stars if there were 6 make that 7 no 10 like jayne anne phillips' black tickets susan minot's monkeys james agee's writing uniquely its own there is nobody else who could do this what mr torres did here clearly i am not able to say anything intelligent about this experience still under some spell but i will say read it","1332":"incredible the most beautiful novel i have read in a very long time","1333":"this short novels reads like the mythology of a family and then the last two chapters put the story into a sharp heartbreaking focus it is apparent that the author wrote this sentence by sentence and revision after revision the clarity beauty and accuracy of each sentence is fascinating","1334":" 'we the animals' is a gloriously frank and beautifully written account of childhood and adolescence what is most striking is the author's capacity to capture this innocence his portrayal of sex and violence as almost insignificant sources of bewilderment and curiosity when seen through the eyes of a child torres' forthright style drives this novel i finished it in one go which is not to say that the narrative is rushed on the contrary there is a sense of being carried along by it venturing to places that we as readers should not really be all in all this is a great read from an author whose public openness about his life experiences made it far too easy for me to read more into the story than is intended a situation that enhanced rather than detracted from my enjoyment","1335":"wow a disturbing heartbreaking and beautifully written book","1336":"this book is raw and emotionally intense beautifully written after reading the first couple of chapters i thought that the narrator and his brothers really were animals but as i got a more in depth picture of their home life it became clear why they were animals the only reason why i didn't give it 5 stars was the chronology towards the end got a bit fuzzy and a bit confusing loved the book","1337":"three brothers their parents and this world raw dark powerful tragic heart melting at times short but far from simple unique and flexible impressive overall","1338":"was going for a 5 star rating until the last few chapters i have the feeling that the author always had the last few chapters in the back of his mind as the real reason for writing this story as he sees himself as the main character but the rest of the book is soooo much better i am pleased i read it i love justin's prose love brotherhood and trauma beautifully and masterfully portrayed","1339":"very powerful writing not sure if i liked it or not but i know it was well written very painful too to say the least","1340":"very short only three discs book of three brothers coming of age in upstate new york puerto rican father white mother i found it compelling nicely read by frankie j alvarez","1341":" a solid debut from justin torres the writing is great often very lyrical and the passion that goes into describing the joys and hells of family life feels completely genuine and real but i agree with some of the other reviews i've seen of this at 125 pages it simply feels too short just as it's revealed that the narrator is different from his brothers in a totally unexpected and dramatic way the book ends novellas are tricky since the economy of the form almost threatens a narrative from being truly satisfying to the reader in a way that a novel's can be ultimately i just wanted to know more about these characters especially the narrator but when i got to the end i felt like i'd only seen the tip of an unexplored iceberg","1342":"some really beautiful imagery","1343":"it felt like half the book was missing the skeleton of this book is great and interesting but the content is just not there it felt like an outline or sketch that never got filled in and i'm left with too many questions to really have any sense of what i just read which is a shame because the characters and the plot all seem like they would be great if it were more than a sketch","1344":"this book was rather good it took me just under 2 hours to read and it was captivating it was written in a beautiful way that really hooks you from the beginning so so honest yet still mysterious the ending was a little confusing and i had to go over the last page several times before i really understood i recommend this book to anyone it was beautiful dark haunting and thought provoking","1345":"great book one of the best i've read this year read it in a single sitting many sections felt like prose poetry can't wait for his next book","1346":"this book is beautifully written the first chapter is brilliant in my opinion at times it made me feel a little nauseated it's just that evocative at times i wanted to put it down or read it at a distance but ultimately had to finish it","1347":"i wanted to like it but so much of the book is spent in the narrator's early childhood that when the narrator starts to grow up it's as though he's lost steam and it just ends abruptly with no real sense of closure however the writing is raw and authentic and i'd be interested in reading more by mr torres in the future","1348":" this thin book reads less like a novel than it does a prose poem a bit disjointed and chopped but lyrical overall i appreciate the exploration of language the writer attempts the way he poetically and succinctly presents scenes and characters but the one interesting thing i found about this book is how it felt as if it suddenly changed from a novel to an autobiography of course this is speculation on my part but when the main character reaches adulthood the entire tone of the story seemed to morph into another animal altogether it had less a feeling of fiction and more that of a memoir honestly it was jarring it became at that point less likable somehow an objectivity was violated an initial trust between the writer and his reader was broken still i would mildly recommend we the animals to anyone who appreciates an adventurous use of language and story telling it's unconventional and worth a look","1349":"us breathless","1350":"this novel just swept me along full of energy and brio like the boys it features it starts we wanted more we knocked the butt ends of our forks against the table tapped our spoons against our empty bowls we were hungry we wanted more volume more riots we turned up the knob on the tv until our ears ached with the shouts of angry men we wanted more music on the radio we wanted beats we wanted rock we wanted muscles on our skinny arms we had bird bones hollow and light and we wanted more density more weight we were six snatching hands six stomping feet we were brothers boys three little kings locked in a feud for more and continues in the same vein until it ends as you can see it is written in the first person plural and most of the book is like that until towards the end when it moves to first person singular as the protagonist becomes an adult and is clearly differentiated from his brothers depicting violent but loving parents view spoiler not so loving at the end hide spoiler and the usual boy adolescent shenanigans digging trenches fighting watching porn etc the reader this one anyway likes the family then doesn't then likes again both the adults and children are mixed up needy people poor desperate at times the mother had all three boys in her teens which explains her immaturity eg how she joins in the games the children play you root for them all even when the boys smash windows intimidate neighbours or the father goes mad he beat manny bad punched his face punched his crotch the writing never veers from its poetic rush rhythmic and commanding it's funny and true it's also brutal and exhausting luckily it's short others on gr have complained about the episodic nature of the book they have a point and the end which maybe has a tacked on feel but i was happy with it obviously a coda it even has a different style of chapter heading and i feel the dramatic development is signalled sufficiently go back and read it again being sexist for a minute i'm very pleased i had two girls and not three boys","1351":"inter related stories that really reminded me of hanna pylvainen's we sinners great prose","1352":"sweet and powerful","1353":"didn't expect to love this short little book so much it's rare to find prose that is both poetic and completely readable and this was both very memorable and unique style","1354":"i wasn't sure if i liked this one it was a quick easy read and i wanted to know what was going to happen by the time i got to the end i was gladid read it it was thought provoking and really made me think","1355":"one word review rawthis story gave me deja vu and it turned out to be true i saw these stegner fellow shorts at stanford a few years ago and it turns out that this book was one of the stories adapted for the stage the stories are crazy heartwrenching and painful sweet with tender moments and the writing is excellent they aren't for everyone since it's the opposite of mainstream and some are difficult to read but it's amazing what torres packs into such few pages","1356":"very short but very good little snippets about three boys growing up in poverty","1357":"lyrically beautiful honest dark disturbing and passionate story of three neglected brothers growing up feral look for more from this author fine fine writing","1358":"torres has no trouble kicking out some beautiful sentences but there were moments in each chapter that felt portentous yet ended abruptly sections intended to be weighty and insightful were quick visceral observations often left as a metaphor those metaphors also bore some reflection on identity focused around family sexuality religion for example regarding religious influences good and bad many images are left static and orphaned and don't seem to be developed a deeply binary view of masculinity and femininity is presented without apology but i wanted a more considered exploration of experience to understand the origin of the characters' responses instead some sections come off as hard edged with loud protests about gender i wanted to know more","1359":"although it's labeled as a novel on the front cover it's more like a collection of related short stories that link up more towards the end of the short book a fast read but a heartbreaking one as well","1360":"great book about three brothers growing up in poverty in up state ny these vignettes show a harsh life of neglect and survival what i liked most was the picture of the parents who had a strong love for each other and their boys the last section of the book was alittle confusing as the author reveals a secret about himself i would have preferred an addional vignette or two to see how the boy and his family comes to terms with that revelation","1361":"the writing was amazing and his description of growing up in a dysfunctional household was riveting furthermore the characterization of his relationship with his brothers was not only raw but so well written that it was both uncomfortable and satisfying at the same time","1362":"poetic and heartbreaking","1363":"poetic languagevignette style snapshots of moments think house on mango street rings truedarksudden turnlacking resolutionfiction memoir fictionalized memoir","1364":" this was not my favorite i felt that the narrative was disjointed and that the ending was so abrupt it disturbed any sense of story that had been developing it felt more like a loosely connected short story collection than a novel the individual vignettes were executed with varying levels of skill the opening vignette being the strongest on the positive side there is great use of imagery torres does a great job of painting very vivid pictures of abused neglected children trying to navigate their lives his use of language is beautiful but ultimately that couldn't make up for the flaws in story construction for me","1365":"i discovered this book on npr and i knew i had to read it at first i was more drawn to a story about coming out but as you say it really turns out to be more than that we don't even get any whiff of that until much much later in the story and even then it's handled almost quietly still hiding in plain sight the dysfunctional family a family raw with so much animalistic instincts to survive those are what got me hardest it really is eye opening the hopelessness and the hole that they live in particularly the abused mother in a piece for the millions another literary blog jt recommended another book if you knew then what i know now an essay collection by ryan van meter that i have been yearning for some time to be able to have the leisure time to read also jt has a new yorker piece a love story seemingly told in reverse chronology definitely worth checking out if you're a fan i forget the title but i am sure you could easily find it source http ksfyim tumblr com","1366":"worst book i've read this year the whole book felt like a daytime soap opera that would get cancelled after the first episode aired i only finished the book because i refuse to leave a book half read","1367":"this book was very mfa thesis to me and read more like a collection of short stories than a novel the final story er chapter was the only one that moved me beyond the pretty language and i felt like that's where he was trying to go for the entire book and yes he got there but without the support of the rest of the narrative","1368":"worth the hour it will take to start and finish very well written and captivating kind of strange ending but that's ok","1369":"superb writing disturbing story and vivid characters it's one flaw in my opinion was the way the very last part of the book seemed to be almost a different story but perhaps i was supposed to be affected in that jarring rough way as this was how these boys lived their lives","1370":" 4 5 starsi really loved this book and it was on its way to becoming a favourite five star book that i would rave about for days on end but unfortunately the end brought the entire book down torres changed the direction of the story too abruptly and too late it felt to me at least in the story the end didn't have the same flow that the beginning had and the individual chapters did not seem as if they could stand on their own as the first chapters could have being individual stories that together told the story of these three brothers despite the ending i still really loved the book for the most part and may still go back and re read it at some time overall a really good book that unfortunately fell a little short at the end","1371":"came highly recommended i don't understand why","1372":" haunting thought provoking beautiful nostalgic and deeply poetic all at the same time you don't know what to think while reading this all you can do is follow along and wonder and hope for the actions of these three boys very surprising and disturbing and saddening and hilariously heart warming at certain points the first fiction book i've given five stars in a long long time on a side note what pulled me in was the fun cover handsome author and title that sounded like an indie rock band also i think page 85 explains the book cover","1373":"read this for bookclub it is beautifully written lots of imagery and metaphor","1374":" the opening line is we wanted more this is a coming of age story focused on three brothers growing up in upstate new york it is narrated by the youngest boy their parents married as teenagers and struggle to make do paps is a frequently out of work alcoholic ma toils long hours on the graveyard shift and occasionally sinks into depression left largely to fend for themselves the boys grow up as wild animals in various scenes they are rambunctious energetic tender seeking adventure neglected abused hungry confused and lonely and always they want more food attention love security torres writes with a unique prose poetry style that packs a powerful punch sentences and phrases tumble over one another as three boys at play will do - each demanding all your attention until the next comes along and does the same thing it's raw and compelling there were times when i gasped aloud and times when i chuckled at the boys' mischievous antics however ... at about page 100 of 125 pages the novel takes a very dark turn i felt completely sucker punched by the descriptions of the narrator's awakening sexuality the language is graphic and violent the choppy short sentences that moved the story forward for the first 100 pages were completely inadequate to explain what was happening in the characters' lives having pictured the boys as somewhere between 8 12 years old i'm suddenly confronted with scenes that must involve 15 17 year olds or i sure hope so though even that is young i felt completely disconnected from the story at that point and re read the last 15 or so pages twice to ensure i hadn't somehow missed something torres is clearly talented but the hole he left in this work is a huge disappointment i give the book 3 in recognition of the emotional impact especially in the first 100 pages warning readers averse to crude language or reading about homosexuality might want to avoid this book","1375":"a language of muscle and elbowsa fleshy torrent of rude raw masculinity blinkered self awareness family circumstance as fist and inside the fist one alien vulnerable child grows conscious of himself as unlike the rest torres invents a sthenic guttural prose the narrative holds its breath and hurdles forward","1376":"review to come","1377":"beautiful and devastating","1378":" this is a story of three brothers of mixed race and their family which is written in a dark funny and lyrical way it tells about their fears joys and sadness as they are growing up in an impoverished brooklyn neighbourhood the story just grabs you from the beginning and while you are still devouring it it comes to an end rather quickly there is a time jump before you reach the end and it is the only low point of an otherwise great book you want to know more about the brothers and how they are coming to terms with the world around them the incidents of their childhood made an instant connection with me the stories are strange and sometimes violent but they are truly endearing","1379":"this is an excellent heartbreaking book there were times i got lost in the story and missed the poetic beauty of the book and other times i got lost in the poetry and missed the story but it kept me interested and moved the entire way through so many scenes and lines will stay with me for a long long time perhaps especially as a mother of my own 6 1 2 year old boy and then i was seven","1380":"i wrote a review and it was awesome and it got erased notice i take no personal responsibility for the erasing it said stuff about each chapter being a fully fleshed out short story about how i want to buy it for every reader i know but don't get excited because i didn't actually say i was going to do that just that i want to it also had a great quote from the book about the dad peeing it would've made you want to read the book do it","1381":"i should wait a bit before reviewing and rating a book after giving a bit more thought and reflection this really goes down to a 1 star it lacked any real flow and the writing style was fairly bland the topics seemed to be written as an attempt at achieving a shock value","1382":"a painful book powerfully written","1383":"i'll admit i was obsessed with torres after i read his story in a recent new yorker on a plane reverting to a wild state not only was it unusually structured backwards destructing chronologically western time and tossing one off in the face of it by his subversive love and even more subversive paid affair well it was everything i want to read in the new yorker and rarely do naughty squirmy and brutal so i snatched up his book we the animals for my commute to new orleans i wanted more it's a one hundred twenty paged treat fresh and witty without being showy the first person inclusive where we becomes i allowed me to feel the author's identity merging with his brothers his characters were wicked and strange and painfully human his mother was dizzy and exhausted a wonderful sad character it was joyful sad and delightful i would have read another one hundred twenty pages from torres about his father and brothers","1384":"i am looking forward to reading more from mr torres","1385":"wow gripping little book listened to it on audio and it was amazing","1386":"this book wasn't what i was expecting i thought a novel i found a bunch of short stories about the same people i liked it i liked it a lot","1387":"i'd give it 3 5 stars if i could it short its vivid and strong the last chapter or so with the main character growing up took a bit of a left turn for me i guess it's supposed to but it didn't feel like it fit with the first 90% of the book's narrative worth reading","1388":" it is not an easy book to review i read and reread the final chapters twice and still couldn't get my head around it i didn't understand what exactly happened there the book ended abruptly after that because of this abrupt obscure ending i gave it the lowest rate it feels unfinished in fact the whole book is a collection of ramblings and strange acts as if you ask a small child to tell what happened last summer another thing that bothers me a lot about this book is the sheer stupidity of the adults in this book this is not angela ashes the events take place in the late seventies eighties in the us yet these people never heard of birth control 3 kids at such a young age and no income to support them for all the horror of the neglect and abuse this family suffers i felt no empathy just sheer rage rage at the people who raised them who allowed their children to have children at 14","1389":" i was severely disappointed in this book it was lauded by the vast majority of the publishing industry thus i figured i'd be doing myself a disservice by not reading it it came together as something akin to a short story collection a novella of short scenes tenuously connected and switching in the preferred pronoun in a way i found jarring as to the story itself i wonder if perhaps as someone who cannot particularly identify with the narrator much of the impact is lost on me i am not nearly as articulate in my ability to review books as most i prefer brevity to encyclopedic breakdowns so please reference this review for my points in a much more succinct intelligent manner http www goodreads com review show","1390":"i read this slim book in a little over a day it's slim like poetry is slim fierce fiery compact three brothers born to teenaged parents run somewhat wild in a hardscrabble town in upstate new york the narrator is often we testimony to the close almost soldierly closeness of the boys but breaks out more and more into an i narrator as the youngest child ages with one hispanic and one white parent the boys don't belong much of anywhere except in each other's arms literally there is a lot of fighting and wrestling here the first steps the i narrator takes away from this family of origin are heartbreaking the evocation of very complicated violent loving parents and of the pleasures and pains of the body in childhood are astonishing","1391":"heartbreakingly sad and beautifully written in hindsight probably not the best book to read at the holidays but the prose is stunning and you just keep wishing for happiness for these characters i did see parallels between it and the house on mango st which i read earlier this year it might have been interesting to read them side by side as in some ways this felt like the evolution from cisnero's novel","1392":"ugh from the back cover 'we the animals' snatches the reader by the scruff of the heart tight as teeth and shakes back and forth between the human and the animal the housed and the feral love and violence mercy and wrath and leaves him in the wilderness ravished by its beauty paul hardingshaken is right shaken to my core i do not recommend this read but i will not forget it does that mean i liked it fantastic writing is not always what i want from a book especially when the images it produces stick so solidly prominently in the mind","1393":"i really don't know what to say about this book it was a journey for sure very cultural and interesting sad and upbeat all at once","1394":" we the animals resembles no other book i've read it is written in magical language with unforgettable images one of my favorite authors dorothy allison said some books quicken your pulse some slow it some burn you inside and send you tearing off to find the author to see who made this thing that can so burn you and quicken you and slow you all at the same time a miracle in concentrated pages you are going to read it again and again and know exactly what i mean we the animals is the story of three young brothers of parents who entered parenthood as teenagers the mother gave birth at ages 14 15 and 17 the mother works the graveyard shift at a brewery and the father works when he can this is a saga of kids ages 7 9 and 10 growing up in poverty with parents who were probably never ready to be parents what happens to this family in this sparse book will stay with me for a long time","1395":"smacks of an autobiography incredibly well written prose is sparse and shocking torres is someone to watch","1396":"goodreads asks what did you think i'm thinking","1397":"great prose and imagery weak on plot development update after attending a book club with justin torres he says he never intended a conventional narrative arc and meant it as a poetic collection of short stories","1398":" this book is incredible it follows the life of three mixed white and puerto rican brothers living with their fragile and adoring mother and their rough but caring father the story progresses and matures along with the three boys eventually focusing more on the protagonist through the short stories you experience the life of this family you feel included in the good the bad the touching the cringe inducing you're pulled along as they grow up and change in their own ways when it ends it comes together and it's like a window into the growing up of a real family amazing","1399":"a quick read that is going to stay with me for a long time emotional and powerful and beautiful","1400":"some writers like annie baker or george saunders or mary oliver create work of such deep empathy that you want to seek them out and thank them i put torres and this book in that category","1401":"torres's writing is lyrical and haunting but we the animals failed to fully mesh together for me in particular the last few chapters of the book deviate quite a bit from the rest both chronologically and thematically or maybe the whole interlinked stories thing is just not my cup of tea","1402":"still unsure about this book loved the imagery but i guess in regards to content and plot i wasn't thrilled","1403":"http thedianerehmshow org shows 201 link to npr interview and also first chapter of book","1404":"enjoying this tremendously","1405":" i used to believe we could escape he whispered i had it all figured out like when we were in the field today i was sure that god would grab hold of those kites and lift us up protect us he took my chin and turned my face toward his but now i know he said god's scattered all the clean among the dirty you and me and joel we're nothing more than a fistful of seed that god tossed into the mud and horseshit we're on our own he wrapped one arm and one leg around me and was silent and still for a stretch of time and i drifted into sleep after a while manny started up again talking to himself plotting saying what we gotta do is we gotta figure out a way to reverse gravity so that we all fall upward through the clouds and sky all the way to heaven and as he said the words the picture formed in my mind my brothers and me flailing our arms rising the world telescoping away falling up past the stars through space and blackness floating upward until we were safe as seed wrapped up in the fist of god we the animals is a short little novel just over a hundred pages and you can read it in a couple of hours if you find the time you should because even though the book's not perfect it's damn near close when i finished it i realized that this book was the reason why i read","1406":"can't say i enjoyed the book because it was so dark but we'll written thought provoking and heartfelt","1407":"this wisp of a book holds as much tenderness and innocence as the terrific room by emma donoghue interconnected vignettes tell a tale of love family disappointment abuse and abandonment lyrically rich and beautifully conceived i can't wait to read more from mr torres","1408":"i finished this book a few days ago and i'm still not sure how i feel about it the writing is very good and some of the scenes have stayed with me but i think i may have to read it again we the animals is a short book i think it's shocking in it's sadness and violence","1409":"read this it is uncomfortable and upsetting but very well written and compelling","1410":" i was in bowling green this week and had a few hours to spend in barnes u0026amp noble so i grabbed a copy of this book and found a chair in a corner there's been a lot of hype surrounding this book and i wanted to check it out because torres is one of the authors who will be attending the southern festival of books in october in nashville i was curious if his session was one i wanted to attend the writing is what i expected it's edgy and lyrical and torres' voice is consistent and distinctive when i say it is what i expected i mean that usually books like this that get the buzz have a more modern literary even urban feel maybe i'm generalizing too much and incorrectly but that was my expectation and it was accurate i think the novel is autobiographical in feel though i don't know enough about torres to know just how autobiographical it is it kind of reminded me a bit of the brief wondrous life of oscar wao in terms of the immersion into a puerto rican family and coming of age but there are a lot of differences as well there's a nice movement from the close knit band of brothers to a division between one brother and his family by the end of the book though that's the thing that bothers me most of all too it's not that i was disturbed by the content or the development of particular events it's that i felt they were so abrupt and jarring to the story that had been developing and once those things happened everything just ended i would've been so much happier with another 100 pages to be able to see what happened with the main character and his family and how their tribe continued or didn't","1411":"pretty amazing book of short stories read it in a night ready for more from this author","1412":"an oprah kind of book story about three closely knit brothers their adventures in a home with an abusive puerto rican father and a white mother quick read sad story","1413":"i found this book to be quite overrated it came storming out with an overabundance of praise so i waited a few years before reading it didn't matter while the writing is actually quite lovely the story is kind of forgettable and dare i say cliche where it wants to be unique don't get me wrong it is a good debut and delivers some beautiful sentences torres is a writer to watch for sure it was just not as sensational as the lavish praise it received on release","1414":"go read this right now","1415":"this book has received a lot of praise it is very stylized writing and very beautifully written i'm not sure if i liked it or loved it","1416":"in the beginning it is easy to question do i really want to readthis in the end the same reasons maktthat cause discomfort make you glad you did it is easy to be abhorred when looking at abusive situations from the outsidesituations fromfrom the outside this author brings you in so that you understand the normal of it and the rhythms","1417":"nine tenths of this book is great but the ending was a huge shoehorned let down","1418":"i heard good things about this book and was truly disappointed half of the time the book made no sense and jumped around the premise of the book was view spoiler a white woman marries a puerto rican man and he beats on his kids and his wife and at the end of the book the son is gay and the father is bathing him hide spoiler very weird book sorry i just didn't get it","1419":" justin torres's novel we the animals incites a nostalgic familiarity of loss of innocence and teenage angst although described as a novel its structure content and lack of plot resembles the book as more of a memoir than anything else in order for the book to have a plot there must be a dramatic question that is brought up near the start of the book and a climax that answers said question toward the end instead of bringing up a solid plot question the book acts as a collection of polaroid snapshot memories strung together by a series of interconnected themes these themes serve as the heavy hitter for the story as we are drawn emotionally by the subject matter and overall tone mood of the novel or memoir thus the structure of the entire book becomes skewed and can only be interpreted a personal interpretation is that the book follows a wheel structure the themes that are repeatedly interjected in the novel lies on the outside of the circle as our central character resides in the center as each theme connects with him with various spokes resembling the life events this then becomes an excellent recount of one's life through the many patterns of themes that he himself has witnessed all in all i found the content to be extremely riveting and addicting but one must accept that this isn't a book that's written typically","1420":"at just over 125 pages it didn't take me long to get through this book but what the book lacks in length is made up for in substance i felt like i was reading a book that should be discussed in a classroom for its literary excellence i bet if i read it again i'd see even more in it i was surprised by where the book ended up but not disappointed the author's descriptions put me right in on the action for good or bad","1421":"poetic dark thought provoking deep this novella is ugly and beautiful brave u0026amp experimental like the use of language and reoccurring motifs","1422":"just read really short seems like it needed to be longer to really draw me in","1423":"when it comes to things that have a price tag attached literature being no exception there are certain trends that come and go in commercial fiction this trend might be vampires one day and zombies the other in \"real fiction\" some people might call it literary fiction there's the trend of the autobiographical novel part fiction part truth these novels appeal to most of the best young novels out there we the animals is no exception i found out about justin torres's debut novel after i read a short story of his in the new yorker it was good enough for me to search for more of his writing and i found out that he had only one novel published we the animals which in terms of length stands at a meager 125 pages makes for a very quick and easy read but not meaningless dealing with the early childhood of three porto rican brothers the novel is layered out in a pattern of scenes all of them adding a bit more color and depth to the story itself scenes that are perfectly endearing on their own short chapters that paint a vivid picture of a perfectly naive childhood eager and ambitious the three brothers are locked in a sort of perilous and strange quest to understand the world around them their methods sometimes unconventional or clumsy sometimes getting the brothers into trouble make this novel so great i wouldn't call it a bildungsroman but it's indeed a tale of discovery maybe even self discovery as the narrator deals with the fact of being inherently different both from his two older brothers and his own parents it's not his evolution across the pages that makes this story endearing but his own sudden realization of his nature human nature is reduced to a tale of trying to figure out who we are as soon as possible and it strikes a particular truth within the confines of the narrative itself and the life of the reader because we all want to find out who we are and what we're supposed to do depending on how long it takes us to figure that out our life takes a different course this novel would be worth reading for just one scene the one in which the boys are dancing with their father it's such a haunting and wonderful scene a truly superlative chapter the boys are having fun with their father but at the same time they're confronted with a sort of identity crisis what they are they being of mixed race is different from their father and he does his best to show them that they're neither white nor porto rican they're not rich and they're not poor they're just boys who want to understand the world around them before it's too late as the opening sentence goes \"we wanted more \"","1424":"good short book i loved the first 85% then the last part was a bit of a let down still a good novella","1425":"crazy family i enjoyed the read","1426":"the prose was lovely and the book kind of reminded me of douglas coupland's life after god but the ending just did not work for me","1427":"i have a bias toward this writing style sparse yet with a strong voice so i enjoyed the first few chapters immensely but my enthusiasm began to wain as i got further in mostly because of the lack of progression in any of the characters and repetitive themes this might of worked better as a collection of short stories rather than a memoir novel","1428":"a bit uneven with a rapid conclusion at the end","1429":"i loved the writing however the plot was somewhat predicable i wish i had not been able to predict the ending half way through the book","1430":"an evocative examination of family and identity troubling at times but definitely thought provoking","1431":"i enjoyed this more than i expected to lately i have such a hard time appreciating anything with even the slightest amount of mainstream attention so i was expecting to lump this one in with the rest of the middle of the road so so attempts at bold contemporary fiction at first i thought i was simply enjoying a personal connection with it i'm a parent of two boys who are far less animalistic than the three here but something about them still resonated with me but as the book went on i was struck by the power of torres's magical despairing prose this is definitely a writer's novel as it's the language and cohesion that weld the story together","1432":"i could not put this book down for the beautiful writing and riveting storytelling the ending blew me away fast and hardhitting makes you think","1433":"literature is great so many amazing analogies and aphorisms read for school great writing creepy story quick read would recommend but don't prioritize","1434":"a friend gave this to me as a book she loved it is a very short book but was very hard for me to read because i don't do well with childhood neglect and abuse and this book contains a lot of both it's very well written for what it's worth","1435":" if this had been written as a short story instead of a novel i would be giving it 5 stars as a character study it's wonderful and beautifully depicts the breaking lives at its center however at many points in the narrative it promises to push beyond a portrait and engage the reader with a plot which it fails to do this tug of war with my expectations made me resent the rather good ending because i felt it had gone to the point where it could open out and instead firmly stays in one place","1436":"really","1437":"this felt a little over written at times but still made me wish for a full length novel","1438":"a brisk read never wanted to put it down wonderful vibrant writing","1439":"well written and very thoughtful i think the plot twist at the end came too close to the end though i closed the book feeling confused and sort of annoyed","1440":"this book was wonderfully written but very unsettling i liked it but at the same time i left it feeling an emptiness","1441":"torres writes beautifully i quite liked how he made the ordinary moments of growing up with 2 brothers book worthy however i think there was a disconnect between the rest of his book and the last three chapters","1442":"sad and painful to read some early sections are captivating particularly the prose describing the mother the book loses coherence in the middle and i became uninterested in the writer's last few chapters these chapters seem contrived to shock and i just felt irritated the last couple of chapters were also choppy and at the end i just wanted to physically remove the book from my presence","1443":"this little book is a firecracker it manages to be both funny and heartbreaking familiar and surprising it will make you long for childhood and glad never to have to experience it again torres writes well in a wide variety of styles really demonstrating his chops certainly a young writer to watch","1444":"this was beautiful i read it an hour but i never wanted it to end","1445":"very well written and worth the read loved the fact that torres allowed readers to explore the spaces between the words rather than filling it with the dribble that most pub houses require to build word count","1446":"beautifully written some passages read almost like poetry but desperately almost overwhelmingly sad","1447":"good writing and i got halfway through in about 30 minutes but not too interested in a depressing story about an abusive father","1448":"really great novel although reading while in the gym is not the best loved the imagery and his use of language","1449":"a short addicting post modern read vanity fair was absolutely right in describing it as a gorgeous howling coming of age novel that will devour your heart","1450":"a novella that shows loads of potential but feels at the end unsatisfying and insubstantial the prose is the saving grace of the text torres has an amazing authorial voice that he wields with beauty it is the narrative of the text that does not live up to the quality of the writing","1451":"through telling scenes depicted using simple yet mesmerizing language torres makes it easy to visualize life growing up in the story's dysfunctional sometimes entertaining sometimes heartbreaking family i was constantly impressed by how well he captured the innocence and spirit of childhood","1452":"prose that'll make you swoon","1453":"one of the best books i've read in a while beautifully written story with a unique voice and a powerful perspective the narrator grows up with a lot of family and personal trauma the story is told in short chapters like flash fiction everything is compressed and so much is said between the lines and between sections so much is said in what is not said really killer","1454":"i really wanted to love this book there was something a little strange and removed about it that i liked at first but weirded me out pretty fast the author was definitely on the edge of somthing big but didn't make that final leap instead screwing up the story with way too late and very distubing deatils when i got to the end i paged through again to make sure i hadn't accidentally skiped over the 30 or so more pages this story cold have used not that i would want to read them it seemed to me that by withholding such facts as the narrator's name and age the author was trying to be mysterious in an overly flamboyant way he dropped in all kinds of random moments that confused me even more like the mother being kissed by a female coworker all kinds of roads were started but never explored this book really cold have been great and there is someting to be said for the writing the ending felt out of place though as if someone had picked up the last pages from a differnt novel and filled it in i'm not sure if everything leading up was suppoed to show us why this happened to the narrator but either way it failed over all very disappointing and unrealistic","1455":"maybe 2 5 stars some of it was compelling some things were off esp toward the end","1456":"~amazon best of 2011","1457":" a lot of buzz has been surrounding justin torres' super short novel okay novella we the animals and looking at goodreads it seemed people either loved it or hated it because it weighs in at only 125 pages i figured the risk of wasting my time on it was pretty low but in the end i didn't need to be worried the book reads a lot like a series of short stories the narrator and his brothers are \"mutts\" living with their white mother and puerto rican father in new york together they wreak havoc on a local farmer's crops fly kites made of trash bags and just generally be boys \"we fought with boots and garage tools snapping pliers--we grabbed at whatever was nearest and we hurled it through the air we wanted more broken dishes more shattered glass we wanted more crashes \" theirs is a dysfunctional family to be sure but it's all the boys know and they are shaped by it sometimes paps leaves for long periods and sometimes he hits ma many of the scenes involve the boys watching the interaction between their parents whether fighting over a large purchase or making out against the bathroom sink but what happens when they're exposed to the world outside their small home and what are the consequences this book feels very honest and more personal than i'm used to fiction being i don't know if its truly fiction or part memoir but it read like the latter the writing is what really makes this a book worth reading as it is so descriptive and eloquent \"we made kites trash bags on strings we ran slipped the knees of our dungarees all grass stained we got up ran choked ourselves half to death with laughter but we found speed and our trash kites soared we flew for an hour or so until daylight fully buried itself into night and all the light sank back except for stars and a toenail clipping of moon and the kites disappeared black on blackness that's when we let go and our trash kites really soared--up and away heavenward like prayers our hearts chasing after \"no the book didn't completely knock me off my feet but it is certainly impressive nonetheless i finished it more than a week ago and it's taken this long for me to gather enough coherent thoughts to write about it it's one of those books that linger will with you that you will recall after seeing something that relates to it in some small way it's deserving of the praise it's received http boookish tumblr com post 10347084547","1458":"decent writer apparently some folks think a may ziiing i however have a few complaints such as the variability of the voice throughout oh well my chief complaint however was personal this is a dark book that moves from dark to oh my dark to cringing dark it was my second book in a row that abuse of children at some level was not only present but palpable often the nebulous 'darkness' in stories has some redemptive level no redemption here nada just couldn't stomach it well this time around","1459":"must read here's an essay i wrote that includes we the animals http www washingtonindependentrevie","1460":"elements of the anyalyst's couch and writer's workshops are distilled into variations on the term feral i liked the prose the hidden meaning of those darkened events from a child's perspective i didn't appreciate the concluding chapters much as i didn't those of lampedusa's the leopard there is no need for a teleolgy within such vehicles there is quite a future for this novelist","1461":" writing 101 teaches writers to show not tell the author of this book would get an a the book gives us vignettes of events in the narrator's life often tragic mostly dramatic always imaginatively rendered each sketch contains layers of meaning built with symbols and other literary devices the deft change in the penultimate chapter from first person to third person narration is the appropriate tool to convey the youngest brother's funereal dissociation the last chapter soars to metaphorical heights writing workshops for aspiring novelists would love to analyze this well executed etude of a book alas i can barely scratch beyond the superficial layer of meaning i could have worked harder to understand more had i cared more i was impressed with the author's writing skill but was not moved by the story boy had a tough life boy experienced an epiphanic reveal boy followed his nature etc underneath the verbal razzle dazzle the author still cannot animate the proverbial dead horse of a trite coming of age tale","1462":"this book upsets me actually it makes me quite furious this novel is a debut for the author and received a tonnage of praise but it's very run of the mill first off it's short in my ipad it was 102 pages and i was able to finish it within two hours while the length of the book is not the most important factor it does mean it better be compact and explosive this it is not the book is about 3 brothers each separated by a year exceptionally close and poor the dad is puerto rican and the mother is white they married young had the kids young and the family life is chaotic dad beats the wife drinks philanders and disappears on the family the wife takes the beatings and is clingy to the husband and treasures the good times while forgetting the bad the kids are extremely close and fend for themselves the prose is banal the writing is dripping with sentimentality and it's cloying torres is saying pity us sympathize empathize and all i want to do is get to the end the only redemptive portion is the final chapter the kids grow up and the youngest who is the narrator separates from the two oldest while the oldest are rough and tumble young men who are like their father the youngest is a good student shy and gay the ending is poignant like the rest of the book but at least the one dimensional characters that i've been reading for the last 100 pages finally start to separate a little take up some identity it's not a terrible book my main gripe is it doesn't deserve all this praise he's featured in the new yorker received grants and fellowships nominations to tons of best young authors lists for what for this 2 hour snooze that i'll forget quicker than what i had for lunch what a waste","1463":"ah poetry torres is another graduate of the iowa writer's workshop and like everyone else i've read that's associated with that place his writing is amazing and again like some of his iowa friends marilynne robinson paul harding his narrative structure is really loose perhaps too loose","1464":"$10 for 88 pages many of which are mostly blank as they come at the end of a chapter i wish i had known it was so short i wish booksellers and publishers would charge less for e media i wish my local library would have a larger selection of e media none of that has anything to do with this book so i'll just move on and say that by the time i was half way through this i wasn't mad anymore it's not a novel and even novella is a stretch for me i think at first i was irked that i paid $10 for 88 pages many of which are mostly blank as they come at the end of a chapter i wish i had known it was so short i wish booksellers and publishers would charge less for e media i wish my local library would have a larger selection of e media none of that has anything to do with this book so i'll just move on and say that by the time i was half way through this i wasn't mad anymore it's not a novel and even novella is a stretch for me i think it's more poetry than anything beautiful evocative poetry the words flow more like music than narration i enjoyed it but i wouldn't pay $10 for it again","1465":" as i started the book i was wondering if this was written for ya and see cuss words used so loosely and then reading first few pages how old are the children to use such language without any percussion then the father yells mutts because they are neither white nor puerto rican or such but i found it as a slavic term which i prefer not to be called being multicultural or multiracial i have spanish blood in my veins not puerto rican per se but found this not amusing we've never used this term in my home and i remember in college when i had to read different types of literature and came across this term i had to ask another mixed friend what does it mean she told me that it came from slavery white and black blood was called a mutt it sounds like a 'dog' to me that is lazy and unworthy i was advised in the reading group to get at least midway to the end to see a more enjoyable reading but so far not impressed and not sure what is the morale of this story or message to get across i am also trying to understand the author's tone which seems like melodrama racist slurs of being as 'animals' and if it ties to their well being and race as a whole and financial burdens with physical abuse verbal abuse from paps to ma and with his children i hope this is not in ya sections of the libraries or bookstores since i wouldn't want my future children or niece nephew reading this literature at all reading this book soon for lfpc online book club for the month of december 2011 thank goodness i got this at the library $18 for 128 pages with acknowledgment copy i have no way jose","1466":"powerful and fast paced this book grabs you and smacks you around there are a lot of folks who agree with me but this book has also gotten a lot of bad reviews it is polarizing and i understand how it wouldn't work for everyone but i thought it was great","1467":"beautiful and dark at the same time many of the chapters read like poetry the development of the loving and hateful brothers and the seriously f'd up parents made me fall in love with this wacky and loving family","1468":"3 5 stars this book was so beautifully written but i felt like the story was lacking","1469":"this story made my heart hurt beautifully","1470":"very dark well written","1471":"fantastically lyrical fast paced enjoyable read for anyone with brothers those that are brothers to brothers and those sisters that always wanted to understand the animal bond","1472":"a beautiful story that is both deep and haunting","1473":"fave short story collection so far this year so perfectly does it capture the precocious preciousness of boyhood brotherhood u0026amp the trials of youth via vignettes shorty stories in miniature and yes the young author happens to be a bit of a hottie but i didn't look at the photo til i finished the book my conscience remains clear","1474":" definitely an interesting different read the story follows three brothers through their difficult oftentimes violent childhood the main character is a little softer than his older siblings a little less angry and animalistic so he was a good lens through which to view the story but the ending becomes all his how he grows up how the violence impacts him and what it's like to be separated from his tribe as he puts it i appreciated the way justin torres dealt with themes like abuse poverty and familial struggles without making any one character come off as the bad guy you understand that the members of this family love one another deeply even as they threaten to destroy each other i also thought it was interesting the way the narration starts off in the beginning as mostly first person plural we do this we do that and over the course of the story it evolves into an i it was well written and engaging with small perfect details that almost made it feel like a memoir at times rather than a novel so kudos to torres for getting the little details spot on","1475":"where to start with this fantastic novel i finished in about a half an hour because i just couldn't put it down the story of this young boy growing up with two other brothers manny and joel both older just shows what can happen to the youngest the hardships and plot twist at the end are magnificent thank you mr torres for this wonderful piece of art","1476":"i'm not a fan of this fractured writing style i like my stories to flow","1477":"great novella about boys growing up with young parents","1478":"i really wanted to like this book but lately it's become too easy to spot the style of writers that emerge from the iowa writers' workshop though i'm sure there are exceptions the ones i've read tend to write about mundane things in curt prose that is supposed to read like swallowed emotions we are supposed to be left breathless because the author has chosen to inhale this might work if so many of iowa's authors weren't doing it this is fine but nothing new is happening here","1479":"excellent and evocative series of short chapters about a child's experience of family life the ending wasn't effective unfortunately i felt like there was a whole other story to explore there and the author kind of rushed through it wonderful heartbreaking storytelling otherwise","1480":"i'm not sure how to judge this book because everything hinges on the final chapters and i wasn't that impressed with the majority of the rest of the book however after reading the final chapters the whole of it is something beautiful and broken i'm just not sure i'll write a blog we'll see","1481":"when i heard about the premise of we the animals i was not terribly excited despite it getting glowing reviews from some folks whose taste i very much trust then i saw torres read a few selections and i was amazed the writing is really and truly brilliant kinetic poetic funny and affecting","1482":" i usually find something to commend on most every book i read some aspect that strikes the right note sadly this is one of two books i've read to completion in the past five years that was hailed and cooed by the titans of publishing that i thought was trash this unimpressive debut generated out of the gate praise because of politics a pretense of social importance the racial theme the gay theme as stereotypical as it is it is surprisingly anointed i have to wonder who is praising caucasians if there are any black or puerto rican readers that loved this book i'd love to hear from you the voice of the \"wide eyed\" narrator is twee and over precious self conscious to a point where it distracts and beseeches the audience to sympathize i kept hearing \"don't you just want to hug me look at how casually i present the facts \" there is no nuance to the text the narrator abrades with ongoing exposition telegraphing characteristics disallowing the reader to form any conclusions through the spaces between words the place where readers reside as pin thin as the characters are torres uses an insistency to grind in the message \"look at this poverty look how these kids persist despite their circumstances how utterly they play \"the prose paradoxically is workshopped to death overbaked yet undercooked flat and borrowed every phrase sentence passage is filled with cliches and shopworn images the prose like the characters and voice is derivative a copy and paste fulfillment that cloyingly coated my tongue with artificial grime this is an amateurish ya book but rated r the graphic parts are sure to elicit oohs and ahs but are gratuitous attempting the pretense of natural the text was dull and droned like a metronome without the peaks and valleys that subtle prose provides a weak story is not strengthened by exaggeration and melodrama it is difficult to specifically point out these problems and yet circumnavigate spoilers but torres fabricated medical law as a story contrivance i know the law and procedures and the laws at the time of this story the fact that vcrs were around even in poverty stricken sectors allows a rough time estimate he presented it as if it were the draconian laws of the 50's that was irresponsible it reduced this story from a 1 75 to a 1 25 i suspect torres is a one book wonder unless he refines his writing skills each chapter or vignette was repetitive i learned nothing new between page 29 and page 99 other than graphic shock value facts told without subtlety the denouement was simply un shocking and flaccid it felt like he was saying \"i'm edgy and unconventional and that makes it literature \" he was coy and gimmicky leaving out facts like dates and ages without purpose his disjointed integration was to synthetically sway rather than convey another artifice that undermined the work the finale read as if someone in the bookbinding department accidentally left out some pages and then the editors embraced its \"edginess \" reductive pointless not even emotionally evocative because he didn't create any atmosphere tone or texture what is this book about it's about 144 unoriginal pages","1483":"it really bothered me that they never stated the boy telling the story's name i noticed it midway through and i had a hard time moving forward without that information i also thought it strange that the entire book was in first person except for the second to last chapter titled dawn","1484":"really really loved the writing style and how well the author told the boys' story i kind of wish it had ended two chapters sooner and maybe just hinted at what was too come i think the writing style was better fitted to describing the children and it felt weird when applied to older people","1485":"a moving story at the same time sweet and heartbreaking","1486":"very powerful tale about reaching adulthood and struggling with ones sexuality highly recommended","1487":"best part on page 102 i was thinking how pretty you were he said now isn't that an odd thing for a father to think about his son but that's what it was i was standing there watching you dance and twirl and move like that and i was thinking to myself goddamn i got me a pretty one","1488":"from the first few pages i found myself muttering and drawn up short as i felt the visceral power of torres prose story and syntax punched constantly brief chapters present an episodic series of incidents anf moments that build and develop a rich sense of the rough exuberant life of the three boys and their parents plenty of it is raw but so much love and defiant vitality courses through their lives it's hard to put down wow quite the novel","1489":" a smart sharp slim and evocative read torres' short punchy chapters gripped me from the opening page and it was a joy to experience the all too brief glimpses of the life he so poetically recalls growing up as part of his family in upstate new york i agree with other readers that the novel's ending is somewhat strange and disappointing i don't so much mind the strange bit but i felt like not unlike the boys in the book i wanted more that i was just left hanging maybe that was the point nevertheless torres has got me intrigued and i'm keenly awaiting his next book","1490":"this is a relatively short book so it might seem pointless to say that i found myself unable to put the book down yet that is exactly what happened while i read almost continuously and i would were it possible i do not read fast so i was fully expecting to read through this over a couple days and several sittings instead i read it over night spending that i should have spent sleeping compulsively reading chapter after chapter the prose style torres uses is crisp light and literally at least for me infectious i tried several times to put this book down and go to bed but kept having the character's voice ringing through my head and seducing me back to read another chapter and then another until i finally just gave up and pushed on to finish the book torres offers a compelling unique and genuinely fascinating look at growing up in the us he uses prose to paint vivid images of an american family that is both channelling norman rockwell and simultaneously as far removed as one can get from that master of american visual iconography i was reminded of tobacco road and as i lay dying in how the author evokes american gothic and yet torres does not turn the novel's inhabitants into caricatures as happens in winesburg ohio a very very promising first novel and a hard act to follow","1491":"read this for a new pdx bookclub my friend started up great first pick short with beautiful writing is this a memoir seems suspiciously so the author wrote in a way that so well captured the memories of our childhoods precise detailed memories of separate not totally connected moments scattered throughout time that together make up a growing up each chapter pops not necessarily leading to another it also gave me an glimpse into how mean men are made the end happened so suddenly so sadly i enjoyed the book though it was paiful happy ending always just out of reach though it seemed so close and i wish i knew the main character's name","1492":" what i liked most about this book was that every time i picked it back up again i was immediately right back in the world that torres created the tone and atmosphere of the book is incredible unique oftentimes parts of the book confused me and i wasn't sure if i had read scenes correctly or wasn't sure even what i was supposed to be taking away from them perhaps that ambiguity was the point i liked the almost short story episodic feel of the narrative overall i found it to be well written stylish sad and atmospheric a solid read","1493":"incredibly powerful book disturbing in parts totally not the type of book i normally enjoy and am not sure that i would recommend it but it really was an incredible book written in short chapters that were so vivid i would have to stop sometimes in the middle of a chapter to catch my breath and calm my heart so i could focus in on what was happening in the book really an amazingly talented writer every word was perfectly chosen and absolutely necessary there was no fluff","1494":"this was a very quick read it was all about a family of three boys in a very volatile marriage it was a pretty good read although the last maybe 25 30 pages were completely out of the blue and contrasted the previous pages completely i didn't have a problem with the direction it went but it was so sudden and ended so quickly that i dont think the reader has tiem to digest deal with the situation before it's just over maybe that was the point by the author but i felt it could have been dealt with a little more better","1495":"quick and manic read about three brothers being raised in chaos title and cover design are brilliant chapters read as linked vignettes and the reveal was a bit over the top view spoiler vcrs are an 80s thing where as homosexuality as a mental disorder is a 50s thing no hide spoiler still glad i read it and not a bad way to spend a couple of hours","1496":"this review has been hidden because it contains spoilers to view it click here where do i even begin i picked this out scanning the back cover clueing in to a story of young wild brothers a little magical tale of childhood from a different perspective and culture from that of my own in a way i suppose it was however you can leave those expectations right there before even flipping through the pages the writer seemed to be all of the place and barely connected the dots from beginning to end if this was a synonom in itself as a homosexual half puerto rican male comin where do i even begin i picked this out scanning the back cover clueing in to a story of young wild brothers a little magical tale of childhood from a different perspective and culture from that of my own in a way i suppose it was however you can leave those expectations right there before even flipping through the pages the writer seemed to be all of the place and barely connected the dots from beginning to end if this was a synonom in itself as a homosexual half puerto rican male coming into his own then one can hang glow in the dark dental floss with chewing gum on the outside of ones home and call it christmas lighting did that makes sense didn't need to apparently the entire story line is at least consistent in it's own way until the last few sections where out of nowhere you're introduced to this whole new view of the protagonist there is an entire chunk of his life and personality that doesn't even play until these last moments is this supposed to be an eye opening view into the mind of how one is raised and cultivated into his own person was the homosexuality meant as a jaw dropping show stopper is this a map to show it doesn't matter your upbringing if you're gay your gay i could pardon the nonintentional pun here get behind that if nothing else one will likely have more questions after finishing the last pages than what one would begin with with a reluctant sigh i give you this horrible review due to utter confusion and disapproval of the total change in everything you thought you were reading let me side step here as well and note that just as we near the last pages our very young antogonist shoots up like a weed nearly tripling his age as stated through the rest of the book and missing huge plot points perhaps if we had the nonexistant pages to connect the dots a little better so many of of wouldn't be so slapsilly flummoxed justin torres you did get us talking that in itself may be brilliant two stars because i didn't hate it but it sure confused me more","1497":"very intense surreal in the telling of it but realistic in the emotions also funny i liked it","1498":"we the animals is a heartbreaking and violent story of family and brotherhood it appears to me more like a creative article than a work of fiction though very poetic simply because it is so tragically real it is so very real and i hate it for it dark raw and untamed but at the same time so innocently beautiful i will probably never read this book again not because it wasn't good but because it made me feel horrible it truly is a dark jewel it made me feel sick and shocked and sad and angry","1499":"we the animals is both beautiful and haunting a short work not lacking an emotional punch i read this in one day really one sitting and like a bad accident i could not look away i will probably re read this many times torres has crafted a poignant story and i look forward to more works of his in the future","1500":"the book told of an intense and vivid boyhood in a way that i experienced quite viscerally through the simple and effective writing","1501":"so you know how there are some books that don't follow the summary that is provided for them well this is one of those books i went searching for an explanation as to what this book was really about and well here's my version this is the story of three boys they grow up in some undisclosed upstate new york town raised by an overworked white mother u0026amp an abusive puerto rican father at times i couldn't help but feel this book bordered on racism with the way people were categorized by race the white trash headbanger the afro wearing puerto rican father the story is written from the point of view of the youngest brother who is seven he goes on rampages with his brothers destroying trees and vandalizing things they find other destructive ways to play throughout the book to make a long story short the book is basically about the youngest brother realizing he's gay and feeling cut off from his brothers so the beginning is basically a memoir of how they used to be close that's it in a nutshell the rest of it is just stuffing i gave it 3 stars because it was mildly entertaining but personally i don't think it was worth all the reviews and awards it received","1502":"this is a vivid and brutal book it is sparse sometimes in a way that sparks the reader's imagination i haven't read anything about the author's life but the book feels so real that i have to believe it is based on his experiences it was not what i expected when i started reading it but it did not disappoint difficult to shake in a good way","1503":"i put this book on my to read list because it was suggested by elizabeth crane a writer i love and respect on a podcast called literary disco i really didn't know what to expect only that i had no idea it would be so beautiful and wounding","1504":"boring","1505":"good fast summer read beautiful writing","1506":"torres is a talent but this novel felt like it existed in two parts there was the three brothers the family as one and then when one brother fragmented off this change seemed abrupt to me and seemed to cut the novel torres does write beautifully but i don't think what he was saying was on the same level with the way he was saying it","1507":"this is a very small but powerful little book which narrates a story of the lives of three sons through the eyes of one son only there is no direct dialogue and reminded me in writing style of 'the mary smoke boys' by patrick holland or favel parretts 'past the shallows' where there is no direct dialogue and yet the conversations stay with you for quite some time the story avidly paints a harsh tale of two young people who fell in love and then life remained hard they have three boys in quick succession and the handsome husband doesn't really grow up finds it hard to hold down a job and so the weary mother works nights at the local factory and life with all its dreams slowly unravels then the book takes quite a sinister turn i was really engrossed but the abrupt end took me a little by surprise and left me wanting something else from this story","1508":"this swift spare bildungsroman is a portrait of the gay artist as a young latino three brothers joel manny and the unnamed narrator are raised in upstate new york by two brooklyn expats a white mami and a puerto rican paps pregnant at fourteen they went to texas to get married the mother works in a brewery the father as a night watchman briefly for most of the novel the brothers seem to be one character at times they are described that way their silhouettes in a window make up a three torso'd creature the comfort and security of their brotherhood shelters them from the father's increasing violence and the mother's instability each chapter is like a prose poem cleanly lyrical and artfully reverberating with each chapter's title danger and comfort live close together in this book as the narrator embraces his gay identity the novel shuts down a bit too fast with a dark but ambiguous ending that perhaps honors the tradition of a single man or giovanni's room but by this time and place i think we deserve a new and more optimistic ending still a beautiful book","1509":"adored every word if it","1510":"super meh this is one of those 'darling' books that feels super precious looking at you jonathon safran foer where the too cute ambition of the book detracts from the story it's not bad just not as great as everyone is making it out to be torres is a great writer though i think","1511":"what a beautiful gripping deeply affecting and haunting novel impossible to put down and short enough to not need to no bookmark needed all readers welcome so long as they're prepared to be moved by and to move with the story","1512":"loved the lyrical rawness of this book but it broke my heart","1513":" for such a slim debut justin torres' work packs quite a punch with its visceral yet lyrical language the narrative is composed of individual scenes depicting the violently passionate hopelessly destructive bonds of family and the limits of those bonds torres' work is devastating yet affirming in its honesty the abruptness of the movement from boyhood to beyond seems jolting but necessary to emphasize the lack of childhood that existed in the boys' growing up the boys deemed animals despite its size this work deserves more than one read","1514":"we the animals is a coming of age tale of three brothers as they grow and mature together and find and lose themselves along the way the brothers learn the meaning of and value of family friendship and love as they witness things no young boys should witness can the brothers relationship stand the test of time and learn to accept as is or will it lead to disappointment just as so many before have","1515":"too much purple prose ugh just too much","1516":" the 3 stars i gave this book and i don't like starring systems for the coming reason have nothing to do with the quality of the writing or the subject matter we the animals is an excellent book for what it is a novella this is not a novel it thank god is also not your average coming of age first novel because torres reaches his fingers deep into the fleshy moments of intimacy and pity an outsider experiences in his or her own family such moments are a burden to carry around and an even greater burden to share i got stoked to read it after i flipped through a few pages and past the initial stunted start if i may take the liberty i'd liken it to slowly inching with hesitance and clenched jaws into a cold pool late spring instead of just manning up and diving in at last once the water is tickling your neck and your head has had enough teasing but the top of your scalp and your hair warm from the sun in their kingdom of heat are still terrified to get wet and cold and alone you go under into torres's biting honest evocative prose and swim in a chilly and correct vat of boyhood and kidhood and mixed up parents all the way through until you gasp out like torres into adulthood covered with goosebumps and tired the metaphor boys as animals is carried deftly if not a little too heavily paps is an animal too a huge intimidating vulnerable beast and so their mother is an animal but something more like a doe or a mare with a bad leg it's a quick read spare and right to the point there are gaps and questions there are no surprises but there are windows into a more vivid desultory future with torres in some someday book of his that will be more will not be autobiographical and will heap in further and more articulate well understood pain and confusion well recommended the release is in august 2011","1517":"i enjoyed the words the writing more than the story itself the ending ruined the book","1518":"series of short anecdotes the ending is interesting i enjoyed the book until the last 25% i'm still chewing it over 3 5 stars","1519":"the story of 3 brothers growing up in s dysfunctional family content rated r well written but content is definitely adult rated","1520":"i found this novel strangely disengaging on one level and very fascinating on another i think it's because the prose is written in a very polished experimental style and yet the characters don't seem to develop in any significant way so the revelation at the end given by the obviously sensitive and intelligent narrator seemed a bit clinical and without much surprise maybe this is an intentional way of avoiding melodrama which is what fascinates me about it","1521":"my sister gave me this and i knew nothing going in it's quite short and most of it is quite engaging a sad story of the youngest of three brothers and a families poverty then suddenly in the last fifth the guy comes out with random stranger sex at a bus stop then his family has read his journal and rejected him they have him committed supposedly in the modern era it makes no sense why would such a novella receive such praise i would suspect the velvet mafia but it hardly seems a gay positive tale that community would want to endorse it's decent writing most of the way but an incomplete mystery i'd check out more from this author","1522":"it ends like a punch in the gut every short chapter is a potent shot i can't wait to read what he does next","1523":"there are chapters in this book that are wonderfully written however the plot itself is hard to digest because of it's dark nature did the author do this to let some demons go did he do it for shock value did he have this fantasies it's hard to judge this novel if we don't know why did he write it many people will either love it or hate it in my case i'd say i liked its form but not its content in the end the author is right we are animals however he forgets that some will choose to follow their instincts and some will control them in this case the characters seem to have no control whatsoever over their instincts so they are indeed animals the novel presents people in a dark place and it does it with honesty no sugarcoating so i admire it unfortunately i wouldn't want to find myself going through the experience ever again","1524":" ugh this emotional battlefield really left me with a bad taste in my mouth maybe because it is probably all too true three young boys endure a life with incompetent parents poverty neglect violence and all around bad behaviors which they also exhibit as they grow older yet at the same time they find ways to be normal children and exist within a family with some semblance of love and connection the short chapters could each stand alone as a short story the writing was okay but i felt like i could be reading someones theraputic journals the brilliance may be in the author being able to pack such an emotional punch in such a short book ugh","1525":"a pretty cool experimental novel about a dysfunctional family with some absolutely gorgeous language however i'm not sure i'm sold on the turn at the end of the book there's no way to explain without giving it away but i almost wish the author had resisted that impulse makes it feel more autobiographical than real fictional and not in a good way","1526":"short and powerful book","1527":"read this today at the beach the writing is incredible the story is incredible the ending made me cry on the ferry it's a certain style of course i've just looked through some of the reviews that call it mfa trash didn't feel that way to me at all it felt distilled like a great long poem","1528":"beautiful sad makes you feel childhood all over again","1529":"decent book i found his writing style a little boring he overused simple sentences and his continuous description of the mother's fragility seemed too contrived it was interesting but i'd recommend people read some of the more interesting sections and skip the book as a whole","1530":"breath taking brutal heart wrenching disturbing beautiful not your typical coming of age story not your typical prose highly recommend","1531":"i really don't know what to write here i didn't dislike or really like the novel while i know the writing style is different so therefore is artsy i did not like it it made the novel seem staccato and jerky it's an interesting take on the coming of age story but the last page made nearly no sense to me this is a book i was neither hastily trying to finish up or wanted to take my time with so i'll part with saying that this novel was interesting","1532":"i loved the poetry of this book and it made me smile it was so beautifully written and then it turned ugly and it really broke my heart surely worth reading if disturbing","1533":"i finished this book a few days ago and i'm still not sure how i feel about it the writing is very good and some of the scenes have stayed with me but i think i may have to read it again we the animals is a short book i think it's shocking in it's sadness and violence","1534":"some intense painful and lyrical moments but the trappings of cliche are hard to get away from here the ending is jarring and horrifying but a bit rushed given the almost non existent pace of the first 90 percent clearly a talented writer though y","1535":"a slim well written book","1536":"this book took my breath away it not only hits the nail on the head about poverty and poverty's despair it is written so beautifully that it almost hurt to read my only complaint is that it was so short i love forward to more by justin torres","1537":"great read very moving the writing was so rich that i often felt like i was watching it unfold","1538":"i really enjoyed this and found the writing to be beautiful funny and moving i was just disappointed by its length i thought that toward the end there could have been a few more stories when the brothers were a little older that would have tied it all together with that i would have given it five stars it's really a nice little book","1539":"really beautiful writing that's consistently fierce for awhile in the middle i wasn't sure about the novella as a whole but then the end smacked me in the face the last two chapters completely blew me away a quick but very worthwhile read","1540":"a tiny granade of a book a true shredder","1541":"first there was holden caulfield and then there were three mixed race brothers coming of age poor but wise beyond their years torres has done a masterful job with spare chapters that capture the rough and raw lives of this family who live on the edge of work and love","1542":" december's book club pick we wanted something short but not too intense it's intense though i picked it up at the library and began reading it at stop lights on the way to christmas shop could barely stop when the lights turned dangerous for driving but great for at home this book is crazy good the verdict's still out on the ending but i'll have plenty to discuss this thursday at book club i'm going to bake cookies so we don't feel so sad this book is seriously a must read for 2011 justin torres is amazing","1543":"loved this is told in the voice of a young mixed race boy in new york and it's a narrator we don't hear often but one i found very easy to read","1544":"disturbing uncomfortable unpleasant not one of the characters was remotely likable but i guess that was the point i guess i only stuck with it because it was such a quick read","1545":"three brothers bound growing up in dysfunctional household was surprised at ending","1546":"thought #1 twee and overwrought thought #2 what in the actual hell was that ending even thought #3 at least it was short","1547":"alternately touching and jarring but mostly bleak need a funny book next","1548":"rip your skin off good the scene in the bathroom slayed me it's been a looooong time since i read anything this good read
